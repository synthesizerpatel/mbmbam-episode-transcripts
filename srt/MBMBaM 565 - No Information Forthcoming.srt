1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

18
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,580
I need your help with something. I want to talk about this Loki thing

19
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,220
Oh, yeah, so I wish for this fucking guy can't stop pranking the Avengers

20
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,380
No, so this is the thing. So I'm I'm watching doesn't fail. Let me get a quick

21
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,500
Let me get out my comedy dousing rod because right now it's pointing away. Yeah, I've got my

22
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,900
Rotating with you. Let's see it. I'm so I'm watching my nature programs that you know

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,420
I love yeah TV that my grandnephew set up for me, right?

24
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,820
And then I finished those now pop-up comes up for this Loki and I see that Owen Wilson is in it

25
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,100
You know, I'm a big drill bit Taylor fan. Yeah, it's your favorite. Yeah, I click on it and I'm watching it

26
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,740
Yeah, I want to talk about this Loki fellow

27
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,780
Because everybody seems to like him. Yeah, but he seems like a superhero version of a YouTube prankster

28
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,220
Yeah, and I don't know that I'm comfortable with the world watch it. It's on and can I say it's on the Disney thing?

29
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,980
Right next to Mickey. This is my problem with right with Mickey. He's doing this right near it

30
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,300
We're Mickey can write for the love of Christ. It's like he's Mickey's next-door neighbor now

31
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,940
Yeah, Mickey live next to Loki. I know will you agree on one thing?

32
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,900
There's nothing low-key about it. No

33
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,300
This guy is amped up. So I don't understand that part for sure

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,660
Now listen Owen Wilson's there and he is definitely bringing it down. All right, he's a little hand

35
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,940
Hold I am I am holding on tight to Owen Wilson as I try to ride out this confusing

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,020
I hate this fucking guy with the horns cuz he's always

37
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,060
Breaking the Avengers and now he's being mean to Owen Wilson aka drill bit Taylor, right?

38
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,620
Right and Owen Wilson doesn't need that. He's Owen Wilson. He's been in many movies a lot of movies

39
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,020
What's this low-key guy ever done? Yeah, except hurt the Avengers feelings. We mean to him. He made the whole cry

40
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:54,740
Henry's obsessed with superheroes and he has been for a long time and they make these like books for like the world of reading books

41
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:01,440
They're like, here's here's very simple sentences and words and there's ones where they're at a daycare and low-key

42
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,820
Like steals the Hulk's the paints the Hulk purple instead of green and steals the apple slices from snack time

43
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,340
And then at the end he like get they confront him and he comes clean and I want to be like this man has killed

44
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,820
People this man is killed in the fit in the fit. I'm not a big, you know

45
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,020
I'm not deep in the Avengers set but I do know that this man is

46
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,780
Responsible for the deaths of countless innocent New Yorkers. We love to forget that don't we?

47
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,380
Yeah, we strut we stride into a hot topic by the first cool t-shirt

48
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,660
We see low-key on it and we just forget this man has murdered people. Yeah, there's blood on these on his

49
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,560
His a yeah now don't get me wrong. I like the t-shirt where he's kind of giving us more gonna just as mischief question mark

50
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,780
It's not the most creative, but I love that font

51
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,000
What this man's a murderer hey Justin Justin

52
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:06,460
Loki charms. Well, no fucking yeah trap fucking dirt bag. No fucking shit. Why do you think they did it?

53
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,380
Otherwise bud, I don't know because he's whimsical. No, cuz it sounds like Loki. Oh, you know what?

54
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,380
You're the Loki of this show. Now. I've just decided. Yeah. Oh, no, you're the Loki of it and you're a villain of it

55
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,780
I know I've been that for a while. Come on, man

56
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,980
Get with it. But here's my question. Yeah, am I supposed to like him this murder?

57
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,700
Relentless murderer. I

58
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,540
the first scene of

59
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,860
the Loki show

60
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,020
Should be Loki and he's it might be

61
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,340
And he should be like hi America, it's me look

62
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,380
I just wanted to say that thanks for taking the chance on my television show and I just want to promise you that well

63
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,660
I'm not gonna do no murders in this one. So if you give me a chance, let me be the hero you deserve

64
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,820
I promise I could do a better job for you America. Enjoy my show. I'm sorry. I'm right next to Mickey

65
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,020
Do you think that there's somebody in the Marvel like big boardroom somewhere who's like?

66
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,180
Can we do a George Lucas on the Avengers movie and just add a quick scene or Captain America?

67
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,660
They've they've stopped Loki, but they look around and go pretty incredible that no one got hurt during this, huh? Yes

68
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,460
We just seem to avoid

69
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,940
Anyone getting hurt during this entire battle, huh?

70
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,220
Bunch of buildings fell down air-conditioned came took tumble

71
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,820
But each time it just barely missed the people you're lucky this time Loki

72
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,020
They should call you Loki charms and then everybody was at the big game

73
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,660
Everyone nobody was even in these buildings. How fortuitous

74
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:48,260
He's a murderer and this shows murdering him with all the jokes so far and I want to get into some questions

75
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:58,100
Maybe just to say we actually start the show in earnest at this point. I'm I will say this. Oh, oh, oh What's up guys

76
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,860
No, she's us. Hey guys big news for you. Yeah

That's what they say. Well what it is in Cincinnati is sauce for the gander. Yeah, here's what we're gonna do first boys

89
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,940
The ones that are sure

90
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:08,180

91
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,560

All right, let me look at you cuz it's summertime now and I want to help you get your fragrance game, right?

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,840
I guess I'm just confused Richard because like two weeks ago you had me buy some really expensive

97
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Fragrance. Yeah

98
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,800
And now from from your kiosk by the way, and now two weeks later you're telling me to throw it away

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,120
Throw it in the trash, but it's time for summer

100
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,480
Fragrances like dull chain. Come on. I like blue all intense poor arm. You want citrus?

I'm feeling a bit. I'm feeling less good about sorry by bit

109
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,160

147
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,120

148
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Perfect

149
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,720
No, I mean I taught him that turn your brother down

150
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Next I'm gonna give you out

151
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,280
Here's what I'm gonna put you on to and I'll even save you a bit cuz it's gonna run you like $218

152
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
250

153
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:32,640
Maybe 600 or so is silver mountain water by Creed, right? Okay a multi-sex

154
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,260
fragrance anybody can wear cool great green

155
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,400
Citrus is here. Wait, did you just say green or

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:50,240
Green like a green smell. What the fuck does that mean like a green smell like vetiver like green vetiver green?

157
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,760
Like a green smell. No, it's got like a green cell and then there's a knock at the door

158
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
You open it and it's citrus. No, go back to the green

159
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Smell 20 times and we didn't get it

160
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,000
And then you open it up you open the door or citrus and citrus comes in is like I brought a cake and inside the

161
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,360
Cake is musk. Yeah, this is the smell you're getting with silver mountain water by creed and there's like a little bit of like

162
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
It's like a fresh

163
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,600
floral

164
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,780
Sort of vetiver sort of what is that word? You keep saying a word there that I it's I'm having trouble parsing it

165
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:39,040
Vetiver it's a VE. Don't worry about it. And I don't worry about it. It's the oil from vetiver. Oh, yeah

166
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Yeah, yeah. Oh

167
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Oh guys bad news. What's wrong? What's up? My boss at PJ Maxx just caught me podcasting on the job. I got damn it day

168
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,640
Oh, listen, I'll be over there soon to pick you up. I'll talk to him. I'll get your job back

169
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,080
No, not even a problem. Can you bring some orange slices for sure?

170
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,680
And I'll be back in fall to talk about fall fragrances and not until then right?

171
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,320
He's had a guarantee. Are you is this a promise?

172
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
It's an absolute promise, bro. I

173
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,560
Don't know that I will not be here to talk about fragrances until fall. Well, wait, you just winked at me

174
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,240
So where you go now that was your nose. I won't be here to talk about fragrances until fall

175
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,360
Okay, but so you'll be here to talk about other things. I

176
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,540
Gotta go how did he do that? He made that noise of his mouth. Yeah

177
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,520
Hey Justin, do you want to tell us how Richard got in your house again?

178
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,440
At this time I did let him in but he said he had a package

179
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,240
Okay, it sounded like he fought you at the beginning a little bit

180
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,960
Yeah, I thought he had I thought he had left. How long's he been there? I

181
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,680
Don't know he's looking kind of mace aided

182
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,800
I'm worried he doesn't have a stable source of nutrients in my home. I'm worried. He's living in my house

183
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,120
Oh in like, you know, yeah hollowed out a chair and when you sit in the chair, you're actually sitting in his lap

184
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,300
Yeah, one of those classic. How about question? I would I would absolutely love that

185
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,480
My grandparents just gave me $500 worth of jewelry for graduation and I don't really mean to sound ungrateful

186
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,080
But this is the ugliest jewelry I've ever seen. I wish I do

187
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,320
This is you've defined ungrateful, but let's move press on I don't want to pawn it and they ask you about it later

188
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
But I really don't think I'll ever wear it ever

189
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,920
That's from $500 ugly jewelry owner

190
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,520
Um

191
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,320
This is a actually easy one. Oh

192
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,640
Yeah, finally an easy one. You gotta just pretend like it's

193
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,320
$6 jewelry and what would you do if you had gotten $6 jewelry?

194
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,760
You would just put it in the place where jewelry goes which for me is the underwear drawer

195
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,160
just kind of loose rattling around in there with what with my cigar colognes and what have you and

196
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,240
Then you can just keep on keeping on

197
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,820
Yeah, we maybe wonder Griffin if this is a phenomenon that

198
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,040
Many people experience where if you are not a fancy person

199
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,880
But you get the kind of thing that a fancy person would have you bestow upon it a sacred

200
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,660
Safe place of inside the underwear drawer towards the bottom where it's not gonna interrupt your life

201
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,660
But it is safely protected but beneath your unmentionable. No criminal will ever look there if you think about perhaps

202
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,940
Cuff links. Yeah. Well, that's something a fancy person. It's not a monetary thing

203
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,900
It's just like this is something where if I'm a different person, this would be something I would need ready access

204
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,740
Yeah, there'll be something I like madly dig for before a few

205
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,300
Well, that's the thing if you only have one set of cuff links

206
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,340
You're not going to invest in some sort of cuff link caddy, right?

207
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,780
Right, you're not gonna have a special storage place. I'm sure there is a tipping point where you have enough set of cuff links

208
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,980
That you're like, I need something to store these bad boys. I don't know what that

209
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,620
Tipping point is but it's not one set. It might be two sets. Yeah, I got a nice watch

210
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,380
Somebody got me as a gift once and I'm not a big watch wear because I need

211
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,100
Absolute maximum flexibility and mobility to do all my gaming

212
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,420
Uh, but it is a nice watch so it lives in my underwear drawer

213
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:26,020
Like the fucking food in the peewee's playhouse freezer just having a little home and its own little life in there

214
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,300
It's got its own kids of the kids are it's are the ties that I haven't worn in

215
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,940
Since I had a child

216
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,840
Yeah, don't be ashamed don't be and if it if the grandparents ask about you just say yeah, okay

217
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,620
Yeah, I'm not wearing it today. I love it. It's so good, but I'm not wearing it today

218
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,620
What do you think it looks like? What do you think?

219
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Chonky

220
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:53,420
Chonky, I mean some people like a chunky like a chunky necklace some people like chunky accessories. It's a that's a that's a thing

221
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,140
Yeah, Griffin's right. You should wear it. No one cuz maybe you think it's ugly, but everyone else thinks it's beautiful

222
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,860
What do you know? Well, maybe that's it

223
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,380
Maybe it's the way that you look at it in the mirror is backwards

224
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,100
And so it looks bad to you, but when you look at the right way, it looks actually super good

225
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,020
Why would you give me a bracelet with my name spelled backwards on it grandpa?

226
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,540
I hate you grandpa. You tried to trick me again

227
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,860
Try to get me to say my name backwards and get banished to another dimension against nice try

228
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,900
You and Superman always trying to get me. Can I shower you guys with some wisdom of the cloud?

229
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,740
Oh, I love that

230
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,300
This one is a it is another wiki house just because I it's what's got me excited right now

231
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,460
I've looked at others, but this is what's doing it for me Christopher sent this in. Thanks Chris

232
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,180
It's uh, this one's authored by the wiki house staff. So

233
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,020
And it's updated May 6th. So this is we got like hot up-to-the-minute deets on how to get shampoo out of your eyes

234
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,220
And you may think you've got this one solved and I think this actually is cyclical because we did talk about this

235
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,460
I feel like early my bim-bam we talked about like sort of maybe episode one

236
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,420
Maybe even episode one getting shampoo out of your eyes with water part one

237
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,100
can I can I just say by the way this also falls into the category that I think the coyote one fits to you of

238
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,860
Like just go ahead and look this out ahead of time. Yes, you find yourself in the scenario. It's too late

239
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,220
It's too late and in the spirit of that the very first step that they have listed here is so good

240
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
And it's simply calm down

241
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,580
If the shampoos in your eyes

242
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,420
You may experience a burning or stinging sensation pain can often lead us to panic staying calm

243
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,780
I'm sure you do not do anything which might make the situation worse like put more shampoo in your eyes

244
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Well, you want to wash out that shampoo?

245
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Shit way

246
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,060
Well, sometimes I panic and maybe fall through like a sliding glass door

247
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:53,140
Or I just start smashing bottles on the ground in a panic, you know, I pull the fixtures off the walls

248
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,500
Yeah, it tells you to breathe in your nose to a count of five and exhale through your mouth for a count of five

249
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,640
Do this at least three times

250
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,620
You may also envision yourself in a peaceful scene where nothing hurts you and you are not in danger

251
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,780
for instance

252
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,580
You're bashing yourself on a peaceful mountain top try to imagine the breeze on your face and the gentle warmth of the Sun on

253
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,560
Your skin if you get shampoo in your eyes

254
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,540
breathe for 15 seconds and then

255
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,060
You're on the mountaintop in your mind

256
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,380
And at that point your eyes have dissolved out of your head because you've taken way too long to address the situation

257
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:29,460
I want them to continue this kind of vibe and like in sentences with we're gonna get through this

258
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,200
Yeah, I'm here for you. Take a deep breath rub your eyes. No, just kidding. It says don't rub your eyes

259
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,300
There's chemicals in shampoo that hurts your eyes

260
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,340
Step three close your step three close your eyes

261
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:53,660
And if you need more information here, it literally says bring your top and bottom eyelids together to close them

262
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,780
Where I think okay. Wait, are you fucking with me?

263
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,760
Is this whole thing been are you fucking with me the steps so far just to recap?

264
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,660
Calm the calm the fuck down

265
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,300
Don't touch your eyes close your eyes and then for two to three minutes

266
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,220
Look up into the faucet and let the water hit your eyeballs for two to three minutes

267
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,880
For two to three minutes let cool water blast your open eyeballs and feel it

268
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:24,820
This escalates so quickly from like I'm on a mountaintop to I'm gonna let water blast my open eyes

269
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
It's step five simply

270
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
Try to cry

271
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,160
Not hard. Yeah, I don't take a lot for me

272
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,180
Well, I just think about the ending of iron giant and I'm gone. Yeah

273
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,340
Well, if that doesn't work for you wiki how does say crying on command takes long practice

274
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
It sure does

275
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:52,340
Thinking of tragic thoughts like being a child alone and scared in the woods is a good way to inspire tears

276
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:58,020
Hey, let's fuck you. No, I just told me to picture myself on a mountaintop. Yeah, I calm myself way down

277
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,880
Yeah, now you want me to be a scared kid in the wood. Which one is it?

278
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,140
Well, no Travis

279
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,940
You got to get calm in order to open your eyes and look into a running faucet for two to three minutes

280
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,620
And then after that you have to try to cry you need to try to cry and then you need to see a doctor if it

281
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,180
Continues to hurt. Okay, the next step sucks so bad

282
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,500
Hit me avoiding shampoo in your eyes

283
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,780
Okay. Well, come on lean your head back 45 degrees when shampooing

284
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,240
That's awesome. I love that. They put a number to it

285
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,740
Next time I need like a protractor in the shower

286
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,500
Make sure I get the next time I'm in the shower. I'm gonna make sure that I'm not doing it at 30

287
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,260
I get I still get some shampoo in my eyes. It might be a 30 degree angle situation

288
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,220
Do you guys do you guys if you're showering your head off, right?

289
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,300
Do you face the spigot and just like go for it or do you?

290
00:23:52,740 --> 00:24:00,260
Turn around away from the spigot and like lean your head back like you're at a fancy salon. Mmm. I don't know

291
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,860
I genuinely don't I think I right now you're thinking have I ever watched I've ever washed my hair before I

292
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,100
Know I do. I mean I have to use some pretty bodacious stuff on my rig not to get too

293
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,860
Not to get too clinical on the podcast, but that's why you got some

294
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,340
Oh, I got some anti-dandruff. It is a fucking cakewalk compared to what I have to rub up there

295
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:31,940
Let's just say let's just say Papa guts to rub some dry shampoo in there for his delicate condition sometimes

296
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,620
So you gotta start with dry shampoo and then do a somewhat moist shampoo and then a full-blown wet shampoo

297
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,540
And then a wet shampoo. I have to walk my way up not like the rest you guys

298
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,380
You're just like head and shoulders go I have for me. It's a it's half a day

299
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,900
There's some other steps in here including read the directions and again don't touch your eyes

300
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,140
But the most awesome one is step six

301
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,860
wear protective eyewear

302
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,740
Goggles in the shower shampoo in your eyes causes a particularly acute irritation

303
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,820
You can purchase it's intended for aquatic environments from your local sporting goods store

304
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,100
Where then when shampooing but remove them after you finish rinsing the shampoo out so to ensure your face gets washed properly

305
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:21,860
It's great because you can go to your local Dix and you can walk into the counter with this thought just please fucking nobody asks

306
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,420
So you please no one else. Please don't ask what they're for. Please. Please please doing some swimming

307
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
But then how do I wash my eyelashes

308
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,420
Cuz those things get pretty dirty like a lot of sweat catches up in there. Yeah, they get crusty

309
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,340
How will you wash your face? I guess separately

310
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:46,260
Um, well when I do wiki how on here, you're only getting half the story because the pictures are what's so dope

311
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,480
because there is there is this great image of a man wearing these these goggles and

312
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
scrubbing scrubbing

313
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Travis I got another one for you because

314
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:06,700
There's step seven try a tears-free shampoo. And then there's step eight, which is use an eye shield

315
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,540
Which is something that I use for my toddler to wash. Oh, yeah

316
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,660
And this is a cool look. This is like a bonnet for an adult

317
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,060
This also it looks it looks like an old man wearing a sun hat except a bird stole the top of it

318
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,780
Yeah, so it's just the brim part this hats solution

319
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,460
Assumes I'm not washing the back of my hair. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it's why yeah, don't worry about it

320
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,300
So time for the questions segment

321
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,060
After I do the procedure, can I go to sleep?

322
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,540
I'm not sure what the procedure the only thing resembling a procedure here is

323
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,360
Keeping your eyes open for two to three minutes as you look into a running faucet

324
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,140
But they'd say go ahead and go to sleep if you've washed it

325
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,020
Not a concussion. They still might burn a bit and you might cry, but it should be fine

326
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,740
If anything, that'll that'll help you sack out

327
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,340
You know what? I mean?

328
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,780
Yeah, that's fair. Like I mean, I'm I'm crazy about all these that are like just don't get it in your eyes in the first

329
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
Yeah, but I guess I mean

330
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,660
If I'm googling it

331
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,700
Wiki howling it. I'm probably not in the shower anymore. Right? Like the immediate danger has passed

332
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,980
Well, this is why you have to prep it beforehand and I was thinking about this because like that two to three minutes

333
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,940
It's really hard to like figure out the time like your eyes are full of tears and water at this point

334
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,220
You can't look at the clock. So here's I looked it up

335
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:36,020
Just sing all of the mama's on the pub is California dreamin and that's to get two minutes and 45 seconds

336
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,740
Perfect the perfect amount, right? So at that point you're probably good to stop blinking

337
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,700
There's a is you got to read up on this shit though because this person said I did rub my eyes

338
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,500
But I'm out of the shower and it still burns after I put water in it

339
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,260
What should I do and the the community answer here like tries to offer some advice

340
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,860
But at this point like you're you are fucking you fuck dog. You touched your eyes. That's like you touch number one

341
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:04,380
The first rule it says what not to do that and you're like I did it now what?

342
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,940
Yeah fucked up

343
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,060
It's like if there was a wiki how article on how not to get stabbed and the first part was don't get stabbed

344
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,120
And you're like I did it. I did get a little so now what I do

345
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,100
Well, there is some extra stuff here cuz somebody said are there other tips if none of these methods work?

346
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:25,100
I think if you've hit the point where you kept your eyes open for two to three minutes while water blasted it and that did

347
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,940
Not work. It might not be a shampoo situation

348
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,420
It might be a poisoning or something like that

349
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,780
But there is a community answer that says cup cool water in your hands and put them up to your eyes

350
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,700
Then open your eyes for a few seconds in the clean water repeating as necessary

351
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,580
Awesome. That's a different delivery method then look at the faucet and let it spray into your eyes

352
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,820
well, that's making your eyes too big beautiful burp baths and open them in there and

353
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,300
That is swim around. Nobody can do that. I

354
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,940
Can do it

355
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,620
Here's another question

356
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,580
Soon, I will be riding a horse nice and I would like to make a horse riding playlist

357
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:12,140
I will be riding the horse through a field and some forests in the temperate rainforests of Vancouver Island

358
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,940
I believe it will be a great horse

359
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,260
Thank you

360
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:21,460
Help me choose songs to set the tone and atmosphere for this unforgettable experience from melodious mayor in sandwich, BC Canada

361
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,260
So first off, thank you. Yes

362
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:31,060
For your fucking context. Yeah, so we I wish everybody would follow this this model

363
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,260
Give us all the details you have that completely changes if you're gonna be in a temperate rainforest

364
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,280
Do you know how many times we've done this and then the person has written back and back but the horse is gray and it's like

365
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,820
Well fuck you didn't say that and then completely changes the answers, of course

366
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,180
Well, there's one piece of deets that we did not get what's that? Are we walking? Are we trotting?

367
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:59,020
Are we cantering? Are we galloping? Like I need to you know what I mean? How am I supposed to match the BPM?

368
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,780
My my assumption is field is probably canter

369
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,740
forest temperate

370
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,020
rainforest forest

371
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,860
Maybe trot but probably walk. Okay, it's hard you look I'm looking at pictures of this terrain

372
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Yeah, and some of it is like

373
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,880
Honestly pretty terrifying. Oh, really? I'm looking at this terrain and it's like just like if I was I mean, it's beautiful

374
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,220
but like I'm looking at these pictures of Vancouver Island rainforest and it's like

375
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,220
If I had some of that hard charging and I try to take my horse at that

376
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,420
You know what I mean? It's like if I'm ripping like aces spades, you know

377
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,860
Sure, um two minutes to midnight something like really fucking rip. Yeah, and I have my horse

378
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:52,420
The big Polly as he's asked to be called and if I have him like ripping through the forest that speed

379
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,060
Yeah, I thought I'm gonna take a header for sure into a creek or yeah

380
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:04,320
It's terrifying only in the context of racing through it in on a horse in any other context the

381
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
rainforest of Vancouver Island is

382
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:14,620
Breathtakingly beautiful. I that y'all this is stunning and I'm feeling honestly a little panicky that I haven't done this and like I got

383
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:20,380
As far as Vancouver and those these beautiful rainforests were just right around the corner from

384
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,620
ostensibly

385
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,060
And I didn't I didn't get over there. Okay, so let me let me put put it. Hey, I got it

386
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,060
I want to tell you guys something. Yeah

387
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,260
That I just found in the

388
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:43,620
I was looking for images of the big beautiful trees on Vancouver Island in the rainforest there and I stumbled on a

389
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,000
digital book

390
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,780
That is just called where to find big trees on Vancouver. Yeah, nice

391
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,300
So if you want to not waste your time, yeah

392
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,100
There's nothing worse than when to go see a big tree and you look all over like all these trees are fine

393
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:03,540
but yeah, you're fine, but they're not like Here's what I would say you guys immediately went to this like

394
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,260
hard-pounding like high-pace

395
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,940
Octane kind of that's not fair. That's not fair

396
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,500
I asked what the speed of the horse was before I recommend fair fair fair fair fair

397
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,980
I let me put it this way then I would have for me if I'm setting the mood on a gray horse

398
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:26,860
I in the temperate Vancouver Island rainforest. Yeah, I'm looking for more of a like

399
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:33,860
I'm I'm free. This is free. I'm out here. Maybe I'm the last human being and like this is

400
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,780
I think that's more the vibe. I'm going for

401
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,300
And for that it's probably Bon Jovi

402
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,980
Exclusively just obvious one

403
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,500
I worry. It's not the one where he talks about horses. No, that's what that one's about a motorcycle

404
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,100
The steel horse is a motorcycle. You're talking about some of his lovely ballads. Yeah, I'm saying like a

405
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,940
Bed of roses. Yeah, right. That's beautiful. Just my horse out there

406
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,500
We're doing down and maybe some I might also go for some melon camp in there

407
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,920
Uh, I just some good old Americana to ride through the Canadian

408
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Canadian he

409
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:28,460
Like 100% feels like I don't think he is but like it does feel like he's missing opportunity by not being Canadian doesn't yeah

410
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,540
Yeah

411
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,600
Um, I mean honest answer if I'm in lovely nature like this

412
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,740
I want some pensive music on my throne some bony bear and just like cruise on them

413
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:45,440
But the real even more honest answer is if I'm on a horse and this particular beautiful

414
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,940
Albeit, let's say slippery and Viron. I am going to want

415
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,780
Complete situational awareness. I do not want to remove one of my senses

416
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,060
from the horseback riding in the slippery woods

417
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:09,100
Activity that I'm doing because I don't know if I'm gonna hear like the sound of my my beautiful ponies hooves going like

418
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
As they slip off the bridge that we're crossing

419
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,600
But I need to have that I need to have those clues

420
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,520
What would that be to the horse what I need to do to it to make it not fall off the bridge?

421
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, you know touch it Britain go touch the go button on say hey look out across the bridge or to say like

422
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Look out. Oh, look out crackers

423
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,140
That's in the name of a horse. You got to go. Oh, you got to stay on the straight narrow, and he would go

424
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,600
But if he did if I don't hear him slipping because I'm listening a bony bear

425
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,960
But you died together and the horse will die

426
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,900
There's also gonna be there's gonna be great sounds in this for like that's the playlist is

427
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Like the sounds of

428
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:02,080
Maybe yeah, maybe the perfect thing is if you find an audio track array for his sounds and listen to them at the bout

429
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,200
The right volume where just it's like the force

430
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:13,560
You know it's like just more you just like whatever it would have normally it just kind of like yeah twice as long

431
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
So you're really like?

432
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,480
Okay, wait a big business opportunity

433
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Sound of walking through the forest riding a horse through the forest all of that, but add to it

434
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:30,540
Celebrity cameos you're walking down, and you run into Tom Holland, and he joins you on the walk for a little while yes

435
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,580
Don't you don't look behind you governor, but I'm here

436
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,880
And I'll be I'm really here go protecting you

437
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,640
Always we could have it even be like an in fiction thing where it's not Tom Holland

438
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,120
But it is Tom Holland, and he's like a little he's a wood nymph. Yeah, and so you hear like

439
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,420
It's me Tom. Oh, that's why you can't hear him cuz he's so tiny exactly exactly

440
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:59,260
Exactly my my home didn't cha see I was gonna say and maybe that we can do both these things in one track

441
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,340
Is you go post up at a rainforest cafe for a couple hours, and you just record?

442
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,500
Just a little bit of back. We get some room tone. I'm your waiter for today aren't I?

443
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:18,440
You want me to I'm your I'm your way to Tom Hines you hear about the specials today the rain forest cafe

444
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,580
Oh, do we get the research from Jordan in this one Nathan Drake's a waiter

445
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
Change don't tell anybody

446
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,540
Now it's time to stop okay doing jokes to talk about the only thing that matters in this world is business, okay

447
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Let's go to the money zone

448
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,800
Being a local bon vivant man about town or it boy takes work and poise

449
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,480
But it doesn't actually have to take a ton of money if you have honey

450
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,460
The easy way to get yourself a little taste of luxury

451
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:12,820
Once you add honey to your computer just shop like normal on thousands of your favorite sites even

452
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,980
Luxury, I just want to start with you know up real quick

453
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:23,220
Don't add honey lowercase H to your computer that will break your computer break this is this is capital a tiny trap

454
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,500
Okay, now if you just click apply coupons a checkout when honey drops down

455
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,140
And if it finds a working coupon you'll see the price drop right before your very eyes and voila

456
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,780
You can indulge in a little opulence for a fraction of the cost I

457
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:47,780
Adore using honey. I've been using it to save myself a few extra bucks whether I'm shopping for different caviar gloves or

458
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,420
other different fancy stuff I

459
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:58,900
Always use honey, and it has saved me upwards of 17 perhaps even $18 in some cases on a wide

460
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,660
Variety of products perhaps more perhaps save me so much more than that and friends

461
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:11,760
Don't discuss money. I think I probably want you to say a more accurate total of how much money honey save you sometimes

462
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,060
I will tell honey no

463
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,020
I don't want to say that because I don't want the feeling of paying less than retail right

464
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:26,060
This is my problem with honey the one problem. I have with honey is I'd prefer to pay for retail, so I know I'm getting the full

465
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,380
experience right okay, if you're not like me though

Whoa, that's awfully close-up. They don't have anything a bit further away

529
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,720
I know this is the closest when they had Griffin. I'm sorry. I know you'd like to get a little cheese

530
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:31,040
But let's talk about this. Let's talk about the spirit of Christian spirit of a vampire sexual. Oh, no. Oh my god

531
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320

Thank you for looking

535
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
Christian is

536
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,960
Very unusual to me. Oh boy

537
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,040
There is a definitely us vampire

538
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,800
sexual energy coming for my boy

539
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,640
When you feel hot breath coming from the back of your coming from the back of mine

540
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,200
Coming from the back of your honey, could you look at this because I'm not a doctor but

541
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
This shouldn't be going that way

542
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,320
Billowing around back there and I'm like what the fuck

543
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,400
When you feel hot breath coming from the back of your neck, he is present boy

544
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,320
the

545
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
Apparition of him is magnificent

546
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:44,140
I heard the words god, it's a it's such like a

547
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,440
Sometimes you read one of these and a line like that. It's like that's a really powerful combo of words

548
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,500
Whatever it took to get here. I'm glad we did, you know, the apparition of him is magnificent

549
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,380
He will manifest himself in your dreams and try to cover himself over

550
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,540
God a lot of challenging images and ideas

551
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,680
Yeah, and it's not even really that they're not so much of blood and gore in there

552
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,740
It's kind of a psychological horror with a grammatical

553
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:15,980
Yeah

554
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:23,280
Try he will try to cover himself confer himself over you ask him anything you want with a pendulum

555
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,800
but don't be surprised if every response turns back to sex Wow

556
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,900
Pinchelum though. I can't be surprised by that

557
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,640
What how what options are you offering the pendulum that you're letting it do that?

558
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,360
You know every

559
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Again

560
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,780
Yeah, it's like a powerful lord with a little

561
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,280
Apparitions truly wonderful

562
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,980
Those eyebrows could use a little work. Don't be surprised if every response comes back to sex

563
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:12,660
he wants to tell you about all his desires and pleasures if

564
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,220
Communicating with him becomes dull in his opinion. He will stop responding

565
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,620
He only becomes graphic in your dreams

566
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,700
I start talking about like my interests and the things that I care about my family. He's like

567
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,900
You're a family. What do I care of this? I'll see you to what that dick do

568
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,940
Well, tell me about the dunger

569
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,500
J-brand or get to the hints and I just want to point out that so far

570
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:53,740
Then it just passively mentioned he's a vampire and then the rest of it is just about how wicked horny

571
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,580
They're kind of burying the lead

572
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:04,340
Is it possible? I'm glad he's horny. Don't get me wrong. Is it possible? The vampire thing is just assumed to from the horniness

573
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:10,580
This guy's got vampire levels of horny. If he's not a vampire, something's off

574
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:21,260
He's either a vampire or profoundly broken in a way that is unnerving

575
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,420
Okay, he only becomes a graphic in your dreams

576
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:32,620
He is not a demon and will not hurt you. He is only interested in sexual energy

577
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,980
So we might not hurt you physically. Yeah

578
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:44,080
He's a bit of a heartbreak. He's gonna challenge some of your preconceptions and ideals the only information I have from him

579
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,780
That is not connected to a sexual energy is

580
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,420
His place of origin is Vienna date

581
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,460
1804 and his name

582
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,380
Christian Alexander. All right

583
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,420
Okay, how much does this doll cost? How much money?

584
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:07,260
$69 I'm pissed. Yeah, it's $99. I'm gonna offer $69. If you buy it now. Oh

585
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:12,500
I'm gonna make a quick offer. I actually really want this one. It doesn't look pretty cool

586
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,380
You make him do some cool poses and make him fight your dumb pants though

587
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,820
Is there one of his pants to show if they're cool or not? I don't know if there's one of his pants or not

588
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,180
Let me just

589
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,300
Finish this sale. Okay

He will use all his charm to coax you into wanting him to be your desire

599
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:14,480
