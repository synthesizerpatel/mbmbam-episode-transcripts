1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,900
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me and advice show for the modern era

8
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,540

10
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,660
I'm Travis big dog who was who if McElroy almost forgot to say a dog thing. I do hear it

11
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,180
Yeah, he was talking about like Nate Silver and then he was like, oh shit, but I'd have to know Nate Silver's the name

12
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,560
Of my dog. All right, and I'm Griffin McElroy. Give me ten dollars

13
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,260

14
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:47,020
Look who's good enough to podcast when the time to collect the bill comes due

15
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,100
Yeah, yeah, the the little red hen. Yeah comes poking back around

16
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,180
Well, I don't think that's the moral of the little red hen Justin the little red hen who's too good

17
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,220
I always get that one confused. It is a grasshopper. Yeah, you know what I mean?

18
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,860
That saves all the seeds. No, no, no the grasshopper. No, the grasshopper does a bad job

19
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,500
Okay, who's the who's the kick-ass one? I think we can all agree on is that Griffin is the bad one?

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,540
I'm a shitty brother, and the other thing is that gas drops for my fucking fart balloon of a sign aren't cheap

21
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,700
So give me ten give me ten dollars listener. I'm coming at you with a different tone this year

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,040
I'm working on about two hours of sleep right now. Give me ten give me ten fucking dollars, please

23
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
Please give me ten dollars

24
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,380
Not Justin not Travis not max fun drive is not max fun drive related. Give me ten dollars

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,580
Griffin needs that ten dollars. I'll take five dollars from two of you. I need ten dollars

26
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,660
this is the max fun drive and it's time to

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,820
Stop stealing content. And that is that this is the FBI

28
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:00,100
Warning at the beginning of this episode if you're listening to this without donating to the max fun drive, then you're

29
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,140
It's a crime. It's a real crime wouldn't steal a dog

30
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Then why would you steal it?

31
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,380
podcast

32
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,980
Maximum fun org forward slash join is the site that you can go to to finally

33
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,620
Make it real make it right make it right make it tight

34
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,540
I was all I have a new thing. Okay, make it real make it right make it forever. Oh

35
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:31,420
Oh, that's good. This is a lifelong commitment that we're making to ourselves and you have locked us into creating this show forever

36
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,420
We're locking you in. Yeah

37
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,820
For five bucks a month. You will receive not only the joy of supporting the shows

38
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:47,680
You love this one, but also you'll get so much bonus content that you will actually perish

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,580
Yeah, the the Sun will burn out before you have exhausted all this content. Um, yeah, man

40
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,460
You know, we should treat max fun drives more like youth church lock-ins where it's like

41
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,780
We're not leaving here until we feel the spirit move tonight

42
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,580
There's ten people in here who I know who I know are ready to make that commitment

43
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,020
You're ready to pledge their lives to my brother my brother and me

44
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:20,620
That's definitely not a weird vibe that people have accused us of leveraging for financial gain and we're gonna do show

45
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,940
But the thing is this there's never been a better time

46
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,980
To support the shows that you love and if you can do it, obviously

47
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,540
There's a lot of joking around here if you can't do it

48
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,300
I get it

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,260
But if you can get five bucks a month at ten bucks a month you get all that

50
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,700
All the bonus content plus a magnet

51
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Come on

52
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,880
Join we need you. This is how we pay our bills and you heard about Griffin's son. He's got gas has the worst

53
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:54,260
Gas this child breathes and when we breathe air goes time to go to lungs so we can oxygenate the blood and keep the body

54
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,840
Pumping and when this little guy breathes, it's like to tummy town

55
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,700
We go to make more farts and burps to hurt the Sun to hurt the baby and keep him from the sleep

56
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,460
But I'm not talking about that today today. I'm talking about max fun driving what your support means to me

57
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,380
It's a man. If you donate five hundred dollars a month, you can name Griffin son. That's true

58
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,500
You do get the naming rights to that. I'm huge and you know, you know what I'm talking about right now

59
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,900
Read on me piss boys. Oh, man. We were just starting to get into a good mood. Come on

60
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,100
Okay, now here's what I like about though

61
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,940
There's many things that I like about this riddle can't talk about riddle.com for a second

62
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,100
Yeah quick cuz that we did a they shutting the heart down to our max fun drive

63
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,260
Bonus episode is us all mixing up the bits. We're all doing each other's bits

64
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,980
That's what you're all Bix factory mix up. It's fun and I did riddles calm

65
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,700
Here's a P and a lot of people been like riddles calm is so dope. Here's what you don't know about riddles calm

66
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,040
There is not a button on there. That's like sort by bad. Yeah, right. There's not a button on there

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,980
It's like trash rules only. Thank you. I have a comedy podcast. You have to read through a lot of fucking brain teasers

68
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,660
Yeah, get to the actual whatever the to get to the chaff to get the wheat out of there and find the chaff

69
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,820
You really have to go digging so I have

70
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,140
This was not user submitted. This was me. I did this

71
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:21,860
I put the work in so that I could do the deliverables for my brothers and it begins. That's me

72
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,820
Once upon a time as all good riddles begin once upon a time

73
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,060
John was walking in the woods to go fishing for some food but got lost but he got across an

74
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,140
Old house and asked the owner the owner invited John and they began to tell a story

75
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,140
The old man said once upon a time

76
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,700
Two best friends now you might be wondering at this point the riddle

77
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
No, those two once upon a times are completely unrelated

78
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,580
Once upon a time two best friends were on a deserted island. There was no food. So they began to die of hunger

79
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,900
They agreed to fight until one of them died. The winner would eat the loser and thus be saved besides

80
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,100
No one would ever know about that. They began to fight and finally one of the best friends won

81
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,540
Meaning that the other one was eaten and betrayed then John pulled out a gun and killed the old man at once

82
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,540
Why would he do it?

83
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,380
to eat him

84
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,180
for power

85
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,380
To eat him for power. If it's any other answer, then I feel like my time's been wasted

86
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Justin

87
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,780
I said you get a magnet at ten dollars a month and it's it's not that it's an enamel pin and I'm really sorry about

88
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:37,540
That that's my riddle and I just solved it. Okay. Oh pretty good start for our literal first pledge break. I

89
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,040
Just want to mention that I but he boned it pretty bad

90
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,460
Like an immediate mess up now

91
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,860
Here's what I want to talk about in this riddle because the answer is the old man was the cannibal and I feel like in this

92
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:59,340
riddle John our hero makes a big old leap because the old man began by saying once upon a time and

93
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,020
Told what seems to be a made-up story about two friends on an island

94
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,540
Why is the other and then John leaves to the conclusion that even though the story began?

95
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,540
Once upon a time clearly this old man was talking about himself and needed to be shot

96
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:21,700
Yeah, wait. Yeah, that's a good point trap. Yeah, I think you really undermined this

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,100
Well, I'm starting to think these riddles aren't very good. That's my worry

98
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,940
I'm worried about it because it's like I'm it's hard not to look at all the other bits now that yahoo answers is

99
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,380
Falling into the grave right now. Yes. I travel be honest with you

100
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,620
Sometimes I worry that the riddles on riddles calm aren't great

101
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:49,020
Well, I hate to disagree with you Griffin because there is a voting mechanic on riddles.com. Oh, okay, and this one has

102
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
45 thumbs up and

103
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,300
47 thumbs down. So it seems almost pretty evenly split. It's pretty it's almost nothing

104
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,180
It's almost a nothing riddle. Well, there are folks you can't decide like, ooh, is this John?

105
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,340
Shooting an old man for telling a story pretty good pretty good riddle nice stumped me

106
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Hey Margaret, you gotta hear this one

107
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:20,420
I didn't see it coming and then I guess I suppose in this story John eats him. Yeah. Yeah

108
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,820
Good times

109
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,380
Let's test. Let's answer your question. I feel like it's been so this first question from Tim here. Yes, it is Justin

110
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,980
What a treat for me. Oh boy. Howdy

111
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,500
Tim here

112
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,020
Probably the best local newsman. Oh, yeah, if I if I had to say mm-hmm

113
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:50,300
The broadcast Dave lavender takes tops like local newsman period right like Tim here if you're going broadcast Tim ears, man

114
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,300
I'm here. You know what? I one thing I'll say about Tim here places. He's Tim here

115
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,460
I read interview with him where they asked him what his greatest fear was

116
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,260
I don't know I've talked about this before but it's worth revisiting

117
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:08,700
I asked what his greatest fear was and you know, he said what nothing. Yeah, no fear Tim here

118
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Let's see what's on his agenda today

119
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,900
Checking with no fear Tim here who loves hot sauce another thing about Tim. He's not afraid of the heat

120
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,040
Not afraid of the heat not not afraid of anything

121
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,660
Whenever I walk outside on a windy day, and you know, he's always out there walking that beat looking for scoops

122
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,380
The narrow casting happening right now is is it's basically just Tim here

123
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:38,220
I don't think the version of Tim here that I'm describing would even be recognizable to to some of his other WSA Z colleagues

124
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
so have I

125
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,920
Cuz I reference Bill Murray and that fool left in 2013 to go to Kentucky where all of our most hallowed news people go

126
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:55,240
To die. It's the elephant graveyard of Huntington News people

127
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,640
Man, I'm just realizing that Rob Johnson's gonna listen to this and get all pissed off

128
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,800
Yeah, okay. Well, you need to send in a question Rob. Step it the fuck up Rob. Come on Rob

129
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,760
Let's get it going Tim here is on the show now. Yeah now that Yahoo Answers is dead

130
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,240
We're gonna start a segment on my brother my brother me where we just talk about Huntington News anchors for an hour

131
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,200
It'd be fun. There's another fact about Tim here. He looks just like Woody from Toy Story

132
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,040
So much so that he used to wear a woody costume. I don't remember if it was on the air or fun

133
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Justin had

134
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
All right here doesn't tweet a lot

135
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,880
These are just some Tim facts some Tim some Tim bits

136
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,720
Um just but you know get in man, actually, you know what now I'm looking through his history

137
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
It's more than I thought

138
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,380
His most recent tweet is r.i.p. Greg Jacobs aka Humpty Hump

139
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,840
So these he's he's a guy's thumb on the pulse. He does he's Tim here. I would love so here's a tip

140
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,480
What you're wondering the question? Yeah, I can tell already

141
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,240
But I clicked away from the page to look for more Tim your nugs

142
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,400
I know I gotta go all the way back to the question Tim bits fuck

143
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,640
obviously

144
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Tim bits

145
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,040
Whenever I walk outside on a windy day I Tim here

146
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,280
Walk outside on a windy day particularly in the pollen filled days of spring and summer my eyes water

147
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,440
Other people walk by obviously think I'm crying

148
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,300
One older woman who was clearly moved by what she perceived as an emotionally distraught passerby

149
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,200
Actually went so far as to produce a handkerchief from her purse and wipe my tears

150
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,920
I'm given I've given serious consideration wearing a sign around my neck or perhaps a t-shirt with the emblazoned message

151
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,760
I'm not crying and that's from Tim. I'm not crying ear

152
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,440
It's at Tim. I know he's not afraid of emotion. Yeah

153
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
He's Tim

154
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,800
The only thing Tim is afraid of is lying to the people. Yeah, I've seen him

155
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,240
I've seen him talk about stuff on the news and he'll be like and the Highton Highlanders came back to win it

156
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,560
Nailed it though. We got a the Marshall thundering herd made quite

157
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I

158
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
It's a lot about football

159
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,320
But they let him you know a lot of you don't know this

160
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
But if you're the anchor do you really care about one a lot?

161
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,160
They'll let you do it instead this nice because they don't make him do any of the sad sports stuff, right?

162
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,160
Or even the happy ones just the emotionally moving ones. Yeah, but he can be like, yes

163
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,360
There is a big ritual cult murder that happened in the park. Whatever whatever, but did you hear about these?

164
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Um, I wonder if Tim realizes that um

165
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:07,440
Old women giving you handkerchiefs because you appear to be crying is not something that happens to us that are not TV news anchors

166
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,760
Yeah, that are not specifically Huntington's own Tim. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a

167
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,860
Fair point Tim is like whenever I walk down the street eight people hand me bagels and wish me a happy day

168
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,800
Pretty sure I could be walking down the street openly saloping not just like and I think older women would think oh

169
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,000
He's probably on bath salts or something along those lines. That would probably be the vibe. I specifically will say this though

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,720
I will say this to Lynn credence to Tim's issue if I see Tim here

171
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
local news anchor Tim here

172
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Wandering the streets sobbing to himself in my head. I'm like, what the fuck?

173
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,800
Oh, no on in Huntington some something really does he know that is there an asteroid headed right?

174
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, man with no fear is crying. We're all doomed. Yeah, it would be terrifying lantern is crying. What's happening? I

175
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,800
Used to have this concern

176
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,200
when we used to go to church as kids and I would yawn so hard that my eyes would water and I wasn't worried about

177
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,760
People seeing me yawning. I was worried that they might think I was so moved by the sermon that I was crying and they would

178
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,520
Think did Travis do some bad shit. Did Travis about to recommit his life to the Lord for a third time. I

179
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,240
Did do it a second time because I liked the attention right? Well in the first one you were clearly faking it

180
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,940
Yeah, the first one didn't take off right? Yeah

181
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,400
You know what Tim? Here's what I would suggest. Just let this if this happens to you again

182
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,000
Just let people feel like they did you a solid. Yeah, you've done so much on you

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,880
Let them feel like oh, that was a nice thing

184
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,360
I did I did a good turn for Timmy or I hope you appreciated it

185
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,000
And then when you do the newscast later that day have their handkerchief hanging out of your sleeve

186
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,960
To show that you enjoy their favor that you are now doing the news for them that night, right? Like a jouster

187
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:05,840
Mm-hmm. Who has handkerchiefs old ladies? Yeah, and now Tamir. Yep. And now Tamir has her handkerchiefs

188
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,920
I heard that in his office

189
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:14,920
He nails up the handkerchiefs one by one as they're given to him much much like Willie Mays Hayes does in the the hit baseball

190
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,160
Movies major league. Yeah, I hear he makes a necklace out of really

191
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,760
Yeah, I heard he pulls them out of his sleeve one by one like a clown. They're all tied together

192
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Yeah, and in the end his underpants. That's funny and sexy. It's funny and sexy

193
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,900
Rob Johnson the the floor is yours the this I I can continue to read Yahoo

194
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,000
For another like six days. I mean, I guess I guess there's no reason to not right

195
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,520
Let me say this Graham Roebuck sending a lot of goodens and a very sweet message

196
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:56,160
Well, thank you. Thank you Graham Roebuck for your for your service. This one's asked by Yahoo answers user William who asks

197
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Why is there no big fruit?

198
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Why is all why is all fruit small enough to hold with your hand?

199
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,560
I know we have berries and apples

200
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,400
But I think watermelons are the biggest fruit I know of and you can just hold it with two hands or one if you're strong

201
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Why is there no big fruit now? Listen, there's gonna be some science folk out there like your Hank greens your Hanks green

202
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,840
Oh, we're in a tick tock is right now aren't we you search biggest fruit? I shit you not I

203
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:30,960
Shit you not searched biggest fruit first image Hank green superimposed in front of a picture of a water

204
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,920
Yesterday BB asked me how's lightning work and I pulled up a video and I was like, okay

205
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,720
I don't see any of Hank green stank on this any of stank green on this and

206
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,560
Then fucking right there at the end of the video executive producer Hank green. Oh

207
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,960
Like we're in a tick tock of his right now and he's just like

208
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
He's probably using this audio and being like

209
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,760
So Hank green is gonna tell you that the problem is is that the fruit gets too big it falls off trees

210
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Well Hank green counterpoint. Why don't we have bigger trees then? Yeah. Yeah Hank

211
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,000
Stronger trees. Give me some virile trees trees where the branches bend down all the way down to the ground

212
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,680
So the fruit can just sit on the ground and hang out and then when the fruit falls up the branches whip way up high

213
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,280
In the air and gives a bird a scare. Yeah. Hey crank green. That's good

214
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,480
What about pumpkins? Yep. Hey, hey Hank. Did you forget about?

215
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,760
When you gave us this answer that we imagined a few seconds ago remember when you Hank green said that

216
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,840
Yeah, or Travis attributed that to you and what about the fucking ground Hank?

217
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,280
So I guess it's not on the ground Hank. It's not about trees. Is it Hank?

218
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,560
Hey teens following this guy. This is this is I've revealed the curtain and you could see the wizard behind it

219
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,340
It's just a it's just Hank green lying to you about fruit. He's guessing about fruit

220
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
He's guessing about food. He forgot about

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,340
He forgot about fucking pumpkins so embarrassed for him in that imaginary

222
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,460
response Travis attributed to him and so that I mean that's the thing is like there are some fruit this big like

223
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,460
Pumpkin pumpkins is big huge. You kidding me. What about durians? I've never seen one in real

224
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,060
Jack fruits a big boy Jack

225
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,740
But durian stinky not big. Thank you for it. There's but there's a cap on it, huh?

226
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,940
And the cap is pumpkin that we wear but here's the thing

227
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,820
I've seen some fucking big pumpkins not in person mind you but in pictures

228
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,780
No, I know maybe they're photoshopped

229
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,340
I don't know but like there's a variability in the size of pumpkin you never been at travel you seriously never been to the

230
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,420
You never been to the pumpkin festival? No, I went but I specifically didn't look at the big pumpkin because I was afraid

231
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,660
I was afraid yeah, he'd get trapped inside of it. It's a completely legitimate fear

232
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,980
But I think it could spontaneously like roll on to me, you know, right and he would yeah you die

233
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:05,500
I think that the question we're really asking here is why is most fruits so small? Yeah

234
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,300
Cuz bird is small

235
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,180
Birds so wait what cuz birds is small

236
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,820
The birds gotta eat the fruit and then poop out some fruit birds don't eat fruit

237
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,580
Birds eat worms some birds do fruit birds eat worms and birds eat crackers. That's true. Fuck. That's a good point

238
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,900
What about lemurs Griffin? Yeah lemurs do love it. I lemurs are like the birds of monkeys if you think about it

239
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:33,820
How do bananas know how big to be? I guess as they look at the other bananas around. Yeah, it's all comparing

240
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,220
And that's what's so harmful as they see a lot of pictures and magazines of

241
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,980
Bananas that look a certain way. Yeah, and they think that that's gonna be see now

242
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,180
I wish my last name was green because sometimes I ask questions like that and I want sort of an erudite

243
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,380
discussion about it and but you wish we hadn't gone so hard on but then Travis says stuff like

244
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:57,340
The banana looks with its banana eyes at the other bananas and feels banana peer pressure to look like the other bananas

245
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,020
Well, no, I hold on. I didn't say the banana peer pressure thing. That was Justin

246
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,700
I said they look around and that lets them know how big regardless like neither of you came at me with that

247
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,900
Er that good heat that like I know I just happen to know. Oh, that's funny. You asked that I happen

248
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,380
No, you guys have never ever once said to me. Oh, it's funny. You asked that Griffin. I know exactly

249
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,020
I don't think about something. I know great. You always ask shit. I don't know

250
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,860
Ask me something I know right now right now ask me something, you know

251
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,180
I know is it bad that I can't think of anything Wow

252
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,100
Wow, pretty bad. There's things

253
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,460
Wait, hold on Griffin. You know me right? Yeah, but like I don't know what you know

254
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,660
Huh? I cuz I feel like you sort of float through

255
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:48,140
Through life. Yeah on a little cloud. Yeah, and it's like the thing in Mario Brothers

256
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,100
Trav, what's the big what when you start?

257
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,540
Blacksmithing what's some of the early stuff that you'll learn? What are some of the first skills? Oh, thank you so much Justin

258
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
You will learn you should say

259
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,060
No, I just Travis just to take again. It's a it's funny. It's funny. You asked that it's funny

260
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,140
You asked that hey teens. It's me Travis McRoy your favorite brother

261
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,620
It wasn't blacksmithing, huh? Well, I

262
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,660
Realize me. I got a taper. I mean you don't it's the energy is so off

263
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,940
I'm trying to match Hank Green's energy. He doesn't go

264
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
It's oh you want to know about the biggest fruit

265
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,980
Okay, to be fair in that specific video John Green is choking him out that does happen a lot

266
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,300
I will say this about those two. I wish they didn't fight as much like physically fight

267
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,900
Yeah, it's very upsetting like her green will be doing a video about like, you know

268
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,140
I don't know like why tornadoes happen and suddenly John Green will just karate

269
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:55,540
Like fucking spear him into his computer and break it. I saw John Green speed bag Hank Green's butt once

270
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
Yeah, but like you know what

271
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,820
fucking glass houses

272
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,820
Yeah, we should be back. We speed bag each other's butts on camera before. Oh, yeah all this time cuz we're

273
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,780
We're brother. We're Brascal boys. Yeah, and boys punch butts boys Brascal boys punch each other butts

274
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah, those little rascals love punching butts

275
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,180
Just want to slide in here real quick. Sorry past us for interrupting, but we do want to take a second. I'm not sorry

Speaking of max fun drive, perhaps we should reach for the star Wow

313
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,540
So you're doing a lot of hits well, I just wanted to make it feel special

314
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:23,820
It's our first max fun drive episode and I went to bring the I wanted to bring the two of my bits that people seem to like

315
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,980
Please okay. What's that? Travis? No, I didn't I wasn't going to editorialize in any way

316
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,740
I just want to hear the this segment. Okay, so I will read

317
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,220
some reviews left

318
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:46,100
With with a certain amount of stars. These are all four and five star comments. Oh on on a product on

319
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,340
Amazon I will read you those comments and you guys are going to try to guess what that product is first comment Wow

320
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,520
It works did a good job cleaning out the gunk and earwax

321
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,720
Is it one of those earwax cleaners outers?

322
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,440
Like one of the things it's got a little camera on it

323
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,480
I see him I get Facebook ads all the time where it's like hey you dirty fuck

324
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,760
Get check out this big nasty glob. You can pull out of your human head man. Facebook has you pegged, huh?

325
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,200
Yeah, it does. It knows that I remember. Yeah, you coming a mile away. All right, Justin guess

326
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,340
No, okay

327
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,540
Second comment boy was that not the answer? No, that was not the answer Griffin

328
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,920
No, that was it. Do you think that I would be like guess the product?

329
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,040
Anyways, it's the thing that cleans out you know, come on

330
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,040
The best thing to clean up ears is caps of BIC pins, but I'm assuming it's not BIC pins

331
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,400
That is visceral what you just said

332
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
My wife's a doctor I can't be wrong

333
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,920
Okay used today on a two-mile swim works great and forms to my ears

334
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,880
Keeps water out and dries to use multiple times kids. Don't try this at home

335
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Only adults can stick things in their ears. Is it a wax product? Is it wax some sort of ear?

336
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,900
Wax that you use to protect from swimmers ear incorrect. I'm starting to think that people are not using this

337
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,820
Object. This is like an off-label usage. Yeah, it's like floam or some shit

338
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,440
Okay, or you know how you can smoke flow. Yeah

339
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,000
incredibly high and then you run down the street saw

340
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,180
Okay, I burst my eardrum back in March and my ENT recommended this of all things to use as an earplug

341
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,220
Because it usually stickiness to stay in as opposed to having to be shoved down to the ear canal

342
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,000
This was a great bang for my buck. Oh my god. Is it like silly buddy is silly buddy Justin

343
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,240
So flow wasn't even that far

344
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,100
I've holy shit really was silly putty pack of six Justin

345
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,920
This is a weird reach for the stars were actually come out a little smarter. Yeah, then I went in because this is a whole

346
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,340
World that I did not understand. I don't know about I mean, I guess it makes sense right silly putty wasn't it invented?

347
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,720
To be silly putty, you know what I mean? So why wouldn't it be?

348
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Uh, why wouldn't it be an ear an earplug thing now?

349
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,360
And so just just a guy trying to make fake rubber made silly buddy

350
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,240
He also made great earplug thing here

351
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,020
There are four more quick comments here that I I just I had one first one

352
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,760
received on time and they are a crowd pleaser and

353
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,280
That makes me think that perhaps for a feature live shows

354
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:39,040
I see on jokes fucking hand out some silly putty. It makes me think that the crowd you hang out with sucks

355
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,280
These three comments these were reviews left by three different people and I at three different times I cannot stress this enough

356
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,560
I'm going to read all three of them. It really is silly putty

357
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,560
It's putty. It's silly. Yeah, silly putty. It is right there

358
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,640
That last one's silly putty. It is tribe. You should have read us one of those ones because it'd be easier to

359
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,840
Yeah, but I thought that might give it away. Yeah, was that the only one? Yep. Oh, wow. Okay. I like that Travis

360
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,920
That was your best reach for the stars yet. I would say yeah

361
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Well, you don't have to sound

362
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,960
Hey everybody we don't I wouldn't normally highlight this but halfway through the episode

363
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
We had to take a break and then pick it back up

364
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,560
The next day and now I'm having my coffee and the sun is shining and I'm wondering and I I want us to really think

365
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,180
About it. Did we go too hard on Hank Green? I

366
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,320
Yeah, yeah in the light of day. I feel like I think I called him. I

367
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,200
Think I called him spank green. There was definitely crank green was in there stank

368
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,720
Green green is libelous and I feel to fucking like he's he's been nothing but very kind to us

369
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,000
Just like he's always been so nice to us and like we've worked with him on stuff a lot. Yeah

370
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,960
And like I've texted him as a human. Oh, yeah, he's a power a lot

371
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,000
Good is a good person and I don't know why I call him crank

372
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,720
Yeah, we were really hard spank green

373
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,240
Should we say up to me? I think you know what?

374
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,680
I think part of it is is cuz he had YouTube and he took tick-tock. Yeah

375
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,840
I think that if I'm being honest about it now in the harsh light of day, he did have YouTube already

376
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,840
Then he took tick-tock and he doesn't seem right

377
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,800
He did try to come he and John tried to come for brother podcasts, which yeah did feel a little you know

378
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,280
What now I'm actually coming back around the other side. Yeah

379
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,600
Yeah, he and his wife then also tried to do like married couple like podcast also kind of our thing

380
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Just like crank. That is a real crank move. It's a real crank move

381
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,140
Yeah, real crank move crank. Okay

382
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm back around. I'm back around. All right, good. Well, I'm glad we put left him right in this place

383
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
What do you want another question? Yeah. Yeah, my morning brain is ready for a question

384
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,520
Yeah, this is a new day

385
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:11,680
Like we're now imbued with the knowledge of what happened yesterday and spoiler alert is pretty similar to the 300 plus days before

386
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,280
But all becomes a blur did have some new releases of the circle

387
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,720
Hey, can we take another break and come back then in like an hour so I guess go to question three J man

388
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,920
Computer computer execute question three

389
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,560
I don't normally work that way where it's sort of like you call the shots and I I know but it's a new day

390
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:41,040
It's a new day. Okay, my roommate works at Harris Teeter. Oh, man. I love a Harris team. Oh, yeah

391
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,920
I do not know what this fucking name if you got to get down to the beach with this man Harris Teeter down there

392
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,760
Oh, they got everything. Oh

393
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,020
Boy, I love a Harris Teeter. Okay, my roommate works at Harris Teeter and about a month at man

394
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,200
I hope there's tea every time I express affection for something

395
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,620
I'm so ready for somebody be like actually they put pigeons in the furnace every morning to start the electric

396
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,380
That's like something it's just something about a month ago

397
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:14,660
Okay, so my roommate works at Harris Teeter about a month ago who shows up at her 8 a.m. Shift, but Bill Murray himself

398
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,520
I'm guessing they mean of stage and screen and not Huntington's own Bill Murray

399
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,420
We did talk about other Bill Murray now Kentucky's right

400
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,380
Kentucky at this is Hollywood's

401
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,900
Bill yeah, as he's known the other Bill Murray the Garfield

402
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,660
Struck up a casual conversation with her and asked if she went to a school nearby

403
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:46,740
After confirming that yes, she does and she lives on campus. He asked if she had a car to drive to work

404
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,720
Unfortunately, we're college students who spend the majority of our income on to Tina's Pizza Rolls TM

405
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,860
And so she always walks as he finishes ring amber groceries

406
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,400
He pulls out his wallet and hands our roommate a $50 bill

407
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,720
He tells her to put it towards a bike fun. She did not buy a bike

408
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,280
Instead a week later. We used Bill Murray's hard-earned money to buy a kitten. He was on sale in her defense

409
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
He does not have a tail

410
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
The prosecution rests

411
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,760
What should my roommate do if Bill Murray comes back and ask about the bike?

412
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,560
So sorry if you hear this bill now, this is interesting, isn't it?

413
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,640
Mm-hmm, because here's the sequence Bill Murray said hello. Do you have a car and

414
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,160
And I'm not that directly

415
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,700
Because that does feel like a setup for something. Hello. Do you have a car and the person said no

416
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,040
I take a bike and decide the person said no I walk and Bill Murray said here's $50 buy a bike

417
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,020
It's like well, why don't I is I'm sort of fun anyway

418
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,420
Yeah aspirational why I go and put this towards, you know a car fun or maybe perhaps even a Vespa fun

419
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:59,060
Well, I think Bill wants to feel like he's made a significant contribution to your transit fun

420
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:04,620
That's right and $50 towards car is not as impressive as $50 towards bike. Yeah to scale that back

421
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,980
Let's see. How much is the car? He's gonna get a used car for like $5,000, right? So 50

422
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,380
Used car for $5,000. Well, that's what I mean. I'll rely Craigslist

423
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,380
You pride to find one for free if you're willing to get in the carburetor a little bit get elbow deep

424
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:25,500
Hey, let's hey what Bill Murray should have said was here's $50 buy yourself a really nice bottle of wine

425
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,100
Oh, doesn't that seem more charitable that doesn't that seem nicer? Yeah

426
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:36,020
But that's the way both the way you said it and buying someone is a lid a little creepy a bike

427
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,100
Oh, yeah, but he's Bill Murray

428
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,860
He defied he defies that like and and defines that and defines that it's enough of a cultural legacy

429
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,660
Hey kid, buy yourself a bike though feels like a cool move. Hey fucking cool. Hey, man

430
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,780
Get yourself like but actually I guess what he was doing was hey, here's like 10% of a bike. I

431
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,100
love

432
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,700
$50 I

433
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,940
love

434
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,540
$50 $50 who's on that way highlighted before that? That's that's that's a good

435
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,620
You belay video. That's awesome. Well, it's I mean it's up to 70 now in this fucking generation

436
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
Cash bandicoot. Yeah

437
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,020
Rats you motherfucker got like ratchet and crank

438
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,100
Green

439
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,220
anyway

440
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,260
$50 I love it. I love it. I love it

441
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:35,580
But if Bill Murray gave you $50 isn't there a part of you that's like I don't want to I want to frame

442
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,540
This frame. This is my Bill Murray $50. Well, that's the thing right is a part of a bike

443
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:48,820
That's fine, but Bill Murray paid for this cat. That's way better a good and I hate also

444
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,500
Excuse me question asker

445
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,900
How in the fuck are you gonna tell us you got a cat and not tell us what the name of it is?

446
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:03,300
Yeah, because if it doesn't relate to Bill Murray in some way they'll hurry Bill Perry Bill Perry Bill Perry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry

447
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,740
Sorry, sorry, Bill Perry. Can I just actually did you have a little lag Justin because I did say at first I

448
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,900
Literally, I'm sitting here

449
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,200
I do not know which one of you said at first because of internet latency

450
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,940
But I also want to say that there's probably a whole Garfield vector that

451
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,980
Just completely did not want to explore and this is also one of those moments where I feel like I just want to rattle off

452
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,020
Anyone I could think of so nobody tweets later like I can't believe you guys didn't say like Bill Perry Bill

453
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,580
Hurry, I mean no worries like so it's predetermined. Yeah, it's that good

454
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,860
You know, it's a dope name for this cat that Bill Murray paid for is you call him Lorenzo musics Garfield

455
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,660
Lorenzo music is one of the great names. Yeah, powerful

456
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,380
Wait, hold on wait, I had a follow-up. Why do cats go on when do cats go on sale?

457
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:00,060
I guess if it is when they lose their tail in their 10% off. I guess so. Is that what happened?

458
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,060
No, I mean if you take ten if you if a cat loses tail that cat is 10% off

459
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,620
That's what I'm saying. So it doesn't make sense that you would have a value a value deal. Hmm

460
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:17,340
Hey, did you know that Carla music from Bon Appetit is Lorenzo musics daughter-in-law crazy, huh? Thanks Wikipedia

461
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:24,180
Now Griffin, did you hop on Wikipedia real quick to see if Lorenzo music was incredibly problematic

462
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,180
No, I just wanted to see some cool pictures of Lorenzo music

463
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,340
Okay, and I didn't I achieved my goal and I walked into you guys confuse Lorenzo

464
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,540
Music with Lorenzo llamas probably never it's probably okay. Cool. Cool. Cool

465
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,180
Hey, it's us again your old buddies your old begging buddies. Oh boy

466
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,760
Justin Travis come to your hat and hand saying hey

467
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,480
Hey, are you enjoying this? Is this good? Do you like Griffin's too proud?

468
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,920
Griffin's too proud and too busy caring for an infant. That's another thing false

469
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,800
You know, these babies don't feed themselves. Not yet. Eventually when they get older they will they will but they need you to

470
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,160
Spring into action to buy all the different baby. It's been too long since I've had baby, you know babies

471
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,080
Hey, no, but for real listen jokes leave the room get out of here jokes

472
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,800
Yeah your jokes over the years your support has allowed us to do things like focus more on merch, right?

473
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,520
If you've noticed that we've had more and more merch

474
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,120
It's because we were able to like work with designers and spend more time focused on that

475
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,020
If you have noticed like the shows have been sounding a little bit better, maybe a lot a bit better

476
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,200
We've been able to hire an editor because of your support

477
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,120
There's just things throughout where we've been able to kind of make the shows better

478
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,160
Make them more of a focus for us

479
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,880
Make sure we don't miss episodes when when we can all of that stuff tour when we were able to all of those things are

480
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,760
Because of the support you shown us over the years. There is a direct improvement. Just listen

481
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,680
Well, don't listen to the first hundred episodes

482
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
But the audio quality from no

483
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:00,920
But the audio quality from then to now is because your support has allowed us to get better and better equipment and it's just all

484
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,720
Of those things, you know, the world can be tough sometimes and sometimes you wake up and you think I don't want to be funny today

485
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,120
I don't be creative today, but then we know you're all out there depending on us to make these shows

486
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,800
You're supporting us and we're doing it, you know, we're making these shows for you because you matter to us

490
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,840
We did a mix-up bit thing where we all did each other. It's why there's video stuff in there, too

491

It's all over the video stuff in there. There's you know, if you can do $10 a month you get and all that bonus content

503
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,120
I do want to say just like two more things one if you're already

504
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:33,380
Supporting max fun. Maybe this is the year you consider increasing that support. Maybe you've listened to more shows

You can do that too. You can upgrade your support level or if you want to give a little bit more

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,520
But you're not ready to move up to the next level yet

But the last thing I want to say is if you think this sounds great if you want to do it do it now

510
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,760
It's so easy to think about it and then like 20 minutes from now

520
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080

Then what sense is the no I'm well great. I'm glad Jean was there for this moment because Jean is

527
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,800
An important person to me and a wonderful person

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,000
I am also heartbroken that you were not there for the news story that the fucking just the noise

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,280
I can't sum it up real quick though Griffin. Yeah, there's a new

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,960
Computer car that delivers pizza noise and the noise back

531

00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,960
Man, I love my new son, but the fact that he kept me from this. Yep exciting announcement

535
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,720
That's there's that's not even what work cuz we've already actually did all the jokes about it

536
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,520
Oh, I'm Jean actually came up with like better ones probably yeah

538
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,880
quick CBD update

539
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,240
wings over

540
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:15,140
Which is the name of a place has a new CBD infused menu for 420. Oops missed it

541
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,160
But this new flavor is sticking around it's garlic parm with CBD

542
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,000
Why garlic parm like chicken wings?

543
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,920
Well, it's a garlic parm sauce that you can put on wings tenders and tots

544
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,600
But it also it's CBD. It also CBD garlic parm will get you

545
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,920
Mondo

546
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
Fucked up, dude. It won't

547
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,120
But why but why because CBD and parmesan tots, I guess

548
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:54,240
Yeah, but at a certain point like if someone said here's some parmesan sauce and I crushed up some ibuprofen

549
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
I wouldn't want that either

550
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:07,200
What a delivery man this is headache this is headache destroying Buffalo barbecue

551
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,000
It doesn't make sense and some things don't need to go in things this you know

552
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,620
This new game boy brushes your teeth while you play it. I don't

553
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,560
If you eat a little bit of hot of your Honda Accords tires, it's also Claritin

554
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:33,560
That's good, but why if your allergies are bothering you just get out there and on your tire the same what we're fucking talking about

555
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,400
Cuz that is not the news right now

556
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,940
The news right now in the world of QSR is everybody's every every's plant-based. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I love it

557
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,920
Yeah, everybody's plant-based you like you know their salad or like a tomato

558
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
No, sir, this is plant-based

559
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:59,800
Taco Bell, so, you know that this is the end point of the whole trial Taco Bell is testing a

560
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,680
proprietary

561
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,680
boldly seasoned plant-based protein meat

562
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:14,960
The cravatarian taco feet it's and it says here in parentheses sounds like vegetarian

563
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:22,280
Oh now listen, there's probably somebody in the executive board

564
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,480
Who read that word and thought it said cravatrain and they needed a minute

565
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
They need a special helper to help them

566
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,760
Like the original crunchy taco supreme. Uh-huh. This take features shredded cheddar cheese

567
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,160
Crisp lettuce diced tomatoes and reduced fat sour cream served in a crunchy corn shell

568
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:51,180
Thank you, by the way for reducing the fat in this sour cream. I have a bunch a big spring in my step now

569
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,960
Except now fans can experience Taco Bell's beloved taco in vegetarian form

570
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,800
The cravatarian taco is currently testing at only one Taco Bell

571
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,680
Oh, wow, that's at 14 o 42 Red Hill Avenue, Tustin, California

572
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,160
until big market big market why

573
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:20,840
Why would you put out a press release to say that if you go to this one bizarre-ass Taco Bell in a Californian city?

574
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,600
They'll they'll serve you a vegetarian talk like that's why why does everybody need to know that?

575
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,040
Well Justin they put out press releases when they open that new Guardians of the Galaxy ride at

576
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Disneyland and there's only one of those

577
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,400
Yeah, that's a good point. That's almost a good point. It's like glances off being a good point. And I would also wager that this

578
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,160
Proprietary Taco Bell turbo fake beef is gonna send you on a roller coaster ride of a different kind

579
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,760
Hi, I'm turbo fake me the newest American gladiator

580
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,400
Set a fucking land speed record cruising through your gut

581
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
I

582
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,800
It's gonna make a new in between your intestines

583
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,840
The cravatarian taco is just one output of

584
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,800
Taco Bell's innovation team as they've been busy making good on the brand's continued commitment to provide vegetarian options in

585
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:35,400
2021 if you're keeping track so far that includes one vegetarian taco in California

586
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,400
So it's going pretty good for me. Yeah, I guess hey, you guys are still working on that, right?

587
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,240
It's in

588
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,520
Tustin did you just make up a name? No, I'm sure no

589
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,400
It's cuz your name is just your name's Dustin and I think you just said

590
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,880
your own name

591
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,560
The term cravatarian it feels compelled to outline here is

592
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:07,600
Inspired by all of Taco Bell's craveable options. Yeah, and it emphasizes how no one should have to sacrifice

593
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,920
Bold flavors for their lifestyle. It's okay

594
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,600
It's fun to see the marketing person get their hand on the ball who came up with that term

595
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,000
Like tell him how I thought of it. Hey, tell him how I thought it craved it. No, I think they'll get it

596
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,800
I think Craig it's right there. No, but tell him cuz I'm like, this is the best thing I've ever done

597
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
You have three kids Doug

598
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,320
This is my fourth kid the cravatarian taco the Crava trip

599
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,720
You know what? You actually said crave a train and I think I like that better

600
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
Too late to dammit

601
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,380
So that that is huge news. If you are near Tustin

602
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,420
Then mail us one guys can get is there time for one is there time for one more very brief?

603
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,840
Yeah, there's always time del taco created a Mexican pizza ghosted support hotline. Wait

604
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,400
For the past several years the concept of ghosting

605
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:05,080
When someone cuts off all communication without explanation, thank you so much has become an everyday phenomenon

606
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,280
Not so much an everyday phenomenon

607
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,840
I might editorialize that they don't have to parenthetically describe what the term means in the press release

608
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,800
But no trust us

609
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:20,180
It's an everyday phenomenon more than a year ago a certain tostada like menu item

610
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,600
described as a Mexican pizza

611
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:30,200
Disappeared from a major Mexican fast-food chain and fans took the social media and other do you see what's happening?

612
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,400
Yeah, and other online platforms on moss to air their grief. No, no

613
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,080
If they're airing their grievances about the Mexican pizza, I assume it is in the form of farts

614
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,760
the request went unanswered leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers hangry sad and

615
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,800
ghosted

616
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,880
Okay, and so now a year later

617
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:57,360
Yeah, Delta del taco restaurants with breakneck speed has is offering emotional and culinary

618
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,800
Support to all those disappointed fans via a Mexican pizza ghosted

619
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,380
Support hotline at one eight seven seven three ghosted fans can call the line

620
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,980
24-7 Wow that persistent availability. I assume is

621
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:21,920
Important because you never know when the grief of the Mexican pizza will hit you you can call 24-7 to receive guidance

622
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,800
inspiration and a resolution for being wronged in the form of an exclusive promo code for a buy one

623
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,240
Crunch Tata get one free from del taco

624
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,000
through

625
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
May 20th, can I just say?

626
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,800
we you have been doing bringing to us these months cards for quite a while and like sometimes I think like

627
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:50,120
This is the most like throw it at the wall and see what sticks and then something else comes along and then something else comes

628
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,240
like and I I'm now hesitant to say it but this feels like

629
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,560
Just conceptually perhaps in many ways the wildest one, right?

630
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,040
And I don't I think it's the time frame. I think it's the idea

631
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,760
This is it's it's like when somebody like slams you and then like later that night

632
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,180
You're brushing your teeth and you think of a really good retort only in this case

633
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,240
The slam wasn't against you wasn't a slam and your resort

634
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,160
your retort is to come up with a

635
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,240
Emotional support hotline for the people who feel

636
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:33,520
Slighted by the slam it is it is as if a kid said to another kid like you look dumb today

637
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:39,240
Yeah, and you a third party unrelated to the scenario nine months later

638
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,240
Went to the insulted kid and said hey, do you need to talk about that?

639
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,520
I went I don't fucking remember what you're talking about

640
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,800
What they have what?

641
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,120
So you would think that they'll taco would be like

642
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,520
So we're doing Mexican pizza, right? Fuck you

643
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,620
but

644
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:06,560
Del taco doesn't I guess they don't have the guts because they do have this thing that's called a crunch tada. That's like

645
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,040
You know around

646
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,600
Shit, it looks like I miss you

647
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,000
It looks like the Taco Bell Mexican pizza Mexican pizza is not an existing right world is an invention of Taco Bell

648
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,080
so I they don't call it the Mexican pizza what they're saying is like

649
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,560
We have something sort of like the Mexican pizza. Do you want to call this 1-800 number about it?

650
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,320
Yeah

651
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:34,280
We can make the connection in your head that these two things are sort of the same thing you can come to Delta

652
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,320
Tim hack Bart. You guys know him. He's the CMO over there

653
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
Don't talk. Yeah, of course

654
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,440
Don't taco is more than happy to fill the Mexican pizza void and meet the obvious pinup consumer demand

655
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:49,400
However, instead of just meeting expectations with a single crunch tada

656
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:56,480
We went further by offering a variety that'll appeal to vegetarian. Do you mean cravatarian?

657
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,460
Trains if you are vegetarian, did you describe yourself as anything other than a cravatarian? You don't you're not living

658
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,120
beef and chicken fans

659
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,440
Think of myself as a chicken fan all three crunch tadas highlight our

660
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,800
um

661
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,440
Quick service restaurant plus positioning with quality ingredients like our fresh house-made guacamole

662
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,560
fresh from scratch slow-cooked beans and

663
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,600
Signature queso blanco while offering guests best-in-class value for the money on top of a large

664
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,880
Six and a half inch freshly fried tortilla, so it's like a Mexican pizza

665
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,760
So what it is is a nice

666
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:45,380
Pizza, well, no, here's what happened is that they wanted to get into the Mexican pizza game by which I mean the fucking tostada game

667
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,080
Which is to the tostadas, which is to start us

668
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:55,760
But they can't but they know if they just call it to start as people aren't gonna know that there's instantly instantly

669
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,000
There are certain people I should say that aren't gonna know they're talking about Taco Bell's amazing

670
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,680
Mexican pizzas and so this is their way of kind of having their Mexican pizza and calling it a tostada and then also eating

671
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,620
It too and I got to do something. I'm also not calling

672
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:17,040
Still the belligerence on display here. It's like no one would ever know what a tostada

673
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,080
Yeah, we have to call the crunch tada

674
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:24,640
So they want to eat it now have you called the number yet because I have it loaded up on my phone

675
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,440
I just want to know it's definitely wait. Wait, can you you know me though? I can yeah

676
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:35,680
We can get a call going right here. I know for sure. It's gonna be a robot area answering. I better be

677
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,920
Oh god, yeah, I don't think I could actually handle if it's a real if nothing else

678
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,720
Just the idea of a human being have to be on call 24-7 for that number 24-7

679
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Yeah, the 24-7 thing. It does make me think that it'll be recording. But hey, we can treat ourselves

680
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,840
One second. Okay

681
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:58,840
Yeah, okay

682
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:05,400
Okay, so we called and it was a real human being and that I don't it they it was not a conversation

683
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,980
It was just someone telling us about a Del Taco promotion

684
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:14,960
So I we spared you the the very lengthy script that was read to hey and and let's spare them too

685
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,400
Cuz we said like what the number is the numbers there in the press release

686
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,280
You can find it. Even if you didn't catch him we say don't call it a human being will have to talk

687
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,400
But what if you're creating what if by calling you're being a job creator? I don't actually know

688
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
I'm moving on

689
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,120
Do you guys want a quick Yahoo real quick?

690
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,680
Yes, another gram robot joint thanks Graham, it's a question mark Yahoo answers use your question mark

691
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
I'll call them Dell asks

692
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,760
canned BLT

693
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,760
Hi, hi all I have gave recently started reading a book about the ways of preservation through cannon

694
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,920
It seems like you can meet and cheeses and veggies and vegetables

695
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,840
But almost everything it is possible then for me to try and can a BLT just a thought

696
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,880
Here's my idea toast the bread add the mayo add the tomato

697
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,400
But add lots of salt to help with preserving add the bacon then the lettuce then put it all on the bread

698
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,240
Then I can put it in not a can and vacuum all the air out. So the bacteria can't breathe

699
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,960
Then I put the lid on and boil the jar. Well this work or will the male make the bread soggy over time?

700
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,680
Thanks. I'm new to canning, but I want to become a master. I

701
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,840
think

702
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,480
Boy if you put it in a

703
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:42,600
Jaw a can a jar and you vacuum and you vacuum all the air out. So the bacteria can't breathe

704
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Does that kind of stasis lock?

705
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:53,400
There's a there's a sort of osmosis. I'm worried about of mayo encroaching into the breadlands mayo and tomato

706
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
Let's be honest tomatoes very

707
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,520
very wet

708
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:03,240
Um, could you dehydrate both the tomato and the mayonnaise?

709
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,400
Oh, that's fun and then rehydrate them with some sort of eyedropper

710
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
later in the process I

711
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,900
Mean there are canned hamburgers. Yeah. Yeah, this is no

712
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,480
Can we make those with the technology of our homes?

713
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,080
Do you know what I mean? Like here's what here's it and they specifically asked about a BLT

714
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,080
Yeah, right here would be my issue. Okay when

715
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,080
McDonald's launched the McDLT

716
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,720
They were so

717
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,960
flummoxed

718
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:43,320
by the tech like the the prime the like perfect BLT experience that they created a

719
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,760
two-prong

720
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,600
Styrofoam container in a real fuck you to mama Nate, right?

721
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,960
Which kept the hot side as Jason Alexander told us in

722
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,200
in

723
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,920
That famous ad it kept the hot side hot and kept the cool side. Cool

724
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:04,120
Yeah, so McDonald's in their infinite wisdom could not master this technology

725
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,760
Certainly certainly us at home. It's too well beyond

726
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,400
No, thanks. Well, I'm gonna be able to preserve

727
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,560
I think the problem is is that it gives you too much time to think about the BLT itself

728
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,160
Which as a functional sandwich is great

729
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:23,980
Okay. No, but I mean like you there's quick quick right bacon lettuce to me

730
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,700
It's quick quick and easy, right? It is a functional sandwich

731
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:32,700
But as far as like there's no bells and whistles and a BLT. There's nothing it's not

732
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,900
It's not gonna change the world of BLT. It's not

733
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:41,700
Revolutionary, so I'm saying you're going to a lot of work to preserve a BLT

734
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,700
I'm just saying I think that there are better

735
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:50,620
More interesting options that one could do and be excited later in the in the apocalypse to find

736
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,060
You know your canned croque monsieur, right?

737
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,500
LT is a

738
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,180
Bullshit sandwich. You can't take a club Sam

739
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:05,420
Sandwich and take one of the components off of it and then call it a different

740
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:11,160
Even more desirable sandwich. It's it can't happen like that the BLT

741
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,880
Who it's disgusting those three. I was trying to answer around that Griffin

742
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,000
I didn't want the BLT dancing around it for too fucking long

743
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,680
Like it's you can't just give something a name and then it's this it's a real sandwich

744
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:31,600
Bacon isn't enough to be the star of a sandwich show like it just isn't it's a friend that helps. Sorry Griffin

745
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:37,080
Can you say that very pleasing sentence again? Bacon isn't enough to be the star of the sandwich show

746
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,080
Oh

747
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Now let's talk but here's the thing I you can can a BLT right cuz you can can can can can

748
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,800
I really don't like doing the show some days. I

749
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,000
Forgot I even forget what I was gonna oh, yeah

750
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,360
If we tweak a little bit our definition of the word

751
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,600
preservation

752
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,880
I

753
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,640
Think that the answer to this can be a firm. Yes

754
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,800
Can you can you can a BLT? Yes, you sure? Yes

755
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,300
Absolutely, and it will be in there and stuff's gonna happen to it and when you open it later

756
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,040
It something will be there

757
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,400

758
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:34,920
Scenario. Yeah, the matter itself is preserved the flavor and texture maybe not

759
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,960
It'll be different texturally and flavor Lily and not in a great way

760
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,160
I bet but no you might have done a new society in there, right?

761
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:51,360
Yeah, it might be a little fucking Whoville down there a little little tiny mayor talking to you. Who knows the Mayo. Oh
