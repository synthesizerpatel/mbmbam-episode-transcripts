1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're gonna give advice and do funny sticks.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Laughter, it is in store.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm your middle-est brother, big dog, woof woof, canine.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Can I just say, you guys have been making a real meal out of the name introductions lately.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And I feel like it's a bit like, people just want to get to the nut.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And I feel like you guys are making us sit through a lot of, well just say your name.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay, what up dog pound, it's me, your manger's brother, woof woof, Travis, bark bark, McElroy, woof.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is Griffin McElroy.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
See that took like, that was like a three quarters of a second.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well see Griffin, the problem is in the past we've kind of let it get away from us pretty quickly.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm trying to hold onto it at least through January.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Dude, believe me, like I had a whole honorific there for a while, I turned into a dog.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Like I get it, but I think we're grown-ups now, you know, like one of us is 40.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think that we should be more responsible and serious and less funny.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thanks for listening to our podcast.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We hope you're making some effort to just keep it between the navigational beacons, as James would say.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're back on our regular recording schedule, which is hubris.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You almost have to fucking timecode this episode at this current moment, right?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's Thursday.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, hold on, somebody's at the door.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hey boys, it's me from the network.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh no.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hi.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's me, did I have a name?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Was it Reggie Big Shot?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Reggie Big Shot.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Something like that.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's what we're going with.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Reggie Big Shot.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Reggie, you haven't been here in forever.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know you boys have been doing a good job for us, even putting up numbers, big ratings.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've been loving it, but now I hear you're in a little bit of a pickle.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, we're in need of a new theme song, and I want to hear how the search is coming along.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How's it going?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, you guys masking here or what?

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, we have masks and we have masks on our microphones too, just in case.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, so the germs don't go through the computer.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And I also have Norton antivirus.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hold on, I got a mask.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That is a Mike Myers mask.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, love it.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I love Shrek, Austin Powers.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You would think it would make your nose and mouth look like Mike Myers's nose and mouth, but it's just his whole head on there.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, Griffin, I heard on the episode, my guy, Devin, he does all the listening for me, and he said that you did kind of a fakey fake, fakey fake goof song on there.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's real insofar as that I worked pretty hard on it.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Is it real in the sense that you stole the music from a beloved Mark Mothers bar, still recovering from COVID?

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Get well soon, Mark.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Did that person write the Rugrats theme song?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, yeah, I thought it was fair use.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, Rugrats is 75 years old.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's been more than seven years since Rugrats went off the air, so I don't think Claskey Supo is going to come after my hiney.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, I wanted to give Trev, you know you're my favorite, you're my baby.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I do know that.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I tell everybody, I tell them all, I tell Rogan, Carola, all my boys.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, wait.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's my baby.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wait, this is news to us.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Listen, don't get hung up on details.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is Roman Mars on that?

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You told us Roman Mars was on this network.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is that true?

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He is like Roman Mars.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's a Roman Mars of jugs.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
His name is Doug Jupiter.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He's the Roman Mars of jugs.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He tells all kinds of great stories about jugs, most of them I've heard, but some are new to me, which is a thrill as a listener.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So some are like classical, almost like a Beowulf story about jugs, but some are new creations that he is writing himself?

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, he freestyles on there, and some of them are more historical.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Cool.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I love it all, though.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's kind of a tone poem.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, a tone poem.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's called 99% Vrooms.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How do you spell that?

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's the other 1% then?

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There's four O's.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Listen, of all my boys, Travis, you know you're my favorite.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, okay.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I wanted to, you know, the little one gets a lot of the credit for his talent.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, I'm always like touching my cheeks and like, I'm a stinker.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Travis, I wanted to give you kind of a shot at it right now.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, kind of a shot at doing an intro song, huh?

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, theme song.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I wanted to see what you could come up with, you know, right on the spot.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What about like, this is the intro song.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It is a very long-

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's no music?

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, I mean, okay.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You don't have an instrument like near you?

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My mouth is God's instrument, Griffin.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Man, the sound of Justin eating, even as a joke, bugs me in a major way.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He's out of the room.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I want you to take your-

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You went to the cramper.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Griffin, do you have like an egg shaker handy or something you can give me?

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, sure.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sure, sure, sure.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let me start it.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg, egg.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is the intro song.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It is a very long-

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Egg, egg, egg, egg.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So that was kind of like an Applebee's Birthday remix.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, I figure people want to get, it leaves us more time for great bits like this.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Are you open to notes or you locked in?

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm actually locked in.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,160
I already mailed it to myself in a sealed envelope

126
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,000
so I could copyright.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,280
Smart, smart cookie.

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,800
I could still tweak the fruity loops that I'm working with

129
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,660
if you have any notes on the instrumentation.

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Well, it's not the instrumentation

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,900
so much as the legality of it, right?

132
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,520
You remember when there was a period

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,620
where you were kind of gingerly ripping off

135
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,880
one of the world's most popular bands

136
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,080
really courting some extreme actions?

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Legally speaking, I don't wanna get back into those waters.

138
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,240
Oh, boy.

139
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Where'd you go for a second, Reggie?

140
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,560
Hey, what just happened there?

141
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,960
My gosh, these damn Zooms, hold on.

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
The microphone made you turn into the movie announcer?

143
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,320
Zoom, the Zoom, the connection.

144
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,540
We're not using Zoom.

145
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,760
Damn Zoom.

146
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,080
I got it open on another tab by kids in school.

147
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,400
You're sharing a computer Oh, that's great,

148
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,040
but your child is in school on the same computer

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,640
that you're giving us.

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,520
Yeah, I'm in school, what of it?

151
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,080
Oh, boy. Reggie Jr.

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,920
What?

153
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,960
Reggie Jr. No, his name is Kathleen.

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,240
He's named after his mother.

155
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,160
Oh, a feminine junior.

156
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,560
Hey, listen, Travis's was bad and you know I love him.

157
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
You know I love him. He's your favorite.

158
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,080
He's your angel.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,320
Griffin, you wanna try again

160
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,240
or are you just gonna stick with your original deal?

161
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,720
Can I try another one?

162
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
Yeah, I love that.

163
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,840
Much better. If you change your mind.

164
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,440
Okay, all right, you see you got into a problem.

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,600
Oh, yeah, damn it, there it is, okay.

166
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,920
They are just the McElroys.

167
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,520
They are just the McElroys.

168
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,200
Sorry, I can't even identify what you're.

169
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,880
McElroy brothers, answering questions.

170
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,640
They're the world's most fearsome brother team.

171
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,120
Okay, now I see what's going on here, all right.

172
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,620
Griffin's too cool and Travis does machines.

173
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,580
How are you? You give it up.

174
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,180
Justin's cool but rude.

175
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,300
And so they're all cool, I get that.

176
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,260
Everyone's cool.

177
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,180
And Clint McElroy is the party dude.

178
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,180
Hey, MB, MB, MBAM, MBAM.

179
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,060
We have to add an MB for it to work by the way.

180
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,060
MB, MB, MBAM, MB, MB, MBAM, MB, MB, MBAM.

181
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,700
Yeah, we get it.

182
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,100
It is time for Travis to add Justin Griffin.

183
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,940
Okay.

184
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,740
You put yourself up front, which I love that,

185
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,580
to kill Rinstein.

186
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,820
My song.

187
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,220
Okay, listen, I'm sorry to derail you boys.

188
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,060
I know you're doing your little.

189
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,900
I just made that up off the top of my head.

190
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,660
Doing your show, but you keep working on it, all right?

191
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,300
I'll keep checking in on you.

192
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,700
Cool. I love you, Reggie.

193
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,760
I don't, I think you suck shit, dude.

194
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,680
Hey, he's gone.

195
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,580
Do you think I suck shit?

196
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,540
No, I think that about Reggie.

197
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,460
Let's do a question.

198
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,900
Okay.

199
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,900
I recently discovered a can that had its label removed.

200
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,900
None of my roommates remember its contents

201
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,540
and none of us could tell from its shape or size.

202
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,740
How do I deal with this situation?

203
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,820
Do I open the can

204
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,340
and risk having to dispose of its contents?

205
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,300
Should I just try to forget about it?

206
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,340
That's from Can Conundrum in Canada.

207
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,920
Oh, I got a fix for this.

208
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,260
Open it and eat.

209
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,900
What the fuck's inside?

210
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,060
But Griffin, what if it's like you open it

211
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,500
and it's like a cream of mushroom soup?

212
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,340
And you're like,

213
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,580
I don't want cream of mushroom soup right now.

214
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,740
If I were to just kind of like

215
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,980
draw the Punnett square of options you have.

216
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,860
Don't open the can and don't eat it is one.

217
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,420
And that's the path you're currently following

218
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,900
and it is the most boring path.

219
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,980
And then you have opening the can and not eating it,

220
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,940
which is a fucking waste.

221
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,820
And then you have open the can and eat it,

222
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,700
which is what a hero would do.

223
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,020
And then you have don't open the can and eat it,

224
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,460
which is out there.

225
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,660
That's what a billy goat would do.

226
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,500
That's what a billy goat would do, a cool billy goat.

227
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,700
Let me offer an option.

228
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,940
Yeah.

229
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,020
Well, this is tough now

230
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,180
because people shouldn't be visiting you.

231
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,820
But when people come to visit,

232
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,700
you could offer it like a surprise prize in a game show.

233
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,540
Cool.

234
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,220
Okay, I could give you a slice of pizza

235
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,420
or I could give you what's in the mystery can.

236
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,900
It could be anything in there.

237
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,820
I'll take the pizza.

238
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,020
Is there enough for everybody?

239
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,860
Cause I will take the pizza.

240
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,860
If someone does that to you at their house,

241
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,540
you come and they say, here is a can and you can open it

242
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,340
and maybe you'll eat what's inside.

243
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,300
You know, you don't have to, if you don't want to though.

244
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,900
What is in that exact scenario,

245
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,580
the best thing that you can find in that can?

246
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,740
And don't say like a million dollars

247
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,060
or signed picture of Harrison Ford.

248
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,620
Chef Boyardee mini raviolis.

249
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,100
That's what you're going with?

250
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,940
Yeah.

251
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,980
There's a correct answer to this by the way

252
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,800
and that was not it.

253
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Justin.

254
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,480
Oh.

255
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,300
Enchilada sauce.

256
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,140
Enchilada sauce.

257
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,180
You would want straight enchilada sauce.

258
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,740
I mean, it's not like I want to put a spoon in there

259
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,900
or a straw and go to town.

260
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,940
That's what I'm talking about.

261
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,540
You're gonna put a spoon or a straw in there

262
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,380
and go to town.

263
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,200
Do I get to cook it?

264
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,100
You can heat it up if you want,

265
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,540
but you got to eat it from the can.

266
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,900
Do they make canned gnocchi?

267
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,520
Gnocchi can? Probably.

268
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,360
No can.

269
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,700
They make canned gnocchi?

270
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,580
No can gnocchi.

271
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,940
I could go for a gnocchi.

272
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,500
I would not say no to gnocchi.

273
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,580
Isn't it interesting how the word gnocchi,

274
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,940
you're making one letter silent

275
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,460
and kind of adding an extra letter in there too.

276
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,300
Yeah.

277
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,420
You don't say the G and also add a Y.

278
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,380
You know, Thor's brother gnocchi?

279
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,200
Uh-huh.

280
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,040
Oh, fuck yeah, man.

281
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,540
I'm Loki for gnocchi.

282
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,460
Oh yeah, there we go.

283
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
I love that.

284
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,220
Okey dokey gnocchi.

285
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,380
Is it pineapple rings?

286
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,200
I love that shit.

287
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
Oh.

288
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,780
Do you empty that out onto a plate or whatever

289
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,740
and it's still in its native can shape?

290
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,700
That rules, man.

291
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,140
Back in April, way, way back in April.

292
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,560
I cannot imagine what's gonna come out of your mouth now.

293
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,420
I was gonna make me a pineapple upside down cake.

294
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,460
Yeah.

295
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,460
And three different grocery stores I went to sold out.

296
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,840
This is when people were clearing shelves of shit.

297
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,680
Right.

298
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,420
It was out of both the rings and crushed pineapple.

299
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,620
Fuck.

300
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,820
And that to me is such a, like, not everything was gone.

301
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,340
There was plenty of stuff left, but somebody,

302
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,880
and I think to this day, I think it's one person

303
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,540
who was like, well, you know what I need.

304
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,500
And maybe it was Griffin.

305
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,340
It started to sound like maybe it was Griffin

306
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,620
just going around my neighborhood supermarkets,

307
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,620
buying all of the canned pineapple rings

308
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,940
and crushed pineapple.

309
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,420
I wouldn't buy a crushed pineapple.

310
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,260
I want the rings.

311
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,180
I want it to keep its beautiful shape.

312
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,020
Mm, I see.

313
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,620
That was a fun game.

314
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,460
Do you want any ah-hoo?

315
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,300
I like that.

316
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,260
Can I suggest one other option for the can?

317
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,460
Can you make a recording of yourself opening the can

318
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,740
and then send us the audio recording of it

319
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,020
just so we can be there sort of virtually with you?

320
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,500
Yeah, for the excitement of it.

321
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,340
Yeah.

322
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,940
If it ain't food, if it ain't food,

323
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,580
no, you know what, just from a legal perspective,

324
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,580
I want to go ahead and say, don't eat what's in the can

325
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,340
from us, your podcast heroes.

326
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,060
You could make this a fun YouTube series.

327
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,300
Like, oh, unboxing is old.

328
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Uncanning is the new shit.

329
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,700
There's people who do that with like MREs.

330
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,380
Have you ever seen any of those?

331
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,540
Yeah.

332
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,820
Hey, here's a yahoo that was sent in by everyone.

333
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,660
Thanks, everyone.

334
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,260
It's anonymous Yansers user,

335
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,820
which is the only thing I'm calling this from now on.

336
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,660
It's Yansers.

337
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,740
It's a Yancer.

338
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,560
This one was a Yancer asked by Yancy who asks,

339
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,880
how do I come clean about a crop circle I did?

340
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,720
Ooh.

341
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,620
Some years ago, I read a post

342
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,760
about how to make a crop circle.

343
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,060
So I tried it out and it worked really well.

344
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,900
Then local news-

345
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,720
I was about to say where,

346
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,260
but the answer is probably WikiHow, right?

347
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,420
I've watched a video about how to make a crop circle.

348
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,260
For sure.

349
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,860
I've never acted on that information.

350
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,040
Sure you haven't.

351
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,580
Then local news reported on it

352
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,060
and also said the farmer lost a lot of money from it,

353
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,500
which I hadn't thought about.

354
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,580
I felt bad.

355
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,300
I felt bad, but I didn't say anything

356
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,500
because I didn't have the money

357
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
and don't want to go to jail.

358
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,300
I have the money now and would like to pay him back,

359
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,280
but I still don't want trouble.

360
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,380
And I know he made a lot from people coming to the site

361
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,660
thinking it was aliens and doing tests on the soil

362
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,100
and energy readings and stuff

363
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,880
and buying t-shirts and jewelry.

364
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
So maybe he even owes me money?

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,080
Not that I-

366
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,220
I don't know about that.

367
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,740
The whole question was about that.

368
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,180
This person was too afraid to say,

369
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,460
I want to come clean about this crop circle I did

370
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,140
so I can get my portion of the revenue,

371
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,000
of the fraud revenue.

372
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,860
Okay, until you got to that last bit,

373
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,640
which is morally questionable to me at best,

374
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,460
I do think that if you're trying to come clean

375
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,260
and pay them back without getting in trouble,

376
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,620
you just want to leave it in a little envelope

377
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,360
that says like, to farmer from aliens,

378
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,500
sorry, we landed our ship here.

379
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,780
Here's some of your earth money.

380
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,620
Yeah.

381
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,940
Sorry that our ship had such a bad-ass

382
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,820
like tribal tattoo design on the bottom of it.

383
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,220
Sorry we left the Punisher logo in your field.

384
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,740
We're just crazy about that guy up here.

385
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,860
We love how he doesn't take shit from anyone.

386
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,940
Sorry about the Deadpool face

387
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,180
we left in your crop circle.

388
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,780
We've been thinking about blowing up the moon

389
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,620
into a Punisher skull face.

390
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,640
Do you like this?

391
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,780
Ask your friends, ask the government

392
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,620
if we can do this, please.

393
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,440
Would you guys be cool with that?

394
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,380
Not the whole moon, just like part of it

395
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,180
so that when you look at it, you're definitely like,

396
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,740
is that the Punisher logo?

397
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Bad-ass.

398
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,020
That's so sweet.

399
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,140
Kicks ass.

400
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,700
He doesn't take shit from anyone.

401
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,160
And neither do you, Earth.

402
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,960
That's why we want to give you this present.

403
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,340
Consider this our Statue of Liberty.

404
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,180
Yeah.

405
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,840
Ma'am, what if they fucking did go up

406
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,640
and zap Punisher face onto the moon,

407
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,620
but they misunderstood and they just put

408
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,140
like Thomas Jane up there or John Berenthal

409
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,660
just like looking back down on us all from the sky?

410
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,500
Will you go for more?

411
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,320
That would be great for his career.

412
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,460
Can you give me one more cinematic Punisher, Griffin?

413
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,300
Come on, baby.

414
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,860
You got this.

415
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,380
Was Dolph Lundgren the Punisher?

416
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,220
There it is.

417
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,340
Yeah, nice.

418
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,180
Yes.

419
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,020
Thank you.

420
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,840
Yeah, put them all up there.

421
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,680
Fuck it.

422
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,520
Just a little bit.

423
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,060
It's on different sections of the moon.

424
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,780
So as it turns, it spins.

425
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,780
Yes, as the moon spins around us.

426
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,620
Does it?

427
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,260
And we see the different beautiful parts of the moon.

428
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,660
This is its way.

429
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,700
You don't know how much the farmer lost, right?

430
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,540
It'd be very easy to leave a fat signed cash.

431
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,380
Or gained.

432
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,900
Or gained.

433
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,140
You could just leave an envelope with a note in it

434
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,140
that says, you owe me 500 of your Earth dollars signed alien.

435
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,100
Okay, you've said this twice now, Travis.

436
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,060
I do not believe aliens would deliver this missive

437
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,460
through the postal system or through an envelope,

438
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,420
or through, you know what I mean?

439
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,340
Like there would be, that we need a cube,

440
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,180
or something, a data cube.

441
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,020
Do you know what I mean?

442
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,860
I don't know how we-

443
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,300
This cube possesses bleep or proleons,

444
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,900
which should be enough to reimburse you.

445
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,820
Yeah.

446
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,540
Your kids are gonna love bleep, bloop, proleons.

447
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,020
Bleep, bloop's a number.

448
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,860
Sorry.

449
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,460
But it's also a noun.

450
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,300
This is the thing about alien language.

451
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,180
We can't expect it to all make sense.

452
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,660
It's complex and beautiful.

453
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,100
Yeah.

454
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,500
What if you send a message to them on one day,

455
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
be like, we're gonna drop off the money tomorrow

456
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,060
for what we, the aliens, owe you.

457
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,780
And then the next day you swing by

458
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,980
and you just leave like eight starbursts.

459
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,700
And the farmer's gonna be like,

460
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,300
whoa, starburst is space money.

461
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,140
And then it turns out

462
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,860
that it's all like a big starburst marketing scheme.

463
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,180
What would, I think that it's time to remake E.T.

464
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,020
Okay.

465
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,420
And when Elliot's like, here's some Reese's Pieces,

466
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,100
have E.T. eat them and be like, this tastes like shit.

467
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,220
Do you have any alien candy?

468
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,060
Yeah.

469
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,380
Right, because it's, why would you assume

470
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,820
Reese's Pieces would be universally liked?

471
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,220
Did you say racist pieces?

472
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,100
Racist, racist pieces.

473
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,220
Reese's Pieces.

474
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,820
I like Reese's Pieces,

475
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,380
but my man could have had a nut allergy.

476
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,220
That's true.

477
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,620
He should spit it out and be like,

478
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,580
do you have any sour candy?

479
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,780
Playing with fire, you got any kitty cats?

480
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,020
Cause I just watched Alf

481
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,820
and that shit was funny and appetizing.

482
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,660
You can't just run up and leave some money on his doorstep

483
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,500
because the farmer, all farmers live in areas

484
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
where they can patrol their fields at all times.

485
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,340
And they do.

486
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,860
Here's a rule from me to you.

487
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,340
You put it right on the tableau

488
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,940
with the man who sleeps with a machete under his bed

489
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,900
as a fool every night.

490
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,980
But one, you can put this right there next to it.

491
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,620
You can't sneak up on a farmer.

492
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,460
Oh.

493
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,860
This is proven.

494
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,780
They have long, flat stretches of land.

495
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,340
They're on the lookout for predators such as yourself.

496
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,180
Yeah.

497
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,260
Come after a livestock.

498
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,180
You cannot sneak up on a predator, impossible.

499
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
Can't sneak up on, they can't sneak up on a predator.

500
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,020
That's for sure.

501
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,300
Absolutely, there's heat tracking technology there.

502
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,100
But you can't sneak up on a farmer.

503
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,260
There's a caveat though, Justin.

504
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,740
You can't sneak up on a farmer in his home.

505
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,500
That's why you gotta get him at the general store.

506
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,340
Okay.

507
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,180
You got shelves around, there's like tools on the wall.

508
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,340
He is distracted by things.

509
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,620
That's where you're gonna get him.

510
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,660
And also your whole shit falls apart

511
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,940
when you think about it's corn,

512
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,380
which is the hiding place crop.

513
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,100
Corn is, when you plant corn,

514
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,900
you are giving up your ability to like

515
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,380
really keep tabs on your shit.

516
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,620
When you plant corn, you're saying like,

517
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,860
I can't wait to get that good corn money.

518
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,820
But there could be a living scarecrow.

519
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,700
There could be-

520
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,540
Children.

521
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,380
Children, there could be-

522
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,700
Or just drivers who like veer off the road

523
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,940
cause they thought they saw a ghost and drive into it.

524
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,780
That happens a lot.

525
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,780
That happens every single minute.

526
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,340
I've watched a lot of Supernatural

527
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,380
in every other episode, someone's driving into a cornfield.

528
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,220
They crash into corn.

529
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,060
Now that's why I, when I become a farmer,

530
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,260
I'm only gonna do little crops.

531
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,100
Oh, I like that.

532
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,140
No one can hide in a bunch of-

533
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,980
You know what I like?

534
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,540
The idea of you put potatoes and they go under.

535
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,940
You could keep the rest of it level.

536
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,780
I would love to do-

537
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,380
You haven't grown shit, Farmer Travis.

538
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,260
That's me on my potato farm looking out of the window

539
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,540
and there's just like a little naked green man

540
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,340
like glowing in like a hundred feet from my house.

541
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,660
And I'm like, I see, they're taters, dude.

542
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,460
I see you.

543
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,340
He's just carefully folding tater leaves together.

544
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,180
Yeah.

545
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,020
That's nothing.

546
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,940
That's nothing.

547
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,740
That's nothing, beep blork.

548
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,020
Bleep blork's a number.

549
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,860
Okay.

550
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,700
No, I'm sorry, Justin.

551
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,500
Beep blork is my son.

552
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,340
Yeah.

553
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,380
Okay.

554
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,500
No, we need to go to the money zone.

555
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,740
We don't have time for another question right now,

556
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,020
but we'll come right back and do more

557
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,860
of all the great stuff that you've been enjoying.

558
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,540
But first we're going to take a brief sojourn

559
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,500
straight on over to the money zone.

560
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
It is I, beep blork.

561
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,500
I heard you were talking about aliens.

562
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,260
I've actually been thinking about

563
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,940
how I need to do more character work.

564
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,540
This is not character work.

565
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,820
This is my life.

566
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,180
I've actually been thinking a lot about

567
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,420
how we should be doing jokes this one episode

568
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,060
after we did those very same jokes.

569
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,560
This is not a joke.

570
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,860
I'm the new sponsor of my brother, my brother and me.

571
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,540
I'm not, I don't even think that this is what

572
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,460
you sounded like last time, Bleep Blorp.

573
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,580
I've had work done.

574
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,420
On your voice?

575
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,500
Yep.

576
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,240
You don't know about alien shit.

577
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,480
It's true, that's why it's alien.

578
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
You got me actually there.

579
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,480
I want to tell you about Squarespace.

580
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,160
Then go right ahead, partner.

581
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,920
Your human show, my brother, my brother and me

582
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,520
is sponsored by Squarespace.

583
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,800
You humans still use the internet.

584
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,260
Correct?

585
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,160
Yeah, we do.

586
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,960
You need to evolve your shit.

587
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,560
It's bad.

588
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,680
The internet is?

589
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,900
It makes you sad, and it's hard to make websites.

590
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,360
Except with Squarespace.

591
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,100
So you know we already have access to Squarespace, so.

592
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,320
Like you know that.

593
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,400
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm reading the copy here, bro.

594
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,480
Yeah, but it's embarrassing like it's not broken.

595
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Like you know we have a way to do it well.

596
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,900
You're not bringing us this tech.

597
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,520
But Squarespace is the next.

598
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,400
Hey, just talk about all your boobs again, man.

599
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,360
That's what we liked last time.

600
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,000
I got four boobs.

601
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, stop all the time, he said it, he said it.

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,060
Yeah, he said it, yes.

603
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,800
Okay, now you guys talk about Squarespace.

604
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm too bummed out.

605
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,000
Please, Squarespace, demand to make good and free us.

606
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,240
No, Squarespace, we're gonna get through this one together.

607
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,320
With Squarespace, you can showcase your work

608
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,860
and sell products and services of all kinds

609
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,880
and promote your physical or online business.

610
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,760
I got a business and it's called Embarrassing Aliens

611
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,920
for Not Being Funny.

612
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,760
You're embarrassed, fuck off.

613
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,840
So they have beautiful, customizable templates

614
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
created by world-class designers

615
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,200
and everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box

616
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,440
if you want to put it over your baby's crib, I guess.

617
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,400
And they have analytics to help you grow in real time

618
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,360
and they have free and secure hosting

619
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,880
so you don't have to worry about, you know,

620
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,800
the thieves getting into your website.

621
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,720
And they also have nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

622
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
Anyway, go to squarespace.com slash my brother

623
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,040
for a free trial and when you're ready to launch,

624
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,960
use the offer code mybrother to save 10%

625
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,920
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

626
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,640
Now in the space between ads, Bleak Bork.

627
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,480
If you have-

628
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,400
Hey, is this Reggie Bigshot?

629
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,180
Yes, this is Bleak Bork.

630
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,020
Oh shit, he's calling Reggie.

631
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,400
Yes, I tried to help them out.

632
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,960
Just like you said, they were real assholes.

633
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,680
Real fuckers about it.

634
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,200
I didn't know Reggie liked him.

635
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,080
You should cancel their show.

636
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
Oh no.

637
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Yes, give Doug Jupiter more time to talk about my bazooms.

638
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,160
He only likes Doug Jupiter

639
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,360
because he talks about his miraculous bazooms.

640
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,380
Yes, all four of them.

641
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,220
Fuck.

642
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,480
Yes, yes, Donatello, Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello.

643
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,160
After the damn Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

644
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,240
That was like half a callback, Bleak Bork.

645
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,160
You are comedy poison.

646
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,320
Okay, I love you too.

647
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,160
Bye.

648
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,400
Hey guys, Bleak Bork just left.

649
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,880
He looked really hurt.

650
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,200
Travis, will you do this Warby Parker ad?

651
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,040
This is important.

652
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,320
Hurt like physically?

653
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Well, he was crying and it looked like blood,

654
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,400
but it might just have been alien tears.

655
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,860
Yeah, who knows?

656
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,220
Listen, I have perfect eyes

657
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,060
and I shouldn't have to do this one.

658
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay, I'll talk about it.

659
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,920
Warby Parker is committed to providing

660
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,280
exceptional vision care online and in stores,

661
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,740
offering eyeglasses, sunglasses, eye exams,

662
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,240
and contact lenses.

663
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,720
Glasses start at $95, including prescription lenses,

664
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,160
sunglasses, progressives,

665
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,040
and blue light lenses are also available.

666
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,080
I am currently wearing a pair of Warby Parker.

667
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,060
I have, at this point, several pairs of Warby Parkers.

668
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,080
I enjoy all of them.

669
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
I get compliments on them left and right.

670
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,920
They're comfortable enough to fit my giant face.

671
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,200
And you can do the home try-on kit,

672
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,080
which I like because not every glasses fits my giant face.

673
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,200
So they send them to me after I take a quiz.

674
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,720
You take the quiz, you order a home try-on kit,

675
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,160
and you get to try them on and make sure that they fit you.

676
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,480
Then you send them home.

677
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,440
It's incredible.

678
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,240
I love it very much.

679
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,360
Everyone should try it.

680
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,580
It has changed the way I do glasses.

681
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,200
Not just because of the price,

682
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,380
but because they're fashionable and stylish.

683
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,600
It's so easy.

684
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,680
Everybody has to do it.

685
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,600
Just try Warby Parker's free home try-on program.

686
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,320

687

Ships free includes-

690
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,360
Hey, everybody!

691
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,380
It's me, Juice Jazz, the clown!

692
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,020
I'll kill you, Juice Jazz!

693
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,780
Where'd you come from, beep blurg?

694
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,040
There's no obligation to buy.

695
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,060

696
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,520

at warbyparker.com slash my brother.

698
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,440
Do you think that that was enough

699
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,640
for Juice Jazz the clown to get his own Wikipedia entry?

700
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,480
Probably.

701
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,300
Okay.

702
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,800
Welcome back to Fireside Chat on KMAX.

703
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,600
With me in studio to take your calls

704
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,120
is the dopest duo on the West Coast,

705
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,720
Oliver Wong and Morgan Rhodes.

706
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,920
Go ahead, caller.

707
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,280
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

708
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,040
that's insightful and thoughtful,

709
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,080
but also helps me discover artists

710
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,520
and albums that I've never heard of.

711
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,360
Yeah, man.

712
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,400
Sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks every week.

713
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
Myself and I'm Morgan Rhodes, and my co-host here,

714
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,680
Oliver Wong, talk to influential guests

715
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,120
about a canonical album that has changed their lives.

716
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,400
Guests like Moby, Open Mike Eagle,

717
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,840
talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell,

718
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,240
and so much more.

719
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,200
Yo, what's that show called again?

720
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,040
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

721
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,240
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

722
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,520
You left us hanging there for a while.

723
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,360
I was scared.

724
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,320
Can I ask you guys a question?

725
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,200
I feel like I don't, I'm honestly,

726
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,080
leave this in the show,

727
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,760
but do you feel like I have overextended myself?

728
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,700
I don't want to like capitalize too much of the show.

729
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,520
And I know I did my stupid Big Shot guy bit,

730
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,360
and I don't want to like-

731
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,800
Well, how good is this one squad, Justin?

732
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,140
Is it better than Reggie Big Shot bit?

733
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,040
Look within yourself.

734
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,880
How did you feel like Reggie Big Shot bit?

735
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,560
Pretty good.

736
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,160
Yeah, I thought it was okay.

737
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,640
I just, I brought Beat Blur, Heat, and you know-

738
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,560
Yeah, a few times, Travis did that a few times,

739
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,160
so I think you are owed.

740
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
And then maybe I'll just talk

741
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,840
for the last 15 minutes or so.

742
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,880
Yeah, Griffin, if you want to do just like a monologue

743
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,360
about, I don't know, whatever you want,

744
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,880
I mean, you could do some of your audition monologues.

745
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,720
Yeah, I'll do that. You have that one

746
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,700
from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof that I love.

747
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,760
Yeah, the one that's like,

748
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,260
Meow, ouch.

749
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,600
Yep, that one.

750
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,440
Meowch.

751
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,240
Oh, my pawsies.

752
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,120
No, that's your Meowth audition monologue.

753
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,520
It's the same monologue, Travis.

754
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,840
This one has an audio component.

755
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,240
It is one minute long.

756
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
Oh boy.

757
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,520
And this is a Taco Bell tweet,

758
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,200
and I'm going to fill in some of the blanks after this,

759
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,160
but Taco Bell put out a video.

760
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,920
It said, and now an announcement from our CEO.

761
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,720
Here are the things you need to know about this.

762
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,420
It is being spoken by an animated potato.

763
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
Oh boy.

764
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,660
And now we take you live.

765
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,400
Do not react or the audio will be ruined.

766
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,520
Hi, everyone.

767
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,580
I'm Mark King, CEO of Taco Bell.

768
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,840
And we have some big news today.

769
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,920
As you might've guessed, it has to do with potatoes.

770
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,200
But let's start from the beginning.

771
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,960
Last year, we had to shift entirely to drive-through,

772
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,280
which created longer lines for our customers

773
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,860
and way more demand on our team members.

774
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,840
So in order to create a better experience

775
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,560
for both you and our teams, we had to simplify our menu.

776
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,680
And unfortunately, removing potatoes was part of that,

777
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,440
but it's a new year with new possibilities.

778
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,680
And you know what?

779
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,200
We're bringing them back.

780
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
That's right.

781
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,400
As of March 11th,

782
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,400
potatoes are officially back at Taco Bell.

783
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,920
Give us a minute to get them back to most restaurants,

784
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,620
but know that we're working hard to make things right.

785
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,380
And since you're still watching this potato speak,

786
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,760
I'll let you in on a little secret.

787
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,160
This year, we're going big on our vegetarian menu.

788
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,920
We're going above and beyond.

789
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,880
Anyways, that's all I got.

790
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
Later, taters.

791
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Oh my fuck, Justin, there's so much to unpack.

792
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,240
When you do that and we're not allowed to react,

793
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,280
do you know how torturous that is?

794
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,680
I know it pains you.

795
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,520
I know it pains you.

796
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
So very much.

797
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,440
What struck you, Trav?

798
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,080
What do you wanna touch on first?

799
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,920
Okay, Justin, a couple of things.

800
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,440
One, that it's gonna take them three months

801
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,640
to get some potatoes to Taco Bell's.

802
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,280
That's not what's happening in this.

803
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,480
He said, give us some time to get potatoes to our stores.

804
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,640
He doesn't need the time to get the potatoes to the stores.

805
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,760
He's saying that even at March 11th,

806
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,480
you may not see the potatoes.

807
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
What is March 11th?

808
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,600
Okay, I'm gonna walk you in on this

809
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,960
because I literally need everyone to understand

810
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,120
the context of this message that you just heard.

811
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Okay, COVID-19 took potatoes out of Taco Bell, right?

812
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,760
What this potato is saying is that hopefully

813
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,120
with expedient vaccination rates,

814
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:10,120
we will be able to expedite our processes within Taco Bell

815
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,680
in order to reintroduce potatoes to the menu.

816
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,560
Thank you, Dr. Fauci, for bringing back potatoes

817
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,400
to the menu at Taco Bell.

818
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,320
That was a direct quote from Dr. Fauci.

819
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,960
We're doing the best we can.

820
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,880
We're trying to get potatoes back, everybody.

821
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
We know this was rough.

822
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,480
Also, just say beyond meat.

823
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,040
At that point, you've already said it all.

824
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,880
Yeah, is that the season?

825
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,720
No, it's a wink.

826
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,560
He did a wink.

827
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,800
I get, yes, Justin.

828
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,760
I picked up on that

829
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,200
because it was the classic wink sound effect.

830
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,360
Now, tell me more about this animated potato.

831
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,520
Are we talking about pure veggie tale synergy

832
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,920
or are we talking about-

833
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,040
Yeah, how fuckable is this potato?

834
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,520
It's like Zoom filter,

835
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,960
sorry, Instagram Snapchat filter levels.

836
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,800
You know what I mean?

837
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Where it's got weird eyes and-

838
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,240
Okay, so just say very fuckable.

839
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,360
Extremely fuckable.

840
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,160
I mean, there's holes that would work.

841
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,400
So Taco Bell is bringing back potatoes.

842
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,480
Bringing potatoes back.

843
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,320
Are you ready?

844
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,480
Now, here's one question for you.

845
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,600
Why did they feel the need to give us two months heads up?

846
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
Good question.

847
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,280
I don't know what...

848
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,360
I was gonna leave the country,

849
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,880
but now I'll stay in the country for this.

850
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,720
I like that even within the video,

851
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,640
they acknowledge like,

852
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,280
we're surprised you're still watching this.

853
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,400
Like they even said like,

854
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
well, I guess because you're still here,

855
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,960
we should tell you something else

856
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,800
as a reward for watching this bonkers ass thing.

857
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,160
I love that it's not even a menu item.

858
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,360
The object potato.

859
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,040
We have brought back potatoes.

860
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,200
It will be present in our buildings again,

861
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,120
and we will be cooking them.

862
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,080
You have my guarantee on that,

863
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,120
miss me, Mr. Mark King.

864
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,200
We need some time to get potatoes back into the stores.

865
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,720
Hey bud, I can't think of a Taco Bell on the earth

866
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,120
you can't spit on a Walmart from the parking lot.

867
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,400
I am pretty sure that they could just go get some potatoes.

868
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,800
Just go get some and make the stuff.

869
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,480
Okay, here's the press release.

870
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,360
The brand is kicking the year off

871
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,320
with the return of potatoes

872
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,920
and exploring a new plant-based protein with Beyond Meat.

873
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,760
Potatoes.

874
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,600
So they just came around.

875
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,440
Okay.

876
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,280
There it is.

877
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,960
They're making potato beef.

878
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,000
Their prayers have been answered.

879
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
After a brief hiatus from menus

880
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,560
due to Taco Bell's menu simplification efforts last year,

881
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,800
Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes and the spicy Potato Soft Taco

882
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,360
will be back starting March 11th.

883
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Taco Bell's also teaming up with Beyond Meat

884
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,240
to create an innovative new plant-based protein

885
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,400
that will be tested in the next year.

886
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
Taco Bell chose to team up with Beyond Meat

887
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,160
as a category leader, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

888
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,640
The return of our beloved potatoes

889
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,640
is just the first step in showing our fans.

890
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,400
Oh, you love potatoes so much, huh Mark?

891
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,240
Huh Mark?

892
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,080
Well, it seems like you turned your back on them.

893
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,920
This is Liz Matthews,

894
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,760
Taco Bell's Global Chief Food Innovation Officer.

895
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,600
Dummy.

896
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
You couldn't tell that just from the word choice.

897
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,440
Come on.

898
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,240
This is classic Liz.

899
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,160
Return of our beloved potatoes is just the first step

900
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,680
in showing our fans the strong continued commitment

901
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,880
to vegetarian we're making this year, says Liz Matthews,

902
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,160
Taco Bell's Global Chief Food Innovation Officer.

903
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,640
Hey Liz, weird to talk about your commitment to that

904
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,800
when you were like,

905
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,760
well, let's just not do it for the rest of 2020.

906
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,280
We have had, Travis, it was COVID.

907
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,760
We have long been a leader in the vegetarian space,

908
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
but this year we'll have more meatless options

909
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,600
in the story of the vegetarians, Veggie Curious.

910
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,440
Ooh.

911
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,840
And even meat eaters will love.

912
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,320
Tell me more about this veggie.

913
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,800
Oh, I've heard about these.

914
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,440
Veggie tables?

915
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,280
You say this is a pepper?

916
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,720
Is like a, it's like a crispy green chicken.

917
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,560
I love it.

918
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,400
I love the, do you call it cabbage?

919
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,000
It's like, it's kind of like when I slice up frozen beef

920
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,840
really thin.

921
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,800
Can I have the asparagus?

922
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,200
Two of them?

923
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
I've been curious about these.

924
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,520
I believe it's pronounced tamatis.

925
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,640
Tamatis, is that correct?

926
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,480
Tamatis.

927
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
Isn't that fun?

928
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,160
Prepare the asparagus in the traditional style, I guess.

929
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,560
Excuse me, my hamburger is not done.

930
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
What's that?

931
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,200
This is coleslaw.

932
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,040
Okay.

933
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,200
There's egg on my face.

934
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,720
Do you have eggs by the way?

935
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,600
Okay.

936
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,360
Hey, what's this green shit?

937
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,960
Vegetarian isn't just a trend for Taco Bell.

938
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,040
Yeah, except for that one time

939
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,360
that you fucking blinked in the face of pandemic

940
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,760
and got rid of potatoes.

941
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,960
You are barely doing it already with potatoes.

942
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,920
The brand has had meatless menu items

943
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,760
like the bean burrito for many years.

944
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,880
Fuck off, McDonald's has French fries.

945
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,800
What are you doing?

946
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,600
And it was the first quick service restaurant chain

947
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,000
to partner with the American Vegetarian Association

948
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,680
and currently has over 30 vegetarian ingredients

949
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,880
on the US menu.

950
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,600
That's a weird way of-

951
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,840
There's a lot of vegetarian ingredients

952
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,960
in non-vegetarian meals.

953
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,320
What if Mr. King

954
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,280
only wants to be the potato man from now on?

955
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,600
What if he stops doing public facing?

956
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,720
You're saying we get like-

957
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Well, quarterly profits are down much worse than we thought

958
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,280
and we're gonna have to lay off a lot of,

959
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,280
oh no, I'm always the potato man.

960
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,120
That's interesting to me

961
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,040
because I would have said and wondered

962
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,520
if perhaps he has always been the potato

963
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
and this is the first time it was appropriate

964
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,480
for him to show his face.

965
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,200
Because Justin, you've never brought to us

966
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,720
a video clip from Mr. King before, is that correct?

967
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,800
Well, he did take over CE,

968
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm looking at his LinkedIn page, which is wild.

969
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,520
And he was at Adidas until August 2019.

970
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,200
So he joined, wow, he joined Taco Bell

971
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,640
and he got to taste the potatoes

972
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,120
and then COVID took them fucking away.

973
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,440
He joined, they were like,

974
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,000
listen, Mark, this is gonna be the cushiest gig ever.

975
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,840
We just opened up the potato vault

976
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,200
and people are losing their fucking minds over here.

977
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,360
And as soon as he pulls into the parking lot,

978
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,120
they're like, bad news, Mark,

979
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,240
we had a shit can of potatoes.

980
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
Also, you gotta wear masks now, if you can believe that.

981
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,680
He's been sitting on this character.

982
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,520
Oh yeah, this potato character.

983
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,240
I think a potato in Spanish could be Papa.

984
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
So we could just call him Papa King.

985
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,920
Papa King is here.

986
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,320
Papa King is here to save the day.

987
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,040
He's the new beloved, Mr. Peanut, fuck off.

988
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,720
Eat me, children.

989
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,040
Eat of me, children, I'm the Papa King.

990
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,280
So you can, that's happening in March,

991
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,440
I guess put it on your calendars right now.

992
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,040
Yeah, get there.

993
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,680
I do appreciate how everybody,

994
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,800
I mean, literally this potato vid was out there

995
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,080
for 30 seconds before people were like, alert, alert, alert.

996
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,800
If you go to this tweet, the first like 10 responses

997
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,360
are like, Justin, look quick.

998
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,040
Okay, can I do a Yahoo, please?

999
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,880
Yes, please. Yeah, please.

1000
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,760
Here's one that was sent in by also several people.

1001
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,840
Thank you, it's from Yahoo Answers user Bush, who asks,

1002
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,280
is there a way to revive stale Cheez-Its?

1003
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
I need to fix them to bring to a dinner party tonight.

1004
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,040
Update, no bad taste or nothing,

1005
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,960
just soft like white bread from the staleness.

1006
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
Pfft.

1007
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,560
Soft like white bread from the staleness

1008
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,600
feels like a Macklemore lyric to me.

1009
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,720
Yeah, yeah.

1010
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,960
I need to fix the, fix,

1011
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,280
fix in the sense of not to like fix you up some food,

1012
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,000
but to repair these old Cheez-Its really does it for me.

1013
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
Really, really does it for me.

1014
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,040
Gotta fix them Cheez-Its.

1015
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,520
Can I fix or revive these here stale Cheez-Its?

1016
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,120
Well, you can start with a pep talk.

1017
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,240
Interesting, try to inspire the Cheez-Its.

1018
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,680
Listen, might not do nothing, but it also won't hurt.

1019
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,520
You know what I mean?

1020
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,360
Start there.

1021
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,720
I would say what you don't wanna do

1022
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,520
is start with something that might potentially

1023
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,480
ruin the Cheez-Its more.

1024
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,320
Yeah.

1025
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,600
I think you wanna work up to that, right?

1026
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,640
Yeah, like there's probably a lot of jokesters

1027
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,680
in the audience who like to talk back to our show

1028
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,760
like they're a fourth member of the show

1029
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,600
who are like, dip it in water, duh,

1030
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,240
but that's gonna make it,

1031
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,920
that's gonna get it really sloppy,

1032
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,320
like a sloppy mushy mess.

1033
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,160
I think my first step would be pep talk.

1034
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,360
And then my second step would be like

1035
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,560
200 degrees Fahrenheit in an oven for 10 minutes.

1036
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,360
Oh, so you would just take them into full blown,

1037
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,400
like you're making Cheez-It brittle at that point.

1038
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,320
Well, I would lay them out in a single layer

1039
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,560
as close together as I can.

1040
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,840
I'm trying to get, I mean, they're squares.

1041
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,440
This is how you make, this is like Cheez-It biscotti.

1042
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,040
Yes, exactly.

1043
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,200
Okay.

1044
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
That probably wouldn't work either.

1045
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,360
You could make a hell of a Cheez-It casserole

1046
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,560
I'm thinking now.

1047
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,880
I mean, you could do, I mean, yeah,

1048
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,280
crumbling up the Cheez-Its and using it as a coating

1049
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,840
for some, I don't know, tilapia.

1050
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, okay.

1051
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,880
I was thinking more of like using them

1052
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,160
like one might use lasagna noodles.

1053
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,760
Oh, no, you, okay.

1054
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,080
Well, that's malarkey, Trav.

1055
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,880
You can't just do that. You don't think like layering?

1056
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,640
So it would be like sauce, cheese, Cheez-Its,

1057
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,480
sauce, cheese, Cheez-Its.

1058
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,920
No, it can be like a hat on a green bean casserole,

1059
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,920
but it can't be load bearing Cheez-Its, Jesus Christ.

1060
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,320
I've seen on some life hack videos

1061
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,000
that if you put a piece of bread in with your cookies,

1062
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,480
it'll keep them soft and I'm just not realizing

1063
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,320
we're trying to do the opposite of that.

1064
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Yeah, we'd have to do the opposite.

1065
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,400
So what's the opposite of bread?

1066
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,920
Milk?

1067
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,760
Milk?

1068
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,600
Is milk the opposite of bread?

1069
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,880
Is milk the opposite of bread?

1070
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,720
People don't talk about the opposites of things

1071
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,920
that don't have opposites enough.

1072
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,400
Cause what is the opposite of bread?

1073
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,520
An orange?

1074
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,360
Okay, so it can't be milk

1075
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,400
because milk is like consumable.

1076
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,480
Bread is consumable.

1077
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,880
They're both white, usually.

1078
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,320
Bread is flat and square.

1079
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,080
Orange is round and 3D.

1080
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,960
Consumable by you.

1081
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,800
Baseball then.

1082
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,040
Sponge, sponge, sponge.

1083
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,360
Sponge, same shape.

1084
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,200
Baseball.

1085
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,520
Oh, you want the opposite, well then.

1086
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,440
The opposite of bread.

1087
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,520
The opposite of bread is creation.

1088
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,800
The opposite of bread isn't milk.

1089
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,360
It's creation.

1090
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,200
Woo!

1091
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,720
Bum, bim, bum, bum.

1092
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,760
Right, so bread is,

1093
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm just gonna start listing things that bread is.

1094
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,880
Okay, okay, this is a three-part process.

1095
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm gonna list the things that bread is.

1096
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,120
Okay.

1097
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,680
Travis, you're gonna tell me the opposite of that thing.

1098
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,040
Griffin, you're going to keep track

1099
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,760
of the different descriptors that we have until-

1100
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
Can you just yawn, Griffin?

1101
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,720
Can you just fucking yawn?

1102
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,560
Sorry, guys.

1103
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,400
Sorry, dudes.

1104
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,720
That was a pre-yawn for how boring this is gonna be.

1105
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,040
All right, well fucking, well, you know what then?

1106
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,080
I'm not doing it now.

1107
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,640
So sorry, listeners.

1108
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,880
We were trying to have some fun

1109
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,720
and do science at the same time.

1110
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,000
Let your kids learn something.

1111
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Like what the opposite of bread is?

1112
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,240
Yeah.

1113
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,640
You tell me what's the opposite of bread

1114
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,440
because you have struck out so many times.

1115
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,920
The sun.

1116
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,080
Yeah.

1117
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,520
Hot.

1118
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,960
Oh, you want it to be, bread can be cold.

1119
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,880
What?

1120
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,240
Bread can be cold.

1121
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,400
I will say bread has to be colder.

1122
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,600
That's true.

1123
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,920
Yeah.

1124
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,720
Cold, different shade.

1125
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,800
This is a, guys, it's sliding doors.

1126
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,720
We're getting a glimpse into the alternate reality

1127
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,200
where Justin did get to do his

1128
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,160
what's the opposite of bread game.

1129
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,720
And it's got me fucking busting up

1130
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,040
and my sides are splitting.

1131
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,960
Okay, it's the sun.

1132
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,000
I think it's the sun.

1133
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,360
So just put the sun in with your cheeses.

1134
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,480
Bada bing, bada boom.

1135
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,920
Color-wise, I don't agree with you.

1136
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,800
What kind of dinner party

1137
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,640
can you bring secondhand cheeses to?

1138
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,120
I think, Griffin, at this point,

1139
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,200
if you're going to a dinner party in January of 2021,

1140
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,640
anything, like at this point,

1141
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:00,000
we don't remember what dinner party is.

1142
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,920
That would be a good,

1143
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,360
if you could unload them in like a snack mix

1144
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,480
that you bring to the first party you attend

1145
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,960
once everybody's vaccinated, that would be great.

1146
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,320
Cause it's like, who even cares?

1147
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,800
These are, okay, I do, these are actually very chewy.

1148
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,200
I am not loving it.

1149
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,920
Okay, now I'm thinking about it.

1150
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,440
I can't think of a thing that is more likely

1151
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,440
to get grubby hands all over it than Cheez-It.

1152
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,280
Yeah.

1153
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,440
If you put it out, though, in a party setting,

1154
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,360
you are like, okay, if I eat something at a party

1155
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,360
and it's like stale or cold or too chewy,

1156
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,000
I just assume like, oh, this has been out a little long.

1157
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,600
I should have hit this up earlier.

1158
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,760
So, you know what I mean?

1159
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,800
Like, I don't know, they're crispy

1160
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,840
when I put them in the bowl.

1161
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,360
What's wrong with your bowl?

1162
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,440
Oh, so you're saying you can sort of launder the Cheez-Its.

1163
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,880
Hey, did you give me a wet bowl?

1164
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,240
Exactly, exactly, you launder the Cheez-Its.

1165
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,680
You put one sandwich bag full of Cheez-Its

1166
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,800
in everybody's pockets

1167
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,440
after they leave their coats on the bed.

1168
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,760
This bowl has some kind of time weirdness.

1169
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,480
It made my Cheez-Its get old.

1170
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,920
I think we can all agree.

1171
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,720
Is this one of those weird time bowls?

1172
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,040
Best case scenario, someone else brings a box of Cheez-Its

1173
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,720
and after they've dumped theirs in a bowl,

1174
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,640
you dump yours in a bowl and you kind of mix them together.

1175
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,680
So at that point, we were like,

1176
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,160
I think something's wrong with these Cheez-Its,

1177
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,360
but I also think something's not wrong with these Cheez-Its.

1178
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,920
I think something is wrong

1179
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,360
with some of these quantum Cheez-Its

1180
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,320
because some are good and some are bad.

1181
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,760
Is it possible for half of a box of Cheez-Its

1182
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,560
to go stale while the other half stays primo?

1183
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,440
Is that any, is that anything?

1184
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,160
You try these and you tell me I'm being silly, Derek.

1185
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,040
I don't want to have this fight again.

1186
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,200
Would the moisture redistribute

1187
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,800
make all of the Cheez-Its kind of stale?

1188
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,000
Would it work that way?

1189
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,720
Maybe they, oh, they didn't turn their box.

1190
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,960
You gotta turn your box.

1191
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,760
You gotta rotate the box halfway through the half.

1192
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,920
Something's wrong with my Cheez-Its.

1193
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,440
How long did you leave them in the sun for?

1194
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,280
I didn't.

1195
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,880
Well, you gotta, I mean, you gotta sun dry your Cheez-Its.

1196
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,920
Hey guys.

1197
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,760
Yeah?

1198
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,520
I would fucking ruin some Cheez-Its right now.

1199
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,360
It's all I'm thinking about.

1200
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,200
Oh my God, I'm so hungry for Cheez-Its.

1201
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,960
I've been thinking about white cheddar Cheez-Its

1202
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,040
for the past like three minutes

1203
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,120
and I actually have noticed that I am shaking.

1204
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,480
I am, I am, like my body is noticeably shaking.

1205
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,960
Well, folks, that is our cue.

1206
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,800
You know what?

1207
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,160
I would call it quivering.

1208
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,360
That is how badly I want these white cheddar Cheez-Its.

1209
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
That is our cue to stop doing podcasts

1210
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,360
and to release you back into the wild.

1211
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,480
We have tagged you.

1212
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,520
Now we're opening the door

1213
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,520
and you may once again roam free with the rest of your kind.

1214
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,960
Thank you so much for joining us.

1215
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,360
We very much appreciate you.

1216
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,680
Hey, if I could ask you, we're writing a podcast book.

1217
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,000
It's called, Everybody Has a Podcast Except You.

1218
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,480
You can find it at bit.ly forward slash,

1219
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,880
what, McElroy podcast book?

1220
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,200
Yeah, that's right.

1221
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,160
If you go pre-order that, it would really help us out

1222
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,840
and you could get it.

1223
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,120
There's lots of different places you can get it.

1224
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,040
I recommend, if I may, Justin,

1225
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,080
bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book event.

1226
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,480
You can find links to six independent bookstores

1227
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,760
and event info for our free virtual event

1228
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,920
that is happening next week on January 26th at 9 p.m.

1229
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,080
It is completely free.

1230
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,680
The event is.

1231
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,800
And if you pre-order

1232
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,480
from one of those independent bookstores,

1233
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,840
you get a signed copy from one of us.

1234
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,560
You get a book plate that's signed by one of us

1235
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,840
that you can put in your book.

1236
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,680
It's pretty cool.

1237
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,520
Cool.

1238
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,680
We got a new pin of the month.

1239
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,200
It's a Cerberus pin of the month,

1240
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,960
and it's a doggy with all of our faces on it.

1241
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,120
A reference to maybe our deepest cut reference

1242
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,680
of a live episode of The Adventure Zone Amnesty,

1243
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,280
which is a very good episode if you haven't heard it.

1244
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,440
But also all the proceeds are going to benefit Gnar All,

1245
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,080
which fights for access

1246
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,280
to abortion care, birth control, paid parental leaves,

1247
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,880
and protections from pregnancy discrimination.

1248
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,640
That pin designed by Zachary Sterling.

1249
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,480
Yes, thank you, Zach.

1250
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,360
We also have our Knights Templar II sticker

1251
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,600
designed by Tyler Reed up there

1252
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,920
and a bunch of other stuff, mackraymerch.com.

1253
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,520
And also pre-order the next Taz book, Crystal Kingdom.

1254
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,320
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com.

1255
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,600
Comes out July 13th, 2021, but don't wait.

1256
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,440
Get on it now.

1257
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,720
Also, and this is just a personal one for me,

1258
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,200
go check out The Besties.

1259
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,280
It's available on like every podcast channel.

1260
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,800
Oh, we don't make money on it anymore.

1261
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,640
So we don't actually-

1262
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,480
Yeah, so I don't care if you don't buy it.

1263
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,400
No, but I want you to-

1264
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,320
But it isn't exclusive to Spotify anymore.

1265
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,400
I want everyone to check it out

1266
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,240
because I love it very much.

1267
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,760
Actually, also this latest episode,

1268
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,720
we talk about Cyberpunk with Ron Funches

1269
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,280
and it's a fucking banger.

1270
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,600
Oh man, really?

1271
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,560
Yeah, it's a good episode.

1272
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,720
Oh boy, I'm excited about that.

1273
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720

1276
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,760
Do you want to find Yahoo?

1277
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,600
At least it's finding Yahoo.

1278
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,880
It was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

1279
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,720
Thank you, Graham.

1280
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,640
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1281
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,040
They're anonymous.

1282
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,040
So I'm going to call them also,

1283
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,380
Papa King asks,

1284
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,240
would Cam the Dancer, if he spend too fast,

1285
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,080
create the tornado?

1286
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,760
My name is Justin McElroy.

1287
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1288
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1289
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,200
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1290
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,600
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1291
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,640
Okay, that was the show.

1292
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,600
Hope you had some fun.

1293
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1294
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,640
Go back into the world, face the day ahead.

1295
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,920
Please don't tell our grandparents

1296
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,760
