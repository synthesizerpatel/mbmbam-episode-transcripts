1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,800
I never realized how much flossing looks like repeatedly stabbing yourself in the butt and

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:58,160
crotch. Oh my god. Yeah, you're the one who chose to floss furiously. No one, I just said do a dance.

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,320
You flossed so hard. I dislocated every bone in my body. Holy shit. You flossed really hard.

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,240
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era.

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,880
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,120
I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,000
And what a thrill it is to be here in Cleveland.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,320
Oh you've heard of it. We are here and we are so grateful to those of you that bought tickets to

13
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,600
make the long journey out. There's like 2,000 of you. This is our community theater production

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,320
that just our dad's friends. Thanks for giving us a chance. This is this grassroots live show.

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,640
We want you, but there's that and also our families are still at Great Wolf Lodge in Cincinnati so

16
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:13,040
it's gonna get nasty tonight. We talked about it and we, this is gonna, we want it to be a vile

17
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,160
show. What we want from this show is you know a lot of your friends maybe didn't want to come

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,440
because they don't like us and they think we're like smelly or whatever or like terrible or not

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,280
funny or whatever and um wait we want you to go back to them and and be like you missed.

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Well I won't say missed. It was vile. You made the right choice in not coming because it was

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,200
it was profane. We've we've had to not publish a lot of live shows due to like technical sound

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,720
issues. Or Star Wars issues. Or Star Wars issues. Star Wars centric issues. This one might just be

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,000
too hot for TV. Yeah sure. And if this one goes up it'll be 10 minutes long. Not that they let us on

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
TV anymore. No not anymore. I mean technically unless you had some way to connect your streaming

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,080
device to a TV we weren't allowed on TV in the first place. That's fair that's fair but anyway

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,200
we are here. We do advice. We're brothers. We're nasty. We're nasty. No we're not. We're nasty.

27
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,240
We're three top tier nasty boys. We're nasty middle-aged men. Okay that's way worse. That's

28
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,920
so much worse. So much worse. No listen we're three nasty middle-aged men that bring their dad

29
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,280
with them everywhere. We're nasty. We're three dads who hang three nasty dads who hang out with

30
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,120
their nasty dads. Who hang out with their nastier dad. With two musician nasty dads who opened for

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,920
us. Listen we're just a big group of nasty dads traveling the country in a band. I thought that

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,960
me breaking both my arms before the show started was a bad energy. This is making it actually way

33
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,960
worse. I love this energy. Get comfortable here in the kingdom of the profane where we reign supreme.

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,440
Y'all about to get slimed. It's gonna be. We're gonna say nasty words. All right let's fucking do

35
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,880
the show. I'm tired of this. Traveling concepts. Confrontational ideas. Mature situations. Adult

36
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:13,840
situations. Cartoon violence. Cartoon violence. Mild drug use. Anyway it's a strong language.

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,520
It's an advice show. I decided to apply for a part-time job. One job that came up was for

38
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,200
a paranormal investigation group. I jokingly sent an application and I received a phone call from

39
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,840
the group because they want me on the team. Here lies the problem. I'm beyond terrified of the dark

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,760
even though I'm an adult. Holy shit this question has now taken two turns. Yes. It is almost back

41
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:46,400
where it started. I made up an excuse that I wasn't able to go to the interview and they stated that

42
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,600
they still really want me on the team and I need to give them a call when I'm available to do the

43
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
interview. How do I get out of this mess? I don't want to hurt anyone and I don't want to be haunted

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,480
and that's from I ain't afraid of no ghost. Wait. Yes I am. Are you are you here? Are you here? Are

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,080
you present? I'm sorry. All right thank you. Okay let me just. First off let me say I'm sorry about

46
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,280
how dark it is out there. Are you cool? Yeah it's quite dark. Just look at us. It's bright up here.

47
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,720
Imagine being us. I would also say two things. Thank you for. Thank you so much for writing

48
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,800
questions but uh thing one you didn't jokingly submit a resume. It takes a lot of work. That

49
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,600
takes a lot of work. You were like ha ha ha click like you typed out a thing and secondly how good

50
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,920
is that resume and what do you have on it that these paranormal investigators like this is

51
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,800
everything we've been looking for. I was an assistant assistant manager at Toys R Us before

52
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:52,000
it shut down. I was a safety associate at Best Buy and also I'm an esper who can see. I would be

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
concerned about any job where the exchange is hey we want you come for interview. I'm not gonna

54
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,160
fucking do that. No please. We really need people by which I mean bodies by which I mean vessels.

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Did I say vessels? Damn um have you thought okay here's what you do okay you go to the interview

56
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,200
on pins and needles and you say okay here's the only thing I kind of focus on day ghosts okay

57
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,760
and then if they're like what day ghosts then you say what you think ghosts only come out at night

58
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,760
that's ridiculous and racist yeah I catch when the ghostbusters catch their nighttime ghosts

59
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,320
and they bring them home and then those ghosts escape from captivity while they're on the road

60
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,520
and have nowhere to haunt sun comes up what are they gonna do call a fucking uber no no they're

61
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,600
still just ghosts are always there where do they go during the day thank you yes someone's saying

62
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,280
yes this isn't a joke this is a this is my thesis yeah um I I think that there's a pretty easy

63
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,880
solution is you go in you do the interview crush it of course you're already halfway you're in

64
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,240
you're in once someone says we really need you they can't play hardball with you so you go you

65
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
do the interview and as you're standing up and you're about to sign the huge novelty signing

66
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,120
bonus they have for you a huge novelty check you say I just want one more thing I am a ghost

67
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,040
and then see how they handle that because they can't prove you're not right can't prove a

68
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,360
negative can't prove a negative can't prove you're not a ghost and they can't say like there's no

69
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,880
such thing as ghost oh god damn it you are going to need to phase through the door instead of

70
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,600
opening that will be and I have a wiki how article for you that's really going to help you out with

71
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,760

77
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,440
a horse what's what's the best way to surprise someone with a horse and what's the best time

78
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:49,760
to do it after dinner or early in the morning why are those the only two options yeah uh this

79
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,800
doesn't seem relevant but btw we don't have a barn and aren't going to keep our horse at our house

80
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,800
this is just sort of a woods a woods horse that comes back and it knows it's needed that is that

81
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,440
is like if I surprised my child with a bike and said now I'm going to put this bike inconveniently

82
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,040
away yeah this bike will actually be across town this one's going to be in the basement at church

83
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,800
it is it's kind of like speed once you get the horse you can't stop with it anywhere you have

84
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,680
nowhere to stop with a horse you have to keep moving okay it's like a chocobo it'll run away

85
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,160
as soon as you get off of it so before breakfast or after dinner and no time in between do it yeah

posters okay but i'm worried my family will view me as immature yep if i put them up

147
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,080
it's bad enough i didn't have a job right out of school and i had to move back in here

148
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,080
should i go ahead and put these away or follow my bliss i that's from poster fiend in philly

152
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:28,080
a poster of scarface that's now that's a bad a lot of people have that it's like a cool yeah

153
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,000
it's like the world is yours and it says it on there and people come over like this is tommy

154
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,360
montana i haven't seen the movie this is a this poster is a reminder for me to see the movie

155
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,240
i wrote on the wall above it to do and then i put a colon and then i put the poster from

156
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,800
scarface i didn't frame it or anything i just kind of duct taped it up there i'll just i know

157
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:58,640
two things it's big gun and this dude loves confectioner's sugar i think yeah he eats piles

158
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,560
of it um i say i say you put the anime posters up and then when your parents come in the room

159
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,880
you're wearing like a really cool smoking jacket yeah maybe you have like a cool mustache and a

160
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,880
pipe and you explain to them the artistic values and then if they're like that seems immature then

161
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,000
you say you don't get it and then blow smoke directly right in their face it's time for you

162
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,160
to elevate anime maybe a nice frame is so important and some down lighting oh yes some museum quality

163
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,360
frame maybe like a station with a velvet rope museum quality framing is huge yes because that

164
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,800
is art that elevates anime to art yeah and i think that that would be put a little stuff up here put

165
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,240
a little plate next to it that says like you know printing on paper with the artist's name and maybe

166
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,520
the piece title and the year that it came out and then just stand in front of it like can you two

167
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,640
not name any anime other than dragon ball z yuri on ice that doesn't count

168
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,600
i know you name any anime i've not joked about on a stage with you before gun gundam

169
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,920
all right attack on titan okay paul was talking about that backstage also doesn't count wait hold

170
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:23,840
on battle angel elita there's one where little kids are detective that's the adventure zone

171
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:33,200
it doesn't count okay let me say this let me say this i'm all for this right but that's a lot of

172
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,760
posters and you can put up too many posters you can do poster overkill but you can repurpose them

173
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,240
i mean i was sometimes on queer either like i don't want to throw out my dad's old clothes

174
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,480
and then they come back and bobby's like i made it into a quilt and then they have to be like

175
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,800
oh good because i i for sure didn't like them in clothes form bobby that's not overstepping

176
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:05,840
at all pal anyway make a quilt out of your anime posters make a quilt out of your dad's anime

177

184
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,320

188
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,920

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,160
hypoallergenic and top quality material the thread count is oh off the charts right it's just one big

this or any other audience if we ever ask for a question if we ever ask for advice if it's we

213
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,800

bedroom like this fucking guy's still here justin marmaduke fuck that wasn't an option

216
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,160
i think outside the box uh i decided to apply for a part-time job one job that came oh i got that one

217
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,320
i work children's birthday parties take another pass i think we could one more again i work

218
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,520
children's birthday parties at a local family fun center as it is known a big part of my job

219
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,640
is doing magic tricks for the kids here's my issue i absolutely suck at doing magic tricks

220
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,320
i've been doing working this job for almost two years and my boss thinks i'm great at it

221
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,640
i managed to convince her i'm really good by pure luck even every time i do a party though

222
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,960
the kids are unimpressed and often see right through my tricks they'll literally shout out

223
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,760
how i'm doing the trick it's frustrating and embarrassing what do i do and that's from

224
00:24:49,760 --> 00:25:01,360
mediocre magician in cleveland are you are you here all right

225

whoa a thousand doves just flew onto the stage whoa thank you they're all on fire oh shit i

226
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,920
cannot think of anything more demoralizing than having an eight-year-old just yell out like

227
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:22,720
the balls under your armpit dumb ass i mean okay maybe try theming it for something the kids like

228
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:31,840
like fortnight just like i you put it instead of a bunny rabbit and just rename it their favorite

229
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,800
fortnight stars are you literally reaching what's inside the hat and then it's your phone and you're

230
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,960
like your favorite guys just streaming just watch this for 20 minutes i'm gonna sit in silence and

231
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:54,000
smoke cigarettes while you kids enjoy this fortnight video um maybe work on your pattern

232
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400

233
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,320
the tricks are either like really basic or sometimes even really bad but then it's actually

234
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,080
about like the comedy they do yeah you could do that and just like full on dunk on the birthday

254
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,280
than jokes um i mean i just want to know how they cheated yeah i mean uh i know how they did it

255
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:39,840
the worst hey i got a yahoo okay perfect cool uh this one's from adrian cowles thank you adrian

256
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:49,600
it's uh it's an anonymous yahoo answers user i'm gonna call uh adonis asks should scientists

257
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,720
give octopi bones

258
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,280
and a lot of other podcasts a lot of other podcasts would turn and just run away from

259
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:22,160
a question like that five words each one so vitally essential should scientists give octopi

260
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,960
bones i will say that the word that most troubles me in there and if i have to pick one is give

261
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,880
because that makes it sound like you would hand the octopi bones and they would just absorb them

262
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,480
in oh thank you finally someone gave us bones travis it's up to the scientists to figure out

263
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,960
how to give the bones to the octopi i think the problem would be that's why they're scientists

264
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,840
if if you did this i think that the it would be really hard for the octopus to walk

265
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,720
because its legs would now just be locked in a straight position and it'd be like like a tripod

266
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,680
it doesn't have to be one bone per leg travis your imagination has failed you make me so

267
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,520
fucking mad sometimes i mean again with this shit even if it's every fucking show you give it like

268
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,600
a like a human and it's two bones with knees two bones that's still gonna be hard to walk

269
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,120
i think that it would be a lot of bones in each one how many eight

270
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:34,240
eight so it would have seven knees no not every joints and knee you dullard so it would have

271
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,600
knuckle oh wait now hold on are the legs the fingers there's 50 bones in one big skull and

272
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,480
think about that last one for a second because that's the worst fucked up bone of all the last

273
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,800
thing yeah what if they give him the skull no that's just attractive squidward never mind listen

274
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:58,880
my fear is this we give the octopi bones we're loving it we we don't i don't know how to the

275
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,640
scientists are gonna do this i just give them boats at first they're not crazy about it right

276
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,400
they don't love it their pants don't fit they can't squish through little holes they can't

277
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,720
squish through little holes oh no my door's only this big gig into my ding-dang house now they're

278
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,600
mad at us but they do have bones oh no my fear is this you give an octopi bones and they'll

279
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,800
want a glass of milk eventually they're gonna eventually they're gonna look up from the

280
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,360
beautiful briny shimmery shiny sea yeah they're gonna look up on land and they're gonna say

424
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,080
of a board game that says like for 50 years old and older uh not a board game but golf golf yeah

425
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,360
yeah okay i'm pretty sure that you just came up so you love magic the gathering and you came up

426
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,720
to drag golf is that what we're doing okay good oh 100 okay good good it might not be magic the

427
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,040
gathering that's the only thing keeping you separate from 50 year olds they might also be

428
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:50,320
your junkie okay um but my question is uh how do i uh make that sound cool

429
00:47:50,320 --> 00:48:00,080
oh my passion is cards oh do you play do you play cards i've been known to get down to vegas

430
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:06,400
from time to time okay okay would you say that this is the end of our conversation yeah i would

431
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:13,120
excellent this has gone very well here's a great option lie you could lie what are you into i love

432
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:20,720
football i also love football excellent who's your team though the plane walkers is that a

433
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:28,480
no here here's the thing real world real the thing is is like a lot of people have um hobbies that

434
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,960
when they first started out like hundreds of years ago or whatever were all so weird and the key is

435
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,520
now when you say it like i play magic the gathering don't explain it they don't if they said like i

436
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,000
love to play golf they wouldn't sit there like but golf's fun it's cool you know like they wouldn't

437
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,600
explain that's a dumb thing to say though because everybody knows that golf is yeah

438
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,120
that would be ridiculous imagine that fucking thing you just said with your own mouth here on

439
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,520
stage like i play golf it's um have you ever seen a very small white ball yeah but that's what i'm

440
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,280
saying if you say like i played a magic the gathering for fun and they're like what's that

441
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,200
i'm like oh you don't know um and then with that tiny phrase oh you don't know you've just gained

442
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,280
dominance in this situation oh yeah oh you don't know okay uh and then you explain it to them well

443
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,880
i got a starter deck for you to borrow let's just uh let's just throw down right now and see now you

444
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,800
got them whoa and then if they beat you they're a natural and you take them on tour and you milk

445
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:30,480
them for everything that's your bobby fisher right there yeah uh you could say oh well uh i play yugioh

446
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,160
and they're like what you're like just kidding i play magic and they're like oh thank god

447
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:42,880

448
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,520

449
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,880

454
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:19,040

500
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,200
is incapable of not telling the employees that i'm a vegetarian okay unprompted yeah

501
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,880
have we not gotten vegetarian jerky yet it seems like we would have gotten there yeah it's called

502
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,320
kale chips portobello mushrooms that's not bad they do not sell it at the beef jerky stores at

505
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,120
unload on me so i've had to stop going into beef jerky stores with him because he goes into this

506
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:21,680
fugue state right he can't help himself like half and i've asked him like why did you nobody

my hard crispy tooth-breaking beef but you you can eat jerky right except jerky though right

511
00:56:50,320 --> 00:57:00,720

515
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,400
watching you cover your ears cover them for real the real question is how do you get back

516
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,040
and the answer is you take him to whole foods and you're like this one has tasted the flesh of the cow

517
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,200
and then someone's gonna fucking kill him

518
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:47,520
so you're gonna have to find a new path for yourself yeah now listen it's gonna get real

519
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,000
messy after that you're gonna have to change your name probably move get a new job part of

520
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,240
your journey though respect the journey you got it it's part of your journey and your new identity

521
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,480
might eat meat yeah and it's gonna be a cover yeah they'll never suspect if you're gonna start

522
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:09,360
don't start with jerky holy shit no it makes a bad first meat impression some meat is wet

523
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:19,120
and that's okay that's a griffin mackerel guarantee does that help extremely excellent thank you

524
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:28,560
hello hello how's it going i'm good how are you good good thank you for asking so uh some kids

525
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,400
moved in next door which is fine i guess it's not what's your name stephen by the way stephen hey

526
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,160
so um i have like a pretty tall fence and you can't really see through it from my dog

527
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,720
um and i can't normally see the kids which is a good thing but then they got a trampoline

528
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,160
and now they keep jumping on it and they keep staring at me when they jump

529
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,280
yeah yeah and it looks like michael meyers isn't the george lopez theme song okay

530
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,360
it's a beautiful mental image you've painted for me steven

531
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:10,880
um are you asking us to help you sell your house how do i feel peace of mind in my own home um

532
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,000
see i want to i want to take it it wasn't seaman yes okay um i want to take you back to the first

533
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,080
thing she said which was some kids moved in next door which is amazing this idea that a bunch of

534
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,360
blank checks we got a camp nowhere situation we got a real camp nowhere situation a bunch of kids

535
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:33,840
just moved in and bought a house together i also really like when you said that you had

536
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,680
a fence you couldn't see through for your dog which i imagine your dog just is really private

537
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,840
like this space it's uh it's the taco bell dog we don't want paparazzi

538
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,640
um could you next time they go out to trampoline you're already on their trampoline

539
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:57,520
yeah wait wait your turn idiots i'm having fun up here this is how adults do it and you're smoking

540
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,200
you'll never see that coming and you always put it out on the trampoline

541
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:11,760
and maybe lower your backyard so no matter how high they get they still can't cavernous cavernous

542
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,000
very good raise your fences build an extension on the trampoline side just right in front of

543
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:27,040
the trampoline goes up another eight feet nothing maybe seal their trampoline and burn it no come

544
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:34,960
on it's not even a joke can you somehow and i'm i'm not a scientist i'll be i'd be putting bones

545
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,640
and fish and stuff but if i was a scientist i could tell you some way to weaken the springs

546
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,160
just to affect the height not enough to hurt the kids not enough to hurt the kids lawyers when they

547
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:53,840
jump on it it just goes lower and then doesn't raise back up that's a net so you're talking about

548
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:59,680
a huge round hammock kids would love that they'll appreciate it when they're in their 30s and they

549
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,400
need a license to chill that's true they'll appreciate that giant round hammock that steven

550
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,760
made for them steven i have one very good piece of advice but it depends on if you have one

551
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,000
particular item and it may be uncomfortable uncomfortable for you to tell me whether or

552
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,640
not you own this item is that okay okay do you own a baba duke costume

553

554
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,760
the problem there is if i jumped and i saw my neighbor like my neighbor was baba dude i'd want

555
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,680
to like i gotta double check this maybe try they jump over they see yours in your backyard doing

556
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:50,400
your taxes really frustrated and they're like oh they go down below the fence and they come back

557
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,280
up your baba dude they come back down they come back up you're doing your taxes oh yeah i like

558
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,800
that yeah it's like muscle confusion but for kids it's just kid confusion it's regular kid confusion

559
