1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:50,320
Hello everybody. As you can tell from the jingle bell noises, the Griffin has edited

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,920
into the show. It's jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle jingle.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,400
That's the word jingle said over and over again.

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,800
It's onomatopoetic. Candle Nights has possibly begun,

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,160
or maybe it hasn't. My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,320
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother.

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,600
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and Justin, you bring up a great point.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,520
We are in the phase of Candle Nights where the holiday is part of sort of a quantum state

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,440
where you're not really sure if it's crack-a-lack. Griffin, that's exactly what I was thinking.

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,960
Yeah, like if you're observing it, it exists, but right now I don't see it anywhere.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,160
I don't see it in my heart or the hearts of my fellow men and women.

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
This is the thing about Candle Nights that is so important.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,840
A lot of people ask us, when does it start? I don't know.

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,000
That's the thing. The magical thing is it starts at different times for literally

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
every single human being.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Someday you're just gonna be walking down the street and you'll see

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,080
like two people very much in love or smelling some roasted nuts in the air.

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,480
Yeah.

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,200
And you'll think, it has begun. This is the season.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
Last summer I saw Guardians of the Galaxy in theater and I was like,

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,920
oh shit, early Candle Nights for me. And I had to celebrate it for like six months.

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,400
It was exhausting.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm pretty sure Candle Nights is a serious medical condition.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,800
If you or someone you love has Candle Nights for more than four months,

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,320
you should consult a doctor.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,160
I did. I did. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, they just, they were all-

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
They were up in the mix.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,360
They instilled it inside of me. They birthed the seed from my-

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
What about Rocket Cooper?

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,960
Yes, him too.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,840
The problem with a lot of holidays is like, is it too early to start doing X?

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,400
But with Candle Nights, that doesn't exist because it's,

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
whatever you feel in your heart is a-

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,440
Justin, you shouldn't do X to see at holidays.

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,680
Yes.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,040
What?

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,760
Yes, you should.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,600
You should do X to see at holidays.

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,720
Right. That's true. I should roll Molly every school.

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,720
They've made it a sweet honeypot of sensory experiences

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,320
with all those twinkly lights and jingly bells and sweet savory treats.

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,600
There's a, it is a pansexual, panreligious,

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,920
or is it panreligious, pansexual? That's the order.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,880
Whatever, whatever it is.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,360
It's a panreligious, pansexual, personal pan holiday,

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
and there are no rules. It is just right.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
That's the other thing about Candle Nights.

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
You start celebrating whenever you want.

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
Is Santa in it? You know he is.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
Does it got some menorahs? It does indeed.

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:14,880
Yep.

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,920
Does it got that Chevy wine?

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,240
Last night I went to a Hanukkah party

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,680
and I got chorned on that Chevy wine, damn.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,600
Here's the thing, here's the great thing about Candle Nights

60
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,560
is that it is also Hanukkah and Christmas.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,200
It absorbs all other holidays into itself.

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,040
And winter solstice and Kwanzaa and there's probably others.

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Speaking of Candle Nights giving, by the way,

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
we did this thing last year called NBNBM Angels

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
where people helped out some less fortunate families

66
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,160
in the Huntington, West Virginia area

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,680
where we are all hailing from.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
I am gonna, I've got the list

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
and I'm gonna be spooling that back up today

70
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
if you wanna get into it. Hell yeah.

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
Last year, do you guys remember what we did last?

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
We said like thank, yeah, if you helped out,

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
we recorded thank yous to you.

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,920
And I think we do that again, like let's just do it.

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,400
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Commit to it right now on the show.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,760
So if you go to our Facebook group,

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,800
we'll hammer out the details there

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,080
and tell you all the particulars,

80
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,680
but we're gonna save an entire town,

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
save Christmas for an entire city

82
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,680
and who else could say that besides the Grinch?

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
I think Ernest.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Ernest does, okay, I have a question

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,840
because I'm not gonna watch it.

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
Is Ernest Save Christmas the one where he gets the superpowers?

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,640
Well, okay.

88
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,160
No, that's Ernest goes to jail and gets.

89
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
Well, that's where he gets the electric powers.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I think in Ernest gets stupid, he gets powers.

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,960
God.

92
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
I think he gets powers in a lot.

93
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,040
Ernest goes to camp and then he cries by a window.

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
Is he like rogue?

95
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,480
Does he just, does he get new superpowers

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
every installment of his?

97
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
Guys, I watched a holiday movie the other day

98
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
called Mixed Nuts starring Steve Martin.

99
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh boy, that's a little bit of a dark one for.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,040
Yeah, I was told it was gonna put me in the holiday spirit

101
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,120
and it gave me negative holiday spirit points.

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,560
Why is that?

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
It detracted from my sum total.

104
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
I don't know, I think it has something to do with the fact

105
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,200
that it's all about a suicide hotline

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
and then at one point in the movie,

107
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
they just merc Gary Shandling.

108
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
They just killed Gary Shandling.

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
They no scope Gary Shandling.

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
They do, they no scope 360, no scope Gary Shandling

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
and then like two people have sex

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
like literally two and a half minutes after

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,240
they no scope Gary Shandling and it's like cool movie.

114
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
Come here Santa Claus, I'm ready for you now.

115
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
And they camped Shandling's respawn.

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
So that's, oh God, it just gets gross.

117
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
They troll the respawn Shandling.

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,480
Let's do some questions.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,760
Yeah, let's help some people.

120
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,240
I think we're, I'm ready to get on it.

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,440
All right, here's our first question.

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,480
As my dad gets closer and closer to retirement,

123
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
it's become obvious to his children

124
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
that he doesn't have any hobbies.

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,760
What's more is my mom seems to get a bit annoyed with him

126
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,080
when he works from home and has free time.

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
Can you guys think of any good hobby ideas

128
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,760
for a spreadsheet loving math nerd like my dad?

129
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
My dad is dull in Durham.

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
Oh, that's the inner name.

131
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
They're not just like stating their dad's dull.

132
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,840
My dad's dull.

133
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,440
Additional information if needed, I should say so.

134
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,080
He is an actuarial consultant.

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
Don't know what it is, can't say it.

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
He's an actual consultant.

137
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
He played the trumpet in high school.

138
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,840
He's cheap and I don't think he has the patience

139
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
to build model ships.

140
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,400
I like the last one because it's like,

141
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,480
I know what you guys are about to say.

142
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,800
Let me cut you off before you say it.

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
Before you say model ships, model ships is out.

144
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,240
That's right out.

145
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay, what if he loves spreadsheets, right?

146
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
Statistics, what if he starts statistically

147
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,360
like quantifying really like unimportant things?

148
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,760
If he was like, if you look at my bar graph,

149
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,160
this is how many times that bird landed

150
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
on our air conditioner.

151
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,120
So you want him to go insane.

152
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,880
You wanna make this person's dad become an insane dad.

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
Check out my insane dad.

154
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
Maybe he could use statistics and numbers

155
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,000
to find out what the most pleasurable hobby for him would be

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,960
and that's his hobby.

157
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,440
I like that a lot.

158
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,000
And then he dies.

159
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,400
It's canoes.

160
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,640
No, I spent too long cracking the canoe code.

161
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,760
He starts by paint my numbers and he sees like,

162
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,680
well, that would be less satisfying,

163
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
but it would be good time spent,

164
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
but there's a lot of cleanup.

165
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
So I'm wasting minutes there.

166
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,840
That's not the most efficient way

167
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
for me to spend my retirement.

168
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
So then maybe he'll put a four next to that

169
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
on the spreadsheet.

170
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,240
Wait, out of what?

171
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,760
A thousand.

172
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
He hates paying my numbers.

173
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,680
Yeah, one of the worst hobbies you can have.

174
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,760
Can you just make a hobby out of maybe

175
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,800
just following this spreadsheet thread,

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
just put every number into a spreadsheet

177
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,840
and just every day,

178
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
like maybe you put in like a bunch more numbers.

179
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,000
Good work today.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
I did four through 10.

181
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,320
Yeah.

182
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,240
Well, hopefully you could do more numbers.

183
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,920
He doesn't say he's good at it.

184
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,640
Okay.

185
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,280
It's a good point.

186
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
He would get better eventually,

187
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
but yeah, Trav, I guess starting now.

188
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Could he use statistics and his actuarial knowledge

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
to be an elderly crime solver?

190
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,000
Or like murder she wrote,

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
but it'll be like murder she mathed.

192
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
I don't think there's anything there.

193
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,400
No, I don't.

194
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,120
You know, when you take crime statistics

195
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,320
and then you find like a murderer.

196
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,680
Yeah, I don't know how to use Excel,

197
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,280
but I'm pretty sure you can't just put like gun

198
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,200
and then under that blood splatter

199
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
and then under that.

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,520
Sulfur X.

201
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,160
Sulfur.

202
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
Well, under that, just like Mark and his wife

203
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
were having trouble.

204
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
And then you highlight all of that

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
and you click resolve

206
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,920
and it's like definitely Mark is the killer.

207
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,720
I didn't watch it,

208
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
but isn't this what the show numbers was actually about?

209
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
Like, isn't this what the plot of numbers

210
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,280
that you're describing, Travis?

211
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,120
Except in my show,

212
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
it's shot from the perspective of Judd Hirsch.

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
For my show, it's shot from the perspective of the numbers.

214
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
Seven, eight, nine.

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,400
What are they thinking?

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,120
13.

217
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Well, that's a rough burden to bear.

218
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
What does he do in his off time

219
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
when he's not being a number

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,320
and representing a concrete amount of things?

221
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
The trumpet in high school, I think,

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
unless he got so good at trumpet

223
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,800
that he was like,

224
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
well, I've mastered this.

225
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,480
Gotta put this down.

226
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,920
No need to continue playing trumpet.

227
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,520
Kind of how like Louis Armstrong was like,

228
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,520
I beat trumpets.

229
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,560
I finished it.

230
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
Anybody have anything else for me to play?

231
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
Maybe you wanna get him in like,

232
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
okay, you've got your model trains, right?

233
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,760
You've got your whittling.

234
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
Maybe you wanna get him into something

235
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,080
that's so like non sequitur old man hobby.

236
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,640
Like what if he gets really into like being a house DJ?

237
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,320
Fuck yeah.

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,080
This is my dad.

239
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,520
We're going wakeboarding later.

240
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,440
Yeah, something where it's just like,

241
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
oh yeah, listen, we don't want you to be sedentary.

242
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
We want something that'll get you out there.

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
Now you're like an extreme mountain biker.

244
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
We're taking you to the burn, dad.

245
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,680
Hey dad, we're going to the burn.

246
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,280
Did you see my dad's Red Bull stunt reel?

247
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,400
It's blowing up on YouTube.

248
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,720
Did you hear my dad got to deal with bird house?

249
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,840
My dad's amazing.

250
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
He's a skate king.

251
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
He's king of skate.

252
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
He's king of skate.

253
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,280
This is how cool my dad is that he has things.

254
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,080
He has names and titles and I don't even know about him.

255
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,120
He's too elite for me.

256
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,280
This is my elite dad.

257
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,800
I need to go to the video game store.

258
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,600
I'm going to buy Mark's Dad Pro Skater 5.

259
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
I got cheat codes for Mark's Dad Pro Skater 5.

260
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
I can do a 900, easy.

261
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,120
When they put the Spider Dad into Mark's Dad Pro Skater 5,

262
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
I was like, it's a little much.

263
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,520
But when they had Dad Maul in there, that was better.

264
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,720
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

265
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,800
Do you remember when Dad Margera was the star

266
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,240
of Mark's Dad Pro Skater Underground?

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,440
Of the hit TV show, Jack Dad.

268
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,940
Dadass.

269
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
Hey guys, welcome to Dadass.

270
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,640
This Yahoo was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Drew

271
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,440
in Drew Davenport.

272
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,920
Thank you, Drew.

273
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
It's by Yajuru Answers user Cassidy.

274
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,720
Cassidy asks, what's the difference between toke and blaze?

275
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,360
Good one.

276
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
You're in the right place, Cassidy.

277
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
I told someone I'd like to toke with them sometime.

278
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,980
Mm-hmm.

279
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,280
Which is crazy.

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
Which is a crazy thing to say.

281
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Which is a narc thing to say.

282
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,800
It's a total narc thing to say.

283
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
I told someone I'd like to toke with them sometime.

284
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,080
And they said, they don't toke, they blaze.

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,840
Hello, fellow young people.

286
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
Are we all toking today?

287
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
And I never knew there was a difference.

288
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,400
So can someone explain it to me?

289
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,360
This is definitely two cops trying to bust each other, right?

290
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
Wait, are you a cop?

291
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,960
Yeah.

292
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,600
Are you?

293
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,080
Yes.

294
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,880
Damn it.

295
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,120
Damn it.

296
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Not again.

297
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,920
Fell for each other's web.

298
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
We have to get on the same page with this.

299
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,120
Okay, to try to answer the question in a concrete way.

300
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,680
To me, I feel like toke is the act of one inhalation of marijuana.

301
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,880
And I believe that blaze would just be the entire experience

302
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,160
of smoking marijuana.

303
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,720
Everything from like-

304
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
It's like squares and rectangles.

305
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,360
You know what I mean?

306
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,600
Yeah, like toking is part of blazing,

307
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,640
but like blazing includes buying posters.

308
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,760
And like having them at the place where you're going is life.

309
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah, it's like blaze life.

310
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
Every blaze is a toke.

311
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,080
But not every toke is a blaze.

312
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,200
Some tokes are rips.

313
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,520
Yes.

314
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,320
And some are chunky cheevers.

315
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
That is true, Travis. Some are chunky cheevers of that sweet green leaf.

316
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
Didn't even think about that.

317
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,880
It's a complicated little Venn diagram.

318
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,920
I feel like you can toke alone, but you can only blaze in a group.

319
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,040
That's actually a really good indicator, I think,

320
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,640
for an important marijuana distinction.

321
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,840
There are some slang terms for smoking marijuana

322
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,680
that are going to sound ridiculous if you say them by yourself.

323
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
If you say like, hey, what are you doing?

324
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm just getting blazed by yourself.

325
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,120
Bummer, summer.

326
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,960
Wow, that's a really big bummer.

327
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,920
You're getting blazed.

328
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,000
But I feel like you can chill by yourself.

329
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,880
Yeah, just chilling.

330
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
Netflix and pot.

331
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,400
Is that what the kids do?

332
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,080
I Netflix and chilled myself.

333
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,280
I can't believe I fell for it.

334
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I just don't get why it would be so important to you

335
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,240
to draw the distinction to another living, breathing human being.

336
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Hey, don't say, no, I don't.

337
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
How dare you?

338
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,560
Toke, I blaze.

339
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,880
It seems weird to me that you would be the kind of person

340
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
that only blazed and did not toke.

341
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,600
But is toke, does toke some way like,

342
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
connote that you like don't commit to the blaze life?

343
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
That you're like, oh, you're just a toker.

344
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,280
You just dip your toke in the water.

345
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,200
You don't even, you're not going for it.

346
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,080
To me, the difference is, and in my mind's eye,

347
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,880
the difference is you toke, you're smoking marijuana.

348
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,440
You blaze, you smoke marijuana, and then as soon as you're done,

349
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,080
like throw your arms way open wide

350
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,920
and just embrace the entire experience

351
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,840
and just announce that you're blazed.

352
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,280
That seems to be the difference.

353
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,680
I guess you guys are just making me rethink my whole thing

354
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,120
because I thought I was living a 420 blaze life,

355
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,120
but I just, it feels like maybe that's all a lie.

356
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,200
This has been a reverse intervention.

357
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,960
You're not doing enough drugs, Kerbin.

358
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
Do you think that maybe you misheard them

359
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
and they say, I don't toke, I laze?

360
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,840
And they were talking about eating chips.

361
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,040
They just eat, they just enjoy lazed potato chips

362
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,800
whenever their urge to smoke weed gets to them.

363
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,680
Or were you talking to an old American gladiator

364
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
who's saying, no, I'm not toke, I'm blaze.

365
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,360
That's possible.

366
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
I could have sworn you were a turbo.

367
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
No, actually, I'm blaze.

368
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm blaze, but I get that a lot.

369
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
We usually travel together just to make it easier on people.

370
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
What if there were American gladiators,

371
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
like they ended in a new season.

372
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
It launched on April 20th

373
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
and all of the gladiators were weed slang.

374
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
They all were like, I'm pot cloud.

375
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,640
That's not weed slang.

376
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
What are you talking about?

377
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,200
I was just saying words.

378
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,720
You guys want to breathe in this pot cloud with me tonight?

379
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
430, what?

380
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,280
That's just a time.

381
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,960
That's what time we were going to do it though.

382
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
It's one of the, 420 is one of the great ironies of pot

383
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,720
because it requires that people smoke weed

384
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
and also be punctual.

385
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,360
That doesn't seem fair.

386
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,960
Why do you have to also worry about that?

387
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,320
I was also about to say that it's a problem

388
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,080
if you have like a nine to five job,

389
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,600
but it's probably not.

390
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,800
It's probably not an issue.

391
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,080
An ish, no.

392
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,240
I have to leave right now, but it's not five o'clock.

393
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,120
It's only 410.

394
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
I know, please let me go.

395
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm going to miss it.

396
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,760
There's an answer here that says toke

397
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,960
is just a couple of small hits,

398
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,720
but blazing is smoking a lot.

399
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
See, I mean, I feel like we got it.

400
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,200
What if you start toking,

401
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
but then you get interrupted by something else

402
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,000
and you can't fulfill the blaze requirement.

403
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
Or what if you start intending to only toke

404
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,320
and suddenly realize you've blazed.

405
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,520
Oh no.

406
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
Yeah, that's a better bill.

407
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,280
I've got a bris to go to.

408
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,640
I didn't mean to blaze.

409
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,080
I accidentally got blazed.

410
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,160
Oh no, I can't come to work today, boss.

411
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,680
It happened again.

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,760
Hey, that's understandable.

413
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,880
That's a perfectly valid wanting to toke,

414
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,640
but accidentally getting blazed.

415
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,120
I don't think this will affect Blockbuster's business at all.

416
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,800
I think it'll be fine.

417
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Take it from me, the CEO of Blockbuster.

418
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,800
Jimmy Blockbuster.

419
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm a cool laid back CEO.

420
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,880
Everything's going great.

421
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,320
People will always need videos.

422
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,240
VHS is the future.

423
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,720
I hope no one's stealing our posters.

424
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,680
What do you need, Blade 2?

425
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,120
Quit joking around, we got it.

426
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,920
We should order 18 copies,

427
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,120
just in case people want to get multiple copies of Blade 2.

428
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,760
Hey, do you know how you could go to the grocery store

429
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,480
and get a box of popcorn for three cents?

430
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
How about we sell you a fake tub of it for $8?

431
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
Just like a movie theater.

432
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,080
Please don't steal.

433
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,480
Here's a very large box of Twizzlers.

434
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,080
Isn't that the metric by which you always wanted to enjoy Twizzlers?

435
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,880
Buy the box.

436
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,240
Because that's what we've got for you.

437
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Enjoy these waxy strings forever.

438
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,960
Enjoy these terrible waxy candy strings forever.

439
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
It's a punishment you buy for yourself.

440
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,160
Buy the box.

441
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,240
Apparently.

442
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,520
Hey, do you love that snowcaps flavor at the movie theater?

443
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
But I always wonder why nobody sells those candies anywhere else.

444
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
Well, good news, Blockbuster.

445
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
Enjoy these and showgirls, whatever.

446
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,640
Yeah, whatever.

447
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,560
No judgment here, judgment-free zone.

448
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,080
I'm glad God punished Blockbuster for their hubris.

449
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,560
They just got too big.

450
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
I got another question here.

451
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
What is the best way to tell someone

452
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
they're driving the wrong way on a one-way street?

453
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,160
Oh, man.

454
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,280
This has happened to me three times in the last two months.

455
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,880
I tried, what if it's him?

456
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
How do I tell everybody that they're driving

457
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
the wrong way on this one-way street I found?

458
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
I tried honking loudly, flashing my lights,

459
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
and gesturing forcefully.

460
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,360
But the first two times, they just drove on

461
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
by going the wrong way.

462
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,560
And one guy actually flipped me off.

463
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm not sure what else to do outside crossing into their lane

464
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,560
and forcing them to swerve off the road.

465
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea.

466
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,600
That's Kevin from Kansas.

467
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,560
Yeah, Kevmo.

468
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,680
I bet that guy who flipped him off felt real stupid

469
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,360
like five seconds later.

470
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,160
He was like, fuck you.

471
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,720
Oh, God.

472
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,880
Oh, I was wrong.

473
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,240
Oh, no.

474
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,840
It's my bad.

475
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,760
I want to strongly, strongly caution you against this idea

476
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,280
of trying to run people off the road.

477
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
I don't understand why, when there's a little bit

478
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,840
of a traffic confusion, it has to turn into Mad Max right away.

479
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
Here in Los Angeles, traffic laws mean nothing.

480
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,960
I mean nothing to people.

481
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,240
And you would be amazed, Justin, at how often that kind of...

482
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,320
I've seen people waiting, they get stuck in traffic

483
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,800
because we're all trying to merge under one tiny ass road

484
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
to get over a mountain.

485
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
And people will drive up onto a sidewalk because they're like,

486
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
but I want to go now.

487
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
And they'll just go up on a sidewalk

488
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,480
and then get back in line.

489
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,880
They just want to.

490
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,840
They want to then.

491
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,640
No, officer, you don't understand.

492
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
I want you now.

493
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,840
I need you now, sir.

494
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,880
Please, I want to.

495
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
Why wouldn't you let me do this?

496
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Can't you see that I want it?

497
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,200
I want to be there.

498
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Why don't you get this?

499
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
I would like to be there now, please.

500
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,200
And I'm back here.

501
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,320
And can't you see how angry that is making me?

502
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,280
I need to turn left out of the right-hand lane.

503
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
I don't think there's a good way of telling people.

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
I mean, once...

505
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
Okay, here's the problem.

506
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,040
So once they're out of the range at which you could tell them,

507
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,000
like once you realize like,

508
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
oh, that person's doing this bad thing.

509
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
I got to do something to warn them.

510
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
By the time you've had that realization,

511
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,720
they're already in your rear view.

512
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
I mean, there's somebody else's problem now.

513
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
You've just got to go on with your day

514
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,160
because you don't have time to worry about that anymore.

515
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,440
You've got other things to worry about.

516
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,800
You've got a demanding job.

517
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,040
You've got kids that have to go to school.

518
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,560
Like you're busy right now.

519
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,600
You don't have time.

520
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,800
Let me roll this idea up into a little sticky ball

521
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,440
and throw it at the two of you and see what happens.

522
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,800
Can we get CV radios in every car?

523
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,760
I have wanted this technology forever.

524
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,680
I've always wanted this.

525
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,480
So that's an easy fix, right?

526
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,840
Like, hey compadre, you're breaking the rules.

527
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
Let me turn up the dial, Griffin, with this.

528
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
Please, please, please.

529
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,320
You take the concept of like emojis, right?

530
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
And you have like pre-programmed,

531
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
like you're going the wrong way or you're an asshole

532
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,880
or like that's not a turn lane.

533
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,560
Just buttons that you push

534
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,560
and it just like beams a robotic like voice into their CV

535
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
because you're driving.

536
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,080
We don't want to institute like more distraction.

537
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,200
So you just press a button

538
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,320
and like maybe it's an LED display on their dash

539
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,120
or it's a voice.

540
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,800
It's like you're going the wrong way.

541
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,760
You're saying to limit distraction instead of saying,

542
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
hey buddy, you're driving the wrong way.

543
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
You want to look down into a virtual keyboard

544
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,120
and swipe through until you find the correct emoji

545
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,320
and then tap in maybe a few emojis to send their way.

546
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,840
And then it appears on their screen.

547
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
Of course, they have to close.

548
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,600
They have to like activate the notification

549
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,280
in order to view your emojis.

550
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,600
Well, maybe we make it more ergonomic than that, Griffin.

551
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
We put the buttons around the steering wheel,

552
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,480
like on the back of the steering wheel.

553
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,160
So you're hitting it with your fingertips

554
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,720
and it becomes just secondary nature.

555
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
I hate to quibble,

556
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,440
but if we're creating technology to make cars safer

557
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
and we're trying to figure out a scientific technological way

558
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,520
to communicate to a driver

559
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
that he's going the wrong way on a wrong way street,

560
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,800
perhaps the most efficient, elegant solution to that

561
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,880
is not have other drivers notice

562
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,200
and then try to text them the information.

563
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,520
Perhaps their car could tell them

564
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
that they were doing this terrible thing.

565
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,280
Yes, and I think this conversation

566
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,000
is probably how we ended up with the car horn

567
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,040
because logically, if we keep going down this road

568
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,720
for like another couple of hours,

569
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,320
the three of us are just gonna agree like,

570
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,200
what if you just have one big button on your car

571
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,240
that just went, hey?

572
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
And then that can be sort of a catch all

573
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,960
for you're doing something wrong.

574
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,600
What if a turtle in a cloud flew over

575
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
and fishing line down and picked you up

576
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,440
and turns you back around?

577
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
Yeah, all right.

578
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,160
The problem with the car horn though

579
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,000
is that it doesn't, through years,

580
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,080
any word used repeatedly is gonna become,

581
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,640
like I'll use, you know, stupid for a while, right?

582
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Like stupid meant bad and then in an Orwellian style,

583
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,760
stupid eventually meant good

584
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
and I think it's probably means bad again.

585
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
But the important thing is that any word used long enough

586
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,000
will start to lose its meaning and change and evolve.

587
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
The car horn initially did mean like,

588
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,680
hey, let's drive a little safer please

589
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,200
or hey, please pay attention.

590
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,160
But now, through years of misuse,

591
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,440
it's like people only honk ironically.

592
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
Yeah, it can mean anything.

593
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,600
It can mean anything.

594
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,880
It could be like, hey, my team is the best at sports today.

595
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,960
They won sports.

596
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,400
Or it could just be like a proclamation of like,

597
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,840
I'm here, I'm here.

598
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,960
I am here.

599
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,320
Or what's this button do?

600
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,920
Oh man, it makes a lot of noise.

601
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, that's why you gotta couple it with something,

602
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,200
make it a word and a blow.

603
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,760
You know what I mean?

604
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,080
So we do the horns and then you have like,

605
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,200
almost like semaphore.

606
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,560
You have different hand signals.

607
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,520
I see what you're saying.

608
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
So you're saying like three quick horns means,

609
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,640
Jeremy, I'm outside.

610
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,680
Also, I wanna jump in.

611
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,240
It's 2015, everyone owns a phone

612
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,800
and has it within six inches of them at all time.

613
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Please stop honking your horns to pick people up

614
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,160
at six o'clock in the morning.

615
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,200
What are you doing?

616
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
It's 2015.

617
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
Don't honk the horn, you asshole.

618
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
As long as we're putting people on blast,

619
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,320
this one goes out to our dad.

620
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,120
Speaking of phones.

621
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,400
Hey dad.

622
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Hey dad, when you decide you get a wild hair

623
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
and you wanna text Travis at 5.30 in the morning,

624
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,280
his time, 8.30 in the morning, your time,

625
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
7.30 in the morning, Griffin's time,

626
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,360
an acceptable excuse to that is not,

627
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,280
I didn't think you'd have your phone near you.

628
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,400
Where else would it be?

629
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,920
It's 2015.

630
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,960
I talked about that afterwards.

631
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
I die without it.

632
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,840
I die if I don't know where it is

633
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,560
and it's not touching me at all times, I die, dad.

634
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,960
Time for bed, gotta carry my phone downstairs

635
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,320
to the living room.

636
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,280
Where else would it be?

637
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
What if someone needs me?

638
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
Yes, they don't.

639
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,160
But let me hit you guys with another idea I just had.

640
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,200
And this one's the real winner.

641
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120
You're not gonna even put dad on blast for a second.

642
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,640
This one, well, he's, you know.

643
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
I roll out the mat and you guys just walk by.

644
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
I blasted him.

645
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,160
I blasted him.

646
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,360
I flavor blasted him.

647
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
He's of a different generation.

648
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,080
I'm always happy to hear from our father.

649
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,520
Listen, let me hit you guys with this

650
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,280
because I'm all about increasing goodwill in the world.

651
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,800
You got the one horn now and that one horn,

652
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,320
yes, Justin, as you said, could mean anything.

653
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,400
But most of the time it means hey, dipshit.

654
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:51,440
I would like to suggest that all cars come with three horns

655
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
and it can be like three different sections

656
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,280
in the middle of the steering wheel.

657
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,480
And that'll probably be good too

658
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,840
because if the airbag has to pop out,

659
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,160
it gives it like a little natural sort of like space

660
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,200
for it to blast out from.

661
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,920
It's perforated.

662
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,240
It's perforated, yes, Travis.

663
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,880
So you still have the hey, dipshit button, right?

664
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,840
But then we could have a more neutral horn

665
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,440
or a special occasion horn.

666
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,440
And then if you hear that one go off,

667
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,760
it just means like, oh, that person's doing their own thing.

668
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,640
They're celebrating the winning of a sports team

669
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,440
or something like that.

670
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
It's not traffic related.

671
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,560
Non-traffic related, this is just a sound horn.

672
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
But then you get that third horn.

673
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
They just want to make noise.

674
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,200
They just want to make noise.

675
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
I get that because sometimes you're in traffic

676
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
and you realize that like nobody can move.

677
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,640
It's not like somebody's just sitting there,

678
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,920
but you want to like express something.

679
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
You want to be a part of the conversation, right?

680
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,440
So maybe when you drive by and it's like,

681
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,920
hit this up if you're voting for gore

682
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,840
and then you sound just your sound horn

683
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
because if you honk your danger horn,

684
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,960
then people are gonna think you're in danger.

685
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,800
Third horn though, third horn is the great job horn.

686
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,160
And you do this if somebody does like a dope brake

687
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,480
and like stops from hitting the car in front of them,

688
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
which like slammed on their brakes

689
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
and you'd be like, oh man, that was a close one.

690
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,240
Great job.

691
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
And you just hit them up with that

692
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,760
and they say, oh, thank you.

693
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,720
Or somebody does a dope ass parallel park

694
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,160
in like a tight, tight spot.

695
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
Like, oh, great job.

696
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,520
Or they pull out of a spot

697
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
and then they block the car that like rolled up

698
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,920
to try to steal the spot that you were clearly waiting on.

699
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,120
They block that car.

700
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,800
When somebody does that, great job.

701
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,600
If I see somebody do a very quick turn

702
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,080
on the protected left instead of just like sitting there

703
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,680
watching fucking minions in their built-in DVD player,

704
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,640
great job.

705
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,520
I would like to request one tiny horn at the bottom

706
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,280
that's the equivalent of a throat clear

707
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,520
because that's the horn I always need

708
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,800
where it's like, oh, the light's green

709
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,000
and this person hasn't moved yet.

710
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,360
Just a, ahem.

711
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,800
No, that's the pay attention horn.

712
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,240
What were you saying, Justin?

713
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,920
I would like that horn,

714
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,440
the great job horn would be really useful

715
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
for that moment when you're driving

716
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,080
and you see someone who is driving the exact same

717
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,760
make, model, and color in your vehicle

718
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,520
and it suddenly becomes the most important thing

719
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,960
in the world that that person and you have a moment.

720
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
Is this just, does this just happen to me

721
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,440
where it's like, if I see somebody else driving my car,

722
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,120
they have to notice this is happening.

723
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,080
Doesn't even need to be auto,

724
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,760
it doesn't have to be car to car.

725
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,920
It can be you see a fucking dope ass

726
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,280
Little Caesar sign dancer.

727
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,080
Great dance, great dance.

728
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,680
Oh, this is great too for when you're on those long car trips

729
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,920
and like you and the same red car

730
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,960
have been on the highway just trading places

731
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
for the last four hours.

732
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,600
Hell yeah, I love that.

733
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,440
We know we're doing this dance.

734
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
We know we in this together.

735
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
It's a horn for when you finally have to part ways.

736
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,640
It's like, well, Kimisabi,

737
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,240
I'll see you on down the Otzum Highway.

738
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,360
Great job.

739
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,880
Great job, my friend.

740
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,360
I spent a hell of a time riding with you.

741
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,960
Till we can dance again.

742
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Great job.

743
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,400
Let me just onomatopoe this shit

744
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,760
because we're going to have the danger horn,

745
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,600
which is still like, right?

746
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,240
But then the sound horn sounds like a dorky guy

747
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,000
who just got really scared by something.

748
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,480
Yeah.

749
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,880
And then the sound horn can be like a whoop.

750
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,920
And then the great job horn would just be like, great job.

751
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,280
Great job.

752
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,640
I like it.

753
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,760
I like it's on the nose.

754
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,920
I could never be confused with any of the other horns

755
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,000
because you don't want to honk the great job horn

756
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,360
and have someone be like, what?

757
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,920
Oh, sorry.

758
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,880
That was a great job.

759
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,120
Right?

760
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,360
Like, you don't even want that millisecond of like animosity.

761
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,640
You want them to know right away.

762
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,440
They're like, great job.

763
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,760
I bought a Volkswagen Golf, a new Volkswagen Golf this year,

764
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,840
like two days before they were like we lied.

765
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,880
Gotcha.

766
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
And so they've been trying to figure out a way to settle this.

767
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
It's not going to cost them like 80 billion euros.

768
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,960
And Volkswagen, can I suggest being the first ones

769
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,720
to the table with this technology?

770
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,120
Replace my horn with these three horns.

771
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,200
And then like, first of all, all will be pardoned.

772
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,520
But second of all, like, I don't know.

773
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,080
I feel like I'll be the leader of cars.

774
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,360
I'll be the king of cars.

775
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,240
Great job.

776
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,120
Great job.

777
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,000
Great job.

778
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
Hey, let's go to the money zone.

779
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,920
Great job.

780
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:28,320
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Harry's.

781
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,960
Which part?

782
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,520
Which part?

783
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,320
Which part?

784
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:38,560
The butt shaving set comes with a copper plated razor handle.

785
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,960
A couple of five blade cartridges, shaving cream,

786
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
and a cool travel kit to hold everything.

787
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,400
Hey, what is this bag that has all your shaving stuff in it?

788
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,920
Oh, that's my travel kit.

789
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
What is this bag of loose shaving cream?

790
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,680
It's, it's cool.

791
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,720
Yeah, it is.

792
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,360
Holiday shaving sets are all different price points.

793
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,080

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,200

800
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,200
I got a different sponsor this week.

801
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,080
This one sponsored my tummy and it's Squarespace.

802
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,360
I know when I said that you thought, well,

803
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,680
this is probably going to be some sort of edible product.

804
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,880
No, it's Squarespace.

805
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,560
Although these designs are so delicious,

806
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,600
I feel like I'm eating them when I go to a Squarespace website.

807
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,960
But it's too many bites.

808
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,600
Okay, so Squarespace is the all-in-one website platform.

809
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Squarespace sites look professionally designed,

810
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,800

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,480
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

816
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Griffin, what would your trial website be?

817
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,400
Oh my gosh.

818
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,760
Probably some sort of manifesto.

819
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,820
Nice.

820
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,200
You hear that and you think it sounds negative.

821
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,800
It would be like a positive manifesto.

822
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,800
A humanifesto.

823
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,080
Yeah, just like, hey, cut it out.

824
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,240
We have some personal messages

825
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,280
and they have sponsored the part of the show

826
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,400
that is my neck, my back, my pussy, and my crack.

827
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,880
God, no, I can't say.

828
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,800
It's Brent and Jody get a message from Bobby and Chris.

829
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,320
They say, congratulations on bringing another tiny human

830
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,200
into the world.

831
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,480
Hoping you and Jody are doing well and taking it easy.

832
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,040
Here's wishing you two more happy times ahead

833
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,120
with your new little lady.

834
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,200
High fives all around.

835
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
I hope from Bobby and Chris.

836
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,240
And it goes to Brent and Jody.

837
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,360
And thank you for having one normal,

838
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
hopefully they're not referencing-

839
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,360
It's safe for the introduction, mon frere.

840
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,800
But Justin, that's assuming they're talking about a baby.

841
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,960
They might be talking about like reaching

842
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,800
into some alternate dimension

843
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,520
and pulling like a David the Gnome sized person

844
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
into our reality.

845
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
And they've captured her in a bell jar.

846
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,080
Maybe they're referring to like a choice potato salad

847
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
they all made together.

848
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,520
And it's like a joke, an end joke between them.

849
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,720
Hopefully it's a human baby.

850
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,680
And that's a nice normal message.

851
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,360
And I'm sorry that I spoilt it with my nonsense.

852
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,840
This one unsponsored the shit Justin said.

853
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,480
So these two sponsorships cancel each other out.

854
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,200
This message is for Brain Coral.

855
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,320
And it's from Insign, am I pronouncing that right?

856
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:46,720
Ensign.

857
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,080
Whatever.

858
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,320
Ensign Ellie and the Fluff Monster.

859
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,640
Ensign Ellie and the Fluff Monster say to Brain Coral-

860
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,880
Mornings at 5 a.m. on K-Flunk.

861
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,760
Happy two years boodle doodle.

862
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,960
I appreciate you and our best friendship so much much.

863
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,520
I love your big blonde noggin and paddle feet

864
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,480
going on movie dates and listening to the brothers together.

865
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,600
Thank you for letting me use your body to learn anatomy

866
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,240
and keeping me sane with cuddles in the boudoir.

867
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,800
Stick with me kid and I will show you the world.

868
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,000
Very personal.

869
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,120
Very, very personal message.

870
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,960
Do they mean for us to read that out loud?

871
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Oh, it says here, please don't read this.

872
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,240
Oh, oh no, it's just this sponsorship.

873
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,800
They paid us money just to read these words.

874
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,920
They wanted us to know.

875
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,280
Yeah, know about our love please.

876
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Congratulations on your two years.

877
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
I am also celebrating my two year wedding anniversary today.

878
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,600
Nice.

879
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,360
With my lovely wife Rachel.

880
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,160
What did you get her?

881
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,000
It doesn't matter because Amazon didn't deliver it yet.

882
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,400
Nice.

883
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,840
Pretty cool job Amazon.

884
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,480
We'll run a little late on that one but no big deal.

885
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,520
But anyway, why were you down to the last moment?

886
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
I didn't, it was supposed to be her Thursday

887
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,360
and they done fucked the bed, didn't they?

888
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,080
Nice.

889
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,400
They done took a dump right in my anniversary bed.

890
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,880
Great job.

891
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,200
No, not great job.

892
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,320
I hit the wrong button.

893
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,040
Oh, damn it.

894
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,800
This is gonna be the problem with these horns

895
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,000
until we get them figured out.

896
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,600
Hey everyone, we're the Flophouse,

897
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,440
one of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun Podcasting Network.

898
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,640
I'm Dan McCoy.

899
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,840
I'm Stuart Wellington.

900
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,360
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

901
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,080
What is the Flophouse, you may very well ask.

902
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,320
We watch a bad movie and then we talk about it.

903
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,600
A bad movie podcast,

904
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,160
isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

905
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,440
I'd answer that by saying,

906
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,840
one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

907
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,960
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche,

908
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,480
and two, shut up.

909
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,680
Sick bird.

910
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,400
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

911
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
A podcast about words that sound like other words,

912
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,440
a podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one,

913
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,400
a podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie,

914
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,640
or discussions about sex tarps.

915
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,120
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends

916
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,240
just hanging out and talking about ding-dongs.

917
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,280
That's mostly used to.

918
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,080
Wait, what?

919
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,920

The Flophouse.

923
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
I got another question for you.

924
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
How about Yahoo, actually?

925
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,440
I just said that.

926
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,120
I just said it, if you'd listen for a second.

927
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,720
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Roseng, Game Recognized Game.

928
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,000
Rachel Roseng, thank you, Rachel.

929
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,840
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

930
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,840
Ooh, they're anonymous.

931
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,960
Let's call them.

932
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,440
Let's see.

933
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,800
Anonymous.

934
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,880
Shenonymous.

935
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,800
Shanana.

936
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,600
Shanana.

937
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,120
Bowser from Shanana.

938
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,640
Bowser from Shanana says,

939
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,120
why do some injections you have to get in the butt?

940
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,120
I had to get a penicillin shot earlier

941
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,640
and the nurse said this one needed to go on my behind.

942
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,480
I honestly really did not feel like going there.

943
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,880
Any place below the belt for me is examined

944
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,480
on an absolutely positively need to basis.

945
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,040
So I told her I'll take it in the arm.

946
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,960
She said, you don't want it there, trust me.

947
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,880
I've been doing this 22 years.

948
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,440
I didn't have to pull my pants all the way down,

949
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,600
but still I just didn't like that

950
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,520
and really would have preferred elsewhere.

951
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,800
I know she was just doing her job,

952
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,240
but what difference does it make

953
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,800
whether it goes in the arm or wherever?

954
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,440
One way or another, it goes right into that bloodstream.

955
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,480
Isn't that what matters?

956
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,720
Okay, what qualifies as a need to basis

957
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,160
if it's not a nurse saying I have to give you penicillin?

958
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,960
What greater need is there to show your butt

959
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,840
to a professional?

960
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,900
Yeah.

961
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Well, they're arguing that that shot

962
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,680
is gonna end up in the blood anyway,

963
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,560
so you can put it anywhere.

964
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,920
You can put it in between my toes.

965
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,800
You can put it in my crankshaft.

966
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,000
You can put it wherever you want.

967
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,200
It's just like, why my butt?

968
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,200
Your butt seems like it's pretty far away from you.

969
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,640
It's like a real melting pot.

970
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,240
Yeah, who knows what's going on down there half the time?

971
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,160
And your butt is so far away from you

972
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,160
that from your head and your face and stuff.

973
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,080
You've said that three times down.

974
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,120
It doesn't make any sense.

975
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,080
Well, think about it, Griffin.

976
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,640
Picture it in the world of like Osmosis Jones, right?

977
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,600
Like if you went to the butt in Osmosis Jones,

978
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,240
what would be there?

979
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,920
And I feel like it would be like the wilderness.

980
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,720
I feel like it would be like we have to travel to the butt

981
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,000
like they were saying Mordor.

982
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,640
You know what I mean?

983
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,840
Yeah, the butt seems like it's really far away.

984
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,600
What if in Osmosis Jones,

985
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,120
David Hyde Pierce, who played the pill guy,

986
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,120
was a suppository and that was how he was introduced

987
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,680
was there was a long scene where Bill Murray

988
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,920
had to jam a little David Hyde Pierce

989
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
right into his asshole.

990
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,320
While DHP just screamed.

991
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,840
While DHP was like, no, I'm a mouth pill.

992
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Please, no, I was on Frasier.

993
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
I got an answer from Sydney.

994
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
She is my wife's a physician

995
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,360
and I got an official answer here from her.

996
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,760
And it says butt blood is the most important blood.

997
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,280
Thanks, Sydney for the, wow.

998
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
Wouldn't have expected that.

999
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,840
But I said, why does shots go in the butt?

1000
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,880
She says, there's just a lot of tissue there.

1001
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
Muscle and fat and stuff.

1002
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,000
More so than in the deltoid, whatever that is.

1003
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,160
Sounds like she's making shit up.

1004
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,720
It's arm cannons, like these babies.

1005
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,000
I guess what she's saying is,

1006
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,760
because the butt's so juicy.

1007
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,920
Because he got that juicy bit.

1008
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,760
Because the butt's so juicy.

1009
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,800
Cheese pizza.

1010
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,600
A juicy cheese pizza butt.

1011
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Got that juicy butt, Kevin.

1012
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,320
Also, and she just texted me,

1013
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,240
also doctors like to look at butts.

1014
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,720
But don't tell anyone, that is a secret.

1015
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,320
No, she broke the Hippocratic Oath.

1016
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,360
That's the second codicil of the Hippocratic Oath.

1017
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,840
Do no harm and look at butts.

1018
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,800
No, it's do no harm

1019
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,280
and don't tell anyone about our butt secret.

1020
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,040
Love, love Hippocrates.

1021
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,880
Oh, man.

1022
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,520
Butts are juicy.

1023
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
Did you guys know, by the way,

1024
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm trying to see more versions of the Christmas Carol

1025
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,040
because there's just the few.

1026
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,760
There's so, so, so many out there.

1027
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
And I think people tend to hue to the ones

1028
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
that they're the most familiar with.

1029
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,520
Did you guys know there is an animated Christmas Carol

1030
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,840
from 1997 that features as Mr. Scrooge,

1031
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,480
a young Tim Curry.

1032
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,920
Our friend and nearest, Tim Curry.

1033
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,080
And as if that cast couldn't,

1034
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,200
like that cast is already like pretty good.

1035
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,560
Who is that as the spirit of Christmas present?

1036
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,320
Why, it's Whippy Goldberg.

1037
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,400
Man, together again.

1038
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,800
Yeah, and who snuck in there is Marley.

1039
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,880
Well, it's your friend of mine, Ed Asner.

1040
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
That's a really good cast.

1041
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,920
If I was making a dream cast,

1042
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
I would play Sonic.

1043
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,840
That would be.

1044
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,880
What if Sonic the Hedgehog was the ghost of Christmas past?

1045
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,680
Why do you have to inject shots into my Sonic the Hedgehog?

1046
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,560
I think what if, what would be the best Dickens story

1047
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,880
to put Sonic the Hedgehog inside?

1048
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,160
And I think it would go a little something like this.

1049
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,840
It was the worst of cheese dogs.

1050
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,760
It was the best of cheese dogs.

1051
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,800
Or did I get that right?

1052
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
Chili dogs, my dude.

1053
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,000
Listen, it's been a long time.

1054
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,440
Do you know that that was Urkel?

1055
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,120
Sorry, I just wanted to tell everybody

1056
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,160
about my other favorite version of Christmas Carol.

1057
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,800
This one's a little bit of basically

1058
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,320
the weirdest one that exists.

1059
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,880
And you guys will be like kicking yourself

1060
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,560
that you didn't know this was like a thing

1061
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,240
because it stars as Scrooge, Simon Callow.

1062
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
Not that interesting.

1063
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,440
Michael Gambon is in there as the ghost of Christmas present.

1064
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,000
Into that.

1065
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,680
Yeah, no problem at all.

1066
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,160
And then we have as Belle,

1067
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,840
you know, young Scrooge's love interest is Kate Winslet.

1068
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,440
And then who's that bringing up the rear as Marley?

1069
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,280
Why, it's Nicholas Cage.

1070
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,080
What?

1071
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,480
What?

1072
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,680
What, no, where, is this an animated?

1073
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,400
They got Nick Cage for their animated Christmas Carol.

1074
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,360
No, I've seen this.

1075
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,480
I've seen this.

1076
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,840
It was on Netflix.

1077
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,960
I was like, time to watch Scrooge.

1078
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,240
Oh, Scrooge isn't on Netflix.

1079
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,040
Let's watch this one.

1080
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,640
And it's like demented.

1081
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,840
It's demented, right?

1082
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,520
It's mainly about mice and they take a lot

1083
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,280
of really weird licenses with the story.

1084
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,600
Also in that version, he gets back together with Belle

1085
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
and they're both old and they get back together.

1086
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,760
Like it's not that, it's a happy ending.

1087
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,200
It's not that happy, guys.

1088
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,520
She hasn't been waiting for Scrooge.

1089
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,560
No, in like six months, Scrooge is bankrupt.

1090
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,040
Yeah.

1091
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,360
That's how Christmas Carol ends.

1092
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,480
That's the follow-up.

1093
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,000
That's the placard that comes up.

1094
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,360
That's the title card.

1095
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,600
Six months later, he was in a gutter

1096
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
because he's an old man and he gave away all his money.

1097
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,520
When he needs it the most.

1098
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,480
He needs it the most.

1099
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,280
This was the time he was saving for

1100
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,480
and he was giving it all away.

1101
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,440
And it's not like life is easy in like Elizabethan

1102
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,520
or whatever it was, Victorian London.

1103
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,240
Like it's tough.

1104
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,600
And he's just giving it away.

1105
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,400
There's a balance, Scrooge.

1106
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,680
There's a balance.

1107
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,560
I got a fucking choice when coming out at you hot.

1108
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,040
What is the etiquette when eating at a buffet?

1109
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,640
Specifically, when standing up

1110
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,480
and going to replenish your plate of food?

1111
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,280
Do I wait for a natural break of the conversation?

1112
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,040
Do I wait for the other person to stand up

1113
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,240
and get another plate?

1114
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,840
Or do I stand up in the middle of them talking?

1115
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,920
Almost as if to imply that in three minutes

1116
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,800
they will still be there, but the crab legs might not be.

1117
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,200
Oh, that's a good question.

1118
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,120
That is a good question.

1119
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,160
I love that there's no like catchy nickname on this one

1120
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,080
because they wanted to provide as little evidence

1121
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,400
as they possibly could that would allow people

1122
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,480
to track them down and find out their true identity

1123
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,800
based on the subject matter of this question.

1124
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,440
Hungry buffet boy in Biloxi.

1125
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,800
You know, I encountered like not exactly the same thing

1126
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,440
but I went to a barcade, a bar arcade

1127
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,880
but it was actually mostly a restaurant

1128
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,960
and we ordered food.

1129
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,880
It was like a sit down restaurant

1130
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,320
but also the walls were lined with arcade games

1131
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,480
and like they brought us our tokens

1132
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,600
and then it's like-

1133
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,640
Sorry, sorry, bud.

1134
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,120
You're talking about a Damon Busters?

1135
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,840
No, no, it was like a Japanese restaurant

1136
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,480
that also had like gauntlet.

1137
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,520
It was awesome.

1138
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,640
It was the best, but at what point-

1139
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,840
Dave San and Buster San.

1140
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,800
What is the appropriate time to be like

1141
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,680
and I'm done with this adult conversation

1142
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,080
and I'm gonna go play NBA Jam now.

1143
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,480
Yeah, that definitely adds another layer to it.

1144
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,640
The only thing you could do in that situation, Travis

1145
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,560
is just excruciatingly slowly

1146
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,280
just keep stepping back away from the conversation

1147
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,520
until they suddenly realize they're shouting

1148
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,560
and you're playing NBA Jam.

1149
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,600
No, fuck that.

1150
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,840
The better solution is like on Doubt and Happy

1151
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,600
when they're like, well, dinner's over.

1152
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,280
I suggest we move this conversation to the drawing room.

1153
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,320
Just do something like that.

1154
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,560
Like, well, we've eaten all the pizza

1155
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,840
we're probably going to eat.

1156
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,520
Why don't we continue this thrilling conversation

1157
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,200
over a round of gauntlet?

1158
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,720
Brandy and cigars around the Frogger machine.

1159
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,120
Who's up for some Tapper?

1160
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,440
Oh man, Tapper is so good, you guys.

1161
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,040
I'm not gonna fucking talk about Tapper with you.

1162
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,600
Here's the fun thing that I encountered at this restaurant.

1163
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,240
Like at no point can all four people get up from the table,

1164
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,280
right?

1165
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,680
Because that's a sign that you're done.

1166
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,880
So it's like, you have to leave someone down

1167
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,240
like to pin down the table while you go play like X-Men.

1168
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,200
That's a, that is a sacrifice.

1169
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,960
They should have some sort of service for that.

1170
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,040
You should be able to hire a seat filler

1171
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,400
just to hold your position

1172
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,320
so you can get some four man Smash TV.

1173
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,400
I don't think they were done with these spring rolls.

1174
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,080
I think they'll be back in a minute.

1175
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,920
Wait a minute, do you play four man Smash TV

1176
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,360
or is it just, is it max two?

1177
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,080
I think it's just two.

1178
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
If you actually just put a quarter on the table,

1179
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,080
that means that it's like you've got next on it.

1180
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,440
So you should be fine there.

1181
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,840
But let's get back to the buffet subject

1182
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,080
because this is also very important

1183
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
because I get that sense of constant panic

1184
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,600
of, well, I didn't have room on my plate for those,

1185
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,400
you know, mashed potatoes.

1186
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,760
My first go round, but there weren't that many left.

1187
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,320
So I need to slam jam this gravy square

1188
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,000
before it's all gone.

1189
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,320
Oh, it looks like they just brought out fresh gummy bears.

1190
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,680
I have to go now or they're going to be gone.

1191
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,440
Got to roll.

1192
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,080
One that I find myself stuck in a lot,

1193
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,520
it's basically the saddest thing you can do

1194
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,920
is I'll be at my favorite Chinese buffet

1195
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,000
and they won't have the coconut shrimp I like

1196
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,080
and I'm pretty sure they're gonna restock it

1197
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,480
but like, cause it's empty.

1198
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,560
So of course that's the next natural step.

1199
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,400
So you do that thing and you're like waiting

1200
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,720
like, oh man, I hope he brings some more out.

1201
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,640
It's like waiting for some substandard coconut shrimp.

1202
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,560
This is pretty pitiful.

1203
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,680
I need some kind of flag system at a table

1204
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
because I will load up my plate

1205
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,240
and then take a bite of one of the things on the plate

1206
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,480
and realize, oh, I don't want this anymore.

1207
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,360
Oh, that's the worst.

1208
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,440
And then it's like, can you like,

1209
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,840
you went up thinking it was something with coconut in it.

1210
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,960
You got back and took a bite,

1211
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,520
turned out it was a corn puzzle

1212
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,640
and you're not gonna eat it.

1213
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,160
So you want to put it,

1214
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,240
but like you do want to go back up to get more.

1215
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,120
Right, so I need someone to come clear the plate

1216
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,880
and not ask any questions

1217
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,400
because I don't want to have to identify

1218
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,240
that yes, I'm wasting this.

1219
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,440
Oh yeah, no, I'm bad.

1220
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,040
I'm a bad, bad eater boy.

1221
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,720
And I did not eat this corn puzzle.

1222
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Please take it away so that I can go get more,

1223
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,120
you know, brownie mess or whatever.

1224
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,680
Like that's where I'm at.

1225
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
I feel like I want the people in my life

1226
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,040
who are most important to me to like,

1227
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,880
know and understand that when I begin

1228
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,440
to have these pangs of food anxiety,

1229
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,520
when I'm talking to them,

1230
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,840
I'm not engaged in the conversation

1231
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,600
in the way that they want me to be,

1232
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,320
but it's completely like out of my hands.

1233
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,080
And so when I do just like stand up

1234
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,360
in the middle of a conversation

1235
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,600
and walk to the other side of the room

1236
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,640
because they just put out,

1237
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,240
you know, it doesn't have to be at a buffet.

1238
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,880
We could be at a party

1239
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,240
and they just put out a little cheesecake bites

1240
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,480
and those are gonna go fucking fast, of course.

1241
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,240
Oh, here comes the wave of food anxiety.

1242
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,360
And like, what were you saying about your niece

1243
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,080
and her sickness?

1244
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,600
I really want to be dialed in,

1245
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,040
but to me, you're just saying cheesecake,

1246
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,160
cheesecake, cheesecake bites.

1247
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,800
Yummy, yum, yum.

1248
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,840
They taste so good.

1249
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,280
They're going, everyone's getting them.

1250
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,720
Everyone's taking them from you.

1251
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,400
Why can't we just be adults about it?

1252
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,320
Say, listen, I love this story so much,

1253
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,560
but if I don't sit up and get me some of those

1254
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,000
creamy bites, my human life on this planet

1255
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,200
will literally end and I will die.

1256
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,080
Baby, baby, baby.

1257
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,040
This story about your niece's sickness,

1258
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,160
it is hot stuff.

1259
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,680
I am down with the sickness,

1260
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,600
but I have got to go get these cheesecakes.

1261
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,520
Well, that's the problem, right?

1262
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,120
Cause it would require you to admit,

1263
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,040
like if we're being 100% honest,

1264
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,480
it would require you to admit

1265
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,080
that you're not that interested in stuff

1266
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,600
other people are saying usually.

1267
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,880
No, unless it's gossip or about you,

1268
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,320
it's just not that interesting.

1269
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,760
Unless the thing they're saying is

1270
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,840
directions to closer secret cheesecake bites.

1271
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,600
There's nothing that they could be saying

1272
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,680
that would get me more on board

1273
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,240
than my sweet, sweet food dream.

1274
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,640
Listen, we can all agree that when you go to a buffet,

1275
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,960
you are engaging in an activity more so

1276
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,880
than just going to a restaurant, right?

1277
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,000
Restaurant is we can gab whilst others do the work,

1278
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,840
but when you go to a buffet, you're doing the work.

1279
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,160
So imagine like if you went mini golfing

1280
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,400
and you just focused on the conversation

1281
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,200
and no one took their turn swinging a putter,

1282
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,240
that would be the worst.

1283
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,560
So why can't we agree that we came to this buffet

1284
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,160
for one purpose and one purpose only,

1285
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,760
and it's to eat as much as we can

1286
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,440
and then fall asleep quickly,

1287
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,440
hopefully after we get home.

1288
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,080
So can we all please focus on the task at hand

1289
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,160
and maybe take a nap in the parking lot

1290
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,600
while someone holds down the table,

1291
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,280
then we come back for thirties,

1292
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,520
just be cool for two seconds.

1293
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,400
Travis, you've got it.

1294
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,040
If the only way that people are gonna get serious

1295
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,080
about their food eating at a buffet

1296
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,640
and doing the fucking job they came there to do

1297
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,880
is if after you ate at a buffet,

1298
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,400
a judge came by your table

1299
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,280
and critiqued everybody's performance at the buffet.

1300
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,960
Like, oh, Marcus, three clean plates, my good boy.

1301
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,400
And let me see, what do you got there?

1302
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,320
It looks like a little soft serve bowl.

1303
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,440
And oh, you went ham on those Oreos crumblings.

1304
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,280
You went ham on those Oreos crumblings

1305
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,960
on top of that ice cream bowl, didn't you?

1306
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,400
Oh my God, great job.

1307
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,320
I'm so proud of you.

1308
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,720
Here's a little styrofoam airplane

1309
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,000
you got put together yourself.

1310
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,360
Now, Susan, let me see.

1311
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,920
It looks like you didn't even finish your first plate.

1312
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,320
You left some of your greenie beanies on there

1313
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,000
and then you made a second plate

1314
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,080
and it doesn't seem like you put any effort into that at all.

1315
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,560
And I can't help but just like constructive criticism.

1316
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,600
You talked a lot about your niece and her sickness

1317
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,760
and I feel like maybe that detracted

1318
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,920
some of like your gross eating time.

1319
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,480
That's more of an Applebee's conversation.

1320
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,240
This is a golden corral.

1321
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,120
That shit, that dog won't hunt.

1322
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,200
It's not called golden parlor room.

1323
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,480
It's called a corral, which is where pigs eat garbage.

1324
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,760
So maybe like knuckle down next time

1325
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,760
and focus on the task at hand.

1326
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,360
I do have to point out that that's a trough.

1327
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,920
But you don't just have a loose trough, Justin.

1328
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,160
Keep horses and stuff.

1329
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,640
Well, there can be pigs there too, show pigs.

1330
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,080
Anyway, I think I made a good point.

1331
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,600
Please don't fall asleep on the drive home

1332
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,880
because you just ate a golden corral

1333
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,000
and that's the next logical step.

1334
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,680
No, you have to time it out, Justin.

1335
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,800
That's what I was saying.

1336
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,920
Because if you get to the car

1337
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,680
and you're like 15 minutes to get home,

1338
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,920
nope, not gonna make it, you nap right there.

1339
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
Like when you pull your 18 wheeler over

1340
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,640
by the side of the road,

1341
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,440
because you know that your buzzers have worn off

1342
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,120
or whatever and you're gonna fall asleep.

1343
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,880
You do that in the golden corral parking lot,

1344
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,720
which is why they provide like sleep masks

1345
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,760
as you walk out the door.

1346
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,840
Alternately, you just have a fourth horn

1347
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,680
that is a toggle, a constant low level horn

1348
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,600
emanating from your car that communicates,

1349
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,360
hey, I just entered a buffet.

1350
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,360
Please give me a wide berth.

1351
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,160
It says I have a slo-mo crash into the girder.

1352
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,520
We need bumpers at a little kid's bowling party.

1353
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,080
Please let me ease into the girder.

1354
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,480
It's also the best time to call a Lyft ever

1355
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,440
in case you're way better than you got too drunk to drive.

1356
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,720
There should just be a special golden corral Lyft service.

1357
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,240
Yeah, it is a button the size of your phone

1358
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,520
that appears on your phone

1359
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,080
when the GPS detects you're in a golden corral

1360
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,520
and it's just the size of your phone

1361
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,400
so that if you fall asleep, if you land on your phone,

1362
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,080
a Lyft driver will be there to carry you home to slumberland.

1363
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,280
I'm not too drunk to drive.

1364
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,640
I'm too full to live.

1365
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,640
And I mean, I need a ride home.

1366
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,440
Take me home, Marcus.

1367
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,000
Hey, let's wrap this show up.

1368
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,240
Yeah.

1369
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,080
I think we've done all we can do here.

1370
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,920
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1371
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,600
It's an advice show for the modern era.

1372
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,840
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

1373
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,080
Just to remind you a couple quick things,

1374
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,000
head over to our Facebook group.

1375
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,840
It's the My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation group,

1376
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,480
I think it's called.

1377
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,280
And you'll find some details about how to help some folks.

1378
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,640
I'll get that set up as soon as we're done here.

1379
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,240
I haven't actually done it yet.

1380
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,240
We're doing a candle night show, speaking of candle nights.

1381
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,360
I hope it's begun for you all.

1382
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,200
But if it hasn't, don't worry, it'll come.

1383
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,000
Don't try to force it.

1384
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,720
You'll hurt yourself.

1385
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,280
But if you want to come see our candle night show,

1386
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,720
which is a foolproof way to put yourself in the spirit,

1387
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,480
go to bit.ly forward slash candle nights two.

1388
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,560
That's in Huntington, West Virginia, December 21st at 8 p.m.

1389
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,520
It's us and Sawbones, 20 bucks.

1390
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,120
It'll be a hoot and a half.

1391
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,240
We've sold about 80% of the tickets for that show.

1392
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,520
So if you do want tickets,

1393
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,160
you're gonna want to pounce on those stat.

1394
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,080
And it's a real good time.

1395
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,160
We do it as PG-13 as possible.

1396
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,320
So if you've got family in the area,

1397
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,960
or you just want to carpool down with some friends

1398
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,600
and do something stupid during your Christmas break,

1399
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,840
it's a great opportunity to do something stupid.

1400
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,720
Also, so we just had some Adventure Zone,

1401
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,480
which is the Dungeons and Dragons podcast

1402
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,520
that we do with our dad.

1403
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,880
We had some merch go up.

1404
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,360
It's a really awesome dry erase board,

1405
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,920
dry erase board character sheet

1406
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,680
that was done for us by Justin Gray.

1407
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,680
And also a t-shirt that was designed for us by Leon Roselar.

1408
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,400
And the posters from our Pacific Northwest show

1409
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,160
that were drawn by Emily Carroll,

1410
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,720
they are now up for sale on the Max Fund store as well.

1411
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,720
There's not a ton of those in memory.

1412
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,840
Like it's the leftover ones we did not sell on the tour.

1413
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,360
And when they're gone, they're gone.

1414
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,200
So like they're not gonna print anymore.

1415
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,680
These are just what we had left.

1416
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,440
They are absolutely beautiful.

1417
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,640
If you haven't seen them, go check them out.

1418
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,360
There's also just a ton of other Max Fund merch on there.

1419
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,920
The easiest way to find it is go to maxfundstore.com

1420
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,200
and it will redirect you to there.

1421
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,360
And there's a ton of awesome shit, I should say.

1422
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,280
And it's a lot of really great ideas

1423
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,400
for Christmas presents and stuff.

1424
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,360
So go check that out.

1425
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,200
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

1426
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,160
for the use of our theme song.

1427
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,320
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1428
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,360
It's a good winter time album.

1429
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,480
Lot of warm tracks there to heat up your chilly bones.

1430
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,200
Okay, we also wanna say go check out

1431
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,360
all the other amazing Maximum Fun podcasts.

1432
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,040
We do, all of us do other ones on there.

1433
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,280
And there's also shows that we're not a part of.

1434
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,320
They're all incredible.

1435
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,040
Go check it out, maximumfun.org.

1436
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,920
Also go check out Till Death Do Us Blart.

1437
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,560
It's the every Thanksgiving special

1438
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,040
that we did with the guys from The Worst Idea of All Time

1439
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,160
where we watch and review Paul Blart Malt Cop 2.

1440
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,640
We only put out one full episode a year,

1441
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,200
every Thanksgiving for the rest of time.

1442
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
When we die, we will be replaced.

1443
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,000
Go check it out, tilldeathdousblart.com

1444
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,680
or you can find it on iTunes or at deathblart on Twitter.

1445
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,400
I wanna say it's a good name for a podcast.

1446
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,600
Yeah, I love that name, everybody.

1447
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,120
It's a fucking the best name.

1448
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,440
Thank you.

1449
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,320
Yeah, I wanna say happy anniversary to my wife again.

1450
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,800
Ew, gross.

1451
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,360
That'll be $100.

1452
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,160
No, I take it back.

1453
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,240
All right, fair enough.

1454
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,600
Thank you all so much for joining us.

1455
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,360
And we hope you are having a festive holiday season.

1456
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,840
If you're not in that Canaanite spirit yet,

1457
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,720
a surefire way, get out and do something nice for somebody.

1458
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,040
Guarantee it works every time.

1459
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,440
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

1460
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,840
Absolutely, a duet sent in by Zoe Kinski,

1461
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,640
climbing that ladder.

1462
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,280
Thank you, Zoe.

1463
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sir, who asks,

1464
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,880
how does ghost Pokemon sex work?

1465
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,080
My name is Justin McElroy.

1466
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

1467
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,880
It's a fair point because when you mate

1468
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,960
a two ghost Pokemon in daycare, they produce an egg.

1469
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,760
What the fuck?

1470
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,440
This has been my brother, my brother.

1471
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:11,040
Make your dad square on the lips.

1472
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,240
Maximumfun.org.

1473
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,280
Comedy and culture.

1474
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,400
Artist owned.

1475
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,600
Listener supported.

1476
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,560
Hi, I'm Brian Safi.

1477
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,360
And I'm Erin Gibson.

1478
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,600
And we host the Throwing Shade podcast.

1479
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,920
On Throwing Shade, we look at an issue important to ladies

1480
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,440
and an issue important to gay people.

1481
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,880
And then we basically make fun of it.

1482
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,640
Yeah, and just to answer your question,

1483
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,000
no, we don't have a marriage pact.

1484
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,480
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30,

1485
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,920
we're going to do that for each other.

1486
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,240
That's true.

1487
00:57:42,240 --> 00:58:00,000
Although we have each been divorced three times.
