1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Nobody that can't believe Jamaica's got a running team. Ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,400
against all odds and probably, Jamaica has won the little country that could.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,760
Jamaica has won all three medals in the 200 meter dash.

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,680
It's a real underdog story, Justin, because of course the favorite was the runner from Switzerland.

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
Sure, right, because of the hills.

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,080
Yeah, and barely got beat out by the Jamaican three.

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,040
Now, you don't think about that, but it is hard to learn how to run without certain natural

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,960
aspects of the environment, like hills, like the snow makes it hard.

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,000
Like ground.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,360
You gotta train your legs, your glutes, and your crutes

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,400
to really get your legs up and over those snow mounds.

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, Travis, I understand that this Jamaican running team, which did take

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,200
all three medals in the 200 meter dash, I understand it was coached by John Candy.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,120
Now, how and or why?

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,160
Well, how is the big question here, Justin, because as you know, he's dead.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,800
Sure, right.

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,760
And he's been dead for quite some time now, so mostly they just watch

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,280
Wagons East over and over and over again while they were running.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,080
They set up like a vid screen in their running complex to watch Wagons East.

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,680
If you'll remember, there is that one scene in Wagons East where John Candy and Matthew Perry

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
have to run away.

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm not thinking of the right movie.

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,240
Nope, not in the least.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,760
You're thinking of Shanghai Noon.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Now, what movie is it that you're thinking of?

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
You're thinking of Almost Heroes.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,840
Oh, no.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,480
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
I made a Farley Candy goof.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,240
In case anyone was wondering, Almost Heroes was another movie poster

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
I had on my wall for a long time.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Let's be fair.

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
First off, that's fucking bananas.

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
But let's be fair.

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,920
John Candy was a very, very fast man, very expedient.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,240
Yeah, for once so large, quite graceful.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,080
In his prime, which is to say when he was alive, John Candy could hoof it.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
Mm-hmm, this is my brother-by-brother meeting advice show for the modern era.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
God, I miss you, John Candy.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
I know, right?

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,160
I genuinely do.

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,880
Did you know that motherfucker shot his entire role in Home Alone in a single day?

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,960
Did you know that almost his entire part was improvised?

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,480
Jesus, that too, but still, one day in a, these Hollywood magic doesn't exist anymore

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,360
because every single second of The Avengers took four whole weeks to shoot.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,600
That's true.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
Every second, every frame.

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
That's true.

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,360
Actually, at one point, Chris Helmsworth died and was replaced by his brother, Liam Helmsworth.

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,760
Exactly.

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
And no one noticed.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,040
No one noticed.

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
Nobody even noticed.

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Do you think that'll happen to one of us someday?

62
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,720
Griffin, I can't be sure it hasn't already.

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,440
It's true.

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
We all look so similar.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
With podcast magic these days.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
Yeah, that's a good point.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
Let's get right into the advice.

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
How do you break up with someone you aren't at something?

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
Okay, that's easy.

70
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,840
Sorry, Desk.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm out of here.

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,360
Sorry.

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
We had a good run, Coffee Mug.

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,600
You can tell Griffin and I just named the four things our eyes laid on.

75
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,760
This is how improvisational comedy happens.

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,240
Don't say no and just name the things that you see in front of you.

77
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,160
Those are the two things.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,960
Recite them.

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,520
Yes, and I see a cupholder.

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
How do you break up with someone you aren't actually dating?

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,480
I connected with the gentleman on an online dating site.

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,680
We started texting and went out on one coffee date.

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,400
Then he started texting me all the time, making plans way too far in the future.

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
Like where would we go for Christmas dinner?

85
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,200
Oh no.

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,960
He even sent flowers to my office.

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
I tried to tell him he was coming on too strong, but to no avail.

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
How could I break it off with him when it was never really on?

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
That's from mystified miss in the Midwest.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,120
I could probably shed some light on this situation,

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,720
being probably the only one of the three of us who did this, who did the online dating.

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,440
I didn't, I mean, not that I went straight up Christmas crazy, but-

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,160
Okay, I thought that's what you were saying.

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,640
I don't like to think about where I'm having Christmas dinner.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:06,960
Yeah.

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,440
Right.

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
So what you do, and let me tell you from first-hand experience, it's very effective.

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,480
Just don't ever respond to anything they say ever, ever again,

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,360
because that's the real beauty of internet, is that you can just turn your-

100
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
When I block somebody on Twitter, they die.

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
Did you know that?

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,480
I've heard that.

103
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
They're dead.

104
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
They are for all intents and purposes.

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,160
If I never see or talk to you or experience you ever again, you're dead.

106
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,960
And that's really the-

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,160
But Griffin, you're dead.

108
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,440
And that's really the-

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,840
Here's the one thing about this question, though, that freaks me out,

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,400
is that she could totally easily do that, but the gentleman has already sent flowers to her office.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,160
What if he just starts bombarding her cubicle with the teddy bears with hearts that say,

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,000
why don't you tweet me anymore?

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Ah, that's the other beauty of online dating, Travis, is because this person is online dating,

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,120
they are not going to be brave enough to do any of those things.

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,840
So you are made in the shade.

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,320
Just let this Adams half-life just decay slowly and then it's gone.

117
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,360
What about the texts?

118
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,760
The texts, not a big deal.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,960
They're not going to keep that up.

120
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,480
He's got pride.

121
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,840
He's not going to let 12 texts go unanswered.

122
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,720
Maybe 10.

123
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
You're suggesting full cold shoulder.

124
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm suggesting two cold shoulders.

125
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,280
I know.

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
This is what always happens to me.

127
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,760
So wait a little while.

128
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,800
Don't respond to them.

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,120
And then in like a month, respond to one with, who is this?

130
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,000
No, no, no.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,280
No, and I'll tell you why.

132
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,040
Because whenever I get that text from someone, I always just assume that they've gotten a

133
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,280
new phone and this is someone else who now has this phone number.

134
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,200
That's like, it's Travis.

135
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,080
And they're like, oh, okay.

136
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Wait, now how does it, I've never actually seen, Travis is in the same room as me.

137
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,120
I've never been able to see one of these bad ideas formulated in person.

138
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,640
Now, can you explain, what has helped by texting them, who is this?

139
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,960
Then they get embarrassed and either think that you've forgotten about them or that you're

140
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
somebody new and then they stop texting you.

141
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,000
It's way better than a straight up denial and shoot down to pretend like you no longer

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,120
know who they are.

143
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,320
Justin, I imagine that when Travis is formulating one of these things, like a thick cloud of

144
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:30,960
purple dumb smoke, like comes out of his mouth and ears and just envelops his entire body

145
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
forming a cocoon of idiocy.

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,520
Here's the weird thing, you guys are not going to believe this, but steam just pours

147
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
out of his ears.

148
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
He looks like Herman Munster, it's bizarre.

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
You said you'd never tell anyone that.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,600
Don't rub the salt in the wound, just let him die.

151
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,840
Well, it depends, but I'm just saying it depends on how quickly he picks up on it.

152
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,000
If after like three texts and no response and like you blocking him on stuff, he's like,

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
okay, great, I get it.

154
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,920
I'm saying if he's still texting you like four times a day, every day for like two months,

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,200
you can't just assume that he's going to get the hint and stop contacting you.

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,840
Yeah.

157
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,960
You got to do something.

158
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,480
You got to step up and I mean, at some point you might just have to say, if it gets to

159
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,920
that point, just say like, Hey, I, this is done.

160
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
This isn't going anywhere.

161
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
This was never anything.

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,000
Please don't contact me anymore.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
Oh, can we, uh, can we do a sidebar?

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,480
Sure.

165
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,360
Uh, this is, this is for the person on the other end of this question, which is to say

166
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,840
probably a few of our listeners, probably a lot of our listeners.

167
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,800
If you're online dating, this is the worst.

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,080
This is the, this is the worst period.

169
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,040
That's the end of the sentence.

170
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,640
That's the whole thing.

171
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,040
Don't do this. You've done it all wrong from, from a to Z.

172
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,760
As cool as you need to play it with regular dating, you need to play it

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,200
900 times cooler when you're, when you're, when you're doing that online stuff.

174
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
Now, why is that Griffin?

175
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,680
Because, because people, when they meet online, they're like skittish little birds.

176
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
They're like little birds.

177
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,440
And if you try and squeeze them too tight in your hand, they will die in your hand.

178
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
They're leasing birds because you love them so much.

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,560
Now at the beginning, because at the beginning you are distracted by the fact that,

180
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,200
you know, your, your, your relationship is built on a pretty thin basis,

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,760
which is a computer thought we'd love each other.

182
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Yeah.

183
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
And I mean, eventually you'll have more to go on than that, but that's a pretty-

184
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,040
But based on, based on like my Amazon suggested buys,

185
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
like a computer I think is able to make that decision for us now.

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
Oh, no doubt.

187
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
I think a computer is there.

188
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,000
But what's great is on that first date, you have the option of just getting up and leaving

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
just late and then like not having to worry about it ever again.

190
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,720
It's one of my favorite things about the website.

191
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,040
Okay.

192
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,440
Cupid.

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,760
Cause it's built into the name of your acceptance of whatever the website tells you to do.

194
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah, sure.

195
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Okay.

196
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,280
Cupid.

197
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,400
Whatever you say.

198
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,040
All right.

199
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,080
You're driving this train.

200
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah.

201
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
Keep it cool.

202
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,880
Don't, just don't text.

203
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,760
Don't, just don't-

204
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Don't bring up the words Christmas dinner ever again.

205
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,120
Don't mention, when you are on a blind online date, holidays do not exist.

206
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
Neither do your family.

207
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Living that, living this moment.

208
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,480
Keep it super fish.

209
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,840
What you talking about?

210
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,200
What you're eating and drinking.

211
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
That's the only few things-

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,520
How about those Olympics?

213
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,000
Use it.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,120
I'm giving that to you.

215
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Once she's done eating her dinner, it's gone.

216
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,840
It never happened.

217
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,440
She might, you might need to eat a second dinner to really commit to how in the moment you're going to be.

218
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Now, if you're in your fifties or sixties, everything I just said out the window, first date, start talking plans.

219
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,720
Start figuring it out.

220
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Well, that's like old people catnip.

221
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,280
They'll eat that up.

222
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,320
Oh, they love that shit.

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,880
They love it.

224
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,160
It's old people optimism.

225
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,040
They love that.

226
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,520
Anything.

227
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
You know how we've been around for Christmas?

228
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,240
Let's talk about it.

229
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,720
Yeah.

230
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm thinking about building a shed.

231
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
Tell me more.

232
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
How long is it going to take?

233
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,560
Where are you going to get your supplies?

234
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,600
The depot?

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,520
You're going to totally be allowed to finish it.

236
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,040
Griffin, I need a Yahoo answer question.

237
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,600
Sure.

238
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
Here's one.

239
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
It was sent in by Spummy or Spumy.

240
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
Still haven't decided.

241
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
Thank you.

242
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,360
It's by Yahoo.

243
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,000
It's user Carly who asks, do teens in high school have parties like in Superbad?

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because I have not once seen a party like that.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,760
I am a junior now and I haven't really seen it.

246
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,520
Any of you guys been to parties like that?

247
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,160
I'm not a mom pretending to be a kid at all.

248
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm not an undercover officer.

249
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Anybody seen any parties where underage kids are drinking?

250
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,000
Can I tell you the best answer I have to this is that there's a sort of a fraternity row

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,120
here in Huntington that I have driven past and I think that there have been parties like

252
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
that in there.

253
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,280
Like, it looks very fun.

254
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,720
It looks like they're having a good time.

255
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
I've seen these parties.

256
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,440
I've seen the after effects of a party and believe that once there was a party there,

257
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,280
but I've never actually caught it in the act.

258
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,520
Right.

259
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,880
Yeah, it's sort of like Oasis-like.

260
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
When I approach a party like that, it dissipates.

261
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,440
I don't know.

262
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,280
I don't know.

263
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:21,360
I think if everybody thinks back, I think everybody in their time goes to one party

264
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,360
that is way cooler than they are and you realize it in that perfect moment, like, holy shit,

265
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,480
I'm at a super bad party or an animal house party if you're not 12 and then you just try

266
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,280
to live it up.

267
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,480
You try to just, you try to experience it as hard as you possibly can because it's never,

268
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,400
ever, ever going to happen again.

269
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,360
It's like Narnia.

270
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,000
Once you go back looking for it, it won't be there.

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
I remember mine.

272
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,160
I remember mine.

273
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
We watched Jurassic Park and Laserdisc.

274
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,360
Fuck me, Justin.

275
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
That's the saddest thing.

276
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,280
No, but later there was a, got pretty crazy because we watched a bootleg VHS of Into the

277
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Woods.

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,400
Oh my Christ child.

279
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,160
It got pretty good.

280
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,920
Pretty good.

281
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,400
I don't have to deal with Travis's disapproving looks.

282
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,960
He's like actually physically here looking at me.

283
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,880
See, this is great because the people at home don't know how hard I'm judging Justin right

284
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
now to answer your question real hard.

285
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,800
I think I went to one and I did not, it was like a friend of mine was like, let's go to

286
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
this party.

287
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
And I thought it was going to be like every other party I went to, but it ended up being

288
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,480
like a full blown, our parents are like, his parents weren't even out of town.

289
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,560
His parents were like, really asleep.

290
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,640
His parents were like fucking going to see the lake house or something.

291
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,360
And like, he was like, we got an hour and a half window while they're in trance by Keanu

292
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,680
Reeves.

293
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,240
Let's do this.

294
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
Let's, you know, let's drink and let's hanky pank.

295
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,240
And it actually got broken up by his parents while I was there.

296
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,800
Oh my God.

297
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,440
I swear to God.

298
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
It's the only time that's ever happened to me.

299
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
And it felt so, we left that party.

300
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
I felt like some sort of conquering king.

301
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,560
When I see that scene in any movie where like, you know, it's going to be pretty chill.

302
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,480
I got cheese plate for me and my six friends.

303
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,520
Is that all that is coming?

304
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,800
And then it's like, cut to the whole house, like full of teens and somebody smashes a

305
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,120
vase.

306
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
And this scene is in basically every movie.

307
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
There's like, you know, Hey, who are you?

308
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,320
Dillop?

309
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,600
No, I'm Phil.

310
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,560
I live here.

311
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,280
Okay, man.

312
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,160
We're a party on.

313
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,640
That scene is more terrifying to me than any horror film I've ever done.

314
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,120
I cannot imagine.

315
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,520
First off, it's bad enough that you're in a huge, huge party.

316
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,480
That's pretty brutal.

317
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,720
But an introvert like myself, if you were planning, if you're looking forward to intimate

318
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,480
get together with friends, maybe a couple of board games, and then it turned into a

319
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:54,880
party.

320
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,840
Oh my God.

321
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,040
I want to puke just thinking about it.

322
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
I would just call the police on myself.

323
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,840
Could someone please come down here and help me break this up?

324
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,720
Can you throw everyone out of our house except for the six people who are going to play cards

325
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
against humanity with me, please?

326
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,800
I was just planning a quiet risk night.

327
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,640
And now I'm so scared.

328
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,080
You ruined my risk night.

329
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,000
That has an allure when you're young.

330
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Because when I was at that party and realized like, Oh my God, this is an illegal party.

331
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,840
I was so down.

332
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,880
But I think at the tender age of 25, as I am now, I think if I went to somebody's house

333
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,840
and there's a crazy party going on outside and it's like, Hey, man, is this your house?

334
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,000
And they're like, Nah, man, I'm house sitting for my brother.

335
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,080
I would just be like, Oh, thank you and leave.

336
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,960
Because I don't want to be, I would be so uncomfortable at that party.

337
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,760
This is, or you're breaking and entering basically.

338
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,240
Yeah.

339
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,600
You know, I think back to, I remember being in college and my roommate and best friend

340
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,880
Brent and I would often like just try to find a party.

341
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,360
And we went through a period, which was really weird, where we would just like try to find

342
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
a friend of a friend of a friend, anything.

343
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,120
So we weren't bored and meeting new people because we were hanging out with the exact

344
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,160
same people every weekend.

345
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,160
And now I think about that, and if I rolled up to a party and it was just crazy wild,

346
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,280
even if it was like my friends throwing the party, how, how just against it all I would

347
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,080
be like, Oh man, I just want to sit down, like drink a glass of red wine.

348
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,160
You get to this point where you realize I actually, it actually happened to me in my

349
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,320
fifth year of college and no comments from the peanut gallery, but my fifth year college,

350
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,080
that's my, that's my old man voice.

351
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,400
My fifth year college, I was talking to my college friends and we were like, where are

352
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,960
the parties?

353
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,600
And then we realized, we were like, we never hear about parties going on anymore.

354
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
And then it's like, hold on a second.

355
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,960
I don't think people, we actually thought for a few minutes, like, why doesn't anybody

356
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,160
do parties anymore?

357
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,120
Why does everybody stop throwing parties?

358
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
Wait a minute.

359
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
Nobody asked us to go to them.

360
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,880
I work in an office where I spend most of my days sitting down and talking to people.

361
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,200
Office where I spend most of my day sitting in a cubicle.

362
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,360
My coworkers are older than me and they decorate their cubes, pictures of their spouses, kids

363
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,160
and pets.

364
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,080
Whenever they come into my cube, they always comment on how I haven't decorated it at all.

365
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,160
Decorated it at all.

366
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,360
Yeah, I got the right number.

367
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,760
There we go.

368
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,320
I am a single guy without any kids or pets and I need some decorating ideas that are

369
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,760
personal enough to be interesting, but still appropriate for work.

370
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,720
Any suggestions?

371
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,840
That's from memento lists in Memphis.

372
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,880
Oh, man.

373
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
Now I'm bummed.

374
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
Well, I mean, you could do toys.

375
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:39,520
Like, I've got in my cubicle a Harry Houdini bobblehead, a Superman bust, and a donkey

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,360
figurine from Shrek that talks.

377
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,760
Go fuck yourself.

378
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,960
What?

379
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,440
Why?

380
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,940
Griffin?

381
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,920
No, Travis.

382
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,880
You're an adult.

383
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,160
I am an adult.

384
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm an adult that works at a theater.

385
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,400
You're going to be somebody's husband soon and you have a Shrek toy on your desk where

386
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,960
you work.

387
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,040
He talks.

388
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,680
He says, like, you know what else is better than parfaits?

389
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,000
You know when someone says, you want parfaits?

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,280
He says, hell no, I don't want parfaits.

391
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,400
Parfaits are delicious.

392
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
It's hilarious.

393
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
That was word for word.

394
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,400
You have used this toy so much that you have memorized that entire soliloquy.

395
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,120
It's great.

396
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,320
It's a good thing.

397
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
And he also makes jokes about Shrek farting.

398
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,920
He says, like, shoo, Shrek, did you just rip one off?

399
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,240
I have my mouth open and everything.

400
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,040
It's pretty great.

401
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm just saying.

402
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,320
I hate you so much.

403
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,360
It's just a pretty good thing.

404
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Justin spit coffee all over his keyboard.

405
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,160
He had to go.

406
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,680
Did he really?

407
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,680
Yeah, he's cleaning it up.

408
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,200
OK.

409
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,400
Idiot.

410
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,040
You're so dumb.

411
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,400
You're a stupid Shrek doll.

412
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,240
What about there's going to be something you like, right?

413
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,120
About Doctor Who.

414
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
There's a bunch of Doctor Who memorabilia.

415
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
I also have a Dalek clock.

416
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,800
That's what Sidney's got in her office, and it looks awesome.

417
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:05,200
She's got a bunch of Doctor figures and adipose and whatever song.

418
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,600
It's great.

419
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,040
You guys are thinking about the fashion of the desk, what it's going to do for you.

420
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,240
What you've got to think about when it comes to desk management is the function of it.

421
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
What's it going to do for everybody?

422
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,440
In my mind, I think you've either got to go full-blown minimalist,

423
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
just your keyboard, mouse, and screen.

424
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,320
That's it.

425
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,440
And those are the only things you have.

426
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,000
And if your cubicle isn't already stark white from floor to ceiling,

427
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
then go ahead and paint that.

428
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,200
And the opposite side of that is you clutter your desk with so much garbage

429
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,640
that everybody thinks you are the busiest man in the whole world.

430
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
Oh, yeah, right.

431
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,040
You've got to look like an old-timey newspaper reporter.

432
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,960
You've got to have stacks of papers, six half-empty coffee cups,

433
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,160
which are sometimes called mugs, and pins scattered around,

434
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:14,800
and two briefcases, a sandwich wrapper from the deli nearby,

435
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,400
empty Skittles bags, because busy people eat Skittles.

436
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,120
Right.

437
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,320
There was a lady that I worked with at the newspaper,

438
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,400
one of the newspapers I worked at, who had a jar of candy on her desk.

439
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,920
And the deal was, if you came over and took some candy, you had to talk to her.

440
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,400
And not like- Wait, wait, wait.

441
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,440
Was that a stated deal?

442
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,800
This was not like an unwritten social contract.

443
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,640
This was a deal vocalized by her.

444
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh, no.

445
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,320
Well, if you're taking some candy, gotta stay and chat.

446
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,240
I'm so crushingly lonely.

447
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,120
Please.

448
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,160
There's a bear trap installed on a table,

449
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,840
and if I see you try to pull your hand out of that jar with some sixlets,

450
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
without chatting me up first, say goodbye to your paw.

451
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,160
It's in the jar.

452
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,280
How's your sugar daddy, huh?

453
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
How's your thing about my sugar daddy?

454
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,960
How's your family?

455
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,160
That must be nice to have that.

456
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,600
Basically, all I got are my wrestling tapes that I made in the 80s.

457
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,800
I taped a bunch of wrestling.

458
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,000
I watched those, and I do have a ferret.

459
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,120
I had a ferret.

460
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,080
He left.

461
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,200
He ran away.

462
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,320
He moved away.

463
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,280
That's my life.

464
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,320
I know, Deborah.

465
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
It's the same thing you've been telling me for the past 17 weeks.

466
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,480
Nothing has evolved.

467
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,200
Well, time to go enjoy these sixlets.

468
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,920
Thanks for the conversation.

469
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,880
Totally worth it.

470
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm going to start going to the store.

471
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
I'll buy my own candy.

472
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,480
What about if you put up pictures of everyone else's family?

473
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,880
That is a bad idea on 14 discrete levels.

474
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
I can't see how this could possibly go wrong.

475
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,480
Other people's family that you do work with or that you don't work with?

476
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,280
That you do work with.

477
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Just ask if you could photocopy their pictures.

478
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,960
Well, that's the ball game, folks.

479
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,440
Oh, man.

480
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
Just buy frames that already have pictures in them.

481
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
This is me at my eight weddings.

482
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,880
Right here?

483
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
This is me graduating from high school.

484
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,160
This is my son, Kevin.

485
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,040
I love him very much.

486
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,120
This is me and my whole family in raincoats.

487
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
As you can see, we love sailing.

488
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,160
We love to sail.

489
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,280
This is my sailing ship.

490
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
I have a picture of it.

491
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
I built this model of my sailing ship.

492
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,240
We take it out.

493
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,120
We sail.

494
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,680
We sail.

495
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,520
Just a big sailing family.

496
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
Can you just have empty frames?

497
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,760
And then if somebody asks what happened, just say a terrible tragedy happened.

498
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,440
Something terrible.

499
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
Ghosts took the...

500
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,320
Oh, somebody traveled back in time and erased my path.

501
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,040
These used to have really great, beautiful pictures of my children in it.

502
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,040
Someone traveled back in time and stopped me from meeting what was to be my wife.

503
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
And it was my son, so fuck him.

504
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,480
Fuck that kid.

505
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,560
He's imaginary now.

506
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,840
Yeah, he doesn't exist anymore.

507
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,160
It's very, very...

508
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm starting a charity.

509
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,080
If you'd like to donate $20, then you can also have some candy.

510
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
Just put empty frames up and then have little post-its on them.

511
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,920
Like one will say mother and one will say son.

512
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,360
To do.

513
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,240
Find a son.

514
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,840
Find son.

515
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,120
That would be great if somebody came by and were like,

516
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
why are all these picture frames empty?

517
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
Stand up and be like, like you just realized.

518
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,440
Like, oh fuck, not again.

519
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,280
Strap on the time belt and then disappear.

520
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,240
You've got to disappear.

521
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
That's going to be the hard part of this.

522
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
You got to have a TARDIS right next door.

523
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,120
Yeah.

524
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,920
I'll be right back.

525
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
Hey, do you have any creative ideas for fundraisers?

526
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm raising money to spend two years in Nicaragua.

527
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,360
Volunteering and I'm a little short of my goal.

528
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:53,840
Thanks.

529
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,060
Evide.

530
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,440
Can you kickstart a Nicaragua trip?

531
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,280
You can kickstart pretty much.

532
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,560
If I wanted to go to Hardee's, but I didn't want to pay like the four bucks for

533
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,800
a sandwich of sausage and eggs, then I could kickstart that.

534
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,160
Let's kickstart my brother, my brother and me Hardee's party.

535
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,360
And it's basically like however much money we get, that's how many people.

536
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,520
Okay.

537
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,560
To start, we need $500,000 to build a Hardee's.

538
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:20,880
What?

539
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,800
There's a Hardee's in Route 60.

540
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
You guys have Hardee's here?

541
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,640
Go get it.

542
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,960
We'll need at least, I think we're in pretty good with Andrew WK.

543
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,720
So he'll probably cut us a pretty sweet deal to record a version of a song.

544
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,960
When it's time to party, we will party hard ease.

545
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,080
Breakfast fundraising experience.

546
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,960
When it's time to party, we will party hard ease.

547
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
What are the California raisins doing?

548
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,680
Will they come back?

549
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,360
I will put on a garbage bag and dress like a California raisin for you.

550
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,600
This is going to be a really good party.

551
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm really excited about this.

552
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,720
You guys, this is going to be like a super bad party.

553
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
You're welcome.

554
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,520
I went to my super bad party.

555
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
It was at a Hardee's on Route 60.

556
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,960
They had a little slide.

557
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,480
It was awesome.

558
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,840
It was a little arty farty.

559
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,160
What are we doing?

560
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,720
It's Hardee's.

561
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,360
It's no Sardee's, but it was a Hardee's party.

562
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,080
Just don't be, don't be tardy.

563
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Oh, for Christ's sake, move on.

564
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Get a ride with my friend Marty to the Hardee's party.

565
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,320
Next.

566
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,160
My friend Marty erased all my pictures.

567
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Creative ideas for fundraisers.

568
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,240
I think if I saw a grown woman selling lemonade, that would be pretty crazy.

569
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,560
I think I would probably donate to her because I'd assume she had fallen on hard times.

570
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,320
Especially if some of the letters were backwards.

571
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,680
If she put like womenade.

572
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,880
Wait, not women, not women.

573
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
I actually think you could be arrested for selling womenade on the street.

574
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,120
Excuse me, you got a permit for this womenade?

575
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,400
You sound adorable, officer.

576
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,600
No, I mean, is lemonade, is lemonade, is womenade, lemonade sold by women?

577
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,480
What is it?

578
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,360
I thought it was lemonade sold for women.

579
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,240
Like made of them.

580
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,320
Like you put a spigot in the side of a woman and womenade comes out.

581
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,560
It's adorable.

582
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,280
It's 100% pure, fresh lemonade.

583
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,120
This is like, I feel like a new energy beverage, a new vitamin water is invented every week

584
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,880
and womenade is our fucking meal ticket.

585
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,380
I know.

586
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,400
Here's what it's got.

587
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,320
It's got a natural balance of electrolytes.

588
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
It's going to help you rehydrate.

589
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,000
It's also got estrogen because that's something that's in ladies.

590
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,560
Here's what you do.

591
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,640
You can also B12 and whatever is in red wine that makes you not get Alzheimer's.

592
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,920
You take a regular country time lemonade, you cut it with water because vitamin drinks

593
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,720
can't taste as good as normal drinks and then you throw a one a day women's supplement in there.

594
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,920
That's okay.

595
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,680
And then just a dash of red wine.

596
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,120
Hey guys, let me throw this out.

597
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,920
Let me eat you with this.

598
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,420
Okay.

599
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,720
Okay.

600
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
The spokesperson, Ray Liotta.

601
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
Ray Liotta for womenade.

602
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
I think we should get a woman.

603
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
That's a brave choice.

604
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,600
That seems pretty cut and dry.

605
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,560
I don't like it.

606
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,200
Too obvious.

607
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:29,040
Too obvious. You know what women these days are so concerned about is osteoporosis.

608
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,520
So womenade does have ground up bones in it.

609
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,080
Yeah.

610
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,360
So you can get your calcium.

611
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,920
It is.

612
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,600
It's the chunks that let you know it's working.

613
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,120
It does make it a little mealy.

614
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
It makes it sort of sludge like.

615
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,000
Hey guys, what would you think of this as like a mascot?

616
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,280
The little animated baby from Ally McBeal.

617
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,920
I love it.

618
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,440
Your biological clock's ticking and it's counting down to womenade time.

619
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,600
Crack open a fresh womenade with the baby from Ally McBeal and Ray Liotta, our spokespeople.

620
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,080
Get out of here, baby.

621
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,440
You're creeping me out.

622
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
This is Ray Liotta's voice.

623
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,600
They promised him that they were going to CGI the baby in later, but they never did.

624
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,160
Did you see that fucking womenade commercial?

625
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,600
Ray Liotta is losing it.

626
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,640
I'm losing my mind over this.

627
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Look at him with his little diaper.

628
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,880
Doing that little dance.

629
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,480
What do you call that, baby?

630
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,800
It's just, hey baby, get back here.

631
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,480
Hey, hold this drink for a second, baby.

632
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,520
I got a womenade.

633
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,640
I gotta pitch womenade.

634
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,800
Gotta sell the people on it.

635
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,960
Ooga chaka.

636
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,840
Right, baby?

637
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,480
You like that?

638
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,120
Ooga chaka, right baby?

639
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,840
Remember that?

640
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
Remember when you and Pyrrha McNichol?

641
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
Man, I love that show.

642
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,400
This, I feel like womenade idea is going to make us a lot of money, but in the meantime,

643
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,480
we could make money by going to the money zone.

644
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,680
Hey, building a website?

645
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,120
Dummy?

646
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,240
Can't do it on yourself?

647
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,880
I don't blame you.

648
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,040
I don't know how to build them either, but here's what you need to do.

649
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
You need to get the all new Squarespace 6.

650
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,040
It's got beautiful new templates.

651
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,400
Dummy.

652
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,080
It's got drag and drop interface.

653
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,120
It's got responsive design, social media connectivity.

654
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,320
You don't know what that means?

655
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,120
Tough noogies.

656
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,280
Squarespace is going to walk you through it all.

657
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,560

God, Jesus, guys.

665
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,200
I know.

666
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,840
If our listeners have had a hard day, you think that's going to make it any easier?

667
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,960
Now they can build a website to cry about it.

668
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,360
Okay.

669
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
There'll be JavaScript.

670
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,720
Click a button to make me cry.

671
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm an internet baby.

672
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm an internet baby.

673
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,640
My feelings are hurt.

674
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
Ray Liotta, can you see me dancing around?

675
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
Oh, cuddle me, Ray Liotta.

676
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,880
Cuddle me, Ray Liotta.

677
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,400
You nurture me, Ray Liotta.

678
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm an internet baby from Alley McBeal for women.

679
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,440
Make all my problems go away, Ray.

680
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,800
Scoop me up in your arms and rub my soft cheek on your bristle.

681
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,000
Protect me from everything that could possibly happen to me, Ray Liotta.

682
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,520
Your breath smells like chewed up cigarettes and old whiskey.

683
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,960
I love you, Ray Liotta.

684
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,160
I'm an internet baby.

685
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
The mackerel has hurt my feelings.

686
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,840
Well, well, well.

687
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,040
Wrap me up in your old leather coat and drive me-

688
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,600
We'll watch Wild Hogs together, Ray Liotta.

689
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,840
You can tell me what it was like working with Tim Allen.

690
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,360
I won't understand the big words.

691
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,600
You have to slow down.

692
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,360
Because I'm a baby.

693
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,280
Because I'm an internet baby, Ray.

694
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,040
I love you.

695
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,920
You're my new dad.

696
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,720
Oh, God.

697
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,120
Travis, your pile of media you don't like anymore

698
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,600
has become a threat to me and others that you love.

699
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,480
They're my babies.

700
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,440
Leave me alone.

701
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,800
Will you sell your babies?

702
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,520
Yes.

703
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,680
You go to a bunda trade for five years.

704
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,000
They've been perfecting the media trade in biz.

705
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,640
They take 25% more things than anybody else.

706
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,440
And they're going to give you 10% more for your CDs, DVDs, video games,

707
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,200
and gadgets like iPhones, iPods, and Androids.

708
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
So I don't know why you get rid of an Android.

709
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,840
Trade-in data.

710
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,880
Trade-in data.

711
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,760
Get some money.

712
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,960
On trade-ins valued $25 or greater, you're going to get free shipping.

713
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,680
And our listeners can get an extra 10% on their trade-ins.

714
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,720
So that's even more money for you.

715
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,880
Go to a bunda trade, A-B-U-N-D-A-T-R-A-D-E.com forward slash my brother.php.

716
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,320
And you're going to get that extra 10% on your babies

717
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
that you used to love and now are money.

718
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,800
You want a Yahoo?

719
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,920
Yes.

720
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,600
I do. I was going to ask for that.

721
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,280
This Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

722
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,840
Thank you, Lisa.

723
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:09,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user MarleyCanFly with two Ys, who asks,

724
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,320
how can I make a homemade engagement ring?

725
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,240
I am ready to propose to my girlfriend of over a year,

726
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,880
but we're in college, so you can imagine that money is tight.

727
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,160
I want to make a ring by Thursday night, which is when I am proposing.

728
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,880
It doesn't have to be super fancy, as I know eventually

729
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,560
I will buy her something nice.

730
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,720
I just need something to show I care and love her.

731
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,320
Please help, smiley face.

732
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,640
Hey, bro, you're doing this all wrong.

733
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,720
Now, we haven't dealt with this on the show,

734
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,000
but one of us just recently went through the very similar process.

735
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,720
Yes, I got engaged a couple weeks ago.

736
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,160
And let me tell you, here's the thing, bro.

737
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,840
It's real easy to say like, hey, I made you this ring out of a coat hanger

738
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,400
and I love you.

739
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,760
Will you marry me forever?

740
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,880
The point is that you cared enough about it to save up and get this beautiful ring.

741
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
It's not so much that.

742
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
You cared enough to make a ring.

743
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,720
Yeah, I think it's more of a, hey, I am a good partner to share your life with

744
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,680
because I have enough financial stability to purchase this.

745
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,920
It's that, and also to say, I've been thinking about this for long enough

746
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,440
to save the money.

747
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm truly committed to this idea and not like, hey,

748
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,720
you made me a really nice dinner Monday night, so now I'm totally sold on it.

749
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,920
Let's do this.

750
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,240
I mean, are we talking pipe cleaners?

751
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,320
That seems like the number one thing.

752
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,080
Get yourself some popsicle sticks.

753
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,360
Popsicle sticks, preferably not the ones with jokes on them.

754
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
After all, this is a formal event.

755
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,320
And just wrap up a pipe cleaner around like a marshmallow for a gem.

756
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,440
I think that would be beautiful.

757
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,160
No, that's good.

758
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,360
What about, can I propose just a, no pun intended.

759
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,600
Just like a, how about a ring pop, but you gotta suck it down for a bit

760
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,440
or else it's just going to be ostentatious.

761
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,800
It's going to be gaudy, too gaudy.

762
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,080
She's not Zsa Zsa Gabor.

763
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,280
Yeah, exactly.

764
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,760
And if they do make like a, I don't know, like a,

765
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,360
do they make like a plain crystal, like rock candy, like a meth-flavored ring pop?

766
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,640
They do, they make a flavorless, colorless ring pop.

767
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,360
But there's tons of flaws in it, so it's not rated very highly.

768
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,560
That's why you gotta suck it down.

769
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,240
You gotta whittle it, you know?

770
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,720
You know how people whittle diamonds?

771
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,080
Right.

772
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,280
Right, here's the thing.

773
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,200
Old timey guys sit on a porch.

774
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,880
And they whittle down their diamonds with their diamond knives.

775
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,760
They get their laser knife out and they just carve it right down.

776
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,720
Oh, lost my thumb.

777
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,600
And also my kneecaps.

778
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,560
And also my kneecaps.

779
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,840
I hate this laser.

780
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,280
Why did I start this?

781
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,720
God, I hate my empty life.

782
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Have you ever watched The Real Housewives of any statehood?

783
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,360
No, never, never.

784
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,320
In fact, I've actively not watched it.

785
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,320
I haven't, let me go ahead and set up this thing I'm about to say by saying I have not either.

786
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,640
But I bet you if you got one of them, like a ring that you had,

787
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,280
like a ring-shaped piece of construction paper that you had cut out and said,

788
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
will you marry me?

789
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,000
They would throw you off the premises of wherever it is that they live.

790
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Okay, but what we haven't taken into consideration is maybe this guy is a blacksmith.

791
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,520
Right.

792
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,680
That he's actually smelting a ring.

793
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,800
Okay, maybe he owns like a blood diamond mine.

794
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,360
Sure, right.

795
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,720
I do like that in his question, he specifies that it doesn't need to be fancy,

796
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,440
as though by Thursday, he's going to learn metallurgy.

797
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
I don't need anything.

798
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,000
It doesn't need to look store-bought.

799
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,600
Yeah, no kidding.

800
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,120
I mean, it'll be electroplated.

801
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,800
But other than that, I only have access to cubic zirconia.

802
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,120
So now if you like learned how to make rings and you actually like put the work into that,

803
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,800
like took a class or something, you know,

804
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,520
you went to the museum and you took a class on ring-making, ring-a-street.

805
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
You took a class on ring-a-street and then you made the ring.

806
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,640
That's special because it wasn't something you wanted to do by Thursday.

807
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,200
Yeah.

808
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,440
Yeah.

809
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,480
Well, and you know, I'll say this, having just done it, after I did it,

810
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,440
after I actually like bought, you know, a nice, somewhat for me, expensive ring,

811
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,960
I felt really adult.

812
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,040
I feel like I'd really earned it and deserve to propose to my girlfriend, you know?

813
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,440
Because I was an adult now and I could pay for a ring than an adult would get.

814
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,280
What was that?

815
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,840
So there.

816
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,640
The losers.

817
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,120
What was that?

818
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,000
I've been googling furiously for like two and a half minutes.

819
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,960
What was that toy?

820
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,560
And it was like a, it's like an Easy-Bake oven, but...

821
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,440
Metal maker.

822
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,080
Metal maker?

823
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah, I believe so.

824
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,280
Was that really?

825
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
I don't think you made rings.

826
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,280
I think you just made tiny dragon and wizard figurines.

827
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,160
You could have proposed to your girlfriend with that.

828
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,800
It was like an Easy-Bake oven, except you put little pewter balls in it

829
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,120
and it would melt the pewter balls down into whatever shape.

830
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,320
No, a metal molder.

831
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,880
That was it.

832
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,760
Metal molder.

833
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't know.

834
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,040
I think you could probably...

835
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,200
Yes, it was metal molder.

836
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,520
You could make something like that work, I feel like.

837
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
I feel like they probably made a ring-shaped thing

838
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,240
and then maybe if you get fancy, you could stick a wizard on it.

839
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,760
Yeah.

840
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,840
And then you put little rhinestones in the wizard's eyes.

841
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,800
Stick a wizard on it.

842
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,560
You stick a wizard on it and you put the gemstones in his eyes and then...

843
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,080
Just fill him with the gemstones.

844
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,720
And then the person knows how much you love them.

845
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,080
Oh, honey, you sought out a 1995 metal molder and you made me a wizard ring.

846
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,520
How did we think that was a good idea for our kids?

847
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,040
How did we not think that there was just gonna be...

848
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
I made a thousand wizards.

849
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,720
And you were the only child in the whole country

850
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,360
who didn't fucking Johnny Tremaine themselves right away.

851
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,600
Fuck, you beat me to Johnny Tremaine.

852
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,280
I mean, damn it.

853
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,680
You opened that door just so you could say Johnny Tremaine, right?

854
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,080
Sometimes I do that for myself.

855
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,360
Hey, kids, read a fucking book.

856
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,040
Johnny Tremaine is a book.

857
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,000
Idiots.

858
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Idiots.

859
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,880
Read it.

860
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,920
Just read it.

861
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,240
I swear to God, last week our listeners were smart.

862
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,920
I don't know what happened.

863
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,320
It's like...

864
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,120
I don't know what happened.

865
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,440
They listen to our show too much in other tones.

866
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,240
I guess.

867
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,400
Hey, brothers, I have a pressing issue.

868
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,120
My best friend started dating a girl last year.

869
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,040
She seems to make him happy and that's great.

870
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920
Here's the problem.

871
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
I really dislike her.

872
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,200
It's not that she's bitchy or mean to me most of the time.

873
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
It's just that I don't like her personality.

874
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,160
They often ask me to hang out with him and a few other friends of ours.

875
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
My question is this.

876
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,720
Should I not hang out with him and so not see my best friend?

877
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,400
Or should I still hang out with him and just grin and bear her company?

878
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
Please, brothers, I need advice.

879
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600
That's from reverse Jesse's girl.

880
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,880
You know, I'm starting to learn and I'm coming to accept this

881
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,680
that as an adult that exists in society, I don't get to play that game anymore.

882
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,280
I used to think I don't like this person so it's completely within my rights

883
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,040
to make it obvious to them that I don't like them

884
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
and I never have to talk to them and I never have to see them.

885
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,560
And then, you know, you have friends that start dating people

886
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,040
and you get jobs and you have kids that start dating people

887
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,600
and all this stuff gets added into your life that you can't control anymore

888
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,000
and you gotta learn the skill of grinning and bearing it.

889
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah, it's a great trick.

890
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,680
Washing your hands with somebody is a great trick that you can do like five times

891
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,760
and then you wake up you're like, I'm alone.

892
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,400
And it really only works till somebody else says,

893
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,640
hey, what's your problem with that person?

894
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,320
And suddenly the scrutiny makes it no longer an available option.

895
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,240
If you ever watched Lost, you'll know that if you spend enough time

896
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,800
with somebody that you at first really hate,

897
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,400
you may get to really like them and perhaps even fall in love with them.

898
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,600
Or Jack and Sawyer.

899
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,160
Or possibly they're an evil ghost.

900
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay.

901
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,880
But if she's an evil ghost, don't you want to unearth that

902
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,400
and save your friend the indignity?

903
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,280
The embarrassment of having dated an evil ghost?

904
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,760
That's what no one ever tells you in that story

905
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,000
where like the guy picks up the hitchhiking girl

906
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and then as he passes her grave, she disappears

907
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,520
and then he just feels so embarrassed.

908
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,400
Oh boy.

909
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,880
I am such a dumbo.

910
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,680
Not again.

911
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,880
Get it together, Chuck.

912
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,720
I was already planning Christmas dinner.

913
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,520
Damn it.

914
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,960
How many times is this, Chuck?

915
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,000
Idiot.

916
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,640
This is just what mother warned you about.

917
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,680
Yeah, this isn't your tough, tough tea.

918
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,880
Yeah, you got to deal with it.

919
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
If you ever send us an email and the question is, he's very happy,

920
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,920
but like just erase the email and then go play Nintendo or something.

921
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,040
Go do something else.

922
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,000
It's like, if you really care about this dude, that's what you want.

923
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
Like that's the goal.

924
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,040
You want him to be happy.

925
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,320
If he's happy, great.

926
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,360
Unless the end of the sentence is,

927
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,640
but I don't think he should be doing as much heroin as he's doing.

928
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,520
Right.

929
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
But then you can step in.

930
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,640
But she does supply him with HM's.

931
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,120
Yeah.

932
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,200
Unless this woman is like shooting sweet, sweet H into his arm every night

933
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,480
as she sings him to sleep.

934
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:06,640
She has bullied him emotionally into forming a radical to semi-radical hate group,

935
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
but he seems to be enjoying himself.

936
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,160
That is a condition under which, but like, I mean, seriously, who knows?

937
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,360
Maybe you'll get to like her.

938
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,240
Maybe you won't.

939
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,840
Newsflash about growing up, you're not going to like most people.

940
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280
There's 6 billion people on earth.

941
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,040
I know like 20 of them.

942
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,360
I know like 20 of them and here's the thing is you're not saying,

943
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,600
I started dating this girl and I don't like her.

944
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,040
You're not involved in this.

945
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
You don't need to make this decision.

946
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,760
You just gotta hang in there.

947
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,400
And maybe, and like, even if you don't like, if she's hurting him, that's one thing.

948
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,680
But if, if it's just that you don't dig her personality, like.

949
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,840
Suck it up.

950
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,320
Tough.

951
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,960
I love you because you listen to our show and maybe you're a donor to Max Fun,

952
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,320
in which case you're right.

953
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,280
God.

954
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,480
Ugh.

955
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,240
That is the service we provide.

956
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,040
We can tell you that the bad life decisions that you're making.

957
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,720
For only $20 a month, we can totally reinforce your behavior.

958
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,040
Yeah.

959
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,280
Right.

960
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,000
But no, it's, it's, it's, I mean, you, you might get, grow to like her.

961
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,200
You might see, if you like this guy and he sees something in her,

962
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,000
maybe, and maybe she doesn't like you.

963
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,760
I mean, that's why she's acting the way she's acting.

964
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,360
And here's some other practical advice that I just know from studying acting.

965
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,880
If you fake it enough, you will eventually grow to like her.

966
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,960
If you grin and bear it enough, if you hang out with them

967
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,400
and you pretend to have a good time and try to convince yourself that she's great,

968
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,880
eventually you'll at least grow to tolerate her,

969
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,440
which is better than what it sounds like you're at now.

970
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,280
And note to those listening at home, especially the young ones,

971
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,400
if someone says to you, here's something I learned from acting,

972
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,080
usually you don't want to do the next thing.

973
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,240
Yeah.

974
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,800
No, but what I said was good.

975
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,160
What's fun is you can actually usually do the opposite to great benefit to your life and health.

976
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,720
Here's something I learned on the floorboards on the stage.

977
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,080
When I was trotting the boards, as we say in the limelight,

978
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,000
as I was practicing the bard.

979
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,360
You just find the nearest sharp thing, put it in them somewhere.

980
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,560
I need a place to store this.

981
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,520
Hey, hold this.

982
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,400
In your tummy.

983
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,800
Thanks.

984
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,200
Christ.

985
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,640
Cool.

986
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,720
Hey, you want another question?

987
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:14,960
Yes.

988
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,520
Another real one?

989
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,840
I've recently started my first office job and I've noticed something unusual.

990
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,280
I attend several meetings each week and frequently hear my co-workers use

991
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,880
expression I've never heard before.

992
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,800
For example, I'm not here to cut down the bush and throw it in the fire.

993
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,120
I'm not here to put the elephant on the table and attack it.

994
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,600
What?

995
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,720
We're up to our eyeballs and alligators and there's a little hair on that.

996
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm going to go over these again because they're fantastic.

997
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,400
I'm not here to cut down the bush and throw it in the fire.

998
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,520
Not a real thing.

999
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,480
Not a thing.

1000
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,040
I'm not going to put the elephant on the table and attack it.

1001
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,880
Physically, physically improbable.

1002
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,320
Do you work at a zoo?

1003
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
If so, that totally works.

1004
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,800
Up to our eyeballs and alligators and there's a little hair on that.

1005
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,840
I understand these in context where they seem weird to me.

1006
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,720
I also find that others pick up on them and start using them too.

1007
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,600
Am I missing something?

1008
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,040
And these are common expressions.

1009
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,320
Any ideas about a new weird expression I could try introducing into the workplace.

1010
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,160
That's from Oblivious in Ontario.

1011
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:18,640
Okay.

1012
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,400
There are two equally awesome situations you've stumbled onto here.

1013
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,400
One, you work at the coolest place ever and people are just coming up with this stuff.

1014
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,440
Two, you work at the coolest place ever and people are fucking with you.

1015
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,040
Before each meeting they say, no, which one are we going to use today?

1016
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,240
Oh, there's a little hair on that?

1017
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,960
Let's do it.

1018
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,920
Is it possible that this is just someone sending back their lunch order?

1019
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,960
There's a little hair on this.

1020
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,640
I can't, is that a new phrase?

1021
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,760
Listen, I hate to be a bother and I really don't want to put the elephant

1022
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,720
on the table and attack it, but you forgot the Swiss.

1023
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,880
Pardon me.

1024
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,560
Listen, I ordered the crocodile and then we are up to our eyeballs in alligators.

1025
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,840
Does this person work in the outback?

1026
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,280
They sound outbacky to me and that might just be like racism.

1027
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,360
Are you saying the restaurant, outback, steakhouse?

1028
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:17,440
No, I mean the outback of the great country continent, which is Australia.

1029
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,080
Australia.

1030
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,280
You know what?

1031
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,240
That country continent stuff, you know that there's other countries in that continent?

1032
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,040
Oh, come on.

1033
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,160
I know.

1034
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,000
I didn't know.

1035
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,800
I found out.

1036
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,200
There are.

1037
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,160
Sure, just like there's other countries in North America.

1038
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,760
Papua New Guinea?

1039
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,720
That's in Australia.

1040
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,200
Yeah.

1041
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,700
What?

1042
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,200
Did you know this?

1043
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,920
I didn't know that.

1044
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,120
Everyone knew it.

1045
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,520
Everyone knew it.

1046
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,400
Is Fiji in there?

1047
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,440
I tricked you, everyone knew it.

1048
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,560
I think that you...

1049
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,200
We should be able to help this person.

1050
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,440
You could say, let's dump this melon.

1051
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,320
Let's dump this melon.

1052
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,120
We say that.

1053
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,160
Just steal stuff from us.

1054
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,760
We say a bunch of dumb stuff that we forget about.

1055
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,720
We say a bunch of fun...

1056
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,080
We say a bunch of shit that's not real shit.

1057
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,600
Rachel googled...

1058
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
We used to say, we say Scrowdy Ralph all the time,

1059
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,400
in reference to a thing that's not the nicest that it could possibly be.

1060
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,240
Yeah, it's a little Scrowdy Ralph.

1061
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,560
And Rachel heard me say that and said, that's not a real thing.

1062
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,720
And I said, it definitely is, and then googled it.

1063
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,200
And the only result was a joystick post that Justin had written like four years ago.

1064
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,560
So it isn't invented.

1065
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,080
It is not real.

1066
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,840
Yeah, so now as far as adopting these phrases,

1067
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,680
that would make me a little nervous.

1068
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,600
Because I can't imagine an office where someone said,

1069
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,560
I'm just going to come up with a few different things

1070
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,600
and see how long before the new hires start using them.

1071
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,120
In which case, that's kind of cool and you're playing along.

1072
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,800
But like, I would make sure that those are going around elsewhere.

1073
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,320
Maybe you need to be at a certain level of the office to be able to use those.

1074
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,240
Like, you're like, yeah, there's a little hair on that.

1075
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,800
And like, whoa, that's a middle management thing.

1076
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,840
That's kind of our thing.

1077
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,080
We've earned that because we've been here for a while.

1078
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,840
Now here's the thing.

1079
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,640
Throughout time and the English language,

1080
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,480
none of our idioms were just there.

1081
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,240
All of them had to be invented at some point.

1082
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,440
So somebody had to say like, let's throw it at the wall and see what sticks.

1083
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:07,920
Hold on.

1084
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,120
Somebody else had to go, what the fuck?

1085
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,480
Does this person maybe work at like an idiom factory?

1086
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,920
That's what I'm saying.

1087
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,800
Maybe you're in a think tank that's just there to come up with idioms.

1088
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,880
Your real job is a ruse.

1089
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,800
It's not a real, like, yeah, we make the little things

1090
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,480
that hold the toilet paper and bathrooms.

1091
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:26,880
You're not.

1092
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,400
There's plenty of people who already do that.

1093
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,080
You're currently being Truman showed.

1094
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,160
You are being Truman showed and you've got to come up.

1095
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,560
You are under a lot of pressure right now to come up with idioms

1096
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,240
that we can pass on to our children.

1097
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,200
Let's just put it this way.

1098
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,800
If you don't start coming up with some of your own,

1099
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,840
it's show and prove time.

1100
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,520
You may have to hit the bricks.

1101
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,560
Yeah, or else you're going to be like a puppy on a skateboard on a boat.

1102
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,440
Listen, you are up to your eyeballs in alligators right now,

1103
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,480
and you need to get it together.

1104
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:48,720
Yeah.

1105
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,360
I am exposed in my job.

1106
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,560
I'm exposed to a sort of surprising amount of corporate speak,

1107
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,520
the kind of language I never thought I would hear growing up.

1108
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,720
Like lewd curse words?

1109
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,720
No, like adult language.

1110
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,400
No, like synchronize synergy.

1111
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,160
Now, I heard one for the first time this last summer.

1112
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,240
We were at a game developers studio

1113
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,680
and they were going to show us some secret stuff

1114
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,840
and they referred to it as opening the kimono.

1115
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,960
Now, if you have not heard this expression, it's ghoulish.

1116
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,520
And there is a great temptation to say,

1117
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,960
I'm going to start saying that.

1118
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,760
Don't.

1119
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,160
What's under the kimono?

1120
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,080
Does that mean they're inviting you to a swinger party?

1121
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,560
I'm going to-

1122
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,120
Who wants to see-

1123
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,160
Listen, we just brought you guys here.

1124
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,640
We're just going to open the kimono, just show you.

1125
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,760
And that's like, it's the expression for like, show you everything.

1126
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,000
And this is like a business thing.

1127
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,400
Who wants to see Mario's penis?

1128
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,520
We're going to open the kimono and happy ending.

1129
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,760
Because that's on special order today.

1130
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,400
It's Mario and Wario's penis.

1131
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,280
Two penises at once underneath this sweet kimono.

1132
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,480
I tell you what, if you're at home

1133
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,440
and you've heard a cool business expression,

1134
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,640
business idiom being thrown around at your office,

1135
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,360
send it to us.

1136
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,360
Maybe we'll read some next week.

1137
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,120
Most of our business terminology that we use

1138
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,200
at my current employer, Polygon,

1139
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,040
are just things that we started joking about

1140
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,920
and then started saying unironically.

1141
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,200
So like, I heard the guys on You Look Nice Today

1142
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,400
say blue sky solutioneering, started saying it as a goof,

1143
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,000
and now we say it for real.

1144
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,120
Now we just actually say, let's blue sky solutioneer this.

1145
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,440
We often refer to ourselves as solutionaristas at work

1146
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,040
because we've got to figure out problems.

1147
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,720
And I wish that that was not true.

1148
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,440
Like if I come up with like a really good idea at work,

1149
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,360
sometimes I'll call it like the final solution.

1150
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,880
I'm dying, son of a bitch.

1151
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,520
All right.

1152
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,200
I don't want to do this podcast.

1153
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,080
I don't either.

1154
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,160
I don't think anybody else does too.

1155
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,800
I'm done with it.

1156
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,080
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

1157
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,080
It's an advice show for the Modron era.

1158
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,480
Thank you so much for listening.

1159
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,240
I'm sorry it got hostile.

1160
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,280
But I do want to thank everybody for tweeting about the show.

1161
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:27,120
Mike Kloss, Noah, Anna Ang, Anna Meyer, Brian Wildsmith,

1162
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,440
Grant Buell, as always, our dear friend, Michael Maney.

1163
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,960
If you haven't gotten a chance to check out

1164
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,120
his NBNBM origin comic, we posted a link to it.

1165
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,080
Man, it's beautiful.

1166
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,640
Make sure you get it.

1167
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,360
How about that Dr. Mudgeon art?

1168
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,240
Our dad's comic column, Dr. Mudgeon,

1169
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,160
he did a piece of art with all of us

1170
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,400
and our significant others in it.

1171
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,000
And it's really dope.

1172
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,320
Thank you to Dan Rubenstein, Samuel Doran,

1173
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,480
and Stoke Romance, Wicked Cheap, Bursar K. Greetness.

1174
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,560
And Rocky Horror is working on the next

1175
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,000
My Brother, My Brother and Me mixtape.

1176
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,760
So if you have any suggestions or requests,

1177
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,160
make sure you tweet at him at Rocky Horror.

1178
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,440
Oh, shit.

1179
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,160
Yeah.

1180
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
Is it going to have Skrillex in it, you think, this time?

1181
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,200
I don't know.

1182
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,280
I think he might do some dubstep breaks.

1183
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:13,520
Good.

1184
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,880
Maybe trip step.

1185
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,520
Who knows?

1186
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,000
Who knows?

1187
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,360
Griffin, did you want to thank anybody?

1188
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,640
I want to thank, of course, John Roderick,

1189
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,400
the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1190
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,440
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1191
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,800
I also want to thank John Roderick for the fruit basket he sent me.

1192
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,520
It was lovely.

1193
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,160
Did he really?

1194
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,040
Yeah.

1195
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,120
What the fuck?

1196
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,360
He heard I got engaged and he was like, hey, congratulations.

1197
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,640
Every week, every week, I push albums from that guy.

1198
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,440
And I don't, that's, that's it.

1199
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,920
Is it possible he just doesn't like you?

1200
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,360
I'm cutting off the gratitude train.

1201
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,640
No, I'm not.

1202
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,200
I'll keep it.

1203
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,840
I'll keep it going.

1204
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,800
I'm sorry.

1205
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,960

Catch that.

00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,720
And anyway, Griffin, I believe you have one more question for us.

1213
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,000
Something for us to grow on.

1214
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,480
Yeah, sure.

1215
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,680
Something for us to ponder, chew on.

1216
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,440
Yeah, this one was sent in by Christopher.

1217
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,080
Thank you, Christopher.

Oh, sorry.
