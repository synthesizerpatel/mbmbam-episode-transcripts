1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,440
All right, get ready to sail the seven seas of comedy with my brother of a brother meeting

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,360
advice show for the modern era brought to you by Pirates of the Caribbean now on Stranger's

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:06,160
Hide.

8
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:32,120
And I'm Davy Jones Coulier, who's the dark pirate of comedy.

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,000
Cut it out or you walk the plank.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,640
So we're three pirates of comedy.

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,560
We've sailed under Jack Sparrow for lo these many years aboard the Black Pearl, taking

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,240
in his tutelage and this is a theme podcast.

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,580
His high seas tutelage.

14
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,240
This is brought to you, of course, by the new Disney picture.

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,440
I think it's going to be a big smash.

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,360
It's Pirates on Stranger Tides.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,400
We, in the know, just call it Pirates because what else could you be talking about?

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,080
I call it P4 because I'm a real fan.

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
Are you going to P4 this weekend?

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
You know it.

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,120
I thought the real fans didn't count three, so this would technically be P3 in the canon.

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,080
In the canon, spelled with two Ns because we're just so crazy about pirate ships.

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,560
All aboard for hilarity.

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,560
So this is a device show, of course, obviously.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,720
We take your questions and turn them, like using the magic of the mysterious island of

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,160
Tortuga, into wisdom.

27
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,120
Like the witchcraft of Teodolma.

28
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Here we go.

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
A torch of destiny.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm just going to say that every time somebody asks.

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,520
My girlfriend refuses to make decisions.

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,600
From things like, what should we do, eat, watch tonight, if you're still figuring out

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
what to watch tonight?

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,940
Why is it just Pirates of the Caribbean 4 on Stranger Tides P4?

35
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,840
To things like, where would you like to go on vacation?

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,920
Or which apartment should we lease?

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,680
Tortuga is the spot.

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,180
I get the same, up to you, matey, response.

39
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,880
I try to counter with, no, no, it's up to you this time, or similar, but at some point

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,680
a decision has to be made.

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,000
How can I force my girlfriend to decide on things from time to time to also indecisive

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,120
in Coral Springs?

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Make her walk the plank.

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
That's A.

45
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,160
Step one.

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,520
Here's an interesting idea.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,700
Here's something that's going to kind of blow your mind.

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,640
She already has told you.

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
Like is not.

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,440
She has already told you where she wants to eat, but now it's a puzzle that you've got

51
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,560
to piece together from the past two days.

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,720
You have to reassemble the clues and figure out-

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,960
So are you saying if she mentioned sushi the day before, you need to say sushi?

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:17,200
When she says, oh, whatever you want, in her head she's screaming, remember when I said

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
sushi?

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,240
Please remember when I said sushi?

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,480
Is that really that special to her, you think?

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Just is it more special that he remembers that like a week ago they watched P4, and

59
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
so like now-

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,840
Now that she wants seafood?

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Wants Long John Silver's.

62
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,040
Well I think that, I think it's broader than that.

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,880
I think it's like, you need to remember that she's allergic to shellfish and not take her

64
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
to Red Lobster.

65
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,200
Well, bitch, I don't think he's going to take her to a place where he's going to kill her.

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,600
That's probably implied in like the off the table choices.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Just like I don't go to the stab restaurant anymore because I hate getting stabbed.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Like it's probably the same thing.

69
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,680
Oh, but their croutons are so good.

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
They are so good.

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,920
They do that thing with the herbs.

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I don't know what it is.

73
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,600
It's something in the oil and it's delicious and it almost makes getting shivved with it.

74
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,560
I'll tell you what it is.

75
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Before they serve that oil, they stab it.

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Yeah.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,920
They stab the oil and it really opens it up.

78
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,600
If you do carry out, they'll just cut your inner thigh like someplace easy to hide.

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Yeah.

80
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,760
And not super deep or like a surface.

81
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,320
I appreciate that.

82
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Yeah.

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,520
We can't go to that restaurant anymore.

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
No.

85
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Yeah.

86
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
I don't care how good this crouton is.

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,960
I go to that restaurant just to feel.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,320
Can we go to Shooties instead?

89
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,920
Shooties is good.

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,240
There is a surprisingly high prices though, which for a restaurant where you get shot

91
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
a lot, I don't understand that.

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,320
Can we go to some of this food is poisoned?

93
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,280
That used to be way better, but it got out by Denny's and now it's way too corporate.

94
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,240
I think all that fake kitsch on the wall where it's not like, you know, it's like, take

95
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,680
my wife, please, ha ha ha, signs.

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,240
You know how Denny's has baconalia now?

97
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Uh huh.

98
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Yeah.

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,440
That was an innovation inspired by some of this food is poison.

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh.

101
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Yeah.

102
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Some of this food.

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Little food facts for you.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Some of this food was poison.

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,840
The challenge there was actually the best and last episode of Man vs. Food.

106
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I miss him still.

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,960
I don't know why their challenge was to eat all the poisoned food and I don't know why

108
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,480
he accepted it, but here we are.

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,760
Also decisive in Coral Springs, that is part one of the advice.

110
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Part two is just start deciding my man.

111
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,080
And I would suggest this, maybe purposefully make some wrong choices until she steps up

112
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
her game.

113
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Okay.

114
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah.

115
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm saying like when she's like, where do you want to eat?

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,680
There's be like McDonald's every time she's like, maybe I'll decide tonight.

117
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
And you're like, okay.

118
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,640
You know that there are a sponsor this week, right?

119
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,200
Oh, that's awkward.

120
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Yeah.

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Just kidding.

122
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Go.

123
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
It's just saying, just take her out.

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Because it's delicious.

125
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,800
Go get some big and tasties and shove them in your mouth.

126
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,160
So go ahead and make those choices.

127
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,920
It may just be hard for her to decide and that's a facet of her personality that you've

128
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,880
got to sort of learn to incorporate.

129
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,120
But also listen to her because she will probably drop hints if you pay attention.

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,160
And a lot of times that's more important than what the food ends up being is sort of

131
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,680
knowing that you were there for her.

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,320
And maybe rather than like one of you making a decision, you can provide options and be

133
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,920
like, well, would you rather have, are you thinking like sushi or are you thinking like

134
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,300
maybe go to like a steakhouse or something and then let her say, well, I'm not really

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,600
feeling in the mood for sushi and make it a discussion rather than one of you has to

136
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,760
make the decision.

137
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,800
Break right up with her.

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Okay.

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
That would be a decision.

140
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Certainly.

141
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,400
Life is too short to suffer indecisive people.

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,480
Just tell me what you want, Catherine.

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
What you really, really, really want.

144
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm 30 year old dude in rural Kentucky and I have a hard time meeting and maintaining

145
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,720
relationships with women because I'm an open atheist.

146
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,240
I'm not confrontational about my lack of belief, but I don't hide it either.

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,160
Whenever a prospective lady friend asks if I will go to church with her or just how much

148
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,900
I love the sweet Lord, baby Jesus, I have to tactfully answer in the negative.

149
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,580
Then I get dumped.

150
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,080
At this point, it has gotten demoralizing.

151
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,220
I know the remedy for my love life would be more urban and educated area, but I'm unwilling

152
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,320
to leave my family in the lurch just so I can have some female companionship.

153
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
What say you brothers three?

154
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,360
Can you shed some insight on my lack of apostate lovin', Wes?

155
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,600
I think you should move to a more rural area.

156
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Yeah.

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,520
A lot of people always eliminate the super easy options, like we can just knock this

158
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
out of the park.

159
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,040
Like you need to move to where there are more people like you, like in your situation.

160
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,520
Or learn to keep your mouth shut.

161
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Kind of.

162
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
One of those two things.

163
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

164
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Hey, how about this?

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,920
When people start talking about how much they love Jesus, why don't you just go in the

166
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,360
other room and make yourself, I don't know, whatever atheists eat.

167
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Like make yourself that.

168
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Why?

169
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
An empty sandwich.

170
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
An empty sandwich.

171
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,160
I feel like you guys are ignoring the easiest solution, which is to accept the love of sweet

172
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,800
Jesus baby in your heart.

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,120
Jesus came on a rocket ship and landed in Kansas low these 33 years ago.

174
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:41,280
He was raised by Mom Pa Kent to save us all from Krypton and from Lex Luthor, and I think

175
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,040
we should all believe in him because he's flying up above us, waving down.

176
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
In space.

177
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,480
And also Green Lantern is there.

178
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,040
Green Lantern is hanging out with him.

179
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Who's that?

180
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,520
Thor is hanging out and they're having God talk.

181
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Just chatting about God stuff.

182
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Yeah.

183
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
My three gods.

184
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,520
My three gods are Green Lantern, Superman, and Thor.

185
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,720
That's my favorite TV show.

186
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
It's my favorite.

187
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
My three gods.

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Yeah.

189
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
It's a pretty good show.

190
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:13,200
Wes, there are many people that I know that I've known for, I don't know, almost a decade

191
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,280
that I, if you put a gun to my head, could not tell me their religious beliefs.

192
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Yep.

193
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
That's the thing.

194
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,960
You say you're not being confrontational, and I believe that you're not, but I also

195
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,160
believe that you're maybe being more vocal about it than you have to be.

196
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Yeah.

197
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
You just gotta keep your mouth shut about it.

198
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
And like, if you get to a point where-

199
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,600
So who else here hates Jesus, right?

200
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Yeah.

201
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Yeah.

202
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Right?

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
That crosses a load of baloney, right?

204
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Like, what are you doing?

205
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,480
I, yeah, I mean, like, just keep your, just don't talk about it.

206
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,520
And that advice, really, like, I kind of think that extends to everybody.

207
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:59,120
Like, it's such a, if alcohol is a social lubricant, then religion is like social silly

208
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
putty.

209
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,800
It just gums up everything, and no real, like, super productive, fun talk can come out of

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
that.

211
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,560
Because the thing is, once you bring it up, that's all you're talking about for like

212
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,920
the next hour and a half until somebody gets up and walks away from the table.

213
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Yeah.

214
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Here's what I think.

215
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,200
If you're an atheist, it means you don't believe in any god, make up a god.

216
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Another one.

217
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
They gotta respect that.

218
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah.

219
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
And also, Wes, look at it this way.

220
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
If you're with a girl that's gonna break up with you because she believes something

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,120
different than you, you don't want to be with her anyways.

222
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,640
But you're saying he's gotta get his nut off, but he's gotta get his nut off, and he doesn't

223
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,280
know where to find girls that will take him.

224
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Get his nut off?

225
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Excuse me?

226
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Pardon me?

227
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,280
He's gotta get his seed out, and he can't find girls that-

228
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,680
His one, is it his nut or his seed?

229
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,720
You're throwing down a lot of arboreal references right now.

230
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
He's gotta plant-

231
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,480
He's gotta germinate his stamen and or pistols.

232
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,280
He's gotta drop some sap, won't that be?

233
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Hey.

234
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Hey.

235
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Hey.

236
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
How about a Yahoo?

237
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Yeah.

238
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Okay.

239
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Give me.

240
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
This one is sent in by Steve Lewis.

241
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Thank you, Steve Lewis.

242
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, oh great.

243
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:11,080
Listen to the Easter Platypus who asks, how long do you think it would take for someone

244
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,000
wearing a Batman suit to be thrown out of the mall?

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,640
Do you think he might get away with it for a couple minutes at least if he pretends to

246
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,960
be there to promote something Batman related, so he hands out flyers or something?

247
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,280
Well I think the factor we're ignoring there is the security guard assuming that that is

248
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Batman.

249
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,640
Yeah, he could just be like, oh thank God, somebody to help me carry the burden.

250
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Holy fuck.

251
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,320
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, Batman Paul Blart crossover comic coming this fall from

252
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Dark Lord.

253
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:57,360
Paul Blart Dark Knight, Crisis on Infinite Sandwiches.

254
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,520
I like the image of this guy fervently typing this into his phone as he walks into the mall

255
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
in a Batman costume.

256
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I try, guys, listen.

257
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Update, 23 minutes.

258
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
23 minutes.

259
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,320
23 minutes, no one has taken me out yet.

260
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,280
I honestly think that if you showed up to the mall dressed as Batman, the amount of

261
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,400
time you could walk around dressed as Batman is infinite.

262
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,520
I don't think anybody's going to be like, get out of here Batman.

263
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,600
Now unless you're like Batman with like a crotchless costume, you're not getting booted

264
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
out of the mall for dressing like Batman.

265
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Do they sell this?

266
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
You're going to get looked.

267
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,480
I don't want to talk about it.

268
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,440
Let me reach in my utility belt.

269
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
What's this?

270
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
It's my bat bow.

271
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,320
I've only got one tool, but it's good for everything.

272
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,160
This is my utility dog.

273
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,440
I can't tell you how happy I am right now picturing Batman in Bed Bath and Beyond.

274
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
With his dick hanging out?

275
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Where are your facial scrubbers?

276
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,280
Why are you hanging out with Batman with his dick hanging out, Travis?

277
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,680
This isn't the loofah I deserve, but it's the loofah I need.

278
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:04,800
Why are you in the mall in a Batman costume, sir?

279
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,200
Pardon me, sir.

280
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
Can you explain your whole situation to me?

281
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm not trying to kick you out.

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm worried about you.

283
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,720
I just want to know.

284
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,200
I want to get to the bottom of this.

285
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,440
You're the world's greatest detective, and I want you to explain this mystery to me.

286
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Why are you in Petland?

287
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Why are you in Petland, Batman?

288
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,720
If I see Batman, I'm running the opposite direction because wherever he is, the penguin

289
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,600
can't be far behind.

290
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,840
He knows what shadows hide in the hearts of men.

291
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Nope.

292
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Nope.

293
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
That's not it at all.

294
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,880
If you see a guy dressed as a shadow at the mall, oops, he's a hobo.

295
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
That's your mistake.

296
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
That's on you.

297
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,080
If he tries to control your mind, well, they all have to.

298
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,400
Can we go back and just really explore that Paul Blart-Mall-Cut-Batman crossover?

299
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
Because I think there's a lot of room for-

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,320
So are you talking like Paul Blart as Batman, or like a team-up power deal?

301
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm talking about team-up.

302
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm talking about a match-up maybe, but maybe like Bane comes in and breaks Batman's

303
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,040
back, and then Paul Blart has to put on the mantle, only it doesn't fit because Christian

304
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,920
Bale's like cut and ripped, and Kevin James is like super fat.

305
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,600
And there's like a montage of him trying to fit it into the costume to the sound of

306
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,760
like, I don't know, maybe Brick House or something?

307
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,840
I think it would just be like a tuba.

308
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,520
And also for some reason, Jonah Hill is his sidekick.

309
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,680
Yeah, Jonah Hill would be his Robin.

310
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,280
Well, could we do Robin?

311
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,120
We might get extra comedy if it's Batgirl.

312
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,320
It's, hey, Jonah Hill's cross-dressing you guys.

313
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,880
What if we get Alicia Silverstone?

314
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Uh-huh.

315
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Oh, okay.

316
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,520
Well, that's kind of on the nose, but I guess we could get her.

317
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
What's she doing?

318
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,960
I think it would be interesting if we did like Batman, colon, Generations, and so we

319
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,320
had Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, and we had Christian Bale, and then-

320
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,360
So you're saying, okay, okay, okay, okay.

321
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Dane DeVito, Penguin.

322
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,120
All these guys are fighting a war of crime inside of Paul Bart's mall.

323
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Okay.

324
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,400
Oh, and it turns out that Paul Bart is Batman from the future.

325
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,480
So they will pass, if I understand your Generations concept, what you're saying is that at some

327
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,500
point in the narrative, Batman will become unable to do his job, and he will pass the

328
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,600
suit on to Paul Bart, who will fit into it in a tube of music, and then Batgirl will

329
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,360
become incapacitated, and Jonah Hill will have to take the Batgirl costume and rise

330
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
up as Batgirl.

331
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Is that what you're saying?

332
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Yes.

333
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
What I'm saying is Bane has two knees.

334
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,180
He's gonna crack Christian Bale, gonna crash loose to Silverstone, and then where are those

335
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,600
cowls going other than the sweet and chubby heads of Jonah Hill and Kevin James?

336
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Okay.

337
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,520
So who does, what happens at the, do they fight the same penguin, or does the penguin

338
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
get passed on to somebody else?

339
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,700
The penguin's played by Ed Helms.

340
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:11,200
The penguin gets passed on to Ed Helms, Bane is the Hulk, Hulk Hogan.

341
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Okay.

342
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Okay, sure.

343
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,880
I want you to know right now I'd see this movie.

344
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,720
I would watch, why, where are the advertisers for a movie like this?

345
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,360
Why can't this be the sort of thing they're putting in the multiplex?

346
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,640
I would watch a Batman movie that is nothing but two hours of Arnold Schwarzenegger making

347
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
Mr. Freeze puns.

348
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
Chill.

349
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,480
I'm going to Orange Julius.

350
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,800
I hope they put ice in my drink.

351
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,360
Like that's the level of puns that we're talking about.

352
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Yeah.

353
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,520
Just saying, him saying ice in different ways.

354
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm going to Jared to get some ice, I mean diamonds.

355
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,240
It was ice to meet you.

356
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,080
Yeah, that's actually one that they say in the movie.

357
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,920
Oh, burn in hell, really?

358
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,480
I scream, you scream, we all scream for cold stone ice cream.

359
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,280
Can you cut more ice into my ice cream?

360
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,760
That's my top, that's my big sin.

361
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,320
I had an illegitimate child.

362
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,080
Oh, that's who Mr. Freeze can be.

363
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,040
Mr. Freeze can be played by Arnold Schwarzenegger's 10 year old love baby.

364
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
The baby shorts?

365
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Yeah.

366
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Baby shorts.

367
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Is that 10?

368
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Is that thing 10?

369
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Yeah, it's 10.

370
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
And then we're out there.

371
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,840
There's like a super cut 10 year old just getting real.

372
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
What is his future?

373
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,320
10 years though, that's a good job.

374
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,880
Getting cast in a major Hollywood movie.

375
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,680
No, I'm saying 10 years keeping a secret love child on the down low for 10 years.

376
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh, Travis.

377
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,000
He's already got a job in Batman Generations.

378
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,280
Or on the flip side, maybe he's right now walking around a wall wearing a Batman costume

379
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,560
and sending in questions to Yahoo.

380
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,560
What is the best thing in life to maybe see a boob someday?

381
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,120
Hey, NBNB AM, I have a problem.

382
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,480
Whenever I meet a lady, I'm usually very funny.

383
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Oh, good.

384
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,440
That lasts for a few months until it becomes more serious, at which I'm extremely nice

385
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,080
but dull.

386
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,480
Now I was never not nice to the ladies, but when it is less serious, I worry less about

387
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,600
offending them.

388
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,960
How do I bring back the funny but not offend them Gmail?

389
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,880
Wait, do you realize that there's a difference between when like a relationship gets serious

390
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,960
and when you have to get serious, you can still be funny.

391
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Nope.

392
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
It's not like we're dating now.

393
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
Let's talk about death.

394
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,760
It's like putting on, it's putting on like comedy sweatpants.

395
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
You just give up.

396
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,080
Like no more comedy makeup or comedy curling your hair.

397
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,760
You're just, you're just laying out some conkers and calling it a day.

398
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
So are we dating now?

399
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,000
Cause I'm just about out of Napoleon Dynamite references.

400
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,080
Love only makes you less funny.

401
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,680
That is why I have remained single for so many, so many years.

402
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
It's for the show.

403
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,520
He's a, he's a chuckle monk basically.

404
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,560
I am a chuckle monk.

405
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:14,760
I am, uh, I am silly, but boy, I need to go write that down real quick.

406
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Don't do it.

407
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
Yeah.

408
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
Hey, I got another, I got, I got another point I came up with.

409
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
What's that?

410
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Check this one out.

411
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Diabetes.

412
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Hey, right?

413
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Pretty good.

414
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,440
Um, yeah, that's, I mean, that's, I mean, that's for real.

415
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,560
If I would lose the jokes, I would pull a fucking Eddie Murphy, holy man, like full

416
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,360
on 180 career shift.

417
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Yeah.

418
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,600
And all of a sudden you're doing haunted mansion and meet Dave.

419
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Uh huh.

420
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
And why?

421
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Cause I've got kids now.

422
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,400
Hey kids, come laugh at haunted mansion.

423
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
What's this?

424
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Beverly Hills cop?

425
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
No, put that down.

426
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Put that down.

427
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
You're too young for that.

428
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Kids are the kryptonite to a funny career.

429
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,640
Did Mike Myers get kids before he did love guru?

430
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Is that what happened?

431
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,120
It would explain a lot.

432
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,520
I, yeah, I, I think that's, that's so true when you see a movie and it's like, I want

433
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,120
to do something my kids could watch.

434
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,000
It's like, why are your kids want to watch shitty stuff or are you letting watch?

435
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know what?

436
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You know what?

437
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,560
If you want your kids to be cool, let them watch trading places cause that would make

438
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
for a cool kid.

439
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,800
When, when I become a movie star and I make a shitty movie, my explanation in the interview

440
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,280
is going to be, I wanted to make something that I could make my kids watch when they

441
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
misbehave.

442
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,080
I need to have a, a punishment tool.

443
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
Now you have to watch meet Dave.

444
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
You sit down.

445
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
With your friends.

446
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Your friends are going to watch it with you.

447
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
You sit down.

448
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,660
You're getting, you, you wrote on the walls with crayons.

449
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,560
You're watching Pluto Nash.

450
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Come on in here.

451
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Strap in.

452
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,560
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

453
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,840
We're doing a back to back of RV followed by RV and then I'm just going to talk to you

454
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,080
for 30 minutes cause nothing could be worse than that.

455
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Hey, speaking of this, this is what your, your, uh, pattern in relationships is exact

456
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,600
same tack adopted by Robin Williams and the American public.

457
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,840
You try to be funny for like the first third and then you just, just give up and sort of

458
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
plunk it.

459
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,240
You keep, I think we've talked about this before, but it's the idea of if you are putting

460
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:11,160
on like a personality to impress someone in the beginning of your relationship, eventually

461
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,840
you're going to drop that.

462
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,080
Just be yourself from the get go.

463
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,920
And if yourself is funny, be funny for like the rest of your life.

464
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,120
You don't have to stop being funny.

465
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,080
It's such a, such a hassle though.

466
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,620
Be funny forever.

467
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,620
Can't do it, man.

468
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,120
Well, if you're not funny, then don't be funny.

469
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,960
Don't like, don't try to be funny in the beginning.

470
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Don't wear yourself out.

471
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Just be like, Hey, this is me.

472
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
I'm kind of boring.

473
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,080
In the beginning of our relationship, you should always sell yourself short.

474
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,680
You should always, so like under promise over deliver under deliver under don't, don't promise

475
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,520
zero promises and then like half ass delivery and then you can pick up the speed and pick

476
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,720
up the pace as it goes along and then it'll be like, you're just getting funnier and it's

477
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,680
like you're just getting better and better.

478
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,520
I was, I was unsure about staying with you in the beginning, but now in the immortal

479
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,680
words of wide life, all things just keep getting better about you, Jerry.

480
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,280
Kiss my boobs.

481
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,360
Get over here right now and kiss on the back.

482
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,680
I have two big bags of blood on the front of my body that needs some kisses and it's

483
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,240
time for you to do the man.

484
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,960
Is that what they are?

485
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,400
I've never WebMD'd it, but I would like to know what's going on in there.

486
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,880
It's just blood, blood and milk.

487
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,560
How come when vampires bite people, they don't bite them right on the boob?

488
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Because that's inappropriate.

489
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Griffin.

490
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Yeah.

491
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
I can't show that on TV then.

492
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Jesus.

493
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,520
Hey, how about a Yahoo answer question?

494
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Yeah, let's do that.

495
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,880
This one was sent in by Sarah Westlake.

496
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,200
Thank you, Sarah Westlake.

497
00:23:51,200 --> 00:24:00,840
That's by Yahoo Answers user Jack1081, who asks, how much fart can you store in a typical

498
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,280
large glass jar?

499
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Such is the sort you buy pickles in.

500
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
We are assuming-

501
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,560
Such is the sort.

502
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,400
This is what we're assuming, you guys.

503
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Okay.

504
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,120
We are assuming that you've got a vacuum seal with the right equipment.

505
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,720
The only time that the seal's broken is when you're sitting on the receptacle and ready

506
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
to fart.

507
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,640
A flat mechanical lid slides open, the machine sucks fart in, and immediately closes the

508
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
lid.

509
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Oh, God.

510
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,520
Oh, like a postal pneumatic tube, like, got that fart.

511
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Oh, Jesus.

512
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,000
Basically, you know that thing in Ghostbusters, the trap, the proton trap or whatever?

513
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,760
We're talking about that, but for flash lights.

514
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,520
So like a really big Twinkie full of farts.

515
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Well-

516
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Oh, God.

517
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,920
I think this person, like, hey, FBI, if you need the heads up on the dirty people that

518
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,400
are going to like steal toddlers and dress them up and make them do mock pageants in

519
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,120
their basement, like, this is the person, like, this is the person that will do that.

520
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
You need to get them.

521
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Go get them.

522
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
I think there's a-

523
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Go get them.

524
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Go catch.

525
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Go catch them.

526
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,520
I think there's a time in every person's life where they think about how many farts

527
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,440
would fit inside something, and that time is like four years old.

528
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Yeah.

529
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,560
I wonder if I could fart into my toy train and then keep it there forever, like, oh,

530
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
you can't grow up.

531
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
All aboard the Fart Express.

532
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Toot, toot.

533
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Toot, toot.

534
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Get it?

535
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Dummy.

536
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Some Yahoo!

537
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:42,960
Answer user, Bacon Lever, responded, in a typical glass pickle jar, you can fart as

538
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,220
many times as you want, but it's impossible to fill it up 100% of the way with farts.

539
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,360
Too much fart will escape when you try to close the jar after farting in it.

540
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,920
According to my estimations, you can fill it up about 42% of the jar with farts.

541
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
What?

542
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,400
According to my calculations, didn't this guy already tell the plan of how he's not

543
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,520
going to let the farts escape?

544
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,680
He's got a secret plan to keep the farts inside.

545
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,160
What fucking estimations are you doing?

546
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
What equations-

547
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,240
I punched the numbers here into my, uh, my, my calc, and-

548
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
It looks like 42%.

549
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,720
A little bit less than half is what you're going to get in that jar.

550
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,600
You're going to get in that jar, it's going to be around 42% farts.

551
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,040
Actually, uh, it's funny, 42% farts is actually the first component of Avril Lavigne's new

552
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
perfume.

553
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:40,140
It's 42% farts, 29% sandalwood, 11% um, the smell of newborn babies, and about 8%

554
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
perjury.

555
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,400
Are these Avril Lavigne's farts, or are we, are we dealing with, like, uh-

556
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,320
Oh, no, no, no, they get them from, uh, they get them from Indonesian kids.

557
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,320
These are Pete, these are Pete Wint's farts, get these out of here.

558
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Whatever you do.

559
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,520
Do not buy, like, the CVS knockoff version, it smells like Avril Lavigne's farts.

560
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,400
No, it's Manny Morse farts, you don't want that.

561
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,080
Um, uh, um, why, why are you doing this, guy?

562
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Hey, hey, guy?

563
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
Hey, guy?

564
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
I'm-

565
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
I have a better Yahoo question.

566
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,760
What is it?

567
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Why are you doing this?

568
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
I, I-

569
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Why are you doing this?

570
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,280
I'm a pretty nostalgic guy, and I like to, I like to have little treasures from the past.

571
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Um, but-

572
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,040
You know what, guys?

573
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:29,840
If I've learned one thing from the supercollider, sometimes science is just for science sake.

574
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
You think this is a science-

575
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
You don't have to have-

576
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
You think this is a science project.

577
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Yeah!

578
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,760
At this point, his wife has left him, he's lost custody to his kids, but he has got to

579
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,120
answer this question for science sake.

580
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,720
I think it's more amazing that he's invented an apparatus that lets you fill a container

581
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,640
with gas without letting the previous gas out of the container.

582
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Yeah.

583
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Uh-huh.

584
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
How do you differentiate-

585
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
This is his wife.

586
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,760
Because, because science says that there's displacement going on in there, right?

587
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,820
Like you, you put the fart gas in, and it lets non-fart gas out, um, but how do you-

588
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,480
How do you differentiate between the two?

589
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,200
Well answer that, and you get the Nobel.

590
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
One will be brown.

591
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
And one will be clear.

592
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,720
You think one will be brown, you think it'll be dense with farticles, and then-

593
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Exactly.

594
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,680
We're looking for the god farticle here, Griffin.

595
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,800
I uh, I think that this is his life's work.

596
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
That's the important-

597
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
The important thing is not that he-

598
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,800
The important thing is that it'll be done.

599
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Like there's not-

600
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
That I have a practical application.

601
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Yeah.

602
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
I think when he-

603
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
This isn't for him, this is for his kids.

604
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,560
When he looks at his tombstone, it's gonna say, here lies Greg.

605
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,280
As it turns out, about 29 farts.

606
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,920
1960 to 19- 2011.

607
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,960
If we're lucky, he will be dead soon.

608
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:56,000
How pissed off are those CERN guys gonna be if by inventing a fart storage, a perfect

609
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,480
fart storage apparatus, this guy actually discovers the Higgs boson particle and not

610
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
them?

611
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,920
The Higgs boson farticle, of course.

612
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
The Higgs boson farticle.

613
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,680
Like, oh, you guys built like a 35-mile long tube that cost you like a trillion dollars?

614
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
That's cool.

615
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
I just farted in this jar.

616
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,240
Oops, the god element found it.

617
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,160
Big Bang made it in this jar.

618
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,120
I have my own little tiny universe.

619
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,800
Talk about a Big Bang.

620
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:28,880
I think on that note, it's time to take a trip together, just three brothers, going

621
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:37,600
on a journey to the Money Zone.

622
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,560
Travis, who are we taking?

623
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Who's going with us?

624
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Who's in the trunk?

625
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Cut up in pieces.

626
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Whoa.

627
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Oh god, no.

628
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
Oh god.

629
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,400
Um, well, riding shotgun in the RV on the trip to the Money Zone is Lacey Harbour, soon

630
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,760
to be Lacey Smith.

631
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,400
She wants to send out a special wedding gift message to her fiance and soon-to-be husband

632
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Brian.

633
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Brian with a Y.

634
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Yeah, he's hip.

635
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
It's a mysterious Y.

636
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
He's down.

637
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
He's hip with a Y.

638
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,280
When can we expect their nuptials?

639
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,440
They're getting married on June 4th of this year to Brian.

640
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,920
That's like next fucking week.

641
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Yeah.

642
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Oh my god.

643
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
God, are you guys nervous?

644
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Cold feet?

645
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
You got cold feet?

646
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
I got cold feet.

647
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
What are they into?

648
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
What's their deal?

649
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,800
Well, he received a master's in science by inducing E. coli to produce- no, I read that

650
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
wrong.

651
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Inducing E. coli to produce human hemoglobin.

652
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,440
Oh man, you read that so wrong.

653
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
I've been inducing E. coli to produce.

654
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
You'll never catch me.

655
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,680
You'll never take me alive, fruit cop.

656
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,120
Enjoy that bok choy, motherfucker.

657
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,020
He's a super good at Super Meat Boy.

658
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,080
He is sadly allergic to black pepper.

659
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,360
That's the best kind of pepper that there is, though.

660
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
Yeah.

661
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,880
I think you're gonna have white pepper?

662
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Because that's good.

663
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
It is?

664
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,080
And not just salt?

665
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,520
He proposed to me on top of Guadalupe Pete in Texas.

666
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Where did he propose to Lacy?

667
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,160
That must have been so special for you.

668
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,160
He even made her a special meal to eat at the top, because he's a great cook, except

669
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:30,760
where he uses kind of a light hand with the black pepper, because that would kill him.

670
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,760
I want to blow your guys' minds and say he's safe for two years to buy the right.

671
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
That's the trick.

672
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Two years' salary.

673
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
I always say that.

674
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Jesus Christ.

675
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Mm-hmm.

676
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Jesus Christ.

677
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
You'll know.

678
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,920
Travis, one of these days, you're gonna make that magic leap, and you are gonna know the

679
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
kind of sacrifices that-

680
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,760
I can't save two weeks' salary.

681
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I know.

682
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,520
You spend all of it on pancake materials.

683
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,560
Stuff to make pancakes with.

684
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Jars.

685
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:01,640
So, congratulations to you guys, and especially to Brian, for whom we are a gift, treasured

686
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
gift-

687
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
You're welcome, Brian.

688
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,920
That you can keep forever.

689
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:15,360
Our other message comes from Ben Sawija, and he submits that we should officially come

690
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,520
out in support of Luminous Electric in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

691
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
That's right.

692
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,000
They are a skilled electrician serving homeowners, contractors, and commercial customers in the

693
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,440
Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

694
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Holy Christ.

695
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Yes, we-

696
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
What do you need?

697
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
What do you need?

698
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
What do you need?

699
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,200
You need updated electrical panels in older homes?

700
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Whatever.

701
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Done.

702
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Check mark.

703
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
How are your electrical issues?

704
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Oh, you have them?

705
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
We will solve them for you.

706
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Check mark.

707
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,520
Lighting design and installation?

708
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,760
Check mark.

709
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,360
Free estimates?

710
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
Probably.

711
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,760
Do you want to have flashlights installed in your hands, like a super power?

712
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
Yeah.

713
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Or maybe a light bulb eyes.

714
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,600
Do you want to replace your veins with wires?

715
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Yes.

716
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,720
Can I replace my heart with a ticking clock?

717
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Yes.

718
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,520
Turn yourself into a mechanical man.

719
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,320
Some sort of mechanical man with Luminous Electric.

720
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,680
Luminous Electric will turn you into a mechanical man.

721
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,480
Honestly, if you live in the Twin Cities area, and you're listening to this, and you

722
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,760
do not hire these motherfuckers, what's wrong with you?

723
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
That's like the best electricians ever.

724
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,920
Can you imagine how awesome that would be?

725
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
What?

726
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
What?

727
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
I mean, okay.

728
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,000
What else is there to do in Minneapolis-St. Paul other than get turned into a robot and

729
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,960
then have like robot races?

730
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Yeah.

731
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Uh-huh.

732
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,760
So they will transfer- they might say at first like, I don't understand what you're saying

733
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
and we can't transfer-

734
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Uh-huh.

735
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
They have to say that because the FDA.

736
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Yes.

737
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
You're right.

738
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
And the FBI.

739
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
The code word is French Stewart.

740
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Yeah.

741
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,000
You say French Stewart and they will-

742
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,720
Give me a full on French Stewart.

743
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Give me the French Stewart.

744
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,920
He's saying, wait, holy shit.

745
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Is he a mechanical man?

746
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,380
He is a malfunctioning mechanical man.

747
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,560
His light bulb eyes don't work.

748
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
No.

749
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,960
So that's- go to LuminousElectric.com and you can just hire them.

750
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,040
Just get them.

751
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,520
And I honestly, if you listen to this and you don't choose them as like your cool electrician,

752
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I don't know.

753
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
I don't know what's wrong with you.

754
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Justin.

755
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
So, yeah.

756
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:32,360
You're going to need to jingle it up and you have so much to go on here.

757
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:43,360
But I'm out on top on Guadalupe Peak, made the decision and with his mouth he speaked,

758
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
shit.

759
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:54,240
I take you Lacey to be my bride and I want some robot parts inside.

760
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:03,080
I want to take you down the aisle with super robot strength.

761
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
Hold your hand.

762
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,040
Try not to crush it.

763
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,160
Thanks Luminous Electric for making me your robot man.

764
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,040
Half love, half husband.

765
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,040
All robot hero.

766
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,360
Electro Brian.

767
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,520
I said clap.

768
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,680
Clap for me.

769
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,680
Go crazy.

770
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,520
So thanks to Electro Brian and Luminous Electric and the wonderful Lacey Harbour, soon to be

771
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,680
Lacey Smith, for taking everybody to the money zone.

772
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,840
We got a- I got a question here.

773
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,360
I'm a graduating high school senior.

774
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,080
I don't want to go to my ceremony.

775
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,560
The reason is that I have not made any good memories in high school.

776
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,600
When I look at all these people, I think about how horrible some of them treated me.

777
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Some of my old best friends have ganged up with me a lot last year and bullied me saying

778
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:11,120
backhanded comments all the time like I'm ugly and they act like I was beneath them.

779
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,920
Our school said that if it's all right if we don't want to walk the stage, but I know

780
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,200
that graduating is a big deal to my parents.

781
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,160
I don't know how to tell them that I don't want to go.

782
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,960
I don't know what excuse to make up.

783
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,360
Should I just not go and tell them I forgot?

784
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Hey mom and dad.

785
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Oops.

786
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Was that today?

787
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Was that today?

788
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,160
That's from Kelly in California.

789
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,720
You already dropped- I know you already dropped a hundo on your Jostens robe like-

790
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,320
Yeah you had- Did all three of us walk?

791
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Did you walk?

792
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Yeah.

793
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
I didn't walk in high school.

794
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
I didn't walk in college.

795
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,320
It took me five years to get through.

796
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,480
I wasn't going to be like I finally did it mom and dad.

797
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,120
I got my acting degree in five years.

798
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
I did it.

799
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,280
I think that this is one of those things that I look back- I'm glad that I did everything

800
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,800
that I could in high school so I don't look back and go man I wish I'd gone to prom or

801
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I wish I'd walked the stage.

802
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,680
You did all of the requisite high school-y shit.

803
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Yes.

804
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,440
What I'm saying is there's no sense in skipping this similar experience that is just like

805
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,760
this one time it'll happen to you.

806
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
Yes.

807
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,000
You can be snarky about it but it is a big deal.

808
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,280
Like graduating high school is a big deal.

809
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Yeah.

810
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,960
Yeah and it is a big deal and you know like don't think of it as like I'm going to miss

811
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,600
high school so much.

812
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:41,580
Think of it as you rose above these fucking assholes who are trying to keep you down and

813
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:46,360
you're about to go into college where everything is cool or go into the real world where everything

814
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,240
is equally cool and nothing sucks as bad as what you just went through.

815
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,120
You know that's a great- like Kelly it ain't about them.

816
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,240
Yeah it's about you.

817
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
You fucking did it.

818
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
It's about you.

819
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
You did it.

820
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
You killed it.

821
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,560
You- you know like they tried to keep you down and you fucking won.

822
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,600
You know what the high school graduation rate is in this country right now?

823
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
It's like eight.

824
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
It's like eight percent.

825
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,380
It's like eight percent and Kelly you beat the odds.

826
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,760
You're not in that nine- that's the stupid 92 they call it.

827
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,640
You're not- you're not in that group.

828
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,120
You're- you're uh- you're- you're going for it.

829
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,860
You're going for uh- it's like you- you set your mind on a goal much like Captain Jack

830
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,320
Sparrow set his mind on the goal of retrieving the black pearl and now you've got your black

831
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,120
pearl so you're going to walk across the stage and take your- take your victory lap.

832
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
You did it.

833
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
And shoot Barbossa.

834
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
Shoot Barbossa.

835
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
On the stage.

836
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Only-

837
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Metaphorically speaking.

838
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Metaphorically speaking shoot Barbossa when he's flesh.

839
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Not flesh man.

840
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,320
Take a gold piece.

841
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,520
Take the bloom from the cursed chest.

842
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Yep.

843
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Gain-

844
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Get the zombie monkey.

845
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Gain immortal life.

846
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,560
Like what else do you need to know?

847
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,800
Also it- also this is really special to your parents and it's one of the- there are things

848
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,920
in your life that you will always be faced with like this is something you are doing

849
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,120
for them and for you but not for your asshole ex friends and those people.

850
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
No.

851
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
This is for you and your parents.

852
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
I'm saying fuck your parents.

853
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm saying this is Kelly time.

854
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
This is Kelly time.

855
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm saying you get on that stage and you let everyone know how you feel about them.

856
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Like-

857
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
And maybe give your principal an extra hard handshake.

858
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Give him a handshake and-

859
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Nothing big.

860
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Just like-

861
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,960
Turn towards all of your shitty classmates and just get your dick out and be like bite

862
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
it.

863
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
And it'd be like bite this wiener.

864
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
No.

865
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
No.

866
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Not this at all.

867
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
You gotta do something like super memorable that'll get on TV and everything.

868
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,320
How is that not memorable?

869
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,480
Just turn around and be like make sure to listen to my brother when my brother meets

870
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
at mpnbam.com.

871
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Goodbye.

872
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,760
And maybe just yell San Dimas high school football rules.

873
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,000
So Kelly this is for you.

874
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's not about them.

875
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Fuck those guys.

876
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,320
This is your time and you won.

877
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,800
You succeeded.

878
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,400
You triumphed.

879
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
And now it's time to-

880
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Oh my god.

881
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,520
Shit is about to get so good for you.

882
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Oh Kelly.

883
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,840
The next four years of your life is gonna absolutely rule.

884
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,320
A switch is about to flip.

885
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,440
A rad switch.

886
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,120
An awesome switch.

887
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,960
So guys I was reading Cosmo like I do.

888
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,580
Like you do.

889
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,080
And I bypassed.

890
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,980
There was one article that I really wanted to read and it was 17 things you don't know

891
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:23,320
about your vagina because it sounded mysterious and I want to know what my vagina's up to.

892
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,160
But I bypassed that through 25 surprising things that turned men on.

893
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Okay.

894
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,960
Now the terrible stupid thing that Cosmo has done here is they asked guys to submit them

895
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,400
on Twitter.

896
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Okay.

897
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,080
So these are straight up submissions.

898
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,680
Before we start can I say that the thing that turns me on most in this world is exploring

899
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,440
the secrets of the vagina.

900
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,600
The 17 dark secrets.

901
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,440
What your vagina does when you're not around.

902
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,120
Some of my favorites on this list.

903
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,520
Number two is that early in the morning or tired at night phone voice.

904
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,600
Which translates to me of like can we please just go to bed.

905
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Why are you up so early?

906
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Daniel.

907
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Daniel.

908
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,120

909
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Number three.

910
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,900
Girls who swim.

911
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,960
Like mermaids.

912
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
I guess.

913
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,720
She's moist all the time.

914
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
She smells like chlorine.

915
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
I love it.

916
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,880
She's the best.

917
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Number eight.

918
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
All caps.

919
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Paying for your own dinner.

Got a major boner.

921
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,680
She pulls out that visa and this boner just jumps right off.

960
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,720

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,440
the sexes yeah stuff like what he doesn't want is for you to get really into the game

962

00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,760

974
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:41,360
about the 1990s so there's a little lack of that or you ready what universes are you ready

975
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,920
wait Griffin you've got to do it to music you can't not do this to music I can do it

you can you elucidate the last stanza for me again equal I bird flu Michael Jackson

984

who knew Hans Zimmer Green Day Guantanamo Bay okay all right hold on who knew what who

985
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:02,280
knew what I guess that Michael Jackson was gonna die and if that is the case then everybody

986
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:09,080
okay I wouldn't my bigger problem with this is not about the flow of her lyrics but more

987
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:15,040
do we live in a world where this gets updated like the encyclopedia like at the end of a

988
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,080
decade it's like well we need to go back and add a couple stanzas by the end of time we

989
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,360
didn't start the fire is gonna be eight hours yeah it's gonna be an epic poem written by

990
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,960
poet laureate Billy Joel I'm glad I'm glad somebody's stepping up here because yeah like

991
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,720
I don't want our school kids to be like and then in the year was 1990 and after that there

992
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,680
is no more history I mean Sarah touches on some good points here I mean definitely definitely

993
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,600
CSI and Twin Towers and Wi-Fi should all be sandwiched together like that pretty much

994
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,840
they're pretty much like the same level of stuff right Dan Brown definitely deserves

995
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:57,720
to be remembered for and Hans Zimmer wait Hans Zimmer you know and Harry Potter's in

996
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:03,480
there potters in there he's up with that that's a revolution that's fresh that's great Hans

997
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:11,320
Zimmer like what what what what what what contribution of Hans Zimmer's are you are

998
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:17,760
you honoring here like that did you feel is it oh I know excuse me he did the motion picture

999
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,180
soundtrack for Pirates of the Caribbean on stranger so that that that makes perfect sense

1000
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:29,040
he did that OST so yeah I mean what what what are we forgetting here there's got to be some

1001
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:36,040
other important events like Iraq Afghanistan something like that Pirates of the Caribbean

1002
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:45,640
on Stranger's Tide Iraq Afghanistan Pirates of the Caribbean how about Robert Downey Jr's

1003
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,080
return to the screen that's pretty big deal Robert Downey Jr's return to the screen like

1004
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:56,080
I don't think so now what about Grey's Anatomy and then the spin-off Private Practice let's

1005
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:02,920
here's what's it I'm looking through this and I think my problem isn't my problem is

1006
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:11,220
what didn't make the cut so like oh Dan Brown made it but not Hurricane Katrina like uh-huh

1007
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:19,480
yeah so Sarah Palin is up in the mix not 9-eleven though so yeah well she said Twin Towers and

1008
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:25,400
that sort of shorthand for 9-eleven never forget Twin Towers it could be see it could

1009
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:35,040
be referring to the second Lord of the Rings movie it cannot no it could not Grey's Anatomy

1010
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:42,080
is made for you Kung Fu Panda one and two there I think that's better because it gets

1011
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,800
some like super important cultural stuff I think that it would be better if it was all

1012
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:52,000
just not like what happened in the world but like a personal recount of your 1990 to 2009

1013
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,520
so it's like met a guy we broke up went to dinner met some people then I went to college

1014
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,400
and it was pretty cool and it was just like a personal telling of stuff that happened

1015
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,240
in your life can you explain to me the sort of sliding scale that puts going to dinner

1016
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,040
with some people and graduating college on the same import like it's a good dinner it

1017
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:16,600
wasn't it wasn't a very good college it was a very good verse it was mostly a party school

1018
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:23,600
I graduated still a fool and I went and got on Yahoo Answers wrote this song so I want

1054
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,000
you pimp us to people when you say hey check out the show include that sampler link I think

1055
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,880
is is maybe even better than our website link because it it's a really good entry point
