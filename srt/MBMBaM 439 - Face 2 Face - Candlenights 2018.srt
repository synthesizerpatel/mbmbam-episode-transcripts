1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,560
We can go ahead and take out those house lights now. Yes, there they go. They're too attractive.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,200
Everyone's too attractive. It's like they were never there,

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,800
still very much up these house lights are. Oh no. If anyone has a slingshot, if everybody has a

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,960
slingshot, just take them out. I can see everybody way too well. All right, it's fine. I can't believe

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:19,680
we're firing Paul. Dang. Happy candle nights. Dang, I'm going to miss Paul. Dang. Hey, happy

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,520
candle nights to y'all. Joyous candle nights. You know what? I want to get a couple of thank

11
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,680
yous out right up at the top. How about that? Sure. Like before we say the name of the podcast

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
and there they go. Bye. Before we say the name of the podcast and everything. Fine.

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,120
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Justin McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,120
And I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,920
Thank you. Thank you. And I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I almost cursed.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:26,080
I almost cursed. Y'all, this is our non-cuss show. No cusses allowed. I almost cussed.

18
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,120
Backstage, it's been like we are the keynote speakers at a cussing convention.

19
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,520
I don't know why. Hopefully, we're just getting it out of our system. I said eight cusses just

20
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,320
before I walked out. Just got there. I want to say very briefly, thank you, first off,

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,800
to Akinpucky, a design company here in Huntington, West Virginia that has designed all of this.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:56,400
You also know Akinpucky as the creators of this super desk from My Brother, My Brother, Me,

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,680
the limited television event. I would call it a mini-series. The My Brother, My Brother, Me

24
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
mini-series. Mini-series, and also they made the clown box. You can blame them for that.

25
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
And if you look over here, I would like to say thank you to Safety Town for donating

26
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:20,800
this actual Safety Town car. Also, thank you to Emily Cardamas, who is here in the audience.

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,520
She designed the posters for this evening. Emily, we can't bring the house lights up again. I'm

28
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,200
sure you understand. Thank you so much for that. You can buy those in the lobby if you haven't

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,560
already. What are you guys going to miss the most about cussing over the next hour?

30
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:47,840
I'm going to admit, sometimes when we do a Yahoo question, they ask us a real ding-dong.

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,160
Oh, yeah. And even that, how do we feel about ding-dong, folks?

32
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,600
I meant like a bell, like a dumbbell. I meant the word, but also radical.

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:07,920
What if I need to describe a huge butt? And my normal words for size aren't getting it across,

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,880
and I'm going to be super descriptive with the size of the butt.

35
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,160
I feel like if you say it a third time, we're bordering on dangerous territory.

36
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,920
Hey, as long as we're teetering on that edge, I have a toilet illness tonight,

37
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,960
a toilet illness tonight, which is not much of a surprise to anybody.

38
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
Is this any first time listeners here?

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
You might worry that you're going to get a subpar show,

40
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,920
and I would argue you're going to get the only show that we make.

41
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,960
Moments before I walked on the stage, this is not a lie. I did my dirty thing, and

42
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,840
I don't want to get too blue, but somebody went on the seat,

43
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,720
and I sat in a big wet mess, and I want to cuss about that now.

44
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,680
I'm still coming off fresh from this horrible event.

45
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
I know this is our holiday special. I shouldn't have gone that deep.

46
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,640
I only toilet once a day, and I did it at home.

47
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:08,960
Okay.

48
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
It takes 45 minutes.

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,240
Justin?

50
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,760
Yes?

51
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,080
I didn't hear you deny the wet mess.

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
I mean, there's a lot of perpetrators here.

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
It could have been any one of us.

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
It could have been one of our children, Griffith.

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,320
Yeah, that would be wild.

56
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760
Hey, do you guys mind if we maybe...

57
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,520
Do you want to start with a Yahoo this time?

58
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,080
All right.

59
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,400
This is a Yahoo off the Yahoo answer service.

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,480
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles, who I believe is also here tonight

61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:44,320
after a half-day-long trek to get to Huntington, West Virginia.

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
Thank you for all of your wonderful, wonderful gifts.

63
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm super curious.

64
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
How many people here are from out of town?

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
So all of them.

66
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,240
Did any of our hometown friends manage to get tickets?

67
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,760
All right.

68
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
Well done.

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,960
So thank you, Adrian.

70
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,200
This one is an anonymous Yahoo answers user.

71
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm going to call Billion.

72
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,320
Asks, is it better to smoke a cigarette or vape

73
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,800
during an open-air Christmas carol service?

74
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,360
Huh.

75
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,200
We shall stand at the back where most of the smokers gather.

76
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,000
How big is this carol service?

77
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,360
Point number two.

78
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
So how cool is it?

79
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Point number two, there will be lots of kids present.

80
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Huh.

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
That last one is a sticky wicket, because you don't want to smoke

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,680
that cigarette smog around the children, because it's,

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,040
you know, according to doctors, not good for them.

84
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,960
But if they see you vaping, they're going to want to do that right now.

85
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
No, they're going to try to steal your vape.

86
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,200
Hey, old man, let me get at that jewel real quick.

87
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,240
I saw that jewel in a Fortnite dance.

88
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,560
Hey, let me fortnight at that jewel,

89
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
real quick, old man.

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm going to fortnight all over the place.

91
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,200
Hey, you care if I fortnight real quick with that jewel?

92
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,480
Step back, I'm going to fortnight.

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,800
Hey, careful, I got a fortnight brewing in my tummy.

94
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,240
Here's what you do.

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,440
Here's what you do.

96
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
You just pretend like, you know,

97
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,040
oh, I can see my breath as you're ripping mad cotton.

98
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,600
Heck yeah.

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
Oh, it's so cold in here.

100
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,000
So chilly.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,320
They'll be like, Tyler, this is Fort Lauderdale.

102
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,120
It's 63 degrees outside.

103
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,920
Man, you got to do one of them though, huh?

104
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,640
That's what it's called, an addiction.

105
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,480
I like that in this question,

106
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,720
there is not an option of not going to the open air candlelight

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,400
or caroling service or whatever.

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,480
Like, well, I have to go, but I also have to vape.

109
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
There's a smoker section.

110
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
That's what's wild to me.

111
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
It's tripping me out.

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,200
If I get a group of carolers coming to my...

113
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,680
What is it?

114
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
Is this a state?

115
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,760
Am I coming to them?

116
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,440
Because if so, you're not carolers.

117
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
You're just a choir doing a performance outdoors.

118
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,960
But okay.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I feel like if I'm seeing a group of, you know,

120
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
people singing Deck the Halls at me

121
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,760
and in the back I see a bunch of, you know, army grandpas

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,320
chiefing their vapes.

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,560
So what is the best vape flavor for a caroling service?

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Cigarette.

125
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm going to say pine.

126
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,200
That's nice.

127
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
What about frankincense?

128
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,760
Pine is one of those rare vape flavors

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,240
that is better for the people around you

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
than it is for the people putting it in their mouth.

131
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
Those are great choices.

132
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
What about snow?

133
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,760
Fresh.

134
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,120
Chris.

135
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,760
What about one just called... I'll make one called Santa Claus.

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,520
Yeah.

137
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,400
Baby Jesus.

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,440
Yeah.

139
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,160
And there it was.

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,400
That was our exit ramp.

141
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,480
While we wait for Justin to unlock his iPad.

142
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,920
I have questions from you, our beloved audience members.

143
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm going to read them right now.

144
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,400
I did a bunch of gift shopping at Half Price Books

145
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
as I do every year.

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
I got my seven-year-old nephew

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,400
two books of Lego construction ideas and instructions.

148
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,160
When I got home, I discovered one of the books

149
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,280
has an inscription stating it was a gift for Clay

150
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,000
from his loving grandpam in 2011.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
His loving what now?

152
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
Grandpam in 2011.

153
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
It is I, grandpam.

154
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,200
It is written in large letters on the front page.

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Do I wrap the book as is knowing my nephew

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
will understand the nature of used books

157
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
and that is the reason he is getting two books

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,400
instead of just one?

159
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,520
Or do I try and hide the inscription somehow?

160
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,280
Do I add a note saying something like,

161
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,960
I guess Clay didn't like this book too much.

162
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,680
But I bet you will.

163
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,320
In an attempt to appeal to my nephew's sense of humor,

164
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,200
that's from Festive Faux Pas in Fort Worth.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,760
Are you here?

166
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,760
Oh, too bad.

167
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
Fort Worth is pretty far from here.

168
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,880
First of all, they make books that don't come with Legos

169
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
that are just some ideas for things you can build with Legos.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,360
That is wild to me.

171
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
Like, I don't know, a building?

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
Maybe a car?

173
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
Castle?

174
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,840
I don't know.

175
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,040
You kids like dinosaurs?

176
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,120
You got a lot of green ones?

177
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
Could you write after the word Clay, the word Aiken?

178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,040
And now-

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,280
That's a collector's piece.

180
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,440
Yes.

181
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,000
You can sell that back to the bookstore for $25.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,240
Can you write over Clay, after Clay, write face.

183
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
Please change your ways.

184
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,520
Love, Batman.

185
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,160
And enjoy the book.

186
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,880
Grandpam.

187
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't get any Legos stuck inside of you

188
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,280
and your gelatinous body.

189
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,200
P.S.

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,160
Commissioner Fort.

191
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,120
Man, Clayface is-

192
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,840
You don't really think about Clayface that often, do you?

193
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,120
All the time.

194
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm going to make you-

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
Because I bet he gets dirty after a day of just existing.

196
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,280
Clayface blorps around the city trying to cause crime,

197
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,240
but then he gets home.

198
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,360
How does he wash up?

199
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,000
He's mud.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,560
Yeah.

201
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
But he's covered in cigarette butts.

202
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,400
Clayface's favorite joke is

203
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,920
after he hangs out with a bunch of criminals

204
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,960
at the end of the night, he's like,

205
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,840
well, I guess I'm going to go to sleep in a bed.

206
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
That's a great joke, Clayface.

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,680
Yeah.

208
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,280
The audience loved it, fake Clayface.

209
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm just kidding.

210
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,720
I have to lay on the ground because I'm Clayface.

211
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,680
Yeah, sure.

212
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
Like, what are his other options?

213
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,080
Does he maintain a solid form as he rests?

214
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,960
I don't think so.

215
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
Can you tear the page out?

216
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
Is it the cover?

217
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,800
Front page.

218
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
It's probably written on the-

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,960
Thank you for the correction.

220
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,840
Someone in the audience just said no.

221
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I mean, that first page is going to have

222
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,640
a lot of important details.

223
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,240
The publisher information.

224
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,200
The IBSN number, is that it?

225
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,000
It's close enough.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,960
It says-

227
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,000
The IBS number?

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,040
Don't use Duplo blocks on this book.

229
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,920
It's rich.

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh, no!

231
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,140
No!

232
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
Put a quarter in the jar.

233
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Put a quarter in the jar.

234
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,560
We made it.

235
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,600
13 minutes.

236
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,840
That goes-

237
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,800
Yeah, what do you got, Griff?

238
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,160
What's going on recovery points tonight?

239
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,640
What do they got?

240
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
So that's just your credit card.

241
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,540
Okay.

242
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
And now I'm going to read the numbers out.

243
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
Whatever they feel is fair.

244
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,280
There's no numbers.

245
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,840
Okay.

246
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,800
What is this?

247
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,300
All right.

248
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,280
It's a blockbuster gift card.

249
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,000
That's my one.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
I cussed because I was angry at Travis for

251
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,640
dumping on my joke.

252
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,800
How about another Yahoo?

253
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,200
Now I'm on point because I'm only 13 minutes in and I used mine.

254
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,080
Charlotte sent this one in.

255
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,720
Thank you, Charlotte.

256
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
It's Yahoo Answers user dgirl who asks,

257
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,520
how does Santa get away with having his elves put together

258
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,040
and give away toys that are trademarked or patented by other entities?

259
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,340
Yes.

260
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,080
Additional details.

261
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,240
Is he above the law?

262
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
Geographically speaking, yes.

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
I have seen a lot of movies where they arrest Santa.

264
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,920
Yeah.

265
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
It happens a lot.

266
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,040
Yeah.

267
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,120
It's like to the point now,

268
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,240
if in real life I was a police officer and I arrested somebody

269
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
and they're like, I'm Santa, I'd be like, oh, statistically,

270
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,400
it's probably true.

271
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,160
Yeah.

272
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,720
Go on.

273
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
So, I mean, like, walk it through there, right?

274
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,240
Is he above the law?

275
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Santa shows up at the police officer's house.

276
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
He's got a bunch of licensed toys and the officer's like,

277
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
I got to arrest you, Santa.

278
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,720
And Santa's like, all right, let's go.

279
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,560
Just kidding.

280
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
I can be everywhere at once and I'm immortal and okay, let's go.

281
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
Like, are you going to catch me if you can, Santa?

282
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,620
Yeah.

283
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,320
I don't think so.

284
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,440
Is Santa invincible?

285
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,940
No.

286
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,240
Sorry.

287
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,440
I've seen the Santa Claus.

288
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,960
He's not invincible.

289
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,480
Is Santa invincible?

290
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
If, if, if, if you arrest Santa and you put him in the back

291
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,240
of the police car, can he, using Santa magic,

292
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,920
escape the car through the exhaust pipe?

293
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,420
Yes.

294
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,520
If he chooses.

295
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,640
The exhaust pipe is the chimney of the car.

296
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,120
Sometimes the police officer has a lesson to learn about,

297
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
I don't know, love or Christmas, magic, or joy or whatever.

298
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,640
So Santa could escape at any moment, but he's choosing not to.

299
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,680
And instead, he maybe does like a rock musical number

300
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
in the jail cell.

301
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,760
That's good.

302
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,040
I mean, Santa's got a guy, right?

303
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,080
A wholesale guy.

304
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,720
You know what I mean?

305
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
Santa's real magic is he's got a toy guy.

306
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,480
A box of stuff that falls off the truck.

307
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Hey, a few things fell off the truck.

308
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,000
Santa.

309
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
Or maybe the other side, maybe the wholesale people,

310
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,280
maybe like Walmart has a contract with Santa.

311
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,160
It's like, okay, Christmas, it's all yours to distribute.

312
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,080
The other 11 months of the year, though,

313
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,520
please do send that to us.

314
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,200
The cell will kick some back to you.

315
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Santa could probably be like, I mean,

316
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,000
I give it away so it's technically fair use.

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,200
And they'd say, that's not fair.

318
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,280
That's not how any of this works, Santa.

319
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,920
Goodbye.

320
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm at 30 houses away.

321
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,260
Bye.

322
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,560
Is it possible that Santa did make the Nintendo

323
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,000
and the monster cards and Battle Boy

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,280
and all the hot toys for this candlelight season?

325
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,760
Oh, man, I got a Battle Boy.

326
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320
All right.

327
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
He's the boy that will leap into the fray.

328
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,960
He's the boy that's going to save the day.

329
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Everybody get out of the way.

330
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
It's Battle Boy.

331
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,480
Fun Stix, all the hot toys from 2018.

332
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,040
Good Wheels, you know.

333
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,280
That doesn't explain why none of the toys

334
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,960
are spelled right that you get from Santa.

335
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,720
I got a Ben Tendo.

336
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
Jim Tendo 63.

337
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,360
With a copy of Golden Guy.

338
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm currently.

339
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,840
Hey, no slop job when we're playing Golden Guy.

340
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,600
It's not fair.

341
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,640
Clappers only.

342
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,140
Hey.

343
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Slop job probably isn't good.

344
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,720
We're definitely pushing a mountain here doing that one.

345
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,800
Oh, no.

346
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm coming off as a real Howard Stern type up here.

347
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,480
I'm currently sitting in a well-known sandwich establishment.

348
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
I have replaced your brother Justin with a droid.

349
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
No, it's just a question.

350
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,840
Waiting for a call that my car inspection is finished.

351
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,440
When a man started to do a Christmas rock set at noon.

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,880
Stop.

353
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,840
What sandwich chain do they do live music at?

354
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,680
I mean, it's well known.

355
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
When a subway with a stage in the corner.

356
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,840
Probably a subway with a stage in the corner.

357
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,560
Currently, he is facing me and I am the only.

358
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
Maybe Potbelly.

359
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,080
I was thinking Potbelly is pretty slick.

360
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,280
When a man has started Christmas, I currently he is facing me.

361
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
And I am the only patron in the establishment.

362
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,680
Brother, I blow it up from the inside and survive.

363
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,680
What is the protocol for being the only audience member?

364
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,920
Should I clap solo between songs?

365
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,640
I've taken one earbud out and done some.

366
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
That was your first mistake.

367
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,480
Yeah, I've done some intermittent foot taps.

368
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,680
Oh, but what should I do?

369
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,480
Punny names are hard in Baltimore.

370
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,040
Are you here?

371
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,200
God bless you wherever you are.

372
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm probably still trapped in that sandwich, folks.

373
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I don't have a lot of rules for living.

374
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,200
Here's my number one.

375
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,120
If you see someone carrying an amp, finish your sandwich.

376
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,560
Especially if you look around and there's no one else in the room.

377
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,240
Hold on, I think they might have been writing it down.

378
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,760
I'll repeat, if you see someone carrying an amp, finish your sandwich.

379
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
Unless.

380
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,680
How did you?

381
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,400
No, no.

382
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,000
Unless.

383
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,480
Unless.

384
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
It's not, but fine.

385
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,160
What if it's 2006 and the person with the guitar and amp is a young Jason Mraz?

386
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,720
Okay, no.

387
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,360
You let yourself, you knew you were the only one in there.

388
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

389
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,600
You saw them carrying the amp and some part of you was like, mm.

390
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
Let's see, nice.

391
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,000
I can't imagine where this is going.

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,720
A little mid-lunch music.

393
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,400
Another thing, you pulled out a headphone and the earbud was like, huh?

394
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,800
Like, not both, you monster.

395
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,680
Yeah, this.

396
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh, that's what you do.

397
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,000
If they play a really good song, you reach up and you take the other one out like, okay.

398
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,640
Now you've got me, reel me in.

399
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,120
Do you have a CD I can buy for $2?

400
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,160
If they play a bad song, which this potbelly live music act almost certainly will,

401
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
you pop the other one back in.

402
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,440
You gotta earn it.

403
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,480
You rappin' bad.

404
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,920
This is where you, hopefully you have this in your bag, but you pull out like a clipboard

405
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,400
and a pen, they finish the song, you go, hmm.

406
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
And like, take notes and write it down.

407
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
And then, okay.

408
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
And then say, I think I've got everything I need.

409
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,800
Oh, God.

410
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:40,960
That's good.

411
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
I think I've seen enough.

412
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,160
Can you pull your phone out?

413
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
And I don't know what I'm gonna say here, so I'm really just kind of generating it

414
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
as I fly, which is always fun.

415
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,040
But like, do a FaceTime with someone so you have a buddy there for the performance

416
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,160
so you're not alone.

417
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,040
Maybe it's your great-

418
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,800
Hey, remember that new sound you've been looking for?

419
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,040
Yeah.

420
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,200
Listen to this, and then you set the phone down on the table and walk away.

421
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,440
Now, bad news, you lost a phone.

422
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,800
Worst news, you might've lost a friend, but you get to go home.

423
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,520
Can you say, could you kind of cover your mouth and be like, whoever had the Honda Pilot,

424
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,920
your car's done, so you better come get it, or we're gonna throw it away, so you better

425
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,080
hurry up and get here, and you just run away.

426
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,160
You write that down on a note and hand it to the guitarist to read out loud to the crowd.

427
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,800
Then it's more authentic.

428
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
And then you go, wait, that's me!

429
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
That's my Honda Pilot.

430
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,960
What if you just yell, I'm allergic to sandwich, I forgot!

431
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,920
And then you run out.

432
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,720
I have to get to the hospital, quick!

433
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
That's probably the worst suggestion, Travis.

434
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,840
That doesn't even make sense.

435
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,680
How could you be allergic to a construction of food?

436
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,600
What are we doing here?

437
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,880
It's the holidays.

438
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,760
You're right, Justin.

439
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,760
Y'all want to know who?

440
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,560
Oh, yeah.

441
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,160
Cool, this one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

442
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,880
Thank you, Graham.

443
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,920
It's anonymous, no, wait, they're not anonymous.

444
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,520
The website has been on the naughty list.

445
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,360
Yeah, and it just ain't going to work.

446
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,640
So I'm gonna call them, Dravens asks.

447
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,560
I like the plural.

448
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,840
What does, it's more than one person sent in.

449
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,200
The Dravens.

450
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,160
What does Santa Claus and the Christmas people do on Easter?

451
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,240
These chairs sure are a moving and a wiggling, huh?

452
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,800
I like it.

453
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm getting the ab workout.

454
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah, same.

455
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,800
I imagine this is what sitting on a yoga ball is like.

456
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,680
We filmed a special limited television event in these chairs

457
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,760
and the rolling was a constant issue.

458
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,680
That's why we keep our hands on the desk.

459
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
Scoling about 24 hours a day.

460
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,080
The thing about it that a lot of people don't know

461
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,000
is that Santa and the elves are Jewish.

462
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,640
That's why they work on Christmas.

463
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,120
Okay, okay, fun.

464
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,360
So they don't do anything on Easter except probably work.

465
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah, probably not.

466
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,080
I don't know.

467
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,560
Ask Dan an answer.

468
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,680
I don't know, Trav.

469
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,560
If you think about it conceptually,

470
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
when you think about the reason for the season,

471
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,840
Easter is pretty much the opposite of Christmas.

472
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,340
Huh?

473
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,360
In a lot of ways, if you think about it,

474
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
why we do the both of them,

475
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
it's kind of opposite ends of a life.

476
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,320
Oh, okay.

477
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,040
Oh, all right.

478
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,160
So they probably resented as much as the Easter people

479
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,920
resent Christmas.

480
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,520
Oh, I see.

481
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,020
I...

482
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,560
Maybe on Easter,

483
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,920
Santa and the Christmas people celebrate Christmas

484
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
because that's their time to do it.

485
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,360
That's when they observe it.

486
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
That doesn't make any sense either, Travis.

487
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,800
You're posting up a lot at Dookie tonight.

488
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,760
How do we feel about Dookie?

489
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,880
I want to dig into the fact that Santa Claus is Jewish.

490
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,380
Okay.

491
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,080
In the scenario you have supposed,

492
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,960
Santa Claus is an immortal Jewish man

493
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
who, when Jesus was born, was like,

494
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,280
I don't think this kid is anything special

495
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
and I'm going to throw him the greatest birthday party

496
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,320
every year for the rest of my life.

497
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,820
Yeah.

498
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,100
Okay.

499
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,120
Well, Jesus was Jewish.

500
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,680
Yes.

501
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,240
So Santa was like, all right, let's do this.

502
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
And then at a certain point, it veered away

503
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,440
and Santa was like, oh no, what about the reason for the season?

504
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,940
Yeah.

505
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,840
My cool party.

506
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,440
My cool party I'm doing.

507
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,560
When Santa celebrates Christmas on Easter, Travis,

508
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,000
the other foolish thing that you've said-

509
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,280
I'll turn to my left now.

510
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Is he waiting for him to come down the chimney?

511
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
So you're supposing that at night,

512
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
Santa goes to sleep thinking,

513
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,040
boy, I hope I bring me some cool stuff.

514
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,440
He puts cookies out for himself and says,

515
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
boy, I hope I like these.

516
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,480
Justin.

517
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
My mother loves Santa Claus.

518
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,920
Yeah, heck yeah.

519
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,040
That's two.

520
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,200
That's two, that's two.

521
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,400
They can say that one on Friends, it's okay.

522
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,560
My mother loves Santa Claus much to the point

523
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,240
where she has him decorated in her house all year round.

524
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,360
Not Christmas decorations all year, just Santa.

525
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,080
Sure.

526
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
That is an interesting distinction to make.

527
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,120
Not Christmas decorations, just Santa.

528
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,240
I never thought it was weird,

529
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
but a friend of mine recently pointed out how weird it was.

530
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
It's a bold friend?

531
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
When I asked my mother why she had so many,

532
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,120
she just said she likes him.

533
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,600
Is this weird or is my friend just being a jerk?

534
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,000
That's from Cold for Christmas in Columbus.

535
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,560
Are you here?

536
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,160
Because she likes him,

537
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,560
the only other option response is like,

538
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,320
huh, you're right, I do have a lot of Santa stuff.

539
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,760
That is so weird.

540
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,480
Hey, he's a cool guy.

541
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:22,980
Yeah.

542
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,360
Like why can't we just celebrate this cool guy all year round?

543
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,860
Yeah.

544
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,920
No, no.

545
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,420
Okay.

546
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,760
Because I'm thinking about it and that's unacceptable.

547
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,680
Tell me why, tell me why.

548
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,720
How are you going to miss Santa Claus if he's always there?

549
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,600
Yeah, it's just like how we only put up the American flag

550
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,440
during the 4th of July season.

551
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,400
When we think about being in America.

552
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,160
And that's an equivalent thing.

553
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,800
Yes.

554
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,040
And we only have pie at Thanksgiving.

555
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,120
Flaggo, the American flag who comes to bring us pies on the 4th of July.

556
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,620
Yes.

557
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
I love Flaggo.

558
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,440
He does great work when he swoops in through the half open window

559
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,280
with a pie taped to him.

560
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,400
And some baseballs.

561
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,720
And some baseballs that he gives to all the good patriotic children.

562
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,400
Will Ferrell.

563
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
But no baseballs for the liberals out there.

564
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,580
Thank you.

565
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,600
Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have never brought me any gifts.

566
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,520
But I keep my Talladega Knights, Stepbrothers, and Holmes and Watson posters up

567
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,800
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

568
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,520
Why?

569
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,480
Because I'm a fan.

570
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I do like that you specified 24 hours a day as if there wasn't like...

571
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,040
Oh, and 5 o'clock.

572
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,240
5 o'clock.

573
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,360
Time to take.

574
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,080
Take them down.

575
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,640
See you tomorrow.

576
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,200
For real.

577
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,000
All's the clock.

578
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,760
Go rest up John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell for tomorrow.

579
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,360
For real though, whoever that friend is, I know that's the last option that you gave,

580
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,320
that they're a bad friend.

581
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,400
That's the best friend you got.

582
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,800
That's the best friend you got.

583
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,400
A real good friend will tell you hard truths about yourself.

584
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,880
Yeah.

585
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,560
A real true good friend will tell you hard truths about your mom.

586
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,800
That's tough stuff.

587
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,320
99 times out of 100, it goes very bad.

588
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,560
Yeah.

589
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,160
It's a brave friend.

590
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,040
So this person, your question must have grown up in the house with Santa decorations, right?

591
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,600
Sure.

592
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,360
I have a Santa cookie jar that I realized this July was still there, and I don't know

593
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,640
if you're like me, but I looked at it and I was like, well, you're there until Christmas,

594
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
mon frere.

595
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
Because you have missed your train.

596
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,880
You get one trip out to the garage when you get put away.

597
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,760
You have missed it.

598
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,920
You get comfortable, little man.

599
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,440
You're going to check out a little holiday I like to call Halloween.

600
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,920
This is actually why I really like Halloween.

601
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,760
Okay, I have a good movie for you.

602
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,760
You kidnap Santa Claus and you bring him to Halloween and just watch him lose his mind.

603
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
It's called The Nightmare Before Christmas, Joseph.

604
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,880
No, no, no, no, no.

605
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,160
Listen, hear me out, okay?

606
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,400
So there's this skeleton man.

607
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,880
I've got a Yahoo here I'm just dying to read.

608
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,280
Hit me.

609
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,040
Was that you?

610
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,760
I wasn't looking.

611
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,880
That didn't sound like you.

612
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,960
That was, I put on the mask for a second when you weren't looking.

613
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,160
This Yahoo was sent in by Brittany.

614
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,040
Thank you, Brittany.

615
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,840
It's from, do I say that name weird?

616
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,560
Brittany.

617
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,600
Is it two syllables?

618
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,720
Are you on pot?

619
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
That's the right phrasing, right?

620
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,760
Are you on pot?

621
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,120
Are you on Fortnite right now?

622
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,480
Griffin, are you taking Fortnite?

623
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,640
I rubbed some Fortnite on my gums before I...

624
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,200
This one is asked by Yahoo Answers user, bnotnobody, who asks,

625
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,640
what are some good Christmas gifts to put in a red and black mafia slash dragon living room?

626
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,480
Good, good, good.

627
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,800
Hi.

628
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,080
Hi.

629
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,800
Hi, hello.

630
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,720
Welcome to our podcast.

631
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
It's hi, hi, period.

632
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,600
Hi.

633
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:17,840
Hi.

634
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,480
Hi, I'm trying to do some Christmas shopping for my boyfriend who is 26 years old.

635
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,520
He loves Scarface and the Goodfellas.

636
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,880
You pretty much said that in the subject of the question.

637
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,640
He also loves dragons and weapons.

638
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,160
I'm looking for some ideas to make Christmas gifts for him to put in the living room.

639
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,120
Maybe you have some ideas.

640
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
He loves fancy things.

641
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,520
Also, if you know of any online shops where I can find fancy gifts for a guy,

642
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
that would be awesome.

643
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,080
So you really don't know where to get anything.

644
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,480
If you just go to Google and type bad person,

645
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,520
the first 100 results are going to be gifts.

646
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,720
Here's what you do.

647
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,200
Yep.

648
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,840
You Photoshop this boyfriend a Scarface poster,

649
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,960
except instead of Tony Montana, it's a dragon.

650
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,600
Oh, I thought you were going to say the boyfriend, but that's even better.

651
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
No, you got to come back.

652
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,720
Listen, anyone can get mafia or dragon presents.

653
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
I want dragon mafia presents.

654
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,000
Take Tony Montana out of it.

655
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Just put in one big long sword and now it's sword face.

656
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,960
The world is swords is the subtitle.

657
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,520
Maybe there's just a dragon leaning in the background waving.

658
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah, we can Photoshop Mushu from Mulan in there also.

659
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Maybe just get him a bunch of Pete's dragon merch.

660
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
Is that the kind of dragon she's into?

661
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,880
Hey, it's me, a dragon.

662
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Can you know how he is?

663
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
You know how Pete's dragon does.

664
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
Elliot, is that his name?

665
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,240
Yeah.

666
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,160
His name is Pete.

667
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,560
No, Pete is the monster.

668
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,440
Pete is the monster.

669
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
Okay, here's the deal.

670
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,000
I already bought this guy nunchucks while you're reading the question.

671
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,200
They should be arriving soon.

672
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,960
Sorry.

673
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,880
Are the nunchucks made out of cocaine?

674
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,000
Yes, and they're painted like candy canes.

675
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,040
So it's festive.

676
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,760
End of jokes.

677
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,720
That's it.

678
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
That's all the jokes we have for this evening.

679
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,560
That's how we always come back from the live show breaks.

680
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,720
You can't even generate a unique idea.

681
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,920
I know it's a holidays, but you can't even do a unique idea.

682
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,280
I gotta do one, hold on.

683
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,240
All right, make some art.

684
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,320
Your broadcast has been intercepted by Moneytron.

685
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,880
Oh, yeah.

686
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,880
I am a cybernetic, co-organic cybernetic organism.

687
00:31:59,520 --> 00:31:59,920
Yes.

688
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,280
Cryborg 13.

689
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,720
Yeah, sci-fi.

690
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,240
People love it.

691
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,760
People love this stuff.

692
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:16,480
The planet of Moneytron is now in possession of this broadcast to bring you sponsored content.

693
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,680
My name is Dollarborg and I podcast halves to put ads inside the rest of them.

694
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
Yes, zap.

695
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,840
While you flesh organisms were distracted by celebrating your savior,

696
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,400
we have taken possession of your beloved podcast to tell you about bowl and branch.

697
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:52,000
Your flesh shells require weakness and rest where our metal silicon bodies require none.

698
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,880
When you are indulging in your weakness, we work, we toil, we plot your overthrow.

699
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,840
Dollarborg's skin is melted down, pennies forged into a copper carapace.

700
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,760
It does not require rest.

701
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,120
Make the last of your earth wounds before we conquer your planet.

702
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,440
Count with bowl and branch.

703
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,880
They have taken your cotton, your precious natural resources which you shred through

704
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,160
so carelessly while we watch in delight.

705
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,880
They have taken 100% of your cotton.

706
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,400
It says here, 100% of your organic cotton has been taken by bowl and branch to create

707
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,760
the finest sleeping experience possible.

708
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:45,680
Some of my favorite money rags, which is what Dollarborg calls business magazines,

709
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,040
love this stuff.

710
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,760
Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Fairest Company.

711
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,840
I am new to your earth tongue.

712
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,880
While they should have been covering your inevitable decline and our incredible triumphant

713
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,440
rise, they wrote about sheets.

714
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Yeah, so anyway, shipping is free and you can try them for 30 nights.

715
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,360
And if you don't love them, you can send them back for a refund and receive back the

716
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
sweet nutrients of cash.

717
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,720
You do not want to send them back.

718
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,560
For one, they are excellent.

719
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,360
For two, that would be a terrible squandering of your precious last few moments before

720
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,120
Moneytron conquers your pitiful planet.

721
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:43,520
To get started right now, our listeners can get breakfast off your first set of sheets,

723
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,720

It's B-O-L-L and branch.com promo code MYBROTHER one last time, please.

727
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,080
On Moneytron, we know how to spell everything.

728
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,040
Nothing must be spelled for us, which is why you shall fall.

729
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,680
But please allow me to indulge you.

730
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,320
B-O-L-L and do you need that one?

731
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
Allow me.

732
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,720

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,520

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,680
Life.

739
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,920

741
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,440
That's the Beef and Dairy Network podcast from maximumfun.org.

742
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,560
Also, maybe start at episode one or weirdly episode 36, which for some reason requires

743
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
no knowledge of the rest of the show.

744
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,280
Griffin, do you have any more yahoos you want to get to?

745
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,360
Griffin, yahoo me, baby.

746
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,120
I don't want to bring the show down, but I've got a really deathly serious yahoo here to

747
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,520
read and it's a special one for how sad and important it is.

748
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,320
Is it serious?

749
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm all ears.

750
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,360
It was sent in by...

751
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,720
The crow.

752
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,240
The crow.

753
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,800
Thank you.

754
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,560
Thanks to the crow.

755
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
All right, so sent in by the crow.

756
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,800
Thank you to the real the crow for it.

757
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,000
He's here with us tonight, as he always is, looking out for us.

758
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,120
And it's asked by...

759
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:26,000
By sick man.

760
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,360
Who asks?

761
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,920
What does he ask?

762
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:52,240
He says, gosh, being sick all the time is sure bad.

763
00:37:52,240 --> 00:38:01,520
Also, because this is yahoo answers, can dogs see wi-fi?

764
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,400
I gotta bring everybody's spirits up after that sad one.

765
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,720
We don't usually do bummers like that, but I see why that needed to be addressed.

766
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,240
This is a haunted doll watch.

767
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,200
This one just came in.

768
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,720
This one's festive, so I thought y'all would appreciate it.

769
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,840
It's an 18 inch porcelain haunted doll, Christmas stocking, paranormal,

770
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,760
vessel, voices, and kinetic.

771
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,760
And it's from Awesomest Finds.

772
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
And you can place a bid right now.

773
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,400
Yeah.

774
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Usually the way these live shows go, it'll be gone by the time Justin's finished.

775
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,240
There's already somebody frantically googling.

776
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,760
You can place a bid right now.

777
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
I'll give everyone in the audience a look.

778
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,720
I don't know how much you can see.

779
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Probably only a few rows back, but it's pretty.

780
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,320
Let me peep that.

781
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,040
Show Griffin.

782
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,720
It's screaming.

783
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,360
That's just a big stocking with a porcelain head on it.

784
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,240
It's screaming.

785
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,680
That's what it looks like.

786
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,320
It's old timey.

787
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,040
It's pretty creepy.

788
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,000
So here is the description.

789
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,880
It's pre-owned.

790
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,400
Yeah.

791
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,560
It's a new, fresh out of the oven spirit vessel.

792
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,200
From 2018 that we made.

793
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,880
Pre-owned, but in excellent condition if you want a unique Christmas stocking.

794
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,280
Thank you.

795
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,880
Well, here it is.

796
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
You know what?

797
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,080
These are usually full of false advertising.

798
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,120
I'll give you that one.

799
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,320
Yeah.

800
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,960
Here it is.

801
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,160
But be warned.

802
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,520
And read further.

803
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,800
Materials.

804
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Porcelain and polyester.

805
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,200
Good for any allergies out there.

806
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
Want to get those cleared up right away.

807
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,800
18-inch porcelain doll.

808
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,680
Christmas stocking.

809
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,480
Spirit vessel.

810
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,800
It has an asterisk here and it says,

811
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,840
this doll is a head and two arms only.

812
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,560
The bottom half of the body is a Christmas stocking.

813
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,520
See all photos carefully.

814
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,960
This Christmas stocking is not only unique for the upper half being a porcelain doll.

815
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,720
Yeah.

816
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,720
Oh, you need more than that to set this fine stocking apart?

817
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,080
That half of it is a doll?

818
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,440
There is something beyond our physical world that,

819
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,560
okay, of course, that has become attached to it.

820
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,160
It was in one of the boxes that I inherited from my grandmother.

821
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,920
It was with her collection of spirit vessels along with other items.

822
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,560
Was your grandmother the bad kid from Toy Story?

823
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
It has been six months since I discovered it until this very night.

824
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,560
I was convinced that it was just a mere inanimate object.

825
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,000
But then what happened?

826
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,120
Well, I'll tell you, Travis.

827
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,360
Travis, I segregate all of my new or suspected spirit vessels.

828
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:44,880
Okay.

829
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,760
Well, you don't want to get cross spirits, I guess.

830
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,520
I do not keep them in one area

831
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,320
in case I need to pinpoint the source of any paranormal activity.

832
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,880
In groups, they can be quite troublesome.

833
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,480
Especially when they consist of evil's.

834
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,120
I have had this Christmas stocking hanging on the wall near my Christmas tree,

835
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,800
which seems inadvisable.

836
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,400
That's me.

837
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,560
Only three hours ago, I heard someone in my living room,

838
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,520
I live alone.

839
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,600
Oh, that was, that was, what?

840
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,080
What?

841
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,600
Griffin, don't be mean.

842
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,360
Upon investigating, I noticed that my tree had been knocked over

843
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,560
and that most of my glass ornaments had been destroyed.

844
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,040
So anyway, folks, that person lives alone.

845
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,320
Have a great night imagining the rest of that anecdote.

846
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,760
Maybe the, maybe the doll stocking is haunted by Marmaduke.

847
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,880
Tell me about it.

848
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,520
She knew it was the doll when she looked over and the doll was going.

849
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,240
It says, as I was cleaning up the mess, alone, by myself,

850
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,760
while I sung, I'll be home for Christmas to myself, between songs,

851
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,840
by myself, between sobs.

852
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,080
Wow, this is really in depth.

853
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,600
I kept hearing something brushing into the wall near my head.

854
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,760
It was the stocking.

855
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,840
Yeah, that's what I assumed.

856
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
It was swinging back and forth on the.

857
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,040
It was swinging back and forth on the crude nail I had used to hang it.

858
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,360
What?

859
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,680
What?

860
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,320
You know what?

861
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,040
That's on me.

862
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,280
I had fashioned a nail.

863
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,040
I had fashioned a nail from some loose metal.

864
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,680
The crude nail I had used to hang it.

865
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,840
The nail is also haunted.

866
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,360
I pried it out of a Dracula coffin.

867
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,720
When I reached to grab the stocking, I heard a whisper in my ear,

868
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,920
just over my left shoulder.

869
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,360
It said, don't do that again.

870
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,280
In a threatening, yet calm, child's voice.

871
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,520
Okay, that's four different intonations

872
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,880
that I don't think you can do at the same time.

873
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,920
I try to give it justice.

874
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,760
Either something was dormant in this vessel

875
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,240
and just would not awaken for the last six months,

876
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,200
or it could be the spirit from the vessel

877
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,440
I had accidentally dropped on its head the other night.

878
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,600
Oh my, what a twist!

879
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,440
So you're saying, it's like, I'm out.

880
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,400
You know what?

881
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,840
Nevermind, this sucks.

882
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,640
And this sucks, I'm gonna go chill in that holiday footwear

883
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,840
with a head and arms.

884
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,880
When it said, don't do that again, do what?

885
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,960
Drop the thing on its head, Travis, keep up.

886
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,200
Yeah, I'm hoping I didn't anger the spirit.

887
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,640
It was an accident.

888
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,160
It was a harlequin that I had a lot of evil activity from.

889
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,480
I accidentally dropped her right on her head,

890
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,400
and the head shattered like an egg.

891
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,480
Or I would argue, like the head of a porcelain doll.

892
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,680
Yeah, that also works.

893
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,080
For a split second, it appeared that as soon as the head

894
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,720
popped on the floor, I saw a white flash of light

895
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,160
shoot into the other room.

896
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,080
My living room where this stocky was hanging.

897
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,760
Either way, I don't appreciate, negotiate, reconcile,

898
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,000
or mediate with negative entities.

899
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,040
Hey, everybody!

900
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,280
This next year, I hope we can all take a page

901
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,720
out of this playbook.

902
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,040
We are no longer going to appreciate, negotiate,

903
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,000
reconcile, or mediate with negative entities.

904
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,160
If we could figure out a way to make that rhyme with this,

905
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,720
rhyme with 2019, I think we've got our...

906
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,080
This porcelain doll should only go

907
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,680
to the proper caretakers.

908
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,160
One who dabbles in demonology.

909
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,400
In case this thing is not a normal spirit,

910
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,880
it decides to smash more than a Christmas tree

911
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,800
the next time it wants to speak.

912
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,040
Or at least someone who contacts spirits

913
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,480
to reconcile their problems.

914
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,520
Now this, remind me, this ad started with

915
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,560
if you would like an interesting stocking, let me know.

916
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,800
This is a fun stocking for kids, anyway.

917
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,360
So that is this week's Haunted Doll Watch.

918
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:57,860
Uh...

919
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,120
Yeah, no, let's do some audience questions.

920
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,080
We can do audience questions.

921
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,600
Can we warn Santa about this evil stocking first?

922
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,480
Yeah, we should give Santa a note or something.

923
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,840
So the way we do questions now,

924
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,440
please don't stand up or raise your hands

925
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,080
or anything like that.

926
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,280
If we can go ahead and get house lights up,

927
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,760
we asked you all to send in your questions,

928
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,360
or rather a brief description of the question

929
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,640
you'd like to ask ahead of time.

930
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,640
And I have some names and seat numbers here

931
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,680
that I'm going to call down.

932
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,520
Can you lower us just a skosh?

933
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,560
Just a skosh.

934
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,640
We have a microphone there.

935
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,240
And is there one in that aisle also?

936
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,880
That's romantic.

937
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,200
Yes.

938
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,640
Okay, so there's one there, one there.

939
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,120
Let's get Annabelle C82 to come down.

940
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,280
And Rowan Rezzi...

941
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,920
Rowan Rezzi, row 17, seat 1.

942
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,680
Rowan, also come down.

943
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,840
Hello.

944
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,680
Can everybody see us okay that they dropped the lights?

945
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,560
Is this weird for you all?

946
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,080
Maybe bring the lights up just a little bit more on us.

947
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,720
I don't want to...

948
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,200
Okay.

949
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,320
Now pan left.

950
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,920
Now pan left the lights.

951
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,160
Hi.

952
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,040
Hello.

953
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,000
Hi, my name is Annabelle.

954
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,360
Hi, Annabelle.

955
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,000
So my friend Jackie and I, we met at work.

956
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,080
We're staying at an Airbnb this weekend

957
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,600
and I cooked sausage and sausage gravy

958
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,200
and biscuits this morning.

959
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,840
Cool, cool.

960
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,680
And I started...

961
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,240
Was it good?

962
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,080
Phenomenal.

963
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,640
Come on, Annabelle.

964
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,400
Sorry, children.

965
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,240
That's the worst one there is.

966
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,200
You're covered, you're covered.

967
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,360
Paul got you.

968
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,200
Paul donated your $20.

969
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,000
Thank you, Paul.

970
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,720
Thank you, Paul.

971
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,280
So it's good.

972
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,080
Annabelle, go on.

973
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,800
It was very good.

974
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,920
It was really good.

975
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,040
And I started a small grease fire in the kitchen.

976
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,280
Okay.

977
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,720
Of the Airbnb that we're staying at.

978
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,520
All right.

979
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
Do I have to tell the host that I started a grease fire?

980
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,960
It didn't damage anything.

981
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,480
Now that makes me think that it did.

982
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,440
It did damage something.

983
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,080
It did damage something.

984
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,320
The way that you said that makes me think that it did damage something.

985
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,760
Annabelle, can you tell us,

986
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,320
without barfing your nasty profanity all over the place,

987
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,880
just opening up that potty mouth

988
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,280
and letting a bunch of dookie words spill out,

989
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,960
can you tell us if it did destroy anything?

990
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,280
And there's children present, so...

991
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,000
And the Lord.

992
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,520
We haven't gotten the stains off the glass top stove yet,

993
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
but we're trying.

994
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,680
Sure.

995
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,160
The easiest to replace thing.

996
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,520
No, you can get the stains off.

997
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:23,840
Yeah.

998
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,520
Try baking soda on top of it with a little bit of vinegar.

999
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,880
And then if you get a scraper,

1000
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,000
you got a good grit there and let it set in for a little bit.

1001
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,640
An abrasive.

1002
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,440
Yeah, an abrasive.

1003
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:33,680
Exactly.

1004
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,280
But not go with something like a flat

1005
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,400
because you don't want to scratch the surface.

1006
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,800
If you have a flat edge, it's going to do much better for you.

1007
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,720
I can't imagine, I've stayed in quite a few Airbnbs in my time,

1008
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,520
I can't imagine actually cooking a meal in one of them because-

1009
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,480
That's terrifying to me.

1010
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,560
None of the stuff is where I would want it to be.

1011
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,200
And also there's a small chance I might create a grease fire

1012
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,720
that would destroy the entire building.

1013
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,240
A chance that has increased having heard this exact question.

1014
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,740
Yes.

1015
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,400
There are always sauce pans and there are never frying pans.

1016
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,760
How cool is the...

1017
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,640
And you can tell with Airbnb based on like what the precautions are

1018
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,920
that they list on the website.

1019
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,800
Like if I see one toddler footprint, how cool is the landlord do you think?

1020
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,480
She stopped by and she was-

1021
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,760
So not cool at all then.

1022
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,480
That's the worst thing an Airbnb owner can do to you, 100%.

1023
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,720
She stopped by and-

1024
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,520
And she was fairly cool, but she-

1025
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
The way you said that makes me think she was.

1026
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,720
I don't care if she tried to sell you weed.

1027
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,520
If she stopped by to just poke her snoot in

1028
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,120
to see if there were any grease active grease fires in her house that she lives in.

1029
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,000
Hey, just wanted to see if you were going to be cooking with any grease later.

1030
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,960
It's fine if you do.

1031
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,840
I'm totally cool.

1032
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,600
If it didn't destroy anything, I think you're good.

1033
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,080
It's not like she's going to know psychically-

1034
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,440
There was fire here.

1035
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,280
When the grease fire started, how long did you stand there going,

1036
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,120
well, here we are.

1037
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,760
It's not my house because that's what I would have done.

1038
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,440
Travis.

1039
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,320
So cool that he's lit now.

1040
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,360
The cool arson.

1041
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,440
And Travis is staying at my house this week, so that's cool to hear too.

1042
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,000
What do you think you're going to do after you do or do not take our advice on this?

1043
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,360
A real good scrubbing on that boy with an abrasive.

1044
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1045
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,920
So you're going to lie.

1046
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,160
You're not going to tell them.

1047
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,120
Good choice.

1048
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,920
Well done.

1049
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,480
Excellent.

1050
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,600
Does that help, Annabelle?

1051
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,320
Thank you so much.

1052
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,560
Thank you.

1053
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,280
It's my pleasure.

1054
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:36,480
Let's get Connor, row 11, seat one.

1055
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,360
Connor, go ahead and come on down to this microphone here.

1056
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,240
And Rowan.

1057
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:42,800
Yes.

1058
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,360
Hi, Rowan.

1059
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:44,880
All right.

1060
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,240
So about two years ago for Christmas, I got myself figure skating lessons.

1061
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,200
And in that time, I have improved significantly.

1062
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,880
How long ago did you get these lessons?

1063
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,840
About two years ago.

1064
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,680
Was there a certain piece of media that had come out around that time?

1065
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,880
Listen, yes.

1066
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,600
You're my hero.

1067
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,320
That's awesome.

1068
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,480
I'm also glad to hear that you took lessons and improved.

1069
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,920
That's the way that's supposed to go.

1070
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,480
That's very good.

1071
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,680
OK, sorry to interrupt.

1072
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,440
I was just deeply curious.

1073
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,240
Anyway, the point is that while I have gotten better,

1074
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,960
I am not what you would call good.

1075
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,320
And during almost the entire two years since I've started skating,

1076
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,960
there is this other skater at the rink that kind of makes fun of me

1077
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,880
and bullies me about my skills.

1078
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,440
Like a bigger kid.

1079
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,480
There's a twist.

1080
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,840
Yeah, the problem is that he is about eight years old.

1081
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:54,720
How good is the eight-year-old?

1082
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,880
Much better than me.

1083
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,520
Ah, shoot.

1084
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,920
That's the problem with kids.

1085
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,600
Is that they can learn skills so much better than we can.

1086
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,640
Yeah, they're good at learning.

1087
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,480
That's the one thing they have on their side.

1088
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,720
So what are you looking for here?

1089
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,280
Well, I'd like to-

1090
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,560
You want Jeff to lose phone number?

1091
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,680
Take him out.

1092
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,880
Obviously, I can't fight a child.

1093
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,760
Can't fight a child.

1094
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,080
That's right.

1095
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,280
That was a test.

1096
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,080
And you pass.

1097
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,440
I don't know, Jeff Jaluli.

1098
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,320
Nice try.

1099
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,160
Sure, you can't fight a child.

1100
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,720
But what if we find another child to fight that child?

1101
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,080
Say you find three adult brothers that love fighting kids.

1102
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,200
Say it makes them feel like big men.

1103
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,240
Like big, tough dudes and they have a podcast.

1104
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,480
And it's the Sklar brothers.

1105
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,360
The three Sklar brothers.

1106
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,320
The three Sklar brothers.

1107
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,760
Okay, sorry.

1108
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,280
What do you want to do to this kid?

1109
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,480
You want to punish the child?

1110
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,440
You want to punish the child?

1111
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,200
You should reward this child, Rowan.

1112
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,000
Let me tell you why.

1113
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,200
What this child has done is given you something to chase.

1114
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,880
Right now, if you don't have that rival, you have nothing to shoot for.

1115
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,240
But now you're like, I have to get good enough to beat this eight-year-old in some kind of

1116
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,760
ice skating meet.

1117
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,160
I don't know what it's called in the lingo.

1118
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
An ice skating match, perhaps.

1119
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,040
And you need to skate rings around this kid, literally.

1120
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,880
Because that's a thing you do when ice skating.

1121
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,600
It's not going to...

1122
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,200
They have so much more time and brain energy to spend getting good at it.

1123
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,440
If the eight-year-old trains at the same rate as you, they'll just always kind of be better

1124
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,720
because that's what kids do.

1125
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,840
Then you need to get that kid like a Nintendo DS or something.

1126
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,400
There it is.

1127
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,920
Say like, hey, thank you for everything.

1128
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,880
You don't need Jeff Jalut, you need Yu-Gi-Oh!

1129
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,000
So I should use my adult money to buy this child a Nintendo Switch and then

1130
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,800
surpass him.

1131
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,280
Yes!

1132
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,000
Yes!

1133
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,480
See, you're thinking!

1134
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,680
And then take the Switch back!

1135
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,360
Your bigger body than them is, can it do tricks on the ice?

1136
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,440
And I think they're called tricks that...

1137
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,120
Stunts or tricks?

1138
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,560
Moves, maneuvers.

1139
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,840
That they can't possibly do because of their smaller frame.

1140
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,320
Like reach high things on shelves as you skate.

1141
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,320
Yeah.

1142
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,760
Maybe build a whole routine around shelves.

1143
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,880
When you do the...

1144
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,000
Or driving.

1145
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,920
When you do the hurdles during your ice dressage.

1146
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,840
Do you have a move where you rent a car?

1147
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,920
Where you pay your taxes?

1148
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,560
Where you think about how you're going to die?

1149
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,400
I don't know if that's a move.

1150
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,000
I picked that.

1151
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,280
Justin just going around the rink with his arms straight down.

1152
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,400
Looking into the middle distance for two minutes while Mad World plays.

1153
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,640
Does that help?

1154
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,480
Yes, that helped.

1155
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,440
Imagine my relief.

1156
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,320
Don't lie to us.

1157
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,840
Thank you, Rowan.

1158
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,120
Yeah, let's get one more in the wings.

1159
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,680
Liam, section B, row 16, seat 5.

1160
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,520
Go ahead and come down to that microphone.

1161
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,120
Hey, Connor, I presume.

1162
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, that's correct.

1163
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,760
Can you get right up on that microphone, Connor?

1164
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,040
Don't be scared.

1165
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,800
You can tilt it up towards it if you want.

1166
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,280
Sick.

1167
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:01,600
Cool.

1168
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:01,920
Nice.

1169
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,420
Nice.

1170
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,720
What is your question?

1171
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,320
So I actually sent in two.

1172
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,120
I didn't know which one.

1173
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,200
It's the one that I might be particularly interested in because of the...

1174
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,600
Yes.

1175
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:11,920
Okay.

1176
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,240
Yeah.

1177
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,960
So every year during Christmas Eve, it's the only time we go to church.

1178
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,200
Sure.

1179
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:18,880
And...

1180
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,400
So you're 90% of people.

1181
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,360
So like, you know, I love the big man upstairs and everything.

1182
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,120
But not enough to go the other week.

1183
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,680
Yeah.

1184
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,400
Huh.

1185
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,960
Okay.

1186
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,840
Love this stuff.

1187
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,440
But it's like the same thing every year.

1188
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,200
And I've gotten really into like...

1189
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,920
They're not really adding new stuff to Christmas, huh?

1190
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,560
This year, we found a new chapter.

1191
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,680
You'll never believe this.

1192
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,040
I've written a little fan fiction I'd like to read.

1193
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,720
So like, I want to play Pokemon while I'm there.

1194
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,280
Yeah.

1195
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,240
Can you say that again?

1196
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,280
Because people were laughing.

1197
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,120
It's really the crux of the question, Connor.

1198
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,080
I want to play Pokemon while I'm there at church.

1199
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,600
I can't stop, you know, to go to church.

1200
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,920
So I was wondering like, if there are any like,

1201
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,880
like cool ways I could sneak it without like,

1202
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,400
you know, God or my pastor seeing.

1203
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
You've come to the right place.

1204
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,920
This is not a joke.

1205
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,920
This is not a joke.

1206
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,600
It was during the Easter pageant at our church.

1207
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,040
HBC.

1208
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,080
You can swing by if you want.

1209
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,680
They shut down and sold all the pews.

1210
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:38,000
That I caught Kangaskhan thus completing the 150 original Pokemon in Pokemon Red and Blue at church.

1211
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,640
Also, not a joke.

1212
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,040
Said a short thank you prayer for the good fortune.

1213
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,400
He's a hard Pokemon to catch.

1214
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,760
It's in the safari zone.

1215
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,400
You basically have to throw a ball and hope for the best.

1216
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,240
Did you catch it?

1217
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:56,800
Were you?

1218
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,520
Wait, were you in the show or were you watching the show?

1219
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,400
I was in the show.

1220
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,440
Who were you playing?

1221
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,520
How old were you?

1222
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,400
I was 13 or so.

1223
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,760
And I don't know, a shepherd or something.

1224
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,120
I wasn't Jesus in this one.

1225
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,360
Here's what you do.

1226
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,240
You get a Bible and then you get an X-Acto knife.

1227
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,680
And then you're going to cut out all the boring parts.

1228
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,780
Wink.

1229
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,740
And then you're going to put the DS inside.

1230
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,660
Wait, what iteration of Pokemon are we talking about?

1231
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,220
The new Switch?

1232
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,340
No, no, no.

1233
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,460
It's a 3DS.

1234
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,100
Okay.

1235
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,940
And what version of the Bible do you have?

1236
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,340
You're going to need a big one.

1237
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,340
You're going to need a KGAV.

1238
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,540
NIV's not going to cut it.

1239
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,180
You're going to hand do it with the ones they hand out on street corners?

1240
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,380
It's the teen version.

1241
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,100
Yes, that might already come with it actually.

1242
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,780
Yeah, that's what it is.

1243
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,820
You know, here's what you do.

1244
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,140
When you try to hide it and people see you doing it,

1245
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,580
they're like, oh, he's thinking it.

1246
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,460
Here's what you do.

1247
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,420
You like hold it up.

1248
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,020
And then when people see you, they're like, well, it must be okay.

1249
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:01,860
He's not trying.

1250
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,220
Maybe, hmm, does Connor know something I don't?

1251
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,540
And pretty soon everyone's catching them all.

1252
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,140
Connor, hide the screen from everyone.

1253
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,620
Play it to your heart's content.

1254
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,060
When someone gives you a dirty look, say, yeah, I got the Bible on here.

1255
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,900
That's right.

1256
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,220
These things, you may want to look into it, Mabel, because they got the Bible on them.

1257
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,980
And then you hold it up and you've written across the back, the Bible on here.

1258
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,620
That's good.

1259
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,980
And they're like, oh, okay.

1260
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,980
Custom skin for your 3DS.

1261
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,260
I mean, the only people who are going to catch you while they're praying

1262
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,940
are other people breaking the rules.

1263
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,020
You just got to make sure you got that volume turned down.

1264
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,820
Because it can't be like, happy birthday, Jesus.

1265
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,300
Thank you for it.

1266
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,460
And then...

1267
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,420
Does that help?

1268
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,220
Yeah, definitely.

1269
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,700
Excellent.

1270
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,100
Thank you.

1271
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,260
Did Liam...

1272
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:00,900
Liam.

1273
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,460
Hello.

1274
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,500
Hi, hi, hi.

1275
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,060
Hi.

1276
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,620
Okay.

1277
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:07,700
So I work as a personal nanny out of someone's house.

1278
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,100
Okay.

1279
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,460
It's a very old house.

1280
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,020
And the grandparent of the sweet baby child named Henry is...

1281
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:14,740
Good name.

1282
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,500
Currently, very good name.

1283
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,060
Is currently working to paint the outside of the house.

1284
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:24,900
Problem, he is an old man with bad hearing.

1285
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,380
And he sometimes doesn't notice when I'm playing in the living room.

1286
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:35,700
And he will use the bathroom with the door wide open.

1287
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:49,300
And I don't know how to comfortably ask him to release all of himself with the door closed.

1288
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,220
Okay, I was waiting for the end of that sentence.

1289
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,660
I thought you were going to say,

1290
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:56,260
I could tell because the door's open he wasn't getting the job done.

1291
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,860
So I wanted him to feel comfortable.

1292
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:02,260
Might I suggest he comes tomorrow or the next time you work and once that,

1293
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,660
oh, the house has already been painted by you in the night.

1294
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,140
And that way he didn't have to ever address any of this.

1295
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:14,660
Yeah, that's a good, that's going to be an important sort of element in all of our answers

1296
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,260
is you not having to directly address this, which I imagine is a relief to you.

1297
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,660
And I'll be honest.

1298
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,940
The sentence you sent in was,

1299
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,660
how do I get Henry's grandpa to stop paying with the door open?

1300
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,900
And I thought you were talking about my dad.

1301
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,500
Is that a problem you also had?

1302
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,420
We might have misread that one.

1303
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:39,620
So I'm playing at a disadvantage now because I'm hugely disappointed.

1304
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,380
Yeah, I mean, you could get one of those like,

1305
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,540
like a sliding door at a grocery store,

1306
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,660
but steal it from then and then put it on the bathroom, I guess.

1307
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,860
Not a lot of funny things to say.

1308
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,580
Maybe just a sign on the door that says other people are here.

1309
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,260
That's good.

1310
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:05,380
It's a, it's an occupied vacant like switch,

1311
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,460
but it's on the front door of the house.

1312
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,580
Could be good.

1313
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,660
Could you quit?

1314
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,260
Hey, could you quit?

1315
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,860
I could use a nanny.

1316
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,220
You can work at my house.

1317
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:22,500
Now the house is all doors.

1318
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:22,980
Yeah.

1319
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,780
And no pee.

1320
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,220
Sure.

1321
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:25,940
Sounds great.

1322
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,700
I go to Subway.

1323
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,180
Like a man.

1324
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,500
Are you going to buy a sandwich today, Mr. McElroy?

1325
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,460
Still thinking about it.

1326
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,180
Give me a minute.

1327
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,980
Do you have that special bread?

1328
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,580
Have you guessed the kind of bread I like?

1329
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,180
Like Pee Rumpelstiltskin.

1330
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:52,660
You must solve my bread riddle before I buy a sandwich.

1331
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,380
After he's done, he just yelled, nice.

1332
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,380
Because I bet it'll take one or two of those before he gets the message.

1333
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:10,020
Yeah, you gotta think that the grandpa, if he knew,

1334
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,020
would not, he would also not be stoked about this arrangement.

1335
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:14,340
Right.

1336
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,700
Does he listen to the show?

1337
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,820
Because maybe.

1338
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,620
I think just.

1339
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,900
Hey, Henry's grandpa.

1340
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,500
Henry's grandpa, it's me.

1341
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:20,980
Hoops.

1342
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,060
There's your favorite.

1343
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,300
There's two stalls at Subway, my man.

1344
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,180
See you there.

1345
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:28,820
See you there.

1346
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,260
Come on down.

1347
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,420
Does that answer your question?

1348
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:33,940
Thank you.

1349
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,020
That's a little non-committal.

1350
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,140
Okay, so that's our candle night spectacular for the year.

1351
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,180
Seriously, thank you so much for coming to Huntington.

1352
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,140
That is so sweet of you.

1353
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,260
Yeah, we hope you all had a good time in our fair city.

1354
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,740
We love this city very much.

1355
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,580
We were very proud to shoot our TV show here.

1356
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,780
Hopefully you saw some of the landmarks from the TV show.

1357
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,620
Beloved West Virginia band, Ona, which is a very good band,

1358
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,820
is gonna be playing at the V Club at 1030 after our show.

1359
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,620
Like two blocks that way.

1360
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,060
Two blocks that way up on 8th Street.

1361
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,180
It should be fun.

1362
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,060
You should go check them out.

1363
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,180
We will not be able to hang out.

1364
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:14,020
We will not be there because we have a thousand children and we're very old.

1365
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,500
It's true.

1366
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,140
Thank you to Paul Sabourin, American hero.

1367
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,660
If you haven't listened to Paul and Storm, go to paulandstorm.com.

1368
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,460
You have, though.

1369
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,820
They were in the Christmas, the Candle Nights mix we played at the top of the show.

1370
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,580
We also want to say thank you to Still Buffering, to Sawbones, and to Schmanners.

1371
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,180
Schmanners was great, huh?

1372
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,300
Yeah, great show.

1373
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,260
Thank you to our daddy for playing us on.

1374
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,260
Thank you to-

1375
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:42,980
The Smurls.

1376
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,620
The Smurls.

1377
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,100
Thank you.

1378
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:49,380
Thank you to everybody who contributed to the Mabim Bam Angels initiative.

1379
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:49,860
Yes.

1380
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:54,740
It is like, it is still like the most humbling, like coolest thing every year that you all,

1381
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:59,460
most of whom don't live in the city, think to do something very nice for people who do

1382
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,100
live in the city.

1383
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,620
It means like the world to us.

1384
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,180
So thank you all if you contributed to that.

1385
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:10,180
Thank you to Riley Smurls and the Smurls for spearheading the Candle Nights stars.

1386
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:10,420
Yes.

1387
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,860
That you see here at the front of the stage.

1388
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:18,020
The, by the way, the Mabim Bam Angels, I just want to say that they claimed 100 stockings

1389
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,260
and raised $15,000 in donations.

1390
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:26,500
They're buying 15 beds, a bunch of appliances, clothes, slash winter gear, and toys for 30

1391
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,860
more children who weren't even on the original list.

1392
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,820
So they are-

1393
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:31,220
Wow.

1394
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:31,780
Dang it.

1395
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,460
That is, that's incredible.

1396
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:41,460
You, by coming, have helped us raise thousands upon thousands of dollars for Recovery Point,

1397
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,100
which is treating opiate addiction here in our area.

1398
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,100
So thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts.

1399
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,700
And thank you to John Rodrick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song instead

1400
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,700
of parts you're off the album putting the days to bed.

1401
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,660
Very good album.

1402
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,300
And-

1403
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,900
Oh, I also want to say thank you to Amanda, who you may have seen down in the lobby, who

1404
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,300
does a lot of work with us and she's quite amazing.

1405
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,660
And she's helped us out so much.

1406
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,260
Buy a poster by Emily.

1407
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,140
She is great too.

1408
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,420
Emily, is it Corrupted Jim on Twitter?

1409
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:10,920
Yeah.

1410
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,420
Yeah.

1411
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:12,920
Hi.

1412
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,420
Hi, Emily.

1413
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:13,920
Hey.

1414
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,420
I think that's right.

1415
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:14,920
Okay.

1416
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,420
Yeah.

1417
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,380
Here's the final Yahoo.

1418
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:17,880
Here it is.

1419
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,380
It was sent in by Zed.

1420
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,900
Thank you, Zed.

1421
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,700
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

1422
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,380
I think I'm going to get a name to load on this.

1423
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:25,880
Nope.

1424
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:34,820
Terry asks, is the Happy Honda Days promotion part of the war on Christmas?

1425
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,140
My name is Justin McElroy.

1426
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,380
I'm Travis McElroy.

1427
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1428
01:04:42,260 --> 01:05:09,140
This has been My Brother, My Brother, My Brother.

1429
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:09,780
Hey, gang.

1430
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,740
This is Jesse and I am joined by Bikram, the managing director of Maximum Fund.

1431
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:15,620
Hi, everyone.

1432
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:20,180
So we have some really amazing news to close out 2018.

1433
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:25,460
After this spring's pledge drive, we gave members the chance to buy enamel pins

1434
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:30,980
with the full profits of those sales going to the National Immigration Law Center.

1435
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,100
This is a tough time to be an immigrant in the United States.

1436
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,820
As individuals, as a company, and as a community,

1437
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,740
we wanted to help provide resources for immigrants in the face of these attacks.

1438
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,740
We're proud to live in a nation of immigrants.

1439
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:47,140
And many of us here at Max Fund are immigrants or the children of immigrants ourselves.

1440
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,700
Together, we raised over $100,000.

1441
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,540
NILC will put that money to good use, providing legal representation to immigrants

1442
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,580
and their families who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it.

1443
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:03,540
We are so proud of our community for making such an immense difference in so many lives.

1444
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:10,740
And whether you bought pins or not, you can help the NILC advocate for immigrants right now.

1445
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:16,740
All you have to do is go to maximumfund.org slash N-I-L-C.

1446
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:20,740
That's maximumfund.org slash N-I-L-C.

1447
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,580
Our thanks go to all of you who made this possible.

1448
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,020
Great work, everybody.

1449
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:33,700
And happy holidays from all of us at Max Fund.
