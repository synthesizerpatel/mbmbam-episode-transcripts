1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me and Advice Show for the modern era.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm your middle-est brother Travis, all bark, no bite, woof woof, mangy mongrel, dog pwned, McElroy.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, I didn't know at what point in there you would be finished saying dog stuff.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But this is Griffin McElroy, rawhide, flea and tick medicine, heartworm medicine.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hey, can I ask you guys something?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I love it.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I know Justin, Griffin, you guys are big, big financial bros.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You guys are Wall Street mogul.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I see a lot of people talking about the stocks.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, and I'm so glad that we're bringing that here.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't notice a lot of people talk about bonds so much.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Bonds are done, bonds are over.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They keep delaying it.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, okay.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Stocks, though, are on the tip of everyone's tongues and lips.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Finally, I think it's exciting that the national conversation has finally veered into our –

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
man, I say our weird – that's how I normally do it.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, you really hit that hard.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Our area of sort of expertise.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is our wheel.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We're in our wheelhouse, finally, Starks.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was hoping that you guys could take this opportunity,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because I'm sure a lot of people are as confused as I am.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sure.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because you see a lot of talk about shorting and, I guess, longing, I guess.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Longing is the opposite, yeah.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't know my elbow from my asshole,

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and so if you guys would tell me a little bit about it, that would be great.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Trav, I was talking to my close personal friend, Mad Money's Jim Cramer.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We had a little play date for the kids the other day,

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and don't worry, they were wearing their special helmets.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So that there was no risk of transmission,

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and Mad Money's Jim Cramer knows where to get those helmets and the good ones, too.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And if you don't know what kind of helmets I'm talking about, don't worry about it.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's really only for a certain, let's say, salary level.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But anyway, he explained it to me in this very helpful way,

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and he used GameStop as the example.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And you know how when Crash Bandicoot 4 comes out,

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and in order to get it, you trade in Crash Bandicoot 3 for it.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Right.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But the value is depreciated.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, you have to turn in Bandicoot 3 and 1 together to get 4.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But even that, it's not exactly one-to-one,

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and that's something that Mr. Cramer, my good friend, had explained to me about it.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The differential between those two values is stocks.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So the price difference between Crash Bandicoot 3 and Crash Bandicoot 4 is stocks?

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No! God!

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No!

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sorry.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Justin, can you help me? Can you tag in here?

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am sending jokes out of the room.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I will explain what is happening with GameStop stocks in 30 seconds.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you ready?

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sure.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm so glad our show's going to stop being funny.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No jokes.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We're only three minutes in, though.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's a public service.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But do some jokes.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I had a whole thing about Jim Cramer, my friend.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No jokes.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hey, can we do 30 seconds of jokes,

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and then pretend like you didn't do 30 seconds of jokes,

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and go back to making jokes about it?

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I put in an effort to explain it good, but I also did jokes.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So I don't see why you get to only do one of those.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will make three.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can you use silly words?

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Shut up.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll make three discrete fart noises.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
During my explanation.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, they better get good, too.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Are you ready?

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, they better be good, though.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All right.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's an intro.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't start with one.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That one doesn't count.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You've got to do three more.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Internal.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In addition to buying stocks, when you buy a stock, it says,

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think this stock's going to increase in value.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's short stocks, which is where you borrow some stocks and say,

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think this is going to go down in value,

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and I'll be able to sell it for less than it is right now.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A lot of people did that with GameStop, because it's a bad business.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Gasping.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, I was gasping for a rip, wasn't I?

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
A lot of hedge fund nerds did that with GameStop.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
A bunch of people on Reddit said, actually,

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
what if we all buy GameStop at the same time?

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That'll really fuck those dudes up.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then they all did it at the same time,

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and it fucked those dudes up,

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
because they were expecting the stock to go down,

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but because everybody on Reddit bought it at the same time,

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the stock price went up, so now they're mad,

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and the people on Reddit have money.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I will credit you one fart noise, Justin,

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because hedge fund managers losing everything is way funnier

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
than any joke that we're going to be able to do on this show today.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Very funny.

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Now, that's the entire explanation.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Here's what I don't know.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Does this affect me in a negative way?

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Right, or a positive way.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No, it does affect me in a positive way,

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
because it's extremely funny.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's super funny.

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's so funny.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But it might be less funny if I knew if it affected me in some way.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That I don't know.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I bought stocks in Cheez-Its.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Is that affected by this?

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Specifically, the food product, I went to the store.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I said, give me 100 boxes of Cheez-Its.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm ready to sell them back when they increase in value.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is that affected by this?

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It depends, Travis, on if Cheez-Its were part of these modern-day Robin Hoods

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
over on Reddit, by which I mean, by all accounts,

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
just really kind of shitty people still.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Were they trying to Roger the big man by buying up Cheez-It stock

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
when everybody thinks Cheez-It's going to fail?

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now, I don't think anybody would think Cheez-It's going to fail.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Too crunchy to fail.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Too zesty to zesty.

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you're telling me these boxes of Cheez-Its are worthless?

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Not sort of taste-wise.

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, they're all open.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've been eating out of them.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Maybe to bread some chicken.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now we're talking.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, but I feel like that's a loss.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I feel like at that point, I'm only getting 75% return on my Cheez-It stock.

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
My favorite part of this whole saga so far has been that the trading apps

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
have shut down GameStop trading, which is, you know, illegal.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And AOC was out there like, this is illegal, and we are going to fuck you up.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And then Ted Cruz, famous pants pisser, comes in and is like,

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that's right, AOC, get him.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And then AOC was like, shut the fuck up, Ted Cruz.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Shut the fuck up, Ted.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're ruining it for everybody, Ted.

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You don't get to be on this side of it.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You get to be on the wrong side forever, Ted, you fucking dipshit.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hey, AOC, if you're listening, you're welcome to come on the show anytime.

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Please come on our fucking show.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And I will say, I'm going to go ahead and lay it out.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Ted Cruz is not welcome at any time.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Ted Cruz is not welcome on this show.

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Unless he wants to do 420 with us.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And unless we can put down some plastic sheets on the chairs.

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So this is an advice show.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
By the way, I know less now than I did when we started about what happened.

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So thank you.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You did such a good job.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You just casually threw out the words,

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
somebody borrowed stock to sell it when it was worth less,

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and now they're mad.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What does that fucking mean?

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Who did they borrow it from?

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When you short a stock, you're betting that it's going to drop in value, right?

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because you borrow it at a certain price, right?

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then when you buy it, you're saying, I'm going to buy this later.

183
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's basically what you're saying.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the differential between the price that you eventually buy it at,

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and the price that you borrowed it at, is shorting it.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And that says, this place is going down.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Now some people do that, and then they're like,

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm going to join the board and fuck this place up.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm going to short this stock by going in and shorting it myself,

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
which does not seem very good.

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But it does seem like a good plan.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I see it's effective.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It would be like me saying that, betting that Paul Blart 3 is going to be bad,

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and then being hired as the director of Paul Blart 3,

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and pushing one of the cameras into the swimming pool full of macaroni and cheese,

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
which is a major set piece of the film.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I've ruined the movie myself.

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And that was a belabored metaphor, but you get the idea.

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You guys know what would be so funny?

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What's that?

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If anyone from Reddit is listening, it would be so funny.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I heard all these hedge fund bros,

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and they were going to short sell my brother, my brother and me.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Can you imagine if you guys really drove our stock up,

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and made us super famous and really cool dudes?

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, maybe wait until after our Ippo,

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
which is how Jim Cramer taught me to say IPO.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We got an Ippo.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We have to Ippo.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We got an Ippo.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We have to become publicly traded.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Jim Cramer's got a character he calls the Ippo Hippo,

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and he comes on whenever...

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Guys, the Ippo Hippo's coming into the studio.

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The Ippo Hippo's rolling into the studio.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He says, this is a great Ippo.

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know a lot of people don't care for Jim Cramer,

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but he's a chill bro who has the good kush,

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and he knows where to get the good helmets for the children,

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
so we love him around here.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Unless there is a reason that we should love Jim Cramer

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that we're just not aware of.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He's got the good kush.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He's a chill bro who with a good hang and great kush

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and cool helmets for the kids.

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And has never done anything wrong.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want to start saying that more often.

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Just laying it out.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They've never done anything wrong.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Blanket acceptance.

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I swear to God, if you are about to tweet at us,

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
actually, here's a thing that Jim Cramer did wrong,

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
we probably could have guessed it.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, you can just tweet that at Ted Cruz.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, or Jim Cramer.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Or Jim Cramer.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hey, Jim.

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Just wanted to remind you about this thing you did.

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Jim Cramer's the one fucked up, probably.

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We've all fucked up, haven't we?

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Except some people worse than others.

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Not like that thing Jim Cramer may or may not have done.

243
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I didn't like it when Jim Cramer was doing the stand-up,

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and he got so racist.

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Remember that?

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, I remember that.

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Remember when Jim Cramer did that?

248
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
These are the words.

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Do you guys ever think about how Michael Richards did go off

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and be big racist, big racist,

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and say the most racist words on his stage,

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and everybody started booing at him?

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And you could tell he ran some quick calculus in his head

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
about what he should say immediately after,

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and what he came up with was,

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
these are the words.

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, Michael, that wasn't it, partner.

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It should have been, the words that follow that is,

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
well, I'll be going now, forever.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll be on the moon.

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't worry about me, Michael Richards.

262
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm heading out.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Bye, everybody.

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm departing the universal consciousness.

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Goodbye.

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Does anybody know where the nearest tar pit is?

267
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because I'm just going to stroll right in.

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's me, Cosmo Cramer.

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is an advice show, as you certainly guessed at this point.

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And we are here to help.

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You know what's funny, guy?

272
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I feel like this is a weird show

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
because this is the first one we've recorded

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
since the release of our book about podcasting.

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Everybody has a podcast except you.

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I kind of feel like this is the time to rest on our laurels.

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's no point in improving anymore.

278
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes, thank you.

279
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was going to say the same thing.

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, it's like victory lap time.

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
At this point, the bad part is people, anytime we make any errors,

282
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
people could be like, well, you wrote the book on podcasting.

283
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So that is something that has only recently occurred to me.

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But it's also good because it's like, hey, I wrote the book on podcasting.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This must be the right way to do it.

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's not an error.

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's not an error.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
When we said for sure that Jim Cramer has never done anything wrong,

289
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
that wasn't an error.

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I did the book on podcasting.

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Although if we do fuck up, we can be like,

292
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
yes, we did write the book on podcasting, but I didn't write that one part.

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Justin did that one part.

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That was a ghostwriter, by which I mean the ghostwriter of television fame.

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, fuck, we should have put that on the cover,

297
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that ghostwriter helped us write it.

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We just put a bunch of letters down and we said,

299
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
ghostwriter, here's some letters.

300
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And we threw the letters up in the air or whatever,

301
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and he arranged them into words about podcasting.

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Can I please, please, please.

303
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I wish you would, coward.

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I recently moved into an apartment building next to an Arby's.

305
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Nice.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I love to eat at Arby's.

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's the end of the question.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is written from everyone.

309
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

310
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I love to eat at Arby's, but because of everything going on,

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
they don't allow walk-ins and you can't walk up to a drive-through and order.

312
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
However, last month I saw someone bike through the drive-through, no problem.

313
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't have a bike,

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and I don't want to drive my car through the busy road in front of both businesses

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
just for a craving.

316
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What's the smallest mode of transportation you think they will allow?

317
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's from Meat Seeking Mistland, Michigan.

318
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay, this is actually finally one we can really sink our teeth in.

319
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, until I read this question, it had not occurred to me

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
how silly one would feel if they lived next to,

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
directly next to a drive-through.

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Are you going to get into your car, pull out of your parking space,

323
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
drive around, drive farther than you would walk,

324
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and then go back and park in view of the drive-through window

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and say, like, thanks again, Doug, as you go into your house?

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What about door dashing it and just as they're leaving the drive-through,

327
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
just yell out your window, like, hey, chuck it up.

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll meet you halfway.

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Chuck it up.

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Hey, listen, I made a little rascal-style basket on a rope.

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Chuck it up.

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You have to twist those pedals around to raise it up.

333
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a pulley system.

334
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
First of all, it feels like we've been talking about nothing but fast food

335
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
for the last four episodes in a row, and that's a weird confluence of events,

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
but there's no Arby's Law.

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
There's Arby's best practices.

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When you start an open Arby's franchise, you probably are sent a binder,

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and that binder is like, here's good ways to do Arby's,

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and please do them this way so that there's some Arby's consistency.

341
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can pretty much guarantee you, though, that people working at this Arby's

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
would be willing to work out some sort of walk-through arrangement with you.

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There has to be some Arby's Law, Griffin.

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can't just say blanket statement that everything in Arby's is a suggestion.

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No, it's not a suggestion.

346
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Again, there's best practices, but I'm saying if you work at—

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I had clients, as I referred to them at the TCBY,

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
who I would mix some of the scoopable ice cream into the milkshakes

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
when you were supposed to just use the soft serve,

350
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
or I would blend soft serve and scoopable ice cream,

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
which you're probably not supposed to do,

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and I probably cost TCBY hundreds of thousands of dollars,

353
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
but those are my clients.

354
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Those are my people.

355
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Who am I without my clients?

356
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But, Griffin, you can't assume that every fast food employee

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
is a free thinker like you are, right?

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So the risk is that you walk up and you're like,

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
it's cool, I had an arrangement with Jerry,

360
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and they're like, Jerry's not here today.

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm Diane, and I follow the rules.

362
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And now you're just out a sandwich.

363
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You've got to find the Patch Adams of that Arby's,

364
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
who doesn't play by the rules, but respects the client

365
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and loves the client, and the client's never wrong.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You know, I had a friend, Jason Daniel Aldridge,

367
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
used to work at Arby's.

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I didn't know that.

369
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah, when you work at Arby's, there's a huge loaf of meat

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
that they're slicing, the slices of roast beef,

371
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the titular Arby off of.

372
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You have to wear a chainmail glove when you're doing it,

373
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and he stole one.

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's so cool.

375
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Chainmail Arby's glove.

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's fucking radical.

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Not radical.

378
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You'd probably fight a snake with that.

379
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No problem.

380
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

381
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Not an issue.

382
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Especially if it's made of roast beef.

383
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you think you could get away with Healy's?

384
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Arby's?

385
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, you mean rolling through?

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Mm-hmm.

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay, I'm just going to gut check this.

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay.

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Healy's, no.

390
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Pogo stick, no.

391
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right?

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Skateboard?

393
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It has to contain you in some ways.

394
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah.

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Bicycle doesn't contain you.

396
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's true.

397
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

398
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Motorcycle, they wouldn't turn away a motorcycle.

399
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Segway is maybe about as far as I think they would be.

400
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A bicycle is honestly the lowest.

401
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think a Razor scooter, maybe?

402
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Razor scooter.

403
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, maybe a Razor.

404
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What about a box car racer?

405
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, maybe.

406
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You just finished the big race with your Boy Scout troop,

407
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and it happens to end at the bottom of the hill as an Arby's,

408
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and you just coast through the driveway.

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I know.

410
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They're trying to wait for a car to be in the drive-through,

411
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and when they pull up to the sign, run up and hop into that car.

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No problem.

413
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And say, hey, what's up?

414
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My name's Tyson.

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hey, don't freak out.

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Hey, hey.

417
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Put your phone down.

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Put your phone down.

419
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
This can go one of two ways.

420
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is a gun, but it's unrelated.

421
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This can go one of two ways.

422
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Either you help me out, or I will leave,

423
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and I will wait for another car, and I will see if they're cooler.

424
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But I'm hungry for roast beef sandwiches.

425
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you want a Yahoo?

426
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, please.

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, please.

428
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This one was sent in by several people.

429
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, who I'm going to call them.

430
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Tyson asks, if you could travel to Mars,

431
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
who would you travel with and what's next?

432
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, that's tough, man.

433
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you travel to Mars, how long does it take?

434
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What do you guys think?

435
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Are we staying at Mars, or is it just like a drive-by like, ooh, Mars?

436
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
To Mars.

437
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm seeing how long it takes to get to Mars.

438
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Around seven months.

439
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thirty seconds.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, okay.

441
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No, that was a good one.

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That was good.

443
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It took me a minute to run it in my head.

444
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Like, why does that sound familiar?

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then I remembered about Mr. Leto and his great music,

446
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and then I was like, oh, that's it.

447
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But it would take about six to eight months,

448
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
which is longer than astronauts currently stay

449
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
on the International Space Station.

450
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So there would be like, you know, return trip if you want to come back,

451
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
but let's round it up to two years.

452
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We're talking about bone density loss.

453
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And if we're going to do that, I want a fucking road dog up there,

454
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
by which I mean, I guess, a space dog.

455
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I think, yeah, I think space dog would be the way to go.

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Can you imagine a dog trying to get around floating in the air?

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's adorable.

458
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Kicking their little legs.

459
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, that's a good boy.

460
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Fucking Elon.

461
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll tell you why.

462
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay.

463
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They have to come get him.

464
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
They have to come get him is the first one.

465
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If he wants them to come get him, they have to.

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah.

467
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Second one, the ship crashed into Mars, explodes like it did in Martian.

468
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I wouldn't be out there eating my dookie potatoes like that idiot.

469
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Elon Musk.

470
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Matt Damon, no.

471
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I would say, Elon, how's the new spaceship coming?

472
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That you're making out of Mars rocks.

473
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And he would make me a new one out of Mars rocks.

474
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And the other thing is when I get back from Mars with or without Elon,

475
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
maybe I steal the rock ship.

476
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Maybe not.

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And maybe you travel with him in your tummy.

478
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
When I come back, I'm not going to fucking eat Elon.

479
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Can you chill?

480
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm just saying that if it comes down to it, why wouldn't you eat Elon Musk?

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He'll eat you if you don't eat him.

482
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
When I come back, I will receive a stipend paying me for the time

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
that everybody else got away from Elon Musk.

484
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I'm thinking I could probably scrounge up a couple of milli

485
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
for that service that I would provide.

486
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And I will have gone on a pretty bodacious spaceship adventure.

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So I think mine's the best one.

488
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Here's what I'm going to hit you with.

489
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How about this, Dolly Parton?

490
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Here's my logic.

491
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay.

492
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
All right.

493
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Dolly Parton, one, incredible career.

494
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, story.

495
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Incredible career.

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And is going to have so many great stories, right?

497
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Stories about Porter, stories about Kenny, stories about everybody.

498
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You know what I mean?

499
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Just even growing up.

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Growing up in rural someplace.

501
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You know what I mean?

502
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Like great stories.

503
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And that's going to be great.

504
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And when the talking, when the sort of conversational fuel happens

505
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
on every long trip, and I certainly would think in a space travel scenario,

506
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
she could sing maybe a beautiful song.

507
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And maybe we can duet.

508
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You know what I mean?

509
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe it's me and Dolly.

510
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Islands in the stream.

511
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That is what we are.

512
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Islands up in space.

513
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Better than a car.

514
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This is not a car.

515
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's a spaceship.

516
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And we rely on each other.

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because we're in space together.

518
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And here's the other part.

519
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And here's two more things about bringing Dolly Parton into space.

520
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
One of them is she's led a great life and helped a lot of people,

521
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and I think she deserves it.

522
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I think she deserves to get up there, get the distance,

523
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and look down and say, look at it, Dolly.

524
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You made that beautiful blue globe a little bit better.

525
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
A little bit bluer.

526
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The last thing I would say about it is that she is pretty old.

527
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So if it got kind of boring, you know what I mean?

528
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Like eventually if it got kind of boring, it would probably be okay soon.

529
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You know what I mean?

530
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Like it would probably be better.

531
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If I got sick of Dolly Parton, it would probably be different.

532
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Than when she was alive.

533
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Hey Justin, would you kill Dolly Parton?

534
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What are you saying?

535
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I wouldn't kill Dolly Parton.

536
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm saying that she's an older lady and I love her.

537
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I wish her the longest possible life.

538
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But if we're up in space and I'm like, I'm really getting sick of Dolly Parton.

539
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You would start wishing for her death.

540
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I wouldn't wish for her death.

541
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But I would say nature don't take a space holiday is one thing that I've heard.

542
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Nature is still doing it up in space.

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You don't know that.

544
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well, she's not going to be able to get the special nutrition for older people that she needs up in space.

545
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We're going to be living off of, you know, our dookie potatoes and the little packets of hard ice cream and all that.

546
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So she's not going to get the calcium that she needs up there.

547
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And I'm just saying that like it's not going to be, I don't know, exercise situation or whatever.

548
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But like, I'm saying it, I'm not going to be stuck with Dolly Parton for 20 years on Mars.

549
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, I mean, up to this point, I think, Justin, Griffin and I have been thinking about it in terms of two years.

550
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But you're thinking about if we get stuck.

551
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We're coming home. You want to stay there, I guess.

552
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Now, Justin, I would be remiss if I didn't also ask.

553
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm not saying I want to get stuck there.

554
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We know.

555
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
In much the same way, I'm not saying I want Dolly Parton to die.

556
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But I'm saying if I do get stuck there.

557
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Uh-huh.

558
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I don't even think you know what you're saying at this point.

559
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I think I know what I'm saying.

560
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Hey, Griffin, I think I know what he's saying.

561
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I just don't know that I'm comfortable with the fact that he's saying it.

562
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah.

563
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So I want to shift to a more comfortable topic and ask Justin, in the event that it becomes necessary,

564
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
how do you feel about consuming the flesh of Dolly Parton for sustenance?

565
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then I'm going to pivot even further away from that, Travis, and I'm so glad.

566
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, he was about to answer though, Griffin.

567
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah, I know.

568
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I have to know.

569
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think I would actually do, I think I do think I would actually take Matt Damon.

570
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And the whole time I would be very confrontational.

571
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Like you're always talking, hey, what's up, Goodwill?

572
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You're always talking shit about how you're going to do it up on Mars.

573
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Well, let's fucking see, bro.

574
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah.

575
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And he'd be like, sir, I have never said it's me, Matt Damon, the real Martian,

576
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
who would get up there and make some real dookie potatoes and I could live on Mars and I'm the best.

577
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I've never said that.

578
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Those are words that you're putting in my mouth.

579
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah, right.

580
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, right, Goodwill.

581
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Shit on the ground, dawg.

582
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You also run the risk though, Griffin, of getting Matt Damon and Interstellar, who is a piece of shit himself.

583
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah.

584
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And that is, I would not want to travel with Interstellar.

585
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Now, if I could travel with the robot from Interstellar, forget about it.

586
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Robot, how's the way to go?

587
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Is Matt Damon an Interstellar?

588
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He is.

589
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, he's a real stinker in that flow.

590
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Really?

591
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah.

592
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah.

593
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't remember that.

594
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, I'd travel with McConaughey.

595
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I think he'd probably sleep most of the time.

596
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh, yeah, baby, changing my answer.

597
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

598
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Mr. Smooth himself.

599
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And I bet his skin tastes like jerky.

600
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Huntington, West Virginia's own Matthew McConaughey would be an excellent travel companion to Mars, except it would get, wouldn't it get a little old?

601
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It would get a little sensual, I would say.

602
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And there's no way I'm outliving Matthew McConaughey 100%.

603
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Even the sensuality, Travis, would also get old after a bit.

604
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, you'd start to chafe, for sure.

605
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't think that he would take, I don't think that you would be pounding it with Matt.

606
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, you don't think if Matthew McConaughey and I were together, crashed on, this is long term, this isn't just two years, this is like 20 years.

607
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You don't think maybe just two?

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The question was, if you could travel to Mars and eat snacks, what would it be?

609
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And Justin's answer was, I would kill and eat Dolly Parton, and Travis's is, I think I would have a 20-year-long sexual arrangement with Matthew McConaughey in outer space.

610
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Or a 20-year-long seduction.

611
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, lol, lol, Elon and combos.

612
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And let me be clear, it would be, well, I was going to say it wouldn't be romantic, but I don't know that.

613
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But I think, as far as I know, Matthew McConaughey and I are both straight fellas.

614
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But I don't think that that would get in the way of just the sheer companionship and joy of human contact that we would experience being together.

615
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But that wasn't even, the question is, what's a celebrity you like and what's a food you like?

616
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And Justin's like, I want to carve Martin Sheen's skull into a fucking bowl.

617
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah, and I would say Matthew McConaughey and chocolate sauce, that we might eat off each other if it comes to that.

618
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And at this point, let me just be clear, it's the sensuality, really.

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's just giving us something to focus our minds on other than the desolate wasteland of Mars.

620
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And it reestablishes that we're together, and also chocolate tastes delicious, and look at that six pack.

621
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I love it.

622
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Hey, quick question.

623
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Given the recent quarantine, my pajama game has significantly improved.

624
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I now sport three to four different pairs that I can casually wear on the apartment, go unnoticed on work Zoom calls.

625
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
They're so comfortable.

626
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Nice.

627
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The thing is, I do need to leave the apartment building sometimes to grab groceries or run a short errand.

628
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
My girlfriend thinks it's weird that I don't change into normal clothes to do this.

629
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What do you think?

630
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Can I wear my fancy PJs outside the house for short, local, no driving adventures to the outside world? And that's from Stefan.

631
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
How fancy.

632
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
My one-man production of the pajama game is also doing very well in quarantine.

633
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
There's been a lot of things that I've had to solve for.

634
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
A lot of like, how do you do Bob Fosse by yourself?

635
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And I've come up with a lot of answers to those things.

636
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Everything here isn't alive and well in Austin, Texas.

637
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
In my heart.

638
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I think, okay, I'm trying to think of what is the complication, the difference betwixt pajama clothing and what one might consider outdoor clothing, outside clothing.

639
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Correct.

640
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And it seems to me like the first thing that clicked in my head is kind of like density, thickness of material.

641
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You know what I mean?

642
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I think that could be solved for though with a heavy flannel pajama.

643
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah.

644
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's gonna look like fucking Kevin McAllister.

645
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, I'll go to buy a toothbrush.

646
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's gonna be, it's gonna, this is so subjective.

647
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't think there's one answer to this.

648
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
This is fashion, isn't it?

649
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I can't, I don't feel comfortable wearing pajamas outdoors, even though that is what I am wearing right now at 2.04 PM central time.

650
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

651
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I got my PJ pants on.

652
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Because I haven't left the house.

653
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Little Totino's branded pants.

654
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But if I did leave the house, I would put on jeans is what I'm saying.

655
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But that's just, that's me because I don't think I look good right now and I don't feel confident enough to do it.

656
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But I mean, you know, go on any college campus, everybody's wearing jammers.

657
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah, I mean, you're not gonna get arrested for wearing pajamas.

658
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I just feel like, personally, I just feel like what this quarantine has taught us, it's probably lots of things.

659
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So one of them is every trip outside is a gift.

660
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You know, I took it for granted in much the same way that anybody else does.

661
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Now when I go outside, I take a little time for me.

662
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You know what I mean?

663
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I want to make it feel special.

664
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I feel like even if you aren't into that, the least you could do is like gussy up for other people that are making like their big special trip outside.

665
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Because it'll be a rarity for them too.

666
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You want them to see beautiful people, beautiful fashion, people trying their hardest.

667
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You know, and I think that that, I think it's nice to put in a little, put on the ritz a little bit.

668
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Now Joseph, I hear you say that, but that assumes that these fancy jammies are any more fancy than like jeans and a shirt.

669
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
No, but you know, don't you?

670
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I mean, the thing about it is, I don't know how to define pajamas, but I know them when I see them.

671
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And you know, don't you?

672
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And no matter how the fabric, the material, there's eventually going to be a flap that makes bathroom easier somewhere on them.

673
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You know what I mean?

674
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know, you know.

675
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
There are probably fashion jammies that are not practical jammies that you could wear,

676
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
but they're clearly not, they're jammies one might wear to some kind of highfalutin society pajama party,

677
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
but not actual jammies that you're slipping into for a long winter's nap.

678
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You know?

679
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Like when we get invited up to the Playboy Mansion for their annual pajama party, like the jammies that we wear.

680
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You know what I mean?

681
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Those ones, those are not pajamas I would actually wear to bed.

682
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The jammies that I wear to swim in the grotto, those are not the same jammies I slip into bed.

683
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You know what I mean?

684
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,000
They're jammies that are reinforced in the elbows and knees and the back for protection from weapons.

685
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yeah, you do always have a sort of shield back there, a natural shield.

686
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's important, right?

687
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
All my clothes have that, that's the thing.

688
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But I don't do that when I go to, oh God, I've just admitted my one weakness.

689
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Now people are going to attack me in bed when my jammies aren't reinforced.

690
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Damn it.

691
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's how you're going to go, isn't it?

692
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yep.

693
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's good that you know that.

694
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, nude, nude, totally nude.

695
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's how I'm sleeping.

696
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Did you guys ask that?

697
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I did.

698
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Okay.

699
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You read my book.

700
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The name of the book was What's Justin Even Doing in There by Griffin McElroy.

701
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It came out on the same day as our podcast book, that's why nobody's really talking about it.

702
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's actually published within our podcast book, if you read every third word,

703
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
that's Griffin's book about what's Justin doing in there.

704
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's my book, What's Justin Even Doing in There.

705
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Hey, can we go to the Money Zone?

706
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'd love that.

707
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We've earned it, right?

708
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah, please.

709
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey, everybody.

710
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's me, regular human being here to talk about the Money Zone.

711
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Just a regular human being in my human body, and I'm going to tell you about Squarespace,

712
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
the website that all of us humans are using to build beautiful websites to showcase our human work,

713
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
to sell human products, human services, and human stuff of all kinds,

714
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and to promote our human physical or human online businesses.

715
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Well, I think we humans can all agree that beautiful, customizable templates are important to us humans,

716
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and everything is optimized right out of the box for those mobile things us humans are using all the time.

717
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
This is so much better, Trav.

718
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You're getting so much better.

719
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Thank you.

720
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We have analytics that help us grow in real human time, and there's free and secure hosting,

721
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
so other bad humans won't be able to mess with our stuff.

722
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Good.

723
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And don't worry, human friends.

724
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
There's nothing to patch your upgrade ever.

725
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000

God damn it!

729
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Damn it!

730
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Fuck!

731
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You were on the finish line.

732
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Fuck!

733
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Can you edit?

734
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's get it.

735
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
We'll have it edited out.

736
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay, and I'm Beep Blorp!

737
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Fuck!

738
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Stamps.com.

739
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Let's ask the listener, I guess, what do you already know about Stamps.com?

740
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Pause.

741
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Pause.

742
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Pause.

743
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Wrong!

744
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Well, then we don't need to even do the ad.

745
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
What's the next question?

746
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
We should still do the ad.

747
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We should still do the ad.

748
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Listen, nobody wants to spend all their time going to the freaking post office.

749
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
They want to spend their time going to, you know, Chuck E. Cheese, Dave and Buster's,

750
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
like fun places with cool arcade games.

751
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Well, save time to go to Dave and Buster's by going first to Stamps.com,

752
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
which allows you to mail and ship anytime, anywhere right from your computer.

753
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You can send letters, ship packages, and pay a lot less with discounted rates

754
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
from the USPS, UPS, and more letters.

755
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Do you think that there have been any, like, postmaster generals

756
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
who have thought about, like, putting some arcade games in there?

757
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Just like, even like just one pinball machine, really,

758
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
or like one of those tabletop, like, Ms. Pac-Bands?

759
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I think it would be a game changer.

760
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, that'd be sick, man.

761
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And hey, while we're at it, let's just sell pizza at the post office.

762
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Right?

763
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You know what I mean?

764
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah.

765
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And maybe a ball pit for the kids.

766
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Whether you're a small office sending out invoices.

767
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Just make a ball pit out of, like, abandoned mail that the kids can swim around in.

768
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, that could be fun.

769
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
If you're a small office sending out invoices or an online seller shipping out orders

770
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
or a big, big warehouse sending out thousands of packages a day,

771
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Stamps.com handles all that with ease.

772
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's not even a problem.

773
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You can get discounts up to 40% off post office rates

774
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and up to 62% off UPS shipping rates.

775
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It saves you time and money, and hey,

776
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
nearly one million small businesses already use Stamps.com,

777
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
so join the freaking wave.

778
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Stop wasting time going to the post office and go to Stamps.com instead.

779
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
There's no risk.

780
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000

784
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You just go to Stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

785
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and type in MYBROTHER, all one word.

00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That's Stamps.com, promo code MYBROTHER.

787
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000

788
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Hey there, beautiful people.

789
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Did you hear that good, good news?

790
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Something about the baby Jesus?

791
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Mmm, he's coming back.

792
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Or do you mean the fact that Apple Podcast has named Fanta

793
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
one of the best shows of 2020?

794
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I mean, we already knew that we was hot stuff,

795
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
but a little external validation never hurts, okay?

796
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Hosted by me, writer and journalist Jared Hill.

797
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And me, the ebony entrantress myself.

798
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
JaVelle Anderson.

799
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Fanta is your home for complex conversations about the great areas in our lives,

800
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
the people, places, and things we're huge fans of but got some anti-feelings toward.

801
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You name it, we Fanta-ing. Nobody's off limits.

802
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Check us out every Thursday on MaximumFun.org

804
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Dun dun!

805
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That's supposed to be like the Law and Order sound.

806
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah?

807
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So pretend that, pretend that, okay?

808
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
All right.

809
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Dun dun!

810
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

811
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Dun dun!

812
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

813
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

814
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Dun dun dun dun dun.

815
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Welcome to Law and Order Munch Squad,

816
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
podcast within a podcast, profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

817
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
as it relates to the legal profession.

818
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We've already explained finance, and now we're going to get into some legal,

819
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
some legal metals here on the Munch Squad.

820
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This is a brief Munch Squad, and I just want to-

821
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It's a legal brief.

822
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
This is a brief Munch Squad, and I just wanted to talk about it.

823
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Have you guys heard about Subway's tuna?

824
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Huh?

825
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That is a delicious creamy treat on a nice hot day.

826
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, what a troubling question.

827
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I want to say that I am not lending any credence to this story.

828
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm not detracting any credence from this story.

829
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm reporting this story as a journalist.

830
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah.

831
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Who is not a journalist, but an entertainer is what I meant to say.

832
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
This is for entertainment only.

833
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So there is a Washington Post story about a new lawsuit in California,

834
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and there's a lawsuit against Subway.

835
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Subway has tuna, and Subway's menu says that the tuna is flaked tuna

836
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
blended with creamy mayo, then topped with your choice of crisp, fresh veggies.

837
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Sure, sure.

838
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Okay, so according to this Washington Post report,

839
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
the ingredient billed as, quote,

840
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
tuna for the chain sandwiches and wraps contains absolutely no tuna.

841
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
In fact, according to the lawsuit, it is, quote, made from anything but tuna.

842
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Now, hold on.

843
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Hold on.

844
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Based on an independent lab test that revealed the so-called tuna is,

845
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
instead, a mixture of various concoctions that do not constitute tuna,

846
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna.

847
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
An attorney for the plaintiffs, however, declined to specify what it is.

848
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's not important.

849
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Well, only what it is not, which, again, is tuna.

850
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Thank you to Grub Street, by the way.

851
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm reading the Grub Street report because Washington Post had a paywall

852
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
on this important journalism.

853
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
This is, I would argue, quite important journalism.

854
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
If there are people out there thinking,

855
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I could go for a tuna sandwich from Subway today.

856
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This is maybe the most important journalism that has ever existed for those people.

857
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It can't be anything but tuna.

858
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah.

859
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There must be a line drawn somewhere.

860
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I mean, we're all made out of stardust, aren't we?

861
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So, technically, there's a little bit of tuna everywhere.

862
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
In all of us, every breath you take, there's, like, a little bit of tuna.

863
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like a Julius Caesar's tuna club that he had.

864
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
A Julius Caesar tuna burp.

865
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
At least one molecule of that.

866
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's got tuna flavor, right?

867
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So, it's got to have some sort of-

868
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Driven everything but tuna would imply that if there is flavor there,

869
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
it is artificial tuna at best.

870
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But that's still tuna.

871
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You know what I mean?

872
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
If it tastes-

873
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
People have been eating this for a very long time now,

874
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and in great quantities.

875
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And the fact that nobody's ever taken a bite out of it and been like,

876
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
this isn't fucking tuna,

877
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
makes me think that there's probably some tuna in there.

878
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Or if not, is a close enough sort of simulation of tuna,

879
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
that would rip no skin off my nose, baby.

880
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
There's also, though, I like that there's this possible history

881
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
in which somebody, like, handed somebody this at Subway HQ,

882
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and they said, what is it?

883
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And they're like, well, take a bite of it and you tell me.

884
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And they take a bite and they're like, well, this is tuna.

885
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And I'm like, okay.

886
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah, I couldn't tell you before in case you didn't think it was tuna.

887
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Wait, why wouldn't you tell me it's tuna?

888
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's tuna, right?

889
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Well, do you think it's tuna?

890
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yes.

891
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's all that matters, baby.

892
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Great.

893
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
No, but do tell me, is it tuna?

894
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, what do you think?

895
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
No, I think it's tuna, but is it?

896
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well-

897
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The important thing is, what do you think?

898
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
The important thing is, you think it's tuna.

899
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Tuna is in the mouth of the beater.

900
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Hey, hey, Doug, you're fired.

901
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah.

902
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
No, that makes sense.

903
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah, I get it.

904
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I get that, but do still sell this though, okay?

905
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Not because I made a deal with a dark god to make sure as many people consumed their flesh as possible.

906
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
What's that, Doug?

907
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Don't worry about it.

908
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Nothing, nothing.

909
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You guys want to know what Subway says?

910
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah.

911
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
There is simply no truth to the allegations in the complaint that was filed in California.

912
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Subway delivers 100% cooked tuna to his restaurants, which is mixed with mayonnaise and used in freshly made sandwiches,

913
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
wraps and salads that are served to and enjoyed by our guests.

914
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The taste and quality of our tuna make it one of Subway's most popular products.

915
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And these baseless accusations threaten to damage our franchisees, small business owners who work tirelessly to uphold the high standards that Subway sets for all of its products, including its tuna.

916
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Given the facts, the lawsuit constitutes a reckless and improper attack on Subway's brand and goodwill.

917
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

918
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Subway will vigorously defend itself against these and any other baseless efforts to mischaracterize and tarnish the high quality products that Subway and its franchisees provide their customers in California and around the world.

919
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Subway intends to fight these claims through all available avenues if they are not immediately dismissed.

920
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Now, okay, if I may, that is a very long and forceful rebuttal of the charges, correct?

921
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah.

922
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I think we can all agree on that.

923
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I was stirred.

924
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
My soul was stirred.

925
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Right.

926
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We all feel very confident about that.

927
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's a really long way of saying, no, it's tuna, though, right?

928
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I mean, if it's just tuna, it seems like my statement as Subway would be, no, it's tuna.

929
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Just check.

930
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It's definitely tuna.

931
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But it's, like, so full-throated, I don't know who they need to sway to convince that it's definitely tuna.

932
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Now, okay, to be fair, Justin-

933
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Just have one piece of printed out paper and someone's holding it and they're a scientist.

934
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It says, the facts are in.

935
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And as you can read in this printout, it says here, it's tuna.

936
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
But imagine if you're Subway Justin and you have had to more than-

937
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Subway Justin.

938
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Subway Justin.

939
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
One of my great characters.

940
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And you have more than once had to respond, no, it's tuna.

941
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And think about how on, like, the fifth time you've had to say that out loud, you might just break and write, like, a five-page long statement, right?

942
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Like, it's fucking tuna.

943
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What's going on?

944
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The exact to which it is tuna cannot be overstated.

945
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
This is tuna, baby.

946
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
On a scale from zero to tuna, it's tuna.

947
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Now, it's so wild, though, because there's one of two options.

948
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
One, it ain't tuna, which is wild, right?

949
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Or somebody was eating it and they're like, this ain't tuna.

950
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I want to sue them.

951
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We're going to court.

952
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm doing a lab test.

953
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I want to invent a lab.

954
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I want to find a shady lab that'll say this isn't tuna.

955
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So I can get a-

956
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
This is Bob's lab.

957
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Thank you so much for dropping this up.

958
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I did lose the sample, but I tested something else and it wasn't tuna.

959
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So assuming this isn't settled, which, I mean, in my layman's brain here, looks like Subway ain't giving a fucking inch on this one.

960
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
No.

961
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We're not going to write a $100,000 check to these people that say they ain't tuna because it's tuna.

962
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This is going to go before a judge.

963
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I feel like the judge is going to get a couple of days in the proceedings before he's like, okay, everybody, just level with me.

964
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Is this tuna?

965
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Is this tuna?

966
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We're not.

967
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We could be in and out of here, guys.

968
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Just tell me, is this tuna?

969
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Hey, Mr. Subway, take a bite of it if you're so sure it's tuna.

970
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
No, thank you.

971
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
No, we can't eat.

972
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'm allergic to tuna.

973
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I can't eat it.

974
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Is it possible, because they point out in their response that there's all these like franchisees, these like independent business owners of the franchise,

975
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
that maybe the lab just went to one specific one who maybe had run out of tuna and were waiting and they were just like,

976
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
oh, we got to just put some crab stick in there or something.

977
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We just got to serve them something.

978
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Hey, what I'm saying, Subway, is throw someone under the bus.

979
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah.

980
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's, I mean, that's what they're going to do anyway.

981
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Time to, I guess, buy Subway stock.

982
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I need to call my, I need to call Jim.

983
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Do you want a Yahoo?

984
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Yes, please.

985
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Wait, can we take one?

986
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I just need to take a brief pause.

987
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Okay.

988
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
For an exciting sponsor.

989
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Disney Plus Network has paid us to run the audio for this trailer that has just come through and I need to share it with you guys.

990
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Just the audio.

991
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Okay.

992
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You ready?

993
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah, sure.

994
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I got to cut you.

995
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
If you can't be great at hockey, it's like, don't bother.

996
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I want you to think about all the other kids who've been told that they're too small or too slow.

997
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
They just want to get out there and play.

998
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Let's start our own team.

999
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
All we need is an ice rink.

1000
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You lost?

1001
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
You've been looking at red skates, that's up front.

1002
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Tell me the underdogs are going to come through in the end.

1003
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You got to make this happen for yourself.

1004
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Why do you care so much?

1005
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Because you care.

1006
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Did you see that?

1007
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Oh my gosh.

1008
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Nothing but net.

1009
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That was crazy.

1010
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Nothing but net.

1011
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Pretty sure it's basketball.

1012
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
That's right, folks, the Mighty Ducks game changers.

1013
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Gordon's back.

1014
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The Ducks are back.

1015
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Our show will be about nothing else from this point forward because the Mighty Ducks are back March 26th.

1016
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Write it on your calendars.

1017
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I know we'll be excited.

1018
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
We got a promo code for Disney Plus.

1019
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's just 14 sevens.

1020
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Hey, Justin, are you in a row?

1021
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Are you just shilling for the show now?

1022
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I thought you guys would be so excited about the return of Mighty Ducks.

1023
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I'm so heartbroken that you're not thrilled.

1024
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
When you play audio from a trailer for us, first of all, you know we can't see it.

1025
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
A lot of the times there's-

1026
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'll point my camera at it.

1027
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Hold on.

1028
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Let me turn on my camera.

1029
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
No, no, no.

1030
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Listen to me.

1031
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Let me finish.

1032
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I'll text you something.

1033
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Let me finish, though.

1034
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Something funny in the audio happens where it's like, but then they didn't realize that

1035
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
he's a chimpanzee in a person suit and we're like, good audio.

1036
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That audio was just like, where's the skates?

1037
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And it wasn't funny to me.

1038
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Do you know what I mean?

1039
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It wasn't funny or informative.

1040
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It was mostly just loud sort of timpani drums.

1041
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And there was a moment where I thought Martin Sheen was talking and now I'm thinking there

1042
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
was maybe Emilio Estevez who's sounding more and more like his father.

1043
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Right.

1044
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I think that's what it was.

1045
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I texted you a picture of Emilio Estevez so you know that he's in it.

1046
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I'll look at a new picture of Emilio Estevez.

1047
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
He's looking great.

1048
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Gordon's back.

1049
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And I hope we see him out on the skates.

1050
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
He looks fucking awesome.

1051
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Hey, can I just say if the kind of end of Gordon Bombay's career after-

1052
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Bombay!

1053
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
There it is.

1054
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah, I had Gordon Shumway in my head for a long time and that's Alf.

1055
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Me too, but I didn't want to say Shumway because that's Alf.

1056
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But if the end of his career arc is he owns what looks kind of like a dingy ice rink,

1057
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
this is a depressing story.

1058
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Well, he's making a comeback.

1059
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
How many comebacks can Gordon Bombay make?

1060
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
As many as it takes.

1061
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
As many as he needs.

1062
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
This one's gonna stick, huh?

1063
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Probably.

1064
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Okay, I have a Yahoo here and this one was sent in by lots of people and I'm very excited

1065
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
to read it.

1066
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Im12 who asks, in parentheses,

1067
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Do you think the part where Darth Vader told Luke he was his father was part of the script?

1068
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Or did actor David Prowse just throw that in and it was so good that they just wrote

1069
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
the story around it?

1070
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I mean, that's it, right?

1071
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That's it?

1072
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
That's the tale I've heard.

1073
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
That's fucking a great thing to think about.

1074
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Well, you see that all the time, right?

1075
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You see clips from like The Office, the Parks and Rec, right?

1076
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Where they're just throwing out these like improvised one-liners and they're like,

1077
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Oh yeah, that's gold, that's gold, that's gold, keep it.

1078
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And they were doing that on the Star Wars set all the time, right?

1079
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah.

1080
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
That's a good point.

1081
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Originally the line was supposed to be like, Hey, either do it or don't.

1082
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I don't want to hear anything about trying.

1083
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And Frank Oz kind of fucked it up and said like, Oh, do or do not, there is no try.

1084
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What?

1085
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
What does that even mean?

1086
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That was nothing.

1087
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Guys, I fucked it up.

1088
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I said all the words wrong.

1089
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And they were like, Oh no, no, actually we really liked it.

1090
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm going to go back and rerecord all of Yoda's lines so that he talks that way.

1091
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah.

1092
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yeah.

1093
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Jabba the Hutt was originally supposed to be like, Hey, what's up?

1094
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's me, the cool worm.

1095
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah.

1096
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
But then the actor in the big suit was-

1097
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So drunk.

1098
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
They were like, action.

1099
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And he was like,

1100
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And they're like, Oh, you're okay.

1101
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And he was like,

1102
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And they're like, Whoa, this is good shit.

1103
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Let's use it.

1104
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I heard that they didn't tell Mark Hamill, right?

1105
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
They told him it was, what did they tell him?

1106
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That Obi-Wan Kenobi had killed his dad.

1107
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That's what it said in the original script, right?

1108
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Yeah.

1109
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And then they sprung it on him in the moment.

1110
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Like, Luke, I'm your father.

1111
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Actually, I'm your father, Luke.

1112
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
What would have been so cool is if Luke, if Mark Hamill had been like,

1113
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Shut the fuck up.

1114
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Shut up.

1115
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
No, you're not.

1116
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
No, you killed my father.

1117
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Come on.

1118
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Do you mean to say that Obi-Wan Kenobi killed my dad?

1119
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Because that's what I feel like you're saying.

1120
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
That explains why in the moment, if you watch this thing very carefully,

1121
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
right after Darth Vader says, I am your father,

1122
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Mark Hamill looks straight at the camera and goes,

1123
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Is someone going to call cut?

1124
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That was a mistake.

1125
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Now I understand why that happens.

1126
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Now it's, in my script it says,

1127
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Now I'm going to laser cut you, big boy.

1128
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So like, I don't know why he said something different.

1129
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It just says, how about a forced sandwich?

1130
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Which never made any sense to me.

1131
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
How about a forced sandwich with extra lightsaber sauce?

1132
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And then he kills me.

1133
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I love in every Star Wars movie and TV show,

1134
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
someone has to say how about a forced sandwich.

1135
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Well, it's like the Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker of the Star Wars universe, right?

1136
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You've got to work it in there somewhere.

1137
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And it's so popular.

1138
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
That explains why even Mando Fett said it in the new Mandalorian,

1139
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
when somebody stole his kid for the 18th time,

1140
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and he was like, I'm going to get that kid back again.

1141
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And they're like, oh, Mando.

1142
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And he said, yeah, how about a forced sandwich?

1143
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And they said, that doesn't really work here, Mando Fett.

1144
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And he goes, hey, you're a forced sandwich.

1145
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And they're like, we'll work on it.

1146
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Do you guys think, this is a thought exercise,

1147
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
if we did a t-shirt that said how about a forced sandwich on it,

1148
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
do you think we would get sued?

1149
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
No, man, all those words are free.

1150
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yeah, it depends on how you capitalize F in force.

1151
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Yeah, we capitalize the S in sandwich.

1152
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
No one will see that coming.

1153
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I just fucking love the idea.

1154
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
First of all, all of his lines were dubbed in by James Earl Jones.

1155
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It was a different actor and voice.

1156
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So I'm not even sure it's the logistics of how this will work.

1157
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
David Prowse could have said anything.

1158
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
He could have said literally anything.

1159
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
But I do like the idea of him just being like, I'm your dad.

1160
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And then he slowly side-eye looks over at George Lucas,

1161
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
who from his chair is like, yeah, all right.

1162
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That was just an idea I had, George.

1163
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
If you want to keep it, you can.

1164
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
That's good stuff.

1165
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Real good.

1166
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Real good.

1167
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Hey, give me four or six weeks.

1168
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'm going to rewrite everything.

1169
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Give me four or six hours.

1170
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I'm going to rewrite everything.

1171
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I just did just a Google real quick,

1172
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and apparently it was intended from the very beginning

1173
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
because Darth Vader sounds a lot like Dark Father,

1174
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
which is fucking a way better name for that character.

1175
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
This is Dark Papa.

1176
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
This is Dark Father.

1177
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Hello.

1178
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Hey, I'm Shadow Dad.

1179
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What's up?

1180
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
What's up?

1181
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I miss a lot of soccer games.

1182
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Hey, you look hungry.

1183
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You want a four sandwich?

1184
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
No, I know I don't make them like your mom does.

1185
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I'm sorry.

1186
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I can't be your mom.

1187
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I can't put it back together and cut it into triangles.

1188
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I cut it in half.

1189
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I can't put anything back together.

1190
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We've made that very clear, okay?

1191
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I'm sorry, but I'm here now.

1192
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Do you want me to toast that?

1193
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

1194
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Toasted.

1195
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I know me making those sounds with my mouth

1196
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
didn't toast the bread.

1197
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I can't be your mom, okay?

1198
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm sorry.

1199
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Now this is podracing.

1200
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
No, Dad.

1201
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Okay.

1202
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
No, Dad, it's not.

1203
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You're making a podracing sound with your mouth.

1204
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Why didn't Darth Vader say, I'm your father,

1205
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and if you would let me, I would love a chance to prove it.

1206
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Or if you want to go toss the ball around,

1207
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I happen to have these two gloves with me.

1208
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah.

1209
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's why he tossed the lightsaber to him

1210
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and cut off his hand.

1211
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
He thought he was playing catch.

1212
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh, shit.

1213
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It would literally be like if Dad was a stranger to us

1214
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and then kicked in my door and pointed a gun at me

1215
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and said, come work at the radio station.

1216
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And I would be like, who are you?

1217
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
What?

1218
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Well, the original scene,

1219
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
there was actually they edited one word out,

1220
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
which was, I am your father.

1221
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And then he cuts off the hand and said, whoops.

1222
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And they're like, that might be confusing

1223
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
about his intentions there.

1224
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Okay, let's just cut the whoops

1225
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and make it seem like he did it on purpose.

1226
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Movie history, huh?

1227
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It gives me chills to think about it.

1228
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Classic movie history.

1229
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1230
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
My brother, my brother and me,

1231
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I had to pause to remember the last part

1232
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
because we wrote the book on podcasting.

1233
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Hey, I want to tell you about a book.

1234
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
The Bible.

1235
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
What?

1236
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
The good book.

1237
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
No, a different book.

1238
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And it wasn't even one that we wrote.

1239
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Well, I wrote a little bit of it.

1240
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's called Things I Learned from Mario's Butt.

1241
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's by Laura K. Dale.

1242
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It is a collection of different writings

1243
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
on video game characters' butts.

1244
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
There's lots of different contributors like myself.

1245
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I wrote a piece that is, I think,

1246
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
the weirdest thing I've ever written about Seaman's butt

1247
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
and whether or not it has a butt.

1248
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
If you Google things I learned from Mario's butt,

1249
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
you'll see the link on Unbound where you can buy it.

1250
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It's on, I think you get a Kindle edition on Amazon.

1251
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Wherever you can find it, it's out on Thursday.

1252
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So check it out.

1253
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I think I've looked at it and read it,

1254
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
especially my part because there's a little picture of me

1255
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and it's adorable.

1256
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But the whole book's great.

1257
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I think you'll really enjoy it.

1258
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Speaking of books, everybody has a podcast except you.

1259
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's out now.

1260
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
You can get it at bit.ly slash McElroy Podcast Book.

1261
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Also very exciting, we're doing a Taz live show,

1262
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
a virtual live show on February 19th

1263

1264
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It is both virtual and interactive.

1265
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
We are calling it, we kind of nicknamed it,

1266
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Choose Your Own Adventure Zone.

1267
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We're going to reach some moments where you will help vote

1268
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
on what the players will have to do in character.

1269
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
We're gonna be playing Honey Heist with our guest,

1270
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Erika Ishii, who is amazing

1271
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
and we're super thrilled to play with her.

1272
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Tickets are $10 and you can get them

1273
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
over at live.themacroy.family.

1274
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
We've also got some new merch as this is a new month.

1275
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We've got a boy car pin of the month.

1276
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That's designed by Zach Sterling

1277
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
and proceeds from that are going to benefit

1278
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Know Us Without You LA.

1279
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Know Us Without You is providing food security

1280
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
for undocumented back of house staff

1281
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
and their families in Los Angeles.

1282
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
There's also the Taste of Luxury Stemless Wine Glasses,

1283
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
which are so cool,

1284
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
and a Taste of Luxury shirt designed by Kevin Budnick

1285
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and the Candle Nights video on demand is now for sale.

1286
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000

that we do at mcroy.family.

1301
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
There's a new Monster Factory that went up last Wednesday

1302
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
that is, in my opinion,

1303
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
one of the fucking funniest episodes that we've done.

1304
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I loved it, guys, like sincere.

1305
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It's so good.

1306
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It's very, very good.

1307
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
We're very excited to keep playing that weird game.

1308
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Yeah, that's all at mcroy.family.

1309
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I think that's it.

1310
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You want the final?

1311
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Yeah, I'd love that.

1312
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
This final Yahoo was sent in by the wizard Ben Cant.

1313
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Thank you, Ben.

1314
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1315
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They are also anonymous.

1316
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'll just call them, I mean, I'll call them.

1317
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Suzeb asks,

1318
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Why is there a section for dogs here?

1319
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
There aren't that many dogs who use Yahoo.

1320
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Yes.

1321
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

1322
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

1323
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1324
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
This has been my brother, my brother.

1325
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
May you kiss your dad square on the lips.

1326
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Okay, that was the show.

1327
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Hope you had some fun.

1328
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1329
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Go back into the world.

1330
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Face the day ahead.

1331
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Please don't tell our grandparents

1332
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:43,000
all the cuss words we said.

1333
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm Jesse Thorne.

1334
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
On the next Bullseye, we've got the one and only Ted Danson.

1335
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We'll talk about his new show, Mr. Mayor, about cheers,

1336
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
and about the secret to success in comedy.

1337
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I mean, I feel like one of your signature comedic moves

1338
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
at this point in your career is gazing.

1339
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You do a lot of interesting gazing.

1340
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I also love this.

1341
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Gazing.

1342
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I love that.

1343
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And if I'm not, I'm going to start because that's great.

1344
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
That's Bullseye.

1345
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Find it on MaximumFun.org and PR.org

1346
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,000
