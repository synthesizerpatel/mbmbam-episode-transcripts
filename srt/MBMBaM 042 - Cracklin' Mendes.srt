1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,520
in the air, and love smells like the windscreen on a microphone, though that may just be the

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,520
windscreen on my microphone. Hi, I'm Justin McElroy, the co-brother, co-host, and co-provocateur of

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,800
My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm Travis McElroy, and I am

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:18,480
a co-host and co-privateer as well. Oh, Griffin! Griffin, what's wrong?

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,720
I mean, nothing, I guess. No, now come on, don't keep it inside. A feeling locked inside

10
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,640
is poison for your mind. That's what I always say. Hey, I just, I did want to note before you

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,680
talk about your crushing loneliness, we had to record this intro twice, and I did the same

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,640
windscreen bit before, and I thought it was so good that I decided to stick with it. It wasn't

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,480
like a thing of the moment that I came up with. That's like the second time I decided that would

14
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,760
be good enough. You actually even giggled at it this time. It ramped up. It really got to me. It

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:02,160
really got jumped up in there. Griffin, Valentine's Day was created by a greeting card. Think about

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:13,280
it. I am thinking about it. Here's my stance on it. Jewish people... Good start. They don't get

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,200
sad around Christmas, right? Right. Well, A, because they're so occupied with candle nights,

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:29,760
but B, ain't got no dog in that race. Yeah, no dog in that particular race. I get it. You know

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,400
what, Griffin? You're lonely all the time. You shouldn't let the corporations make you feel

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:44,640
lonelier today. You know what? Here's my motto. I'm bringing lonely back. Some of the best poetry,

21
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
some of the best songs have been written in a state of loneliness. Some of our best podcasts

22
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,960
have been recorded while Griffin was single. It's true. Namely, 100% of them. And possibly

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,080
throughout the fullness of time. No, no, no. You'll find that special somebody. Maybe we'll

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,800
find somebody in here, in this mix. Between the three of us? Fuck, I hope not. No, I don't think

25
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:17,120
so. And now our special guest, Vanessa Hudgens. Okay, here we go. Valentine's Day is coming up,

26
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,960
and I'm wondering if you guys have any ideas of what I can get my lady, Lily, as a gift.

27
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,280
I have a limited budget since we were both in college in this dirt poor, but I want to make

28
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,040
it kind of special too. Thoughts? David from Gmail. You know, there's so many things that

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,880
you can do that costs little to no money, but show a great deal of thought. But what really matters

30
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,760
is money is how much money you spend on it. No, if Lily's cool with, you know, a coupon for one free

31
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,400
back rub, then... Or a groupon for one free back rub. 200 people bought in, and now we get free

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:03,200
back rubs. Really tired hands. So you think back rubs are the way to go? I mean, it's an oldie,

33
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,560
but a goodie. Yeah, I mean, that's a classic. Griffin, what do you think? Cheap Valentine's

34
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:20,000
Day gifts? Like a shitty necklace? I don't know. Hey, I got creative this year, and I got you bad

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,080
things. It's not only that, I just want everybody to know that... I don't know. I don't usually give

36
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:34,080
great advice, but on this particular episode, I'm not on my fucking A game. Get her a DVD, I guess.

37
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,480
With love in it. Like Love Actually? Or For Love of Money. That's a good flick. Can't watch it too

38
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,880
much nowadays without getting hurt, but like, it's a good movie. Just a DVD, or a Blu-ray if

39
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,760
you really love her, but I know that you're straight out of low cash, so gotta make do.

40
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,520
Hey David, I know it might seem like a great idea to loudly announce that for Valentine's Day,

41
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,800
you're giving her a world class fucking... It's not gonna have... Top of the line! It's not gonna

42
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,920
read the way. I'm giving you my best moves tonight. Tonight, I'll be supplying you with some of my

43
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,320
grade A moves. Maybe just put like a bow on your wiener, and yell, you're welcome. You're welcome.

44
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,520
It's the gift that keeps on giving. Accept it like it gives once. For 15 minutes, and then

45
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,760
he gets a little bit. And a power bar. Then your feet are touching me, they're so cold,

46
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,240
people are going to sleep. I moved to a new city recently, and I opened a business.

47
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,640
I'm a pretty social guy, and I don't have trouble meeting people on a personal level,

48
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,880
but I need to promote my business to build my clientele. What's the best way to go about

49
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
promoting my business to people that I meet in a social setting without sounding too pushy and

50
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:58,080
annoying? Brady. Brady, there's only one real way to grow your business. That's of course to become

51
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,160
a sponsor of my brother and my brother and me. I mean, it is a great way. You get a lot for your

52
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:14,800
money. Yeah. You know, you get the fame. We have literally tens of listeners. Yeah. You get the

53
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,960
gravitas. You can't put a price on gravitas. You know what? You could get a special promotion. You

54
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,520
meet one person. Meet one person that you want to impress at a social setting, right? Tell them to

55
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,040
listen to this new podcast, and then you pay us to tell them about your business. That seems a

56
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,320
little backwards. No, it's good. It'll be good. Because they'll say, hey, I know a show you can

57
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,600
listen to specifically this episode. And then when they listen, we'll tell them about your business.

58
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,800
Hey, have you heard of Brady's photocopies? Our friend Brady does the best photocopies.

59
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,720
The print quality is just superb. No line breakage or splotch zones. Those margins to die for. So

60
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
tight. Is that ivory blend on that paper? Yeah, it is. That's all Brady uses at Brady's photocopies.

61
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:13,680
Not a lot of pulp in here. This is a smooth pulp free zone. Brady, I think that you're having,

62
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,440
like, this is sort of the classic question of sales, right? It's something that I'm not

63
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,200
particularly good at. I don't know any answer. I'm great at sales. I am. Okay. I mean, I was

64
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,480
saying I am good at sales. Well, help them then, Tracks. Help them then, for Christ's sake. Don't

65
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,640
hold your light under a fucking bushel. I was just gonna say that if you really do think that

66
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,760
what you have is a good service, like if you think you've got the best service, then you

67
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,000
shouldn't feel any hit. Remember that you're not asking them for something. It's a win-win,

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,720
or at least it should be. You have to put it in your head that they will want to hear about it,

69
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,920
because that's how you think of your product. And my advice would be this. You want to be

70
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,120
indirectly direct, where you don't want to bring up your business. You don't want to say,

71
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,240
hey, my name is Brady. Let me tell you about my new business, because they're immediately

72
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,480
going to shut off. You want to have a conversation that, like, leads to talking about your business.

73
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah. You know, ask them what they do, so then they'll ask you what you do. Yeah, that's a

74
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,320
pretty good idea. Get interested in them first. Remember, that's our old classic. That works if

75
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,520
you want to have sex with someone or want to be their sole photocopy supplier. Also,

76
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,920
those two things are basically the same. Those two things are basically the same,

77
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:46,160
because there's a bed involved, right? Either way. Griffin, hit me with a Yahoo answer.

78
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,880
I will absolutely do that. I got a nice eclectic. I got some mixed nuts,

79
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
which is, by the way, what I'm going to start calling the Yahoo answer segment.

80
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,840
Can we start playing, like, a sound effect after you say it? Like, boing, or something like that?

81
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:09,040
Absolutely. But this week, we got some Valentine's Day questions and some not-Valentine's-Day

82
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,960
questions. But let's start out with the former. It was sent in by Valentine's Day.

83
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,920
Wow. It's become corporeal. It's tormenting you.

84
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I've been incepted. This one was sent in by Cal. Thank you, Cal. It's by Yahoo answer's user,

85
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:36,080
ManMan, who asks, what type of collage should I do for my boo on Valentine's Day?

86
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,360
I want to do a collage for my boyfriend of eight months. I would love to put some pictures of us

87
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,680
and movie tickets of the movies we've seen together, but sadly, we don't have that right now.

88
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,160
Just our memories. I threw away the tickets, and now I wish I should have not done that.

89
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,480
Do you guys have any other suggestions I can make for him? What other collage can I make for him?

90
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,600
A garbage collage.

91
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
This should stand in place for the garbage I threw out earlier. This is different garbage,

92
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,880
but it's symbolic. Hey, you should maybe not-

93
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,240
Kyle, I made you a collage. Sadly, I burn everything that has to do with you the moment it

94
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,440
no longer has use. I've saved no pictures or anything. If you were to die today, there would

95
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,560
be no proof of your existence in my house. Here's all the pictures and movie tickets

96
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,760
from my last boyfriend. I saved those. I don't know. It's weird. Don't read into that too much.

97
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,080
I've scribbled out the Poseidon adventure, and I've written Hancock, which, if you'll remember,

98
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,840
was our first date. It was not. You say it was not our first. You're right. That was him too.

99
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:51,200
That was also Ron. What I've made you is words cut out of magazines like a serial killer.

100
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,200
We went to movie summer. I love you so much, Derek. You're my one. You're my one. You're my only.

101
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,600
I know your name's not Derek, but that's the only name I could find printed in the magazine.

102
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,440
And this one says sassy. I just like the font on that.

103
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,240
What do you want us to tell you? You don't have anything to make a collage out of.

104
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,480
I threw my shit away, and I want to make a time capsule, but I don't have

105
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,400
any shit to put in it because I'm irresponsible. I love the framework of this question of,

106
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,120
I want to make a really romantic, personally touching thing. Please tell me what I should put

107
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,480
on it. Let me tell you what I know about your relationship. How about you make a collage out

108
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,800
of ugly collages? Hey, you didn't save the memory collage. The victory, the elbow grease,

109
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,040
the memory collage is not gluing it to corkboard. That's not the part where it's impressive. It's

110
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,160
impressive because you saved the shit. Did you just start liking him? Did you not like him for

111
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,080
months and you're like, I'm going to get in this guy? It just occurred to me seven months in that

112
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:11,920
we're dating. Why don't you draw some pictures of your memories and then use those pictures,

113
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:22,880
use those illustrations as fodder for your collage. Draw a picture of you two sitting

114
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:37,200
at Hancock and maybe like grazing hands cocks. He's making a hit. He's making Hancock.

115
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,320
It's a classic. It's a classic. And Griffin, you actually have just described my favorite

116
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:55,440
independent web comic. So it's exactly like that. So maybe just take him to dinner or something.

117
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,920
Or maybe try again next year. Like maybe don't throw everything away that you get.

118
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,640
Maybe collage isn't a good idea this year. How about a coupon for one free collage?

119
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:13,840
It's redeemable in exactly 365 days. My wife and I have a one year old. Sorry. I don't know why

120
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:22,000
that sounded so sad. He's super lame. The novelty's really gone. My wife and I have a one year old.

121
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,360
When we found out that she was pregnant again. What? What are you saying? Slow your roll. Your

122
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,000
wife. Okay. When we found out my wife was pregnant. Okay. We were really happy but knew that things

123
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,600
are going to get tight money wise. We just found out the baby's actually twins. Oh shit. Worst.

124
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,760
So now we're still excited but also freaking out a bit. Yeah. Our wedding anniversary is coming up

125
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,400
and all the money is tight. Do you have any suggestions to make my soon to be worn out wife

126
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:03,920
feel special? Thanks Frugal in Philly. Um. What can you do? Like can this woman is about to pass

127
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,120
two human beings? You know you want to you want to make her feel special right? You're you're about

128
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,520
to have three kids and not enough money for them. You want to make her feel special. Right now those

129
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,520
kids have two parents. That's like eh. But if they have one parent can you imagine? Imagine that.

130
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,160
There's only one of you. There's only you only have a mommy so that's pretty special because

131
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,680
your daddy your daddy moved to Vegas. Three three parents. Sister wives. I know we're on a sister

132
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,240
wife streak but like you got one parent per kid. Apparently you're having babies every year so

133
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
maybe with two wives you could alternate it and they can at least have a year off. Yeah. I know

134
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,760
you don't worry about your wife being worn out and at this rate she will be. Like yeah. So I would

135
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,440
say get a second wife to maybe carry one of the twins. Is that is that possible? A brood wife.

136
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,840
Get yourself a brood wife and then like one can be your society wife

137
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,440
and then one can be your you know your gestating hive queen.

138
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,840
Hi this is this is uh this is my second wife Crystal. Crystal. Her name is Crystal. It's not

139
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,360
Chrysalis. I don't know why I thought that and her name is also not dx173pon so I don't believe

140
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,680
people saying that either. And I certainly have I have never considered harvesting her jellies.

141
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,160
For Valentine's Day I got you a second wife in a tank of plasma and we're just gonna use her to

142
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,880
harvest organs and babies from. You're welcome. You're welcome. What did you get me? Oh a stone

143
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:56,640
temple pilot CD. Thank you. Wow we're really even now. Oh shit. Um so what to get your wife?

144
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:03,520
Have you considered a collage? Maybe a nice collage with some of the things you've done together.

145
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,760
What about uh uh make a nice dinner? You know it seems so cliche but if you really

146
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,080
can cook well and you can knock one out of the park that's so nice. And she's eating for three.

147
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,480
Yeah. Or four. Check it. Check it. Double check it. You got trips. She got trips. Heard it here first.

148
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,680
We got the scoop on your baby's itch. Uh you you really I I think that a one you know one night

149
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,560
thing where you know you do the dinner and the movie and really do the real date thing can can

150
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,120
be really nice. But I think that you can make a longer lasting difference here and just really

151
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,200
I and I'm I'm making judgments about you but I mean it's it's it's just sort of general advice.

152
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,320
Yeah right exactly because I don't know you may already be doing this but you know in every way

153
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,160
you can especially over the next couple years do what you can for her. You know when you when you

154
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,560
there are times when you know you might want to watch the big game or something uh and you know

155
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,040
take that time and maybe do something to make her life a little easier because you know that sort of

156
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,200
lubrication on the gears of life could be a gift that that people appreciate all year round.

157
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:31,920
Not hard to box up sure. Yeah. What aren't all the best gifts? It's beautiful. Thank you

158
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,560
Travis. I worked really hard on it and again the collage thing I can't yeah I can't endorse that

159
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:44,560
enough. Last week I met a boy when I visited my friend at a different collage. He got my number

160
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:52,080
and we've been texting ever since. He seems great except there is one problem whenever he texts me

161
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:01,120
he refers to me as a boo. I don't know where he got the idea for this pet name but I really don't

162
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,120
but I really dislike it and all pet names in general. How do I get him to stop calling me boo

163
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,600
besides just saying stop calling me boo uh love the show and sorry if this makes Griffin feel

164
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:21,520
lonely not your boo bear. Let me posit this. Okay. Is it possible that whenever he looks at you

165
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:33,280
you freeze in place and disappear? Oh I got you. Oh good. Final links. Yeah these are the jokes.

166
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:42,800
You know people always always uh email through these questions and a lot of times I think they

167
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,280
the question should just be this there's a simple solution to my problem but I'm not gonna do it.

168
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,800
Make up a harder one for me. Why do you want us to complicate your life? Let me check this.

169
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:02,080
Check this heat. Hey I'm not I'm not crazy about that nickname. Hey I'm I am mad creeped. Can you

170
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,160
please stop? We've only known each other for a week so let me go ahead and throw this out.

171
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,840
I don't like pet names. Yeah yeah exactly like you're in that phase where it's okay to express

172
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:23,200
your discomfort or displeasure with something like better now than in like you know seven years

173
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,160
you're you're watching Price is Right and he's like hey boo could you hand me the Cheetos you

174
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,760
just get a kitchen knife and put it in his chest like that wouldn't it wouldn't be preferable.

175
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,920
That's where this terminates. It is. You gotta play it ten steps ahead. Seven years. Murder.

176
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:50,000
Maybe. Just maybe. Maybe. Is her name something like Borp or Brin or Berg? Brutus? No it's too

177
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,400
long. What I'm thinking is maybe his phone is autocorrecting. Oh yeah yeah yeah. Her name is

178
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,360
Borg and it's fictional which is awesome. Hey are you gonna come over here and assimilate me or what?

179
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:12,640
Resistance is futile. That's so fun. I have to go kill myself. Yeah we've jam-packed a lot of

180
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,880
nerd juice in this question. This got this got pretty bad uh why don't you just say that like

181
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,080
just say it like we have a lot of people who will need our help you have a solution already

182
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,080
it's in your question just do that don't stop it I'm angry at you stop it happy Valentine's

uh uh maybe funeral plot like a nice under a tree or something she's wrapping it up

195
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,440

311
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,840
whoa i'm into this question now elaboration yeah please my husband and i have been married for

312
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,880
almost two years now and i never wear my engagement ring i chose a simple gold band for a wedding ring

313
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,160
which i prefer and wear all the time my engagement ring is worth over two thousand dollars it is just

314
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,960
sitting in a drawer in my house and won't remain there until this lost stolen or given away the

315
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,200
practical side of me wants to sell my ring but is this a subject best left alone dana dana there's

316
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:15,680
no good way to breach this with dana this is a like yeah this is a no win situation let me

317
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,160
put it to you in like a practical a way a practical person will understand um unless you like need

318
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,800
the money do you if you don't need the money then you never you never know you might have a kid you

319
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,040
might have a daughter or a son someday um the the engagement ring i gave my wife was passed down to

320
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:42,080
me from my my grandmother so you know it's it you you never know you might want to to reuse it in

321
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,440
that sense um or make some really bitchin ear jewelry like you just you never know uh but that

322
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,440
it's a that's a no that's that's a loser that's got loser printed all over that that convo you

323
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,960
have with your hubs here here's my suggestion start referring to things in terms of the cost

324
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,000
of the wedding rings our engagement ring so if your husband's looking at a new tv say yeah that'd

325
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:18,400
be about one and a half engagement rings that's much better advice actually that's a really nice

326
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,640
speed but what do you say frank that's like three engagement rings four engagement rings it's not

327
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:31,120
bad that's what we'll name it when we buy it by selling this engagement ring oh man it is that

328
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:37,280
screen is big you know i know you like the 30 inch but for about half engagement ring we can go up

329
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,880
to 50 that ring upgrade um i mean do you need the cash like if you don't need it just it's

330
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,640
why not have it it's like a think of it is another way it's like a nest egg it's like a

331
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,400
a rainy day fund it's gonna depreciate though in value when people stop giving out engagement rings

332
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,280
right because what what's that gonna happen uh i mean people are just gonna people are just gonna

333
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,800
rise above it people don't are gonna realize they don't need physical representations of their sweet

334
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,600
love oh yes say it in the words and just like say it and the words are all that matters in the

335
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:21,920
future that sounds good yeah i read about it tell your husband that listen in the future i wrote it

336
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:29,440
down somewhere but uh i'm basically so i sold my engagement ring the thesis of this story is that

337
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,400
i no longer have that ring you bought me with your three-month salary do you want to go deeper

338
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,240
because that's i pretty much gave you the abstract on this little paper i've written about this

339
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:50,080
also um whoa some ice just fell off my roof that was scary uh also spring is springing three

340
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:57,760
months salary two thousand dollars that doesn't seem right to me you either got played are you

341
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,480
dude's bank account is busted what you should bring up all of these things you should bring up

342
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,960
all the this this here is an embarrassment stanley let me refer to my powerpoint presentation about

343
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,320
why i'm going to sell this engagement ring slide number one your bank account's busted are you so

344
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,680
are you i'm not sure you have this right are you supposed to spend a quarter of your annual salary

345
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,560
on an engagement ring is that what you're telling me that is the rule i'm not making that up i think

346
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,000
you're pulling that out of your ass travis have you heard that's wedding i think that's wedding

347
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,440
rings oh no those are i think that's those are like 60 bucks like i have a yahoo okay give it

348
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,560
give me it was sent in by adam holly thanks adam holly it's by yahoo answers user 2010 world series

352
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,040

bullshit and i slap it on my enemy's faces you don't understand so you don't understand how

355
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:37,280
this works you don't understand how cologne works or parker has a very succinct um answer because

356
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:46,960
it's it's only three words but it describes the like everything about it um eva mendez's vagina

357
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,200
that's this is our new perfume todd it smells like eva mendez's but a haunting like

358
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,480
this is our new perfume eva mendez's vagina strangely it smells like oranges and cinnamon

359
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:14,160
which you would never guess can we just call it mint mendez been dead from for my personal

360
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,440
fragrance i would want to be something beefy because i'm a you know i'm a dude i'm out there

361
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:30,000
making deals making plays in business something beefy but kind of like like cigarettes like kind

362
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,120
of like beef and cigarettes okay okay yeah i call it big business because that's what i'm out there

363
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,880

364
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,080
and cigarettes okay i don't like that part as much does somebody make a money perfume

365
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,640
this is my perfume ballin it smells like money no no it would be more tasteful than that it would

366
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,880
come in a it would look like a maybe a piggy bank that's a little good uh-huh maybe a dollar sign

367
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:11,600
maybe just call it like crisp bills or just like or just crisp rollin rollin see you guys are you're

368
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:20,480
thinking about a sort of a hip-hop superstar affectation making it rain and it would it would

369
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,080
smell like rain and money like money that's been left out in the rain hey what can we talk

370
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,960
about the atmospheric situation in your bedroom right now devin because it right now it's supposed

371
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,440
like it's been raining money and i don't think that like meteorologically i don't think that

372
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,080
that's a sound scenario for you to be sleeping in i would i wouldn't want mine to smell like my two

373
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:52,400
favorite smells which is um baby skin and campfires wowzers that first one was like super creepy yeah

374
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,360
but then you combine it with the campfire and you imagine the smell of baby skin on a camp

375
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,240
cracklin baby skin that's travis all over that's actually what i would call it cracklin

376
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,240
that's really upsetting travis it smells like burning baby skin and even mendez's vagina

377
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,200
it's called cracklin and it's a fragrance and you can buy it at the store and mendez

378
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:25,280
costs eight dollars don't don't be fooled by this department store riposte like sizzling

379
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:32,720
it's eight so it's just like it but it smells like toddler skin on a gas burner and

380
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:40,240
dorothea lang's vagina don't don't be fooled don't be fooled by imitators i uh i think if i

381
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,480
ever became a solo folk artist just traveling around the country with my guitar and a harmonica

382
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,760

383
00:43:51,760 --> 00:44:03,360
my favorite neil diamond song cracklin mendez good news guys dorothea lang was a real person
