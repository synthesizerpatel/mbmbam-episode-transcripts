1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,040
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm your middle-ist brother, Travis McElroy. Well, I guess that makes me your sweet baby

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,400
brother. We were supposed to talk about Eurovision this morning, and then I realized I didn't have

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:13,040
anything funny to say about it, except Sweden was robbed by Portugal. It was an actual robbery

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,920
perpetrated on the world stage. Yeah, the Swedish song about premature ejaculation is amazing,

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,160
and should have won. It was called I Can't Go On. I don't think they were talking about

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,680
that nut. He's talking about that it makes him want to take off all his clothes,

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,440
and that the person he's singing to is so beautiful that he can't go on,

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,920
and he's got to keep it together. I'm saying Eurovision has a vetting process

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,800
to make sure that nut songs don't get through. Griffin, I'm sorry. This is not a joke I am

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,840
making. The Sweden song is about premature ejaculation and trying to hold back.

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,560
You guys are talking about that, and it reminded me of a much more important fact is that I watched

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,080
Fifty Shades of Grey last night. Talking about that nut, though.

19
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,640
Sydney and I had a good post-Eurovision drunk going, and we decided to keep up the fun.

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,920
To catch the zeitgeist. Fifty Shades of Grey,

21
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,960
The Orig, because two, Fifty Shades Darker, just came out on iTunes, but we didn't watch that one.

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:29,040
We watched Fifty Shades of Grey. Hey, everybody, that shit is buck wild.

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,880
How did we let that happen? Is that where things got away from us? I worry.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,840
Here's the most important fact about Fifty Shades. When I brought it up to Sydney,

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,960
because it is ludicrous, she said, oh, well, that's from the book. So here's what it is.

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,640
He has a room called the playroom, right? Christian Grey.

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,520
Well, it sounds fun. And that's where he keeps Cherry and Flory

28
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,920
and Clocky. And Harnessy and Buttpluggy.

29
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,840
She says, is that where you keep your Xbox? Hey, will you play me a cartoon?

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
All right, Buttpluggy. You're the boss.

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,560
Is that where you keep your Xbox? And he says, no, but I thought it'd be rad if he was like,

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,440
well, yes, but also sexy. Yeah, but I don't have a lot of space.

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,240
I don't have many of the newest games. I have Madden 11.

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,480
When he goes in there and he says to her, you're going to be my sex person.

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,320
And you're my submissive and you're my sex person. She has to like get on the ground on all fours

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,600
with like a blindfold or something. And Flory's like, what's up?

37
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,920
She's all naked. And that's like, and you just wait for me.

38
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:00,160
And then when he comes in, this man is wearing sex jeans.

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:09,280
And what I'm saying to you is that he has discrete jeans for sex that are ripped.

40
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,640
So he's not wearing the sex jeans at the beginning of the scene.

41
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,680
He leaves the room and comes back in wearing sex jeans that he does not remove.

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:30,240
He just wears the sex jeans the entire time he is in the playroom

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
with Buttpluggy and the Xbox and everything.

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,400
Actually, I just saw a Skype notification that you've sent me a link.

45
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,640
And I think this might be one that I don't want to.

46
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,040
No, I wouldn't have to click on it.

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
Yeah, it's just, if you get a visual of him, it's just like,

48
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,760
it looks like Incredible Hulk post transformation with like torn sex jeans.

49
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
That this gentleman wears all the time.

50
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,640
A quick diversion to express.

51
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,240
And now I'm gonna fall into the gap if you know what I'm saying.

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah, if there's a, if you, he never takes the sex jeans off.

53
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
He just wears the sex jeans all the time.

54
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
Is he a never nude?

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Apparently he's a never nude is what he's talking about.

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,880
God, that would be such a fucking twist.

57
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,920
If in Shades of Grey he's like, but I'm, I just want you to know,

58
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,480
I want to do all kinds of sex stuff with you.

59
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm not comfortable being naked though.

60
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,720
And I will have to turn the lights off.

61
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,680
I just want to rub my wormy up against this carpenter cut denim is my whole thing.

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
These sweet jinkos.

63
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Sign this, sign this contract.

64
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm going to wait.

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,440
And then the line A, A1A sort of the first,

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,720
the preamble is basically about how these jeans never coming off.

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,040
These jeans are mine and I need them.

68
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,160
And the sex contract is written out on my jeans.

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
You get prescription jeans and I need these for everything.

70
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
It's pretty good.

71
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
It's pretty great.

72
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
All of the movie is excellent.

73
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
Can I ask you a question?

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,240
Anything.

75
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,120
Ask me anything.

76
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
AMA.

77
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,000
I watched all of Fifty Shades of Grey drug.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,500
AMA.

79
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,860
Did it.

80
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
How horny did you get?

81
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,820
Yeah.

82
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,440
Did I mention the jeans?

83
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
No, you did mention the jeans,

84
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,040
but you don't have to be childish about it.

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,400
It's an adult movie for adults.

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
And obviously I'm, we're all over 30 now.

87
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
And so we can talk about stuff like your chubs, like your chubby.

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
We hear every, we hear it.

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
My brother, my brother and me, we are sex positive.

90
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,240
We have many listeners who are in, you know,

91
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
the SM S and M, uh, Dom, you know, sub scene.

92
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
That's totally cool, Justin.

93
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
So however many boners you got,

94
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,200
Chubs.

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,040
Did it get no kink shaming?

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,440
There's gene shaming happening here.

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,760
What I'm saying is I'm sex positive and Christian Grey is,

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,600
is nudity negative.

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,520
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,520
Can't go jeans.

101
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,040
All right.

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,760
Very good.

103
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,720
K and KO.

104
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,760
You gotta get them.

105
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,480
You gotta get them.

106
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,160
You can keep a fucking Game Boy Advance SP in there.

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,360
And also six plugs for a butt in there to have fun with.

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,320
Not your butt though.

109
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,840
Your jeans staying on.

110
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
The jeans are staying on.

111
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,360
But you can keep a full bag of jerky in those jeans.

112
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
Justin, were there openings?

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
You said the jeans were ripped.

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,600
Were there openings in the jeans that allowed him to engage?

115
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Or was this like, oh, I was going to buy, uh,

116
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,520
like a extreme restraints, uh, cage for my penis,

117
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,120
but I forgot to order it in time and it won't be here till Thursday.

118
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
So I'm going to do the next best thing and put them in a denim prison.

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,240
No, no, he scooches them down below his penis.

120
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
Like he's peeing in the trough at a minor league baseball game.

121
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,480
Like he, he just, he just scooches them down to do it.

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,720
To do the thing, to do the darn thing.

123
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,600
A lot of avoiding the subject of the sort of chubby inquisition.

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,440
There's no arousal.

125
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,320
It's negative arousal.

126
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,640
Everyone in the movie is very attractive, right?

127
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,360
The jeans kill every bit of eroticism.

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Because like, all I can feel for Puerto Cota Johnson is, um, uh, uh,

129
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,600
you know, the, the, she, she has to be with a man in jeans.

130
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,240
Always.

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,680
Yeah, Justin, hold on.

132
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Oh, Justin.

133
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,680
Now you've made me wonder.

134
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,280
I assume there's more than one sex scene in Fifty Shades of Grey.

135
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
Did the jeans reappear every time?

136
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,640
Is he like, wait, if we're going to do it, I'll be right back.

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
It's not a single scene, Travis.

138
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,640
What I'm saying to you is there's a couple scenes in this playroom area

139
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,840
where the, like, the, the supposedly taboo things happen.

140
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,600
And, um, it, it, he's always in the jeans.

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
And every, every time he's in the jeans.

142
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,840
Maybe you saw a, were you watching this on the stars at 7 PM

143
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,520
and maybe these jeans were CGI'd in so that like they could,

144
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,760
they could show it on stars or-

145
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,200
Did he stub his toe and, and yell, oh, we's a lover!

146
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
Cause that's a pretty good-

147
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
A bit where he comes around a corner weird

148
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,400
and he kind of jukes real fast

149
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,160
and the jeans take like a half second to catch up with his pubis.

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,120
Was there much jeans lag on the stars channel you were watching this on?

151
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
They were not animated cartoon jeans.

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
Um, there is a, she reveals to him,

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,760
but before he gets into his, his dark proclivities,

154
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,560
he reveals, she reveals to him that she's a virgin.

155
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,080
And his reaction to that is to scoop her up

156
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,440
and she says, what are you doing?

157
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,840
And he says, I quote, I'm rectifying the situation.

158
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,340
Yay-o!

159
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,960
So when you talk about, when you talk about how many chubbies,

160
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
that's why it's negative.

161
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
Ding-dong, shoot, man, fuck.

162
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,320
It's rough.

163
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
Also in pro- like she's supposed to be,

164
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,960
uh, you know, completely, uh, um, uh, ignorant of this world, right?

165
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,460
Yeah.

166
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,720
He buys her a computer and she, he says,

167
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,960
I hope you use this to do some research.

168
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,200
Okay.

169
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,280
And she texts him and says, what should I search?

170
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,720
He says, try submissive.

171
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,280
And it's like, okay, I know she's ignorant of S&M,

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,760
but she's ignorant of like Google?

173
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,880
Like, is he going to give her like a Boolean walkthrough right now

174
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,760
of like how to get information about S&M?

175
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
It seems unlikely.

176
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,560
Justin, having-

177
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,000
She also, wait, I need to finish this.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
I need to finish this one point before I move on.

179
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,120
They take her ignorance of the S&M lifestyle to its absolute extreme

180
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
because when they're going through the sex contract

181
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
and she's eliminating genital clamps from the contract

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
as something that like is good for her, she asks him,

183
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,840
this is a direct quote, what's a butt plug?

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,920
And I wanted to sit down with her at that point

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,800
and just walk into the movie Purple Rose of Cairo style

186
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,760
and be like, hey Dakota, hey Dakota,

187
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
what do you think a butt plug could be?

188
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
Also, this is what, 2015?

189
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
You have not contextually picked up in the world

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
the concept of butt, like I don't care.

191
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm not butt plug experienced.

192
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,120
Travis, you can go into fucking caveman times

193
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
and if it's called a butt plug,

194
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,880
probably we are going to figure it out.

195
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,080
It's a special type of cup that you use for tea.

196
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,920
No, it's a silly little guy and it gets in there

197
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,600
and it holds it all up or in or what.

198
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm not sure what the function is

199
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,920
but I bet it feels fucking great.

200
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,400
Damn, now I'm all rock hard talking about all this junk.

201
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm kind of in disbelief of how long we've been talking

202
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
about Fifty Shades of Grey in May 14th, 2017 AD,

203
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
the year of our Lord Christ Jesus.

204
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,840
I just, I feel bad for, I feel very bad for people

205
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,920
who, for whom SM is a fetish for them

206
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,440
because if this is the world's touchstone for your thing.

207
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
It's not good.

208
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,800
That's not, it's probably, we probably should,

209
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,520
yeah, it is a negative, I think, in terms of awareness.

210
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,280
It's probably how I feel every time I go to a Superman movie

211
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,480
and I'm like, yeah, this time they'll get it right.

212
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,440
And I always walk out like, no, I'm not into Superman.

213
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,920
I don't know why I was here, I'm embarrassed.

214
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
It's as if somebody went and saw Space Jam

215
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,840
and then went to a basketball game

216
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,240
and then was disappointed that nobody was stretching

217
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,720
their arms across half of the court to dunk it

218
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,680
while a bunch of big colorful monsters hurt the Bugs Bunny.

219
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,080
Okay, here's a quick, I have not read this

220
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,240
but here's a headline from Cosmopolitan.

221
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,400
In case you wanted to know what Christian Grey

222
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,160
really calls his sex genes.

223
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
Well, what's he call, don't fucking tell me now.

224
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
Are you guys ready?

225
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,840
Yes.

226
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,880
This is from the book.

227
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,960
In my closet, I strip off all my clothes

228
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,280
and from a drawer pull out my favorite jeans.

229
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,120
My DJs.

230
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
Dom jeans.

231
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,800
Happy Mother's Day, everybody.

232
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,760
Go out, get to fucking J.Crew, get to Express

233
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
and go pick up a new pair of Dom jeans.

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
You're gonna love these things.

235
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,360
Is it possible, is it possible?

236
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,560
Is it just possible that we're having this conversation

237
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
and we're gonna get like 5,000 emails that are like,

238
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
yeah, Dom jeans.

239
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,520
Yeah, I don't care.

240
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I don't, I'll take, I will take that

241
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,840
because you know what?

242
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,600
Just because it's a part of S&M culture,

243
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,760
if it is, I can't be, if it is,

244
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,360
the cultures can grow and evolve by definition.

245
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,600
I, an outsider will help you pass this S&M culture.

246
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
You cannot have Dom jeans.

247
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
One, it sounds like mom jeans.

248
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,960
It sounds exactly like mom jeans.

249
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,360
Exactly like mom jeans, Dom jeans.

250
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,520
I slip them on and fasten all the buttons

251
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,040
except the top one.

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,760
From the same drawer, I retrieve the new riding crop

253
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,280
and a gray waffle robe.

254
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
As I leave, I grab a few condoms

255
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,040
and stuff them into my pocket.

256
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
Here goes, showtime, Gray.

257
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,160
Cowboy hat, cowboy hat, yes or no?

258
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,120
Can't decide in the end, decide next time.

259
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

260
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,320
Is it possible that he needs the jeans

261
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
to put condoms in?

262
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
Like he doesn't, he doesn't want to walk in the room

263
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,200
with a handful of condoms

264
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,560
because apparently he needs a few.

265
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
He needs several, yeah, he's extremely safe.

266
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,960
He just has it, what's in here?

267
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,360
Oh, my condoms and some bazooka Joe and some chapstick.

268
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,640
And 83 cents.

269
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,920
Yeah, I'm looking, I just found the page

270
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,840
you were on, Justin, in this book.

271
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,520
I got the e-book on my Kindle now.

272
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,680
I'm looking through it and let me just catch up

273
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
to call my Dom jeans, put condoms in the pockets.

274
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,760
I don't call them my Dom jeans

275
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,560
because I'm a dominant in the sexual Congress.

276
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,120
I actually call them that because I got them

277
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,360
from my friend, late great actor

278
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
and television producer, Dom Deluise.

279
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,920
That's funny that Dom Deluise would get him sex,

280
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360
like pants for sex in it.

281
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
We've now spent a quarter of this episode

282
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,560
talking about 50 Shades of Gray

283
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,640
and if we do any more, I think that,

284
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,280
I think I might just like call this one like episode

285
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,760
like 152 or something, drop it in sort of in media res.

286
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,320
And so it will be like more sort of chronologically appropriate.

287
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,080
Have you guys seen this dress?

288
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,840
Is it blue and black or white and gold?

289
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm so super confused.

290
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,120
Okay, so anyway, we'll do a question now

291
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
because apparently I'm not allowed to talk about

292
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
50 Shades of Gray anymore.

293
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,840
Is there never a moment when he comes out in the jeans,

294
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,880
there has to be at least one,

295
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
he's probably had multiple partners,

296
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,160
at least one partner probably to be like,

297
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,960
oh yeah, Christian, what's the,

298
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,920
what's with the jeans?

299
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,480
What's the deal with the jeans?

300
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,280
What he does is he takes a woman

301
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,560
and they sign the contract

302
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
and then they live in his house in a special room for this.

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
And she asked him like,

304
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
how many women have you had like this?

305
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,320
And he says 15, which seems high,

306
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,840
but maybe they're not getting scared off

307
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,200
by like the whips and stuff.

308
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,840
Maybe it's just like, I can't with the jeans.

309
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
I have to go.

310
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,760
Is there a line in the contracts that says like,

311
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,520
I will not ask about the jeans.

312
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,400
Promise not to mention the jeans out loud.

313
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,440
The fact that it passes without comment, by the way,

314
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,520
is the most ludicrous thing in the entire film.

315
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,800
She comments about everything.

316
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,920
She doesn't know what butt plugs are.

317
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,480
He walks in with jeans and she's just like, uh-huh.

318
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,520
That seems right.

319
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,240
Hey, showtime.

320
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,440
Uh, J-Man, one more, one more, one more question.

321
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,400
Oh my god.

322
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,680
This has always eaten me up

323
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
and now Justin could possibly answer this for me.

324
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Is the idea of 50 Shades of Anything referenced in the book?

325
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,960
What is the title based on?

326
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,160
Travis, at one point he says, you can't love me.

327
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,880
And she says, why?

328
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,360
And he says, he stares into a window very dramatically

329
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,040
and says, because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.

330
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,120
And that is where the title of the book comes from.

331
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,920
But the name of the book isn't 50 Shades of Fucked Up,

332
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,080
which would be a way better title.

333
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,520
That would be because you could feel when,

334
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,360
apparently the book is, I have not read the book.

335
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,160
Apparently the writing leaves something to be desired.

336
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,560
But you can feel with your entire being

337
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,640
when they have lifted a line directly from the book

338
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
because it sounds like that it is written.

339
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,760
Like the line, the first there,

340
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
I think it's the masquerade scene

341
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
when they sort of go away from the party

342
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,000
and find a little bedroom.

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
And he says, I'm gonna rump me a good one.

344
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,280
And she laughs.

345
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,360
That's page 169, which is funny, which is also kind of funny.

346
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
The weirdest part about the movie is

347
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
he only calls it porking.

348
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,920
So every time it's like, why are you so dark and disturbed?

349
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,000
Because I like to spank while I pork.

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,040
And it's like weird.

351
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,280
That's a weird way of putting it.

352
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,560
So here's an actual question.

353
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm sorry about all the 50 Shades talk.

354
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,040
But if you want me to watch 50 Shades 2 and talk about it.

355
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,080
Nope.

356
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
We're gonna have to do some kind of go fund me

357
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,120
to make that happen.

358
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,040
Maybe donate some money to charity

359
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,600
in order to make Justin watch 50 Shades.

360
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Or maybe to make him not watch 50 Shades 2

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
so we never have to talk about it again.

362
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,680
I thought it was weird how in the movie

363
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,360
every time he achieves climax, he yells toasty.

364
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
Like the guy from Mortal Kombat.

365
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,560
There's like a lot of like, it pulls from,

366
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,720
it's kind of like Scott Pilgrim.

367
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,920
Like he just pulls from all these different,

368
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,600
like there's so many like references to old video games.

369
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,200
It was originally Michael Cero,

370
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,040
which is why they wrote the jeans in.

371
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,640
Cause that was a request.

372
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:44,880
Okay.

373
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,920
I've been trying to clear out the back of my closet

374
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,400
and I ran into an issue trying to deal with,

375
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,400
well, I have these five very large posters of Orlando Bloom.

376
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,440
One Pirates of the Caribbean,

377
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
two Lord of the Rings and two Elizabeth Towns.

378
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,040
Two fucking 24 by 68,

379
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,560
like rip these off the side of a fucking theater

380
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,480
Elizabeth Town promos.

381
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,280
I've had a crush on Orlando Bloom since I was a teenager.

382
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,960
Many years ago, I had a dedicated wall of Orlando posters

383
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
and when I moved into my own apartment,

384
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,280
they all came with me,

385
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,680
but only two went up on the wall.

386
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
Tasteful restraint.

387
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,240
I know I can't make space for the rest,

388
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,320
but I feel terrible about throwing them out.

389
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
Should I ask my friends if they want them?

390
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,560
They don't.

391
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,080
Or sell them?

392
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,040
Good luck.

393
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,280
And that's from Closet Cleaning Canadian.

394
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,760
Man, that's a humdinger.

395
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,080
Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention.

396
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,120
You've chosen wisely.

397
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,560
You can't throw them out.

398
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,200
His spirit is in them.

399
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,640
His spirit, a little bit of it.

400
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,440
Like he'll know.

401
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,040
I feel like every time,

402
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,920
and it doesn't happen often,

403
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,960
but anytime folks throw away the I'm a Bim Bam poster,

404
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
especially if we've signed it,

405
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,320
we've put a piece of our essence in them.

406
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
And so when you throw them away,

407
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
it's like I trip and fall over

408
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
and I'm like, oh man, it happened, didn't it?

409
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,680
I'd love to do, I'd love to be there when Con Marie

410
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,560
digs into this apartment like,

411
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,160
I want you to touch each of these objects

412
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,280
and tell me if they spark joy.

413
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,120
And if not, we'll throw them away.

414
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,600
Let me check.

415
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

416
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,640
They all spark joy.

417
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,440
What else you got?

418
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,680
Okay, if you have one, you're an Orlando Bloom fan.

419
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,000
Fun.

420
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,160
If you have three, it's a shrine.

421
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,520
Like it becomes a shrine to Orlando Bloom

422
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
and that has some powerful symbology.

423
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm not sure you wanna necessarily hit your wagon.

424
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
Well, you leave him offerings

425
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,920
of some of Bloom's favorite stuff, bows and arrows.

426
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,600
Yeah, I'm sure he got really into that.

427
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,800
Pictures of his friends from Lord of the Rings,

428
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,360
like the actors, I think they're all still really good buds.

429
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,160
He likes those.

430
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
What you do is when you have friends come over,

431
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
you say, if we're gonna be friends,

432
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
you need to know something about me.

433
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
Welcome to my play, Bloom.

434
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,480
And then you open the door

435
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
and it's just coded in your posters.

436
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,520
This is something you need to know about me.

437
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
50 posters of Orlando Bloom.

438
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,560
Your friends are confused and you're like,

439
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
what do your Elven eyes see?

440
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,040
Come on, say it.

441
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,840
You know the truth.

442
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,120
These are my genes.

443
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,400
You know what people are really into these days, fellas?

444
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
Very specific museums.

445
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,680
Okay.

446
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,160
Somebody will like rent a storefront

447
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,560
and like, this is my I Love Lucy museum now

448
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,600
or this is like my Bazooka Joe gum museum

449
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,240
or this is my Space Jam museum.

450
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,880
Maybe you want to open up an Orlando Bloom museum

451
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,720
because if you could start making money off of it,

452
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,840
you can turn around to everybody who ever gave you shit

453
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,920
about having five full-sized Orlando Bloom posters

454
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,720
and the Big Head posters

455
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
or a full-sized Orlando Bloom on your wall

456
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
because now you're making money off Orlando Bloom,

457
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
just like everyone else in Orlando Bloom's life.

458
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,560
Okay.

459
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,440
They're all taking advantage.

460
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm glad we've gotten to this.

461
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,120
We're all taking advantage of Orlando Bloom all the time.

462
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,560
If this person is willing, please get in contact with us

463
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,880
because I will literally set you up

464
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
and pay for a post office box

465
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,160
where everybody with spare Orlando Bloom stuff

466
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,600
can mail it to you

467
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,160
and we can really trick this shit out.

468
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,840
Like really get it going

469
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,360
and make a room in your house

470
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
that is a, you probably get a different tax classification

471
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
for this one room that is the Orlando Bloom museum

472
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,520
or the Bloom museum.

473
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,400
Or church.

474
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
Church, hey.

475
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320
We've all reached a dark and tough time in our lives

476
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,080
where we did a little prayer to Orlando Bloom

477
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,680
just to see if he could do anything to help out.

478
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,280
Troy is in Troy.

479
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,200
Yeah, got it.

480
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Got a fourth one.

481
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,320
Hey, do you guys want to know who?

482
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,680
Yep.

483
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,600
Now I'm just psyching about Troy.

484
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,640
Eric Bana?

485
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
Fuck yeah, dude.

486
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Here's a Yahoo.

487
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,300
Brad Pitt?

488
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,580
Was he?

489
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Yeah, he plays the Achilles.

490
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,120
He's one of the Troy boys.

491
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,560
I have a good one.

492
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,440
That's what they call them.

493
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,040
I have a good one here, but it's not loading.

494
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,440
I'm wondering if my cookies are fucked up.

495
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,720
There we go.

496
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,240
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski, riding high.

497
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
Yes, thank you Zoe Kinski.

498
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,800
It's from Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

499
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,600
It's actually from Jorlando Doom.

500
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,720
Jorlando Doom sent this one, asked this.

501
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,760
Jorlando Doom asks,

502
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,720
oh, the page crashed.

503
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,520
What does that even mean?

504
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,400
How does a page crash?

505
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,360
It's the internet.

506
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
I didn't download it.

507
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
Yahoo is closing down around you, Griffin.

508
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
You have to get out.

509
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,760
You're joking, but that is going to happen one day

510
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,120
and y'all never see me again.

511
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,680
Jorlando Doom asks,

512
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,720
God, fuck this website.

513
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,280
Seriously.

514
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,780
Okay.

515
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,120
Jorlando Doom asks,

516
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,680
why does the New Year's ball drop instead of go up?

517
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
This question really fucked me up when I saw it.

518
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,520
Why does the New Year's ball drop instead of go up?

519
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
And then there's the only other text here is update.

520
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,200
Tradition, yes.

521
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,920
Dropping balls, good answer.

522
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,480
Update two, about the gravity response.

523
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,240
No shit, Sherlock.

524
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
So I'm not going to go too deep into the other answers

525
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,040
that people gave,

526
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,400
but I think somebody just said like,

527
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
oh, a ball can't go up.

528
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,880
Ball go down because of the Earth pull.

529
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,920
Do you mean gravity?

530
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,440
So the obvious answer here is that

531
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,640
they couldn't get it down.

532
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,840
Like if you raised it and that was like the thing,

533
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,240
that's cool, except now that ball is just up there now.

534
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,280
So you can't bring it down, you know?

535
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,760
You can't get it because you raised it.

536
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,400
It's not like a flag where if the ball touches the ground,

537
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
the year stops or whatever.

538
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,680
Yes, but the symbolism of like the year is here,

539
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,960
time to raise the ball.

540
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
At some point, you're going to have the reverse symbolism of,

541
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
well, bring it back down, I guess.

542
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,280
But that's how we do it.

543
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,080
That's how we do it now.

544
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
It's like, count it down.

545
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
Three, two, one.

546
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
Let's lower this year into the toilet,

547
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
which is like where it belongs.

548
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,240
I want to triumphant.

549
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,280
I want to count up.

550
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,800
This year, I want to see the ball go up

551
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,600
and I want it to be one, two, three, four, five, six,

552
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
seven, eight, nine, ten.

553
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,040
And the ball's at the top and everyone's like,

554
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,200
fuck yeah, look at that thing up there.

555
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
Everybody can see it better now because it's higher.

556
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,640
Go with me.

557
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,560
I think a third option.

558
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,080
Third option, we build two mechanical hands

559
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,720
and we make it like a tether ball

560
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
and they bat the ball around

561
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,120
and when it's all fully wrapped around the pole,

562
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,400
happy new year.

563
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,120
But it is a billions of Wawrowski's crystals.

564
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,160
And those will not hold up to-

565
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
We'll make the hands crystal too, Griffin.

566
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't know what you want from me, all right?

567
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,640
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few crystals.

568
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
I want to shower Times Square

569
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,040
and razor sharp Swarovski crystals

570
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,360
to take it from the year ball.

571
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,160
Listen, thin that crowd a little bit.

572
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,120
It couldn't hurt, Griffin.

573
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,320
There's too many people there.

574
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
Not enough bathrooms.

575
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,560
They're not allowed to drink.

576
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,520
There's no food there.

577
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,480
I've often thought that standing in Times Square

578
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
for new year's must be the absolute pits.

579
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Full blown.

580
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,480
I think the crystal hand should be controlled

581
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,800
by Ryan Seacrest with a virtual reality helmet.

582
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,520
Oh, yes.

583
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,400
That would be very futuristic.

584
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,280
That'd be very today.

585
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,600
You would never see that on Dick Clark's show.

586
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
That's how Ryan makes it his own.

587
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Where's that year ball right now, though?

588
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,600
What do you think?

589
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,000
It's sitting there.

590
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,000
It's just sitting somewhere, huh?

591
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,120
No, I'm saying like I think it's still on top of that building.

592
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,640
Oh, shit.

593
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
I mean, first of all,

594
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,160
a heist opportunity of the century.

595
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,760
I'm saying if you have the year ball, you got the power.

596
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,160
And so we steal the year ball,

597
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,080
and it's up to us how this one goes.

598
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,040
Maybe that's what the good year blimp is all about.

599
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,800
It's a band of blimp based thieves trying to get the year ball

600
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,200
so that they can just improve it.

601
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,760
What if we just take this whole shit, right?

602
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,720
We turn it on its ear.

603
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,560
And what we do is the ball,

604
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,560
it raises up, right, at the beginning of the year,

605
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,280
and then we continuously lower it when bad shit happens.

606
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,880
And when it hits the bottom, it's time for a new year,

607
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,480
no matter what fucking day it is, month it is, whatever.

608
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,320
Like, well, we've used up all the goodness of the year,

609
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,920
so time to reset.

610
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,600
And then that's right there.

611
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
That's new year, June 7th, whatever.

612
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
Fucking new year, we're done.

613
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,400
It's 2018 now.

614
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,120
June 7th is such a fucking wildly inaccurate,

615
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,440
like, you don't realize, Trav,

616
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
if we started doing this last year,

617
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,480
it would currently be like January 3rd, 3041,

618
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,800
and then tomorrow would be January 1st, 3042.

619
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,600
It would just be like, history teachers would be like,

620
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,920
so there's this weird span of like 650 years

621
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,600
that really took place over the course of like, well, four.

622
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,400
And it got pretty buckwild there for a second.

623
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,760
But anyway, yeah, that's when everybody was like 750 years old.

624
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,720
You remember?

625
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,760
It was really fun.

626
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,040
It was like a fun way to do it.

627
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,280
We were talking about Ryan Seacrest a little bit.

628
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,680
Yes.

629
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,360
I wanted to share a quick vignette.

630
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,640
First, congratulations to Ryan.

631
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,680
He's the new co-host with Kelly Ripa.

632
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,160
So it's-

633
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
Oh, permanently?

634
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,800
Yeah, he's like the new-

635
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,240
Yeah, he's the new guy.

636
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
And they had to keep mum about it for a long time.

637
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,560
And she had this joke where she said, in my house,

638
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,880
we call it keeping a Seacrest,

639
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,240
because they had to not tell anybody about it.

640
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,160
And I just wanted to pass that on to everybody

641
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,000
in case in your day-to-day life for, well, for the rest of it.

642
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
If you want to call secrets Seacrests,

643
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
I would very much approve of that.

644
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,840
And it's something I'm going to try to implement.

645
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
And I just wanted to share that with everybody

646
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,000
that they're called Seacrests now.

647
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,640
It's going to be tough to implement, but I'm going to do-

648
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,280
I mean, you know me.

649
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,960
It doesn't trip off the tongue.

650
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,720
If you guys want to try it, it doesn't-

651
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,520
It stumbles off the tongue, but Kelly leads and I follow.

652
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,360
Kelly says, jump.

653
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,120
I say, how high, Kelly Ripa?

654
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,480
And she tells me how high to jump.

655
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,160
Here's another question.

656
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,920
My housemate keeps opening the fridge door

657
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,440
and fraudulently claiming, balls, we're out of milk.

658
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,040
He then pauses and says, ah, just joking.

659
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,840
How do I explain to him what jokes are?

660
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,760
That's from George from the internet.

661
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,840
You know the one. We're out of milk.

662
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,300
Get it?

663
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,080
I mean, it's the exclamation balls that gives us

664
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,920
a particularly like nutty sort of wild boys

665
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,760
pecan flavor that I really would like an early 2000s,

666
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,360
like some 41 sort of barf vibe that I just

667
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,000
am like really grooving on right now.

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,680
Just sort of, just sort of some, just a fucking really,

669
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
really, really good.

670
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,400
I mean, that's the, that made me laugh.

671
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,040
I'll be honest.

672
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
Yeah, it did make me laugh too.

673
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,560
You want to put on a joke clinic, but the summoning,

674
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,400
the conjuring of balls from the depths is like,

675
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,280
that makes me chuckle, I think, a little bit.

676
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,520
Yeah, because they weren't out of-

677
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,280
Did you, Griffin, did you hear the part

678
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,640
where they weren't out of milk?

679
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
Did you hear that part of the joke?

680
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,800
No, that's classic comedy.

681
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,640
I was more tickled by this sort of ska curse word, balls.

682
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,280
I guess I'm just lost in this whole thing.

683
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,920
So there is milk?

684
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
No, no, no, no, no.

685
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,520
Oh, there is milk.

686
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,000
Oh, there is.

687
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
Now I get it.

688
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,720
Balls, balls, dude.

689
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
Balls, I got tricked.

690
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,000
For a second, I thought that there was no milk present,

691
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
and I panicked.

692
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
I panicked.

693
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,280
Honest to God, I felt my blood go cold

694
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,480
because I was like, what do I put on my Frosted Flakes later?

695
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,760
And I was thinking about having a mac and cheese for dinner,

696
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,560
but not now.

697
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,920
Not now.

698
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
But then, Justin, here's the beauty of this,

699
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,440
was not only is it fucking hilarious,

700
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,200
but the relief I felt when I realized there is milk.

701
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,760
I don't think that this person has thought about,

702
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,320
one of these days, they're going to open that old fridge

703
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,800
and there really isn't going to be milk.

704
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,840
And they can tell whoever they want at that point.

705
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,160
No one is going to believe it.

706
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,560
They're going to go to the store to buy milk,

707
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,280
and the milk butcher is going to say,

708
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,800
no, I'm pretty sure you have milk.

709
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Nice try, but go home.

710
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,160
The milk got your number,

711
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,080
which is funny because you're at a butcher shop.

712
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,360
Right.

713
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,480
The milk butcher being the one who destroys the cows

714
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,800
to get the sweet nectar within.

715
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
There's got to be an easier way.

716
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,120
There has to be.

717
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
When you go to a really nice resort,

718
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,240
sometimes they'll crack the cow right there in front of you,

719
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
just put a straw in it,

720
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
and you can just enjoy it there in your chair

721
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,080
as you watch the waves roll in.

722
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,880
It's amazing.

723
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,520
Balls, dude.

724
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,680
Can you imagine if that's how it was?

725
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,900
Fuck.

726
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,560
Balls, man.

727
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,040
Balls.

728
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,760
That's some...

729
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,560
Oh, God.

730
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,040
It's just like I'm there on the couch

731
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,200
watching Viva La Bam again.

732
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,480
Fuck yeah, dude.

733
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:42,880
Balls.

734
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,680
I'm loving it.

735
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
Just saying it, man.

736
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,160
Every once in a while,

737
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,600
I check to see if there's going to be another jackass movie,

738
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,200
and it always leads me down some paths of despair.

739
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,280
It just gets worse every time I duck my head back in

740
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,400
to see how progress is coming on Jackass 4.

741
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,920
It gets worse and worse and worse.

742
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,800
And at this point,

743
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,640
I think I'm going to stop checking

744
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,400
to see if Jackass 4 is going to happen,

745
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,160
because I always end up very depressed.

746
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Probably better ways for time to be used.

747
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,880
And money and everything.

748
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Hey, here's a quickie sent by Rachel Rosen.

749
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,520
Game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

750
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:19,840
Thank you.

751
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,080
It's Yahoo Answers user Ben who says,

752
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,880
has there ever been a circular banana?

753
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,560
Like, you know, how some bananas are more curly than others.

754
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,600
Has one ever curled right around into a circle?

755
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,400
I mean, probably.

756
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,560
All right.

757
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,160
Travis fruit science expert.

758
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,840
I mean, I'm just saying that if you're talking about

759
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,320
across the great expanse of time

760
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,480
since like the evolution of the modern nanner,

761
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,760
has there been a nanner that has grown into itself?

762
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,720
I mean, probably.

763
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,080
If you had a completely circular banana

764
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,040
that went all the way around,

765
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,000
you could feed everyone with it forever.

766
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,720
Think about that.

767
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,760
Hold up, what?

768
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,680
It's an infinite banana.

769
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,160
Nobody.

770
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,080
There's no beginning and no end to the banana.

771
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,000
So no matter how many bites you took out of it,

772
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,240
it's still all there.

773
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,920
Well, I see what you're saying.

774
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,560
If I may, one step further, in order for that to happen,

775
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,280
the banana would have to twist back in on itself

776
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
like a Mobius nanner.

777
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,400
Now, if you had a Mobius nanner,

778
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,360
you could also have people walk on that banana

779
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,200
and walk forever.

780
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,400
And get real confused.

781
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,760
Yeah, and while they're eating it.

782
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,960
Justin, you came to my house in March

783
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,400
and you brought your lovely family

784
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,520
and we all had a fun time.

785
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,680
And it wasn't just your lovely family you brought,

786
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,960
you also brought a literal bucket of donuts

787
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,160
from Voodoo Donuts.

788
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,200
A big bucket.

789
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,760
Big, big.

790
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
It's not a little bucket.

791
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,640
A 10 gallon bucket.

792
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,840
A 10 gallon bucket, and they had donuts in them

793
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,080
and I watched you eat a food that is a circle.

794
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,800
So I know you understand that not all circular foods

795
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,320
contain infinite food matter.

796
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah, but bananas traditionally have a beginning and an end,

797
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,520
right?

798
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,960
Every banana that you've ever seen

799
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,760
has a beginning and an end.

800
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
You're talking about terminal bananas.

801
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,600
You can either bite the beginning of the banana

802
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,040
or the bottom of the banana if you're a goofball.

803
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,960
I don't even know anybody that eats bananas that way

804
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,760
except maybe monkeys.

805
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,320
No, that's wrong.

806
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,720
But if you have a banana that goes all the way around

807
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,880
and I said, it just keeps going,

808
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,320
so you could bite the top of it.

809
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,120
There is no top.

810
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,840
You could bite the bottom.

811
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,040
There is no bottom.

812
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,440
So since it is an infinite banana without beginning or end,

813
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,680
then theoretically speaking, quantum, et cetera,

814
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,400
et cetera, et cetera.

815
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,360
Quantum, dude.

816
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,560
Much like lobsters, if we didn't harvest bananas,

817
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,880
they would just keep growing like that.

818
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Like lobsters are immortal.

819
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,320
Everybody knows that.

820
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,560
Yeah.

821
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,080
Do you think bananas are immortal if we don't chop them?

822
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,840
Man, am I right?

823
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,440
Humans, won't we fuck up?

824
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,600
Anyways, I want perfectly round bananas that I can...

825
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,480
Because here's the thing.

826
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm going to the park to play with my friends in the grass

827
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,680
and just sort of connect with nature

828
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
and I take an apple with me.

829
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
I drop the apple and of course,

830
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
I'm like running in the grass because I'm having a great time

831
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
and I kick the apple and it goes so far away

832
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
because I just had to hold the apple in my hands.

833
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,600
What the fuck else am I going to do with it?

834
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,640
It's a big apple.

835
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,920
It's a big gala apple.

836
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,080
A banana ring.

837
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,520
I could wear that as a tiara.

838
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,280
I could wear that as a cool bracelet or a belt

839
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
if it's fucking big enough.

840
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,240
Like Travis said, we eat these bananas

841
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,840
before we really give them a fair shot.

842
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,120
So I wear this banana circlet and it's not going to fall off

843
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
because I'm wearing it and it looks cool.

844
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,400
It looks yellow and cool and banana.

845
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,640
Not only that, Griffin, you get to the park with your friends

846
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,960
and it's like, hey, let's play some Ultimate Frisbee

847
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,240
like we've been talking about all week.

848
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,280
Oh no, Steve forgot the fucking frisbee.

849
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,560
Nanner time.

850
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,080
Throw it.

851
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,520
And I would be kind of passive aggressive.

852
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,200
I would throw it so Steve would miss

853
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,640
and so he'd look like a fucking nerd.

854
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,080
This is the dumbest our show has ever been

855
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,840
and I'm stopping it to go to the Money Zone.

856
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:14,720
How would you even peel it if it's all over?

857
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,040
You got a great wardrobe.

858
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
You look good.

859
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,120
You got your perfect jeans with the holes for sex.

860
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,240
You got your banana crown.

861
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,800
What about the things not everybody gets to see?

862
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,200
That's right.

863
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,400
You've been buying those store-bought underwear five packs

864
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,920
that are basically like trash on your genitals.

865
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,520
So congratulations.

866
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,080
It's time to level up your genitals to me undies.

867
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,400
They're seriously soft, feel-good undies delivered

868
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,120
right to your door with all kinds of cool patterns.

869
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,040
They're made from sustainably sourced micromodal,

870
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,320
which is a fabric three times softer than cotton.

871
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,200
They come in a ton of different bold shades

872
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
and adventurous patterns.

873
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,920
They could be your little secret and guess what?

874
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,120

That's meundies.com slash my brother.

882
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,080
And what do you wear over your me undies?

883
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,440
Your blue apron.

884
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Blue apron is a micromodal fabric

885
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,880
that protects you from all food splattering on your genitals.

886
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,480
Food spills and splashes and knife bounces.

887
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,520
It is an invincible fabric that will stop eight bullets.

888
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,520
It is the golden fleece, except it's blue.

889
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,560
It's also an apron.

890
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,840
No, it's a food box.

891
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,560
It's a food box full of ingredients that they send to you

892
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,880
and then you, I guess, get the ingredient.

893
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,120
It says right here you get the ingredients super hot

894
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,560
and make them touch and then they turn into sauces

895
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,800
and cooked meals and stuff.

896
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,640
And then you taste them and they're really good.

897
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,200
It's less than $10 per person per meal

898
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,440
and they deliver seasonal recipes

899
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,880
along with pre-portioned ingredients

900
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
that you can use to put them together

901
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,920
and make them touch and hot

902
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
and then they turn into delicious home cooked meals.

903
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,360
And you can choose from a variety of recipes

904
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,960
based on what your diet is

905
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,200
and there's new ones all the time so you don't get bored.

906
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,520
Some of them include beef teriyaki stir fry

907
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
with sugar snap peas and lime rice,

908
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,720
baked spinach and egg flatbread

909
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,240
with sauteed asparagus and lemon aioli,

910
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,760
three cheese baby broccoli stromboli

911
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,920
with tomato and oregano dipping sauce.

912
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,720
They're all really good.

913
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
You can check out this week's menu

914
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,360

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,440
You eat these meals and you'll be able to think faster

918
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,640
and use the computer faster,

919
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,400
move stuff with your mind like Lucy.

920
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,840
We got some Jumbotrons.

921
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,280
This one is for Teagan

922
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,440
and it's from Sarah who specifies not that Teagan and Sarah.

923
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,920
Which, how do you know what Teagan and Sarah

924
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,640
I was thinking of?

925
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,040
Yeah, I wasn't thinking of the band.

926
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,240
I might've been thinking of you.

927
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,960
You don't know.

928
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,520
I was thinking of you and now I feel weird

929
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,920
because now I think maybe you are the band.

930
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm so confused.

931
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,600
Okay, anyways, Teagan says,

932
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,760
no, Sarah says to Teagan,

933
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
I'm so happy to spend our four year anniversary

934
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,560
slash Christmas 2016

935
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,240
slash our May birthday

936
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,080
slash our five year anniversary

937
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,640
slash Christmas 2017 with you.

938
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,760
Nice.

939
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
You are so amazing and brave

940
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
for transitioning into the woman you are.

941
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,840
Brothers, you good, good boys

942
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,000
make us laugh ourselves silly.

943
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Please tell my girlfriend to stop being

944
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,240
so silly and cute and amazing.

945
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,840
I can't handle it.

946
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,760
That was for either May or December.

947
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,920
Teagan, cut it out.

948
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,520
Teagan, fucking stop it.

949
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
Yeah, what are you trying to prove?

950
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,040
I get it.

951
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,440
You're cute.

952
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,920
You're amazing.

953
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,040
You're amazing, all right?

954
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,160
Teagan, yes, you're very brave and awesome and radical.

955
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,200
But Sarah's sick of it.

956
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,200
Sarah's sick of your shit.

957
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,160
Your adorable shit.

958
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,400
Be normal like us.

959
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,160
We're not cute at all.

960
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,640
Lower yourselves to Arvar.

961
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,120
I have a message for my hobbit boyfriend, Dave.

962
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,680
And it's from your goblin boyfriend, Alex.

963
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
Oops, this isn't the adventure zone.

964
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Anyway, happy 12 year anniversary.

965
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,840
Whoa, congratulations, Dave and Alex.

966
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
If teenage us knew we'd stay together

967
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,360
and still be enjoying D&D, sports, anime, and Pokemon,

968
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,160
well, I think they'd be kind of horrified, actually.

969
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,200
But adult me couldn't be happier to be living my life with you,

970
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
you wonderful weirdo and sweet cinnamon roll.

971
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,400
I love you.

972
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,520
Aw, that's adorable.

973
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,920
Man, two adorable messages.

974
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,880
Very nice.

975
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,240
I feel very fortunate.

976
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,120
So, happy anniversary to Dave.

977
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,040
To Dave and Alex.

978
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,000
Takes two to tango.

979
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,640
I wish we'd known.

980
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,360
That's awesome, y'all.

981
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,240
I wish we'd known things were gonna get so fucking charming

982
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,200
here in the mind zone.

983
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,960
And then maybe we wouldn't have spent 20 minutes

984
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,480
talking about Dom jeans.

985
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,640
Like I think it detracted,

986
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,040
like this could have been our 500 days of summer episode,

987
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,400
but instead it's sort of a weird like grind house style.

988
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,200
Like it starts out like really raunchy and raw

989
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,480
and a lot of talking about blue jean friction against a wiener

990
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,680
and then it does get like really, really, really cute.

991
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,360
Who knows what the third act will contain?

992
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,160
Let's find out.

993
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,920
I'm Hal Loveland.

994
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm Danielle Radford.

995
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,840
I am Michael Eagle.

996
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,440
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

997
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,200
Maximum Fund's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

998
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,800
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks,

999
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,040
the women's revolution, Sasha Banks,

1000
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,520
the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

1001
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,840
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

1002
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

1003
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,680
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

1004
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,120
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

1005
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,000
New episodes Thursdays on Maximum Fund

1006
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
or wherever you get your podcasts.

1007
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,440
Oh yeah, dig it.

1008
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,360
Here is a question.

1009
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,440
I'm a regular at a local thought.

1010
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,960
Oh, okay, okay.

1011
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
How did you do this bad?

1012
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm so sorry.

1013
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,360
Oh, we've done it.

1014
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,640
Say it good.

1015
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:30,960
Say it.

1016
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,680
Say it good.

1017
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,960
Prove that you can to me and yourself.

1018
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,880
Okay, here we go.

1019
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm a regular at a local Thai restaurant.

1020
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,440
Okay, now that we know,

1021
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,960
now that the prestige has been revealed,

1022
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,960
you gotta understand,

1023
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,200
Justin knows about Thai,

1024
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,240
but he also reads one letter at a time sometimes.

1025
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,880
He just like runs through a sentence a letter at a time

1026
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,200
and just kind of explores the words

1027
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,800
at the same time as you hear them.

1028
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,320
It's really a fun way to do it.

1029
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Whenever you all are ready for the throne,

1030
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,360
if you wanna come at the king,

1031
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,960
come take it.

1032
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,720
Come take this throne from me.

1033
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,560
It's not a throne, it's a job.

1034
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,840
And we all have different jobs.

1035
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,960
Justin, it's pronounced drone.

1036
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,480
Okay.

1037
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,600
I'm a regular at a local restaurant.

1038
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,600
What's the sort of genre of restaurant?

1039
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,640
Thai, it's a type of Asian cuisine, Thai.

1040
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
Whenever I overhear another patron

1041
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,000
ask the wait staff for recommendations,

1042
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,920
I fight the urge to rush over to their table.

1043
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,960
You know what I'm gonna do?

1044
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,600
Actually right now,

1045
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,640
and I think this is a big moment for our show

1046
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,080
and for me as a human being,

1047
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,680
I have to increase the text size.

1048
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,800
I think that that's the problem.

1049
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,920
Jesus God.

1050
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,960
The text isn't big enough.

1051
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,160
What were you at before?

1052
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,280
Like 12?

1053
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,880
And now you're bumping up to 14?

1054
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,960
Just like regular and then I'm-

1055
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,080
Do you need to get some readers?

1056
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,480
Maybe I need some readers.

1057
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:56,880
Oh, you know what?

1058
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,520
This is nice.

1059
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,080
I did it too.

1060
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,200
This is nice.

1061
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,840
It's nice, right?

1062
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,800
It's a lot easier to read.

1063
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,280
I should have been doing this a long time ago.

1064
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,920
So I'm a regular at a local Thai restaurant.

1065
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,520
Whenever I overhear another patron

1066
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,200
ask the wait staff for recommendations,

1067
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
I fight the urge to rush over to their table

1068
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,280
and provide them with my favorites.

1069
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,040
Should I continue to resist this urge

1070
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,640
or should I tell them what's good?

1071
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,480
That's from The Red Curry is Delicious

1072
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,520
in Cleveland, Ohio.

1073
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,680
Yeah, you should keep fighting this one.

1074
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,480
Yeah.

1075
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,520
I think on this one,

1076
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,120
that's a battle worth fighting.

1077
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,040
Yeah, so this is a hill you gotta die on,

1078
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,560
I think maybe even a little bit.

1079
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,160
To continue to not do this thing is the most you can-

1080
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,680
I can't-

1081
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,480
I can maybe count the number of times

1082
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,360
where I have wanted this service on one finger,

1083
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,200
and it was when I was in another country

1084
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,440
where I didn't speak the language even a little bit.

1085
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,200
Well, could I have used a little bit of help

1086
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,960
from a stranger friend?

1087
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,520
Otherwise, I think I'm good.

1088
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,400
I think I'm good here, I think.

1089
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,440
Especially since,

1090
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,440
and I don't mean to point out the obvious here,

1091
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,120
they are talking to an employee of that restaurant

1092
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,400
when they ask the question.

1093
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,440
Right.

1094
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,960
And it's their job to answer that question.

1095
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,480
So I think it might be covered.

1096
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,440
So I think that resisting that impulse is good.

1097
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,280
Now, that said, what you should do

1098
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,920
is when the wait staff makes a recommendation,

1099
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,400
just chuckle to yourself and shake your head no.

1100
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,200
Like,

1101
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,360
all right, that's totally cool.

1102
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,160
There's nothing wrong with it.

1103
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,000
And then, it's important you follow that up

1104
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,760
with when you get your red curry,

1105
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,360
you eat it and you're just like,

1106
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,240
oh, balls, I'm loving it.

1107
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,400
I'm loving it, yummy, yum, yum, yum, red curry.

1108
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,920
I'll have what I'm having.

1109
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,720
I feel like I feel when I have sex sometimes

1110
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,960
at the end of it, you know what it's called.

1111
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,440
I don't.

1112
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,360
At the end of the meal,

1113
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,120
save one spoonful of your red curry

1114
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,480
as you're walking out the door,

1115
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,240
slip the spoon into the person's mouth

1116
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,360
and whisper in their ear,

1117
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,520
you fucked up, and then walk out.

1118
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,800
While they're talking.

1119
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,680
So it's just like, yeah,

1120
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,280
so Jeremy walks out of the break room

1121
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,080
and I'm like, I fucked up.

1122
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,680
That was amazing.

1123
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,400
What have I done?

1124
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,480
Got these stupid noodles, fuck.

1125
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,480
And they just hand him a piece of paper

1126
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,160
with a black spot on it and they'll know.

1127
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,440
They'll know.

1128
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,520
It's with a bloody handprint.

1129
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
They know, but it's not blood.

1130
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,320
It's red curry.

1131
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,480
I should have got what he said.

1132
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,120
He said he came when he ate this.

1133
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,920
It made him feel like sex time.

1134
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,600
That's what he said.

1135
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,560
That's what he said.

1136
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,200
How are your pad thai?

1137
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,920
It was pretty good.

1138
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,240
I definitely didn't cum like that dude,

1139
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,120
which is like, shoot.

1140
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,480
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1141
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,440
I gotta go, but it's lunch.

1142
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,160
I gotta go back to work.

1143
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,840
I can't go back to work with creamy Dom jeans,

1144
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,720
but shoot, it sounds like it was a revelation.

1145
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,120
Damn it.

1146
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,560
Damn.

1147
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,040
Wish she'd said something before.

1148
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,840
Is there any, let me ask you boys this.

1149
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,680
Is there, you've made your feelings clear

1150
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,320
about receiving the service in a restaurant.

1151
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,920
I think the problem, and stop me if I'm out of line,

1152
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,520
but I think the problem with doing this in a restaurant

1153
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,200
is that, and it's odd if you think about it,

1154
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,320
but when we have tables at a place,

1155
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,880
we all feel like that's our sort of island.

1156
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,960
That's our, like the other tables aren't there

1157
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,480
and we're all pretending that there aren't tables,

1158
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,400
but like, this is our territory.

1159
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,600
Like we've staked this out.

1160
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,120
You don't do that at Best Buy.

1161
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,520
If someone crosses your path when you're looking at TVs

1162
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,040
to also look at TVs,

1163
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,360
you don't get like weirdly territorial about it.

1164
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,560
It's just as the restaurant,

1165
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,120
you feel like you're renting that space for that moment,

1166
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,360
which is why I don't approve of community tables,

1167
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:37,840
by the way.

1168
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,720
Thank you.

1169
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,160
Thank you very much.

1170
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,640
No, thanks.

1171
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,920
But here's my question.

1172
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,240
Is there a business in which you would appreciate this service?

1173
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,040
Is there a business in which you would want someone

1174
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,120
to just kind of swoop in and drop some some records?

1175
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,920
You know, J-Man, to that point, no joke,

1176
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,000
if it was a counter service thing,

1177
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,120
because Teresa and I, when we went to Scotland,

1178
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,760
once again, different country, not quite the same.

1179
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,800
We do speak the language, but standing at the counter,

1180
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,640
first day there, wasn't sure like what to do,

1181
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,720
what social customs were different.

1182
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,640
Very nice, slightly older than us couple,

1183
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,320
kind of saw our hesitation was like,

1184
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,280
is this your first time here?

1185
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,760
And we're like, yeah.

1186
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,520
I'm like, all right, here's what you need to do.

1187
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,000
And they walked us through like where to go to order

1188
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,920
and like what drinks we should try.

1189
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,040
And that was very helpful.

1190
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,720
So counter service?

1191
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,640
Don't ever walk up to somebody's table.

1192
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,840
I think you are right.

1193
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,920
But if you see someone standing on a counter going,

1194
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,360
I just don't know what to get.

1195
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,360
I think then you can make the reckon.

1196
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,000
Keep walking.

1197
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,040
Yeah, it only happened to me once.

1198
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,080
It was also an older couple when we were in Tokyo.

1199
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,400
We were in this like huge food mall that was like underground.

1200
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,400
I'm making it sound like it was a cave.

1201
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,040
It was just like in the basement of like a shopping mall

1202
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,600
or whatever.

1203
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,360
And there were like a billion food options and this older

1204
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,800
couple was like, you want this?

1205
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,160
And we were like, all right.

1206
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,080
And we did want this very much.

1207
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,480
And they talked about how much it made them come over and over

1208
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,360
and over and over and over and over and over again.

1209
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,280
I went to this new Brazilian steakhouse that got in Charleston

1210
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,520
and I've never been to a restaurant like that before.

1211
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,800
And there were definitely some like I didn't,

1212
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,560
it was terrifying because I didn't,

1213
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,680
the person gave me a list of meat and then left and didn't

1214
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,800
come back to tell me what, ask what meat I wanted.

1215
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,600
Irresponsible.

1216
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,440
And I waited and waited and waited and just sort of like

1217
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,280
looked sadly as people were getting meat and we weren't.

1218
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,960
And it turned out there was this like device.

1219
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,240
There was a device on the table that indicated whether or not

1220
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,120
we were ready for meat.

1221
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,080
And that information was not relayed to me, by the way,

1222
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,440
which seems to me the biggest faux pas you could make in this

1223
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,360
venue because like, that's how I get it.

1224
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,400
Why didn't you tell me that?

1225
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,320
Every time I go somewhere new, I am terrified that I will

1226
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,720
misunderstand a fundamental process that exists in that place.

1227
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,720
Like I'll sit down at a table and it's like, no, no,

1228
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,360
you order from the bar or I'll go to the bar and they're like,

1229
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,760
we have servers, just go sit down at the table.

1230
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,040
So I would say in that circumstance, having like,

1231
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,000
if you see somebody like milling around and doing that thing

1232
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,680
that we humans do when we're really feeling dumb of that,

1233
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,640
like kind of body posture.

1234
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,320
I think in that circumstance, if you want to be like,

1235
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,440
oh yeah, you just sit down and come right to the table and

1236
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,760
you just flip it over so that it's green on top and then

1237
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,800
they know you want meat.

1238
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,400
I think that's totally cool.

1239
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,920
And in fact, when people do that for me, I feel like they're

1240
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,400
angels sent from God.

1241
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,200
And that's Roma Downey just like, Travis, you feel very

1242
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,000
stupid in this moment.

1243
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,040
I'm like, I do, Roma Downey.

1244
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,920
Thank you very much.

1245
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,960
And she's like, oh, you just put your money, you pay right

1246
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,600
up there at the front.

1247
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,040
I'm like, oh, Roma Downey, thanks so much.

1248
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,840
Good Roma.

1249
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,400
Hey, thanks.

1250
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,200
It's a good Roma.

1251
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,840
Killer Roma.

1252
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,640
Well, what I do when I do assets is I just mumble a lot.

1253
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,680
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski, riding high.

1254
00:51:59,680 --> 00:51:59,920
Thank you.

1255
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920
Climbing that ladder and riding high on it.

1256
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,720
Thank you, Zoe Kinski.

1257
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,240
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1258
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,240
Victoria Sparta, who asks, need help ASAP?

1259
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,080
My rear end is glued to my office chair due to a

1260
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,960
super glue prank.

1261
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,260
Yes.

1262
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,600
Yes.

1263
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,240
Not.

1264
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,040
Yes.

1265
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,720
Justin, how could you?

1266
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,520
I didn't.

1267
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:19,920
Yes.

1268
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,880
It didn't happen.

1269
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,520
Give me this.

1270
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,640
Let me read to you.

1271
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,960
And you're going to feel like a real jag.

1272
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,080
Didn't happen.

1273
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,240
A real judge advocate general for your doubting, because the

1274
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,800
extra details I think are going to satisfy you.

1275
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,040
Yes, my butt right now glued to the office chair.

1276
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,840
My fiance and I have a prank war going on right now.

1277
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,720
He got me good.

1278
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,360
I admit it.

1279
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,640
But I will get him back.

1280
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,200
So with the exception of nail polish remover, don't have any.

1281
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,520
What could unstick my skin from this chair?

1282
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,520
He coded the whole dang seat.

1283
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,160
Plus help.

1284
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,120
I'm honestly stuck to this chair right now.

1285
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,280
1100 exclamation points.

1286
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,000
Griffin.

1287
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,280
Wait, wait, wait.

1288
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,580
Skin?

1289
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,440
Travis, that is located in update six.

1290
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,880
The six codex.

1291
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,080
So I'll get there.

1292
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,640
Please help.

1293
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,480
I'm honestly stuck to this chair right now.

1294
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,720
Justin, you fucking doubting Thomas.

1295
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,120
I know this is the wrong section.

1296
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,120
This is in social science gender studies, but I know this

1297
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,480
section is active right now.

1298
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,520
Thus why I put it here.

1299
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,360
Because this is kind of a real time issue.

1300
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,400
Update.

1301
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,360
I wish I was kidding.

1302
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,440
He put super glue on my chair.

1303
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,080
Update two.

1304
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,760
We have a prank war going on.

1305
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,280
Thus, this is the current result.

1306
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:33,920
Update three.

1307
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,400
All right.

1308
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,560
I know y'all are used to weird questions from some people who

1309
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,600
are just bored and messing around.

1310
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,320
But sadly, this is not one of those questions, Justin.

1311
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,360
You piece of shit.

1312
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,680
This is no trolling or anything, Justin asshole.

1313
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,920
So my rear end is stuck to the chair.

1314
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,560
Update four, when I say office chair, I meant my home office

1315
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:48,800
chair.

1316
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,240
It's only me and him at the house.

1317
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,120
He's laughing his head off and refusing to help me.

1318
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,680
Update five.

1319
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,760
Let's just say I'm wearing a skirt.

1320
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,040
Hints answering I think why the skin is on the chair.

1321
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,680
Update six.

1322
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,520
Oh, I found my pocket knife on the desk.

1323
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,280
I hate to ruin a chair, but it looks like I have to cut the

1324
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
chair fabric in order to be able to get up and soak in the

1325
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,560
tub till the rest comes off.

1326
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,680
Man, this sucks.

1327
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,200
Balls.

1328
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,360
My skin's stuck to the chair.

1329
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,520
My fiance got me great.

1330
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,520
Now, but but I if you want you Travis, if what you have to

1331
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
say is not going to help this person out of this fucking

1332
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,640
horrible situation.

1333
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,000
I literally don't want to hear it.

1334
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,840
No, I actually don't want to hear it.

1335
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,920
I guess I just have two questions, they help me

1336
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,040
understand so that I can CSI the issue to figure out the

1337
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,000
solution.

1338
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,360
And that is question number one.

1339
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,480
I understand that this person says they're wearing a skirt.

1340
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,680
How much super glue was put onto this seat?

1341
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,920
Soaked through.

1342
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,720
Soaked all the way through.

1343
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,240
Second question.

1344
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,080
How I guess this is the most important question that I have.

1345
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:57,200
How quickly between application of super glue to seat and you

1346
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,920
sitting down.

1347
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,440
Did your fiance apply that super?

1348
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,840
Was it like they saw you going to sit down and we're like?

1349
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,880
Oh, that's true because it gets tacky real quick.

1350
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,380
Yeah.

1351
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,160
I mean, this whole thing's pretty tacky.

1352
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,240
This is a prank war they're embroiled in.

1353
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,280
They obviously know how to do this type of stuff.

1354
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,720
And Travis, that was a minute and a half where you could have

1355
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,920
said something to help this person out of time losses.

1356
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,360
But loss like this person is going to lose a lot of but

1357
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,880
matter at this point.

1358
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,560
Griffin, I don't think they are.

1359
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,720
I don't think this happened.

1360
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,600
I'm sorry.

1361
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,840
I'm so sorry, but there's six fucking updates.

1362
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,960
This couple loves each other so much and they definitely have

1363
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,680
a YouTube channel where they just sort of get each like they

1364
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,360
fucking just fucking get each other all the time.

1365
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,720
And this is the latest one.

1366
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,880
And I don't understand why you won't help this person out

1367
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,120
because it can be fun and flirty.

1368
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,640
This is my 50 shades.

1369
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,960
Your 50 shades is pranks.

1370
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,480
50 shades of pranks.

1371
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,200
I got you.

1372
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,800
I got you this time.

1373
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,440
I put a bucket of water up on the door sill and you open it

1374
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,640
up and you got splashed.

1375
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,440
Oh, yes.

1376
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,320
I put that you put the fucking sugar on your grapefruit to

1377
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,720
eat it for breakfast, but it was all salt.

1378
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,200
There's no milk.

1379
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,000
Wait, there is.

1380
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,240
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

1381
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,320
I want to play more in this space, though, closing the door

1382
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,520
to the playroom.

1383
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,840
Unfortunately, I'm going to stay in the playroom.

1384
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,520
We're going to be in two different rooms for the end of

1385
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,560
this fucking trap you in there with jokes.

1386
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,480
I'm going to go.

1387
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,200
I'm going to leave the area.

1388
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,560
I'm in the fucking playroom now.

1389
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,120
This is a thematically consistent episode, which I

1390
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:05,920
always really enjoy.

1391
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,640
I love this.

1392
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,960
And thank you for listening to our program to the second

1393
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,080
straight episode where Griffin is absent for the ending of it,

1394
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,160
which is unusual.

1395
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,400
But thank you for listening.

1396
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,800
Thank you to sorry.

1397
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,200
John Rodgers, the long winners for the use of theme song.

1398
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,000
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1399
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,160
Trav, were you going to say something?

1400
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,560
I was going to say thank you to our friends at Cirque du Soleil

1401
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,400
for acting as the go between the mediators between Griffin

1402
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,760
and Criss Angel so that Griffin could get his being back.

1403
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,560
I told a lot of really great jokes in the playroom when you

1404
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,200
guys weren't there.

1405
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,920
It's a shame.

1406
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,000
I should have brought my Mike jokes got to hear him.

1407
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,880
That's the important thing.

1408
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,800
If if you all can think of a collaboration we could do with

1409
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,120
Cirque, because I think they would love to work with us and

1410
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,560
we'd love to work with them.

1411
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,920
Are you talking about the Criss Angel?

1412
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,800
The Criss Angel tweet.

1413
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
I do want to say on the subject that I've had a lot of people

1414
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,160
when they saw that Cirque du Soleil really signal boosted

1415
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,760
sort of my whole drama.

1416
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,080
I did just want to say every night when I go to sleep, I just

1417
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,240
see one big eye and there's not really a traditional pupil in

1418
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,480
there.

1419
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,640
It's just sort of like a big like black hole.

1420
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,160
And I guess that is I like, I guess it is Criss and he's in

1421
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,040
there or whatever.

1422
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,080
Yeah.

1423
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,240
We we're going to oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, we're going

1424
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,720
to do you want to come see my brother, my brother and me or

1425
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,680
the Adventure Zone?

1426
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,440
Either one because we're going to be in San Diego during San

1427
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,720
Diego Comic Con doing a live show for both of those podcasts

1428
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,080
with those programs.

1429
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,800
My brother, my brother, me and the Adventure Zone.

1430
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,920
I have the details.

1431
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,400
Hold on.

1432
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,640
Also, I just want to say, if you're coming to Austin, hit us

1433
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,440
up with those bim bam questions, please.

1434
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,760
And yeah, I always think that's a lot.

1435
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,840
Always lots of yachts a lot.

1436
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,080
Who's for the for the live shows.

1437
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,080
So thank you to all my troopers out there.

1438
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,920
My street team.

1439
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:09,120
So the show is going to be where when the Balboa the Balboa.

1440
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:09,920
All right.

1441
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,960
I'll use that as a search term and I'll search Balboa and

1442
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:22,160
submissive and see what I turn up Balboa on Friday and

1443
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,680
Saturday night at 10 p.m.

1444
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,000
So Friday will be.

1445
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,480
Oh, my God.

1446
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,200
I believe the first one is Adventure Zone.

1447
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,080
Taz always first, because it makes me very scared to do that

1448
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,320
one.

1449
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,640
Yeah.

1450
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,640
So Taz on Friday, my bim bam on Saturday, 10 p.m.

1451
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,520
at the Balboa.

1452
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,600
Trav, are you going to make can you make links for tickets?

1453
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,400
Sure will.

1454
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,160
Call the shot.

1455
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,960
Call the shot now.

1456
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,360
We'll say Taz SDCC and MBMBAM.

1457
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:02,480
So bit.ly forward slash Taz SDCC and bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM

1458
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,240
SDCC all lowercase.

1459
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,640
Now, those tickets will go on sale if and if you you know,

1460
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,920
we're not joking when we say this.

1461
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,440
Tickets for our shows tend to sell out really quickly and we

1462
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,800
want everybody to be able to come on sales for both shows.

1463
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,120
We'll start at noon Pacific on Wednesday, May 17th.

1464
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,400
That's three p.m.

1465
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,440
Eastern Standard Time.

1466
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,560
Or is it EDT yet?

1467
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,360
No one quite knows.

1468
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,880
No one can keep those straight.

1469
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,320
But either way, it's it's noon Pacific, three p.m.

1470
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,280
Eastern, Wednesday, May 17th.

1471
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:45,840
And those links again, Travis, are bit.ly forward slash Taz SDCC

1472
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:51,200
and bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM SDCC.

1473
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,160
Okay, it's gonna be fun as fuck.

1474
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,360
Spider-Man's gonna be there.

1475
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,360
We invited him.

1476
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,440
We hope to get him out there.

1477
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,280
We're gonna have the trailer for Star Wars, episode four.

1478
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,760
We're gonna have that out.

1479
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,200
You'll be able to check that.

1480
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,360
If you know a famous person that's gonna be there, ask if

1481
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,040
they'll come to our show, please.

1482
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,400
What if we got that super old man that they let in all the

1483
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,600
comic movies for some reason who does the one line and he

1484
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,080
showed up and he said like something like he could walk on

1485
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,240
and he could be like a PA and like we wouldn't even make a

1486
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,520
big deal out of it.

1487
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,320
That'd be amazing.

1488
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,360
What's his deal?

1489
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:29,840
Like what?

1490
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,160
It's always like I think he's somebody's dad.

1491
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,840
I think he's Joss Whedon's dad or something.

1492
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,640
There he is again.

1493
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,400
There he is again.

1494
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,600
This time he's a janitor.

1495
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,280
You never know where you're gonna stay.

1496
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,640
I'm always it's hard for me to enjoy those movies anymore

1497
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,480
because like I just don't pay attention to the plot because

1498
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,120
I'm fucking just scouring the background looking for that

1499
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,400
like old guy.

1500
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,200
You know Griffin I actually read that they don't like cast

1501
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,480
him or schedule that or anything.

1502
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,560
He just keeps showing up and then when they go back for the

1503
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,040
edits it's like fuck there he is again.

1504
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,760
Get it again.

1505
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,200
That's sweet though.

1506
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,520
That's sweet though that they let him like be a part of it.

1507
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,240
Anyway come to those shows.

1508
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,800
Please get tickets when they go on sale so you don't miss out.

1509
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
We would love to see everybody there.

1510
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,880
I know there's a lot of things competing for your time there

1511
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,200
but hopefully like I don't know 10 p.m.

1512
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,960
So there's probably it's probably not open anymore.

1513
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,160
You can't go see Spider-Man.

1514
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,520
So might as well come see him at our show.

1515
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,480
Our show's at 10 p.m.?

1516
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:24,880
Yeah.

1517
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,680
Magic hour.

1518
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,320
Shit during STCC Griffin goes till like fucking four or five

1519
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:30,640
in the morning.

1520
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,160
Some people just don't sleep.

1521
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,960
That's midnight for me.

1522
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,760
My time zone and how I do things.

1523
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,360
It will be a very sleepy set.

1524
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,640
Nah it's gonna be a party set.

1525
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,200
No it's not.

1526
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,400
It's gonna be weird.

1527
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,440
It'll just get weirder.

1528
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,440
So come out and see those shows.

1529
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,440
And Griffin do you have a final Yahoo voice?

1530
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:47,920

1534
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,200
