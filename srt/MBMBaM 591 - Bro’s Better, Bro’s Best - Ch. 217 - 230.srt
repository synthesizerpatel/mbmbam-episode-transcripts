1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,500
It's better, it's better with you

9
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,060
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by Matt Estevez. Thank you, Matt. It's by yahoo answers user Yoville

10
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,220
posted in arts and humanities

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,340
history

12
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,940
Yoville asks, what are the ranks in the Illuminati?

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
Name all of the ranks or anything

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,520
They name all of the ranks or anything they use to describe theirself as

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,900
Well, there's the Bluebirds and the Cardinals and the Bluebirds are the more advanced Illuminati and the Cardinals are the ones that need

16
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,560
some help

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,640
Is that some red wall shit? No, it's like a that's like elementary school stuff. I

18
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,720
I think that if anyone answers this question, then they're not Illuminati

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,500
Because they would know better than yeah, because they would know better than to reveal the secrets

20
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,320
Let me bounce something that yahoo answers user armor

21
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,760
armor world

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Responded with very helpful stuff from wrong

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,720
They said the leader of the Earth's Illuminati. So that's a pretty fucking crazy six words right there

24
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,520
The leader of the Earth's Illuminati is called the Pindar

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,400
Cool, the Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling Illuminati families and is always male. That's kind of fucked up

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
but

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
It's 2014

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,880
But really now there's probably a good reason for that in this next sentence

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,080
The title Pindar is an abbreviated term for pinnacle of the Draco

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,560
Also known as the penis of the dragon. Ah, I was so hoping that's what it would be

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,080
The penis of the dragon is probably my favorite Stephen King book

32
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:04,000
He doesn't get a lot of credit, but I'm deeply into it. Yeah. All hail me the penis of the dragon

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Why are you giggling? Why are you all giggling? You're the worst Illuminati Scott

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Scott

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,800
Scott Illuminati

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,520
Scott Illuminati, I hear you giggling underneath your innate mask

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,640
It must be so frustrating to be a member of the Illuminati as everybody is like just spreading out this shit and you want to say

38
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,280
Like hey, that's not true. That's not how it's work. It's gooch of the dragon

39
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm the goochess, but you I am the goochess of Earth's Illuminati

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,280
Wouldn't it be hard to be the penis of the dragon and then somebody cuts in line in front of you at the Chinese buffet

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,280
And you're like cuz they want the last the coconut shrimp and you're like

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,980
Hey

43
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,720
You better not do that and they look at you why and you got and you just have to stare at the floor

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,580
It's like I can't I never mind, but you better not do it. I'm the penis

45
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,240
I'm the enus pay of the agandre

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,100
Just pay you just make a triangle with your fingers

47
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Get it get it and then you put that triangle close to your crotch to make it look like a penis tip

48
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
And then you flap your wings like a dragon

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,440
The shrimp is yours you win I'm leaving

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,320
There do have to be like certain levels of

51
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Illuminati you can't just start as like full-fledged like on the the council Illuminati

52
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
You've got to start as like junior Illuminati, right?

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,280
I think there's a sure-fire like I don't know how anybody finds out about it

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,080
But I've seen the yahoo's that drew Davenport since in if that cat has not found how to get into the Illuminati yet

55
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,360
I don't think anybody ever well, yeah, it seems like he probably would have unearthed it by now

56
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,580
Well, but how are you just are you suggesting Travis that maybe there's like an Illuminati Awana's program?

57
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
Illuminati

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,880
Brownies or something. Yeah, like you're a Cub Scout Illuminati, you know, you start you're making Pinewood Derby first

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,080
And then ten years later, you're ruling the world. You're controlling all the bank cartels and shit

60
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,640
Yeah

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,320
They're not just gonna like first day Illuminati hand you the reins to the American government

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,460
Yeah, I won't even admit that you're in it

63
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,720
First you gotta be really careful. They want to admit the Illuminati existence

64
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,360
So you're a couple ranks in sometimes it's just people trying to trick you out of your rent money

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,360
So wait, am I in the Illuminati or not? Well, I guess

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,880
Six months in it's like hey, you didn't show up to our bowling game on Tuesday

67
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,720
Oh, so it is a bowling league fuck guess wrong again shit

68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
Do you think when you start off in the Illuminati?

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,280
They let you like control a student government and I just see how you do it

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,400
The first the first thing you control is is a fantasy football

71
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,600
That's where you start in the Illuminati, but no one can know about it

72
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,780
My name is Scott Jenkins and I'm running for Huntington High School's tip of the Dragon Penis

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Just a tip please vote Scott

74
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm gonna sort down the lunch signs on Taco Tuesday vote for me for Dragon Penis

75
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
I

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,420
Seen you run in the halls. I have cameras everywhere

77
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,480
Scott the principal comes to him in a robe. Tell me what to do

78
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Milkshake machine

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,840
It's really the final level of adulthood and

80
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,920
You you may think that you are ready for it when when you actually buy a house

81
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,240
You are not ready for it because it's still very bizarre to me that there are whole areas in my house

82
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,160
If I open a door to them and I look at them

83
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,760
I don't know what they do like I don't know what they are or like why they are I had a thing

84
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,200
Do you live in the Winchester house? What are you talking about? No open a door to a closet. You're like, what is this?

85
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,920
No, I'm talking. Okay. I'll give you an example a couple weeks ago

86
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
I went down to turn the furnace on for the first time

87
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,960
I guess it would have been a month or so ago now

88
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,760
I go down and turn the furnace on for the first time and I see this thing called that

89
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,160
There's like a humidifier that sort of like built into

90
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,760
The system there that like as far as I know I've never used and I was like, whoa

91
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,960
I could be having more humid air this whole time, but I didn't really know how it works. I kind of turned some things and

92
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,640
Open a valve and did all that kind of business and I was like, hmm. Okay humidity

93
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh boy, I go down three days later

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,960
My basement carpet is fucking soaked like literally standing water in my basement carpet water

95
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,740
Everywhere because this thing just apparently it's like humidifying GM is just spitting water randomly. Yeah, so I've ruined my house

96
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,200
So you just boarded up the basement and you call that one. I don't yeah, I don't have that

97
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
It really is a weird island

98
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,400
It really is weird like how many times have you been in your attic Justin?

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,620
Twice a year once to get the Christmas lights out and once to put them back. Okay, I've been in our attic twice

100
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,040
once when we like right when we moved in and then

101
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,960
Again, when our HVAC unit up there stopped working and that was after that

102
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,480
We had roofers come and replace every single shingle on our roof a month after we moved in home ownership fucking rules you guys

103
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,840
And I realized that in nailing those new shingles in they had turned our attic

104
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,920
into a fucking hellraiser pain box

105
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
because there are

106
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,560
Infinity nails coming through the ceiling. It's like it's like a goddamn Iron Maiden up there

107
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,000
So no, I don't think I don't think I will ever be going into that room again. Thanks

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,160
What on earth were you planning to do about your broken HVAC unit when you went up there?

109
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:02,080
I thought I got what was your did you think there would be a switch that said broken and you would just flip it to?

110
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,920
Fixed like is that is that what you were hoping for? He was gonna reason with it. I went up there

111
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,180
I was using my phone's flashlight and I had a fucking hex wrench from an Ikea cabinet. I had bought and so

112
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,000
Ready to do battle with it like seeing what I could do up just surveying the you know what?

113
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,660
Yeah, honey. I tightened a couple of hex bolts and it started working again. Apparently just all the hex bolts were loose

114
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,880
You're laughing. I used that fucking hex wrench to fix our garbage disposal. So you don't know anything about shit, dude

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,560
It's it is the universal nano tool

116
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,360
Um, what is it? What is this where does it need to know before they get a house?

117
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,460
You don't know you real please realize like you don't know

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,920
Be be prepared to be reverted to like baby state especially with like buying a house that process is in

119
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,280
Scrutable I still don't know if I bought this house our realtor. No one's got rid of me yet

120
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,920
Our realtor would just come to us. I can't eat $300 for the

121
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,760
I bet yep. Here you go. Take it. It's yours now. I never had that money

122
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,160
I guess were you buying the house from the ancient ones? Yeah, it was a deep tongue. I

123
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,440
Hear that it's a really I got a really great deal on this house

124
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,040
But except for that though walls are full of rats. Yeah, and the seeping floors there this floor sir. Well, that's Justin's

125
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,740
Oh, yeah

126
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,920
Justin has I would say from my money like I'm so happy being a renter like Teresa and I have have often considered

127
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,840
Homeownership, but like I don't know

128
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,440
I think what's always scared me most about is that like the permanence and I know you can always sell your house

129
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
But in this market, it seems like such a

130
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,440
Market the problem with renting is you just put your money into a shitter and you're shitting on it

131
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
And then you're flushing it. It's it's insult to injury. How are you paying your rent? Huh?

132
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,320
Is that how you were paying your rent? I pay it to my landlord. Mr. Toilet

133
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
I

134
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,880
Yeah, it's it's an investment Travis in yourself and your family I

135
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,440
Had a baby this summer so I spent the entirety of nature's bounty of sunlight watching

136
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,880
Canadian Dragon's Den on YouTube watching need to tell me now what that I mean different had the baby not been present

137
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,080
What what yeah, you would have watched American Dragon's Den now I went because we both would have been drunk

138
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,240
That would have been different now. Only one of you can be drunk at a time. You got a tag-team it

139
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,600
Is that how I actually watched all eight seasons? Holy Canadian Dragon's Den on youth. They're all on YouTube

140
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,160
Here's the weirdest thing. There's one episode where it is inexplicably

141
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,560
The only version of this one episode on YouTube is tilted 45 degrees

142
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,920
so

143
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,400
The whole episode is that it's 45 degree tilt and damned if we didn't sit there

144
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,560
With our heads slightly askew and watch that you got it. Yeah, you don't want to miss an episode

145
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,560
You'll be you'll be lost. You just got to make sure you don't get taco neck syndrome

146
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
James asks

147
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,640
Interview at McDonald's should I eat there before?

148
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,200
So I've got an interview at McDonald's and I've been craving a Big Mac for a while

149
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,800
Will it look good or bad if I buy one right before I have my interview or right after I?

150
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,240
Think you're missing the obvious and it's during

151
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,520
Well, you don't yeah, you keep asking questions. I'm gonna get in on this Big Mac

152
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,760
You purchase it and then you take it into the interview is what you're saying. This is what you're suggesting

153
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,720
Yeah in your pocket, and then you do like a dear mind. I'm now I'm now I'm now I'm now I'm now

154
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,880
Or right after I think right after sends a very good signal where you're like, well, I think this went well so well

155
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,120
In fact, I gotta get those two all-beef patties special sauces cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun

156
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,440
Thank you very much. Say I think it'll be the first of many. Mm-hmm that you will get me for free for working here

157
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,240
It's actually a free food working at McDonald's. Do you think you have to you have to right?

158
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,160
You get the leftover burgers and fries at the end of the night the leftover burgers and they may have the orbit

159
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,520
They throw them in like a grocery bag, but they make them the order cheese. Oh sure. Sure. They do Griffin

160
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
Thanks for buying into the hype

161
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
But that's the thing I think you eat it

162
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,240
Beforehand and you just make the person who's about to interview you watch you eat it to show you what a good burger

163
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,840
Bull you are and watch you enjoy it. Hmm. Oh, yeah dripped on my shirt. I don't care. I

164
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,360
Can't help but notice you got a little bit of dribble on your shirt there. Yeah, there's a good reason for that

165
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Your burgers are fucking delicious

166
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,080
Can you?

167
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Buy two Big Macs

168
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,600
beforehand

169
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,120
Set them at a table and then like once your manager arrived like the manager arrives you lead him to that table like oh look

170
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Look what we have here

171
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,400
This can be like why that but what have we found and then see if he'll eat it because I've always been curious

172
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,960
I

173
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,320
Can you roll up with a Big Mac and then hold it in front of the person who's interviewing you and just tear it in half

174
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,920
No, I killed one one down right guys, I'll fucking kill every Big Mac in this place

175
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,020
What if okay, okay don't have a Big Mac during your interview

176
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:31,900
You want to prove something eat like a record number of Big Macs

177
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:39,220
half him join you at a table with like 20 big and try to set a Big Mac eating world record as

178
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:46,100
You conduct the interview see now Justin I thought you were gonna say sit down with a bag open up pull out a Whopper

179
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,340
That's what I meant to say, but I said Big Mac the whole time Burger King does the Whoppers, right? Yes

180
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,540
I fucked that whole thing up. Oh, you thought it was

181
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,460
I

182
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,940
Fucked that whole sentence up when I saw my go to Burger King you get a Whopper and bring it back and you tear it in

183
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,900
Half in front of everybody to say I've sacrificed one

184
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,540
This is the sacrifice this McDonald's demanded. I don't eat a lot of fast food. You guys eat mostly ancient grains. Let me

185
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,420
think something that would make a pretty good impression if you're interviewing to be like a

186
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,060
Fry cook and McDonald's is tell them how you would do things differently

187
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,460
Oh, I think you should tell them like how you would spice up the burgers differently or some

188
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,100
Throw in some black bean burgers bring in a big like gallon bag of likes your special spices

189
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
It's your current product

190
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,780
Pull an avocado out of your pocket. I want you to taste this burger

191
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,600
I just bought this from your from from the line now. I want you to try this burger. I made you like that

192
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,380
It did take me two and a half hours to make so slow down production

193
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,720
We just wrote good burger

194
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:17,120
If you put three brothers in front of typewriters for all of eternity one of them will eventually write good burger

195
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,680
That's the law of large numbers. Oh

196
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:30,360
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling game recognized game. Thank you. Rachel. It's by Yahoo answers user Brian who asks

197
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Why is peepaw so rude

198
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,040
So today I was at my peepaw's household and he sneezed in my face

199
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,280
It's really good then laughed about it

200
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,260
Yeah, he's always doing rude things like this and tripping me and my boyfriend when we walk by and spitting on my ferret

201
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,360
The other day he even picked his nose and wiped his booger on my clothes

202
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Travis Patrick McElroy

203
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,560
These are solid. How can we get him to stop being so rude?

204
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,960
Why?

205
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,780
Spitting on the ferret is out of control. That's some next-level rude grandpa technique

206
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,400
You think your grandpa's rude talking about the war and and just incessantly and talking about his friends and their sacrifices

207
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,200
So rude, my grandpa spits on my ferret. Fuck you. You don't know shit

208
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I

209
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,560
These are all good goofs if I was like this happen, I would I would lose it

210
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,460
Why is this ferret caked in grandpa's pit? I'll tell you why it's good. My jeeps. I I if if I

211
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,840
God willing live to an elderly age. I'm doing this. I'm hitting that power in a heartbeat mores out the window

212
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,520
What are you gonna say? But like this is your kin

213
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,400
Yeah

214
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
Shouldn't you be nice to your to your kin? Don't you want them to remember you?

215
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,240
I know how angry I am at people who are younger than me now

216
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:08,380
Oh, I can only imagine that's gonna be compounded in the intervening decades. Yeah, don't even be young around me. I

217
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Live in an apartment

218
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
with a share

219
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,660
Not enough with a shared quite operated laundry unit the washing machine takes 40 minutes the dryer takes one hour

220
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:30,040
I know this because if you don't set timers and come and get your laundry nice and quick and unknown assailant steals

221
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,420
You come back a couple hours later and the clothes are on the floor in the sink or even the garbage. They're just gone

222
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,060
Other residents have complained about the same thing and having bleach thrown on their drying towels help brothers

223
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,380
What can I do to bring this full of justice and protect my stuff?

224
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,200
It's happened three times now and I'm very low on underwear. That's swing through me on these just real quick

225
00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:01,180
Yeah, that's from got got done down got got done down under I guess. Yeah, you got it

226
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
Got it one. Um

227
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,180
Sounds to me like you got yourself a laundry Krampus on your hands. Mm-hmm

228
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,640
I've been watching a lot of leverage recently and I think you just need to set up an elaborate con

229
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,500
Well, it's gonna have to be a fucking super elaborate con to catch a Krampus. That's great. Yeah, I

230
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,940
Missed that show to catch a Krampus

231
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,420
It was doing such good work

232
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:33,780
You know getting a Krampus. I mean it was too many crap. It was Krampus entrapment and and it's hard to argue that in court

233
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
but

234
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,480
But they were doing the Lord's work. What kind of weird dude is like, okay

235
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,380
I just saw someone take your laundry in I'm gonna go through bleach on their towels

236
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
That's the only way I can feel

237
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,140
I

238
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Did I used to live in an apartment?

239
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,700
Where everybody kept their detergent?

240
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,140
in the lunchroom

241
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,340
And I so you never had to buy and I did not buy detergent

242
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:06,100
I look around the room look around the room. If you don't see a Krampus you are the Krampus

243
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
Don't don't pick and choose

244
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,860
Adult the lifeblood that you drain out of us. We're giving you food

245
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,260
Eat where you your three-headed giving tree. Mm-hmm. And now that we're just a stump you're gonna sit on us

246
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,340
We also have three butts

247
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,420
That's not important to this story. Why would you need to make that? Why would you need to specify?

248
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
I'm just trying to clarify the mental picture

249
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,820
Giving the tree didn't have one but Travis wait, wait, wait, how do you know that Griffin?

250
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:43,620
Cuz I asked the office I'm gonna think about the fact that giving tree had a but I have read every piece of

251
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,660
Giving tree slash fiction that exists that probably exists, doesn't it? Mm-hmm the giving and taking tree

252
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Hachi-machi

253
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Yep

254
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
Okay, Trav you did some some weird

255
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,620
So weird copy positive here my friend

256
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,060
Stump knots and bumps and dents it is it is all

257
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,060
sap and

258
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,420
Ruination no, no, no, no turn it off

259
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:39,820
A slice is just a sample. Isn't it better just to know how it's affecting me

260
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:46,420
I'm glad Gervin take this hit no reason no need to ruin it for all no

261
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:54,500
This is this is oh, this is a legal your friend is absorbing all of this like John coffee from the green

262
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Fuck me. Oh

263
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,420
My god and it ends with okay

264
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,100
There's it's extremely explicit and it is but it ends the way I think the book should end

265
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,460
This is the last sentence and this is actually kind of beautiful the shit before it

266
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:24,180
Decidedly not beautiful the boy laid down and wrapped himself around his childhood friend and love of his life

267
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:31,940
Ah with one final sigh of contentment gross and a smile on his face. The boy closed his tired old eyes for the last time

268
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:38,140
Oh, he dies on the tree that he just fucked with a huge boner and was fucked by

269
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,940
Thank-you-giving tree slash fiction

270
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
tree to death

271
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Did he is this his last

272
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,620
Last action

273
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:58,060
Author's note author's note to enhance your reading experience of my tale of love and reconciliation

274
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,740
I suggest that you listen to Jeff Buckley's hallelujah ball reading. Oh, I

275
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,500
Heard there was a secret tree that you could fuck

276
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,660
And all your childhood memories are dead

277
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:22,320
Brothers my boyfriend's mother recently learned she would be receiving a sizable inheritance. I think it's around 30k. God damn

278
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,960
Yeah, and has decided to spend it by taking my boyfriend myself her her other son her wife her a

279
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,160
Bunch of people on a big family vacation awesome

280
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
Except the last time I spoke to her

281
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,200
She was trying to devise between two possibilities the Grand Canyon and Hawaii now brothers

282
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm not an outdoor person. I have absolutely no interest in a Grand Canyon vacation

283
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,240
I would love to go to Hawaii, but I know that Hawaii would be

284
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,800
Significantly more expensive especially in terms of paying for my boyfriend and myself as we live on the East Coast and the flights will be twice

285
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,840
As much as for anyone else on the trip, would it be impolite to express my strong preference?

286
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:10,000
Should I let her take whatever vacation she prefers with her money and that's from craving beaches over canyons in Washington

287
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,840
This is a really good question. And I this is a great question

288
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,640
My first counter question is what is your problem with the Grand Canyon?

289
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,960
It rules. It's giant. It's made of rocks and I've never been there

290
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,160
But I imagine it would blow your tiny mind

291
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,760
Now Travis, I don't think you're the best person to weigh on on this question because if I remember correctly

292
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,040
You are the man who wouldn't drive four hours out of his way to see the Grand Canyon now to be fair Justin

293
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,840
I had a dog and a cat with me. It was the whole thing. It was gonna be a whole deal

294
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,560
We would have had to take them with us and it was like day seven of our cross-country

295
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:53,320
What is your problem with the Grand Canyon? It's a big hole. It's just a big hole. I

296
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,920
Maybe maybe fill up with water and let me swim in you lake and then we'll talk

297
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Can I Greg can use a shitty lake? It's a shitty dry

298
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,360
We've really turned around on the Grand Canyon since the beginning of this class

299
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,480
This is the very definition of a win-win scenario because if she chooses Hawaii

300
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
awesome, you are gonna have a

301
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,680
fucking

302
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Sitcom special episode and it's gonna be amazing and you're gonna love it

303
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,760
You're gonna be the best time ever go to the Grand Canyon gonna save a lot of money

304
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,880
Probably only to spend maybe five G's on that right getting there that leaves 25 G's of this inheritance left over

305
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,400
I have to be very delicate with my next few sentences because I don't want to implicate myself in anything

306
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,360
But as I see it if you want this inheritance to kick your way

307
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,720
you've got

308
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,640
Maybe six or seven people standing in the way and the Grand Canyon while a shitty lake got to be so careful

309
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
so carefully here

310
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Is

311
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,760
If

312
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,080
Things let me think Jesus Christ things that fall into it will pick up

313
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,320
Let's call it a fatal amount of inertia

314
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,560
Now I'm not saying anything about

315
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,440
Merit or most foul, but I am saying how quickly can you push six or seven people?

316
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,200
Oh, I'm saying win-win scenario. I'm not saying murder these people if you go to the Grand Canyon

317
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,080
But how much how bad you want this money? Here is one thing now when you don't

318
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,080
Decide to push them into the Grand Canyon. Don't do that

319
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,640
I'm saying you don't do that. Okay, when you don't do that and get them on a line and push them in the Grand Canyon

320
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,280
I have I cannot caution you enough against losing your nerve halfway through

321
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,460
That's no good that that nothing good will come of that. Yeah. Yeah, we're not saying any of that

322
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm saying I saw a YouTube video of somebody throwing seven

323
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,320
Watermelons into the Grand Canyon and they did not even come close to surviving the fall

324
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,640
And I'm also saying that watermelons are the most human-like fruit and that's all I'm gonna say

325
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,760
That's just where I stand on the matter. Do you know what this question asker did wrong?

326
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,240
What's after their opportunity for this?

327
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,700
Not not the other thing, but when you were talking with your with your boyfriend's mother, why didn't you say it then?

328
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,920
Why weren't you like, oh Hawaii would be great. Well now because it's hurt I get it

329
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,060
It's her fucking money. You don't want to be like you are not a member of the family

330
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,240
You are dating a member of the family. So it is super not your place to be like no

331
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,840
But the loophole is this it's not like she said Grand Canyon and you said oh

332
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,480
How about Hawaii like she said either Grand Canyon or Hawaii?

333
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,360
All you had to do is like oh Hawaii sounds fun or the Grand Canyon either way, but Hawaii

334
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:00,080
I've always because it's her it's her 30 stacks. She gets the ball. Oh, Hawaii is I feel like once you

335
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,520
um, uh, once you pay for the Grand Canyon trip, it's pretty much paid for once you go to Hawaii, though

336
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,020
I feel like you're just begging for upsells. But what about the episode a lot? What what about burros?

337
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
You got paid for the burros

338
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,300
Burro rental. Yeah. Yeah, very cold donkeys

339
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,920
You gotta get the audio. That was a shitty joke over. Thank you Griffin

340
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,800
No, a lot of people give us give a shit for not recognizing your good jokes

341
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,400
And I'm trying to get better about that, but that also means I'm gonna call you out when you do a fucking terrible

342
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,280
No, cuz it's a burro shot. Just stop it. He's a chili donkey. I

343
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,600
Don't know how much Shanana is is going to track with the humans who listen to your program

344
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,640
but what I would encourage them not to do is

345
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,540
Look too deeply into the Shanana bis

346
00:28:52,540 --> 00:29:02,120
Because there it's not these guys were you know, this is this this is this this fifties Nostalgia Group that

347
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,900
formed in

348
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
1968 eight years

349
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:15,420
Eight years after the thing they formed a nostalgia group, but it only oh here we go

350
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
The only the only reason

351
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:25,580
The only reason it worked is nostalgia was that there had been this profound cultural change in

352
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,960
music and culture and so it truly was as though the fifties had been

353
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:39,000
You know time warped out of existence five thousand years and they represented a completely different culture these guys up at Columbia

354
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,460
University started singing these doo-wop songs from 15 years before or 10 years before and suddenly

355
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,580
They're this oldies act and then they go to Woodstock and then they get a TV show out of it

356
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:57,180
They're all really talented dudes, but none of them have they have that that completely it like

357
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:04,580
Weird rock and roll pedigree, which is that they're all white guys from Massachusetts. No R&B behind them at all

358
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:10,100
They're dancing and singing in gold lamé and their show is somewhere between you know

359
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,940
The malt shop and studio 54. There's so much beard chest hair

360
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,280
One of the cool guys is like 37 years old and bald it is insane

361
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:27,780
It's a warm. It's like a warm blanket this description that you're just draping over me on a camping trip question

362
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:33,100
They're just so many. I know now did you you shaved right? Okay, then I'll tell you the story of Shanana

363
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,940
The questions that these they're talented and terrible at the same time

364
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,820
They're dancing that it is the laziest choreography that I've ever seen

365
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:49,260
Big Lenny who plays the saxophone who's from my home Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is still still alive and still out there blowing sax

366
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:55,740
This guy's got a beautiful tenor voice, but should not be on TV not because he doesn't have a good look

367
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,480
But he has no presence whatsoever on TV. He's constantly flapping his arms around while he sings like some obese bird

368
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,260
it's insane like everything about it and

369
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,500
And then they all quit

370
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
they all quit and became

371
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:17,060
doctors and attorneys and professors one of them is a linguistics professor at Hofstra University and

372
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,140
And and they're all they're all professionals now those who who are still with us

373
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,260
Except for Bowser who's still out there selling the grease, right?

374
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:37,580
And then and then Jaco Donnie and screaming Scott the nice thing about his starting in 68 with the 50s a culture for Bowser is that now

375
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,760
If you are not aware of their history, he just looks like somebody who's aged really really well

376
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,060
How is this guy still hanging with this this lifestyle because it was close enough to the 50s

377
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,980
It seems like a really really old guy who looks fantastic

378
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,980
I

379
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:00,780
Pending the words by the pending. Oh, I know. Yeah, this is what this is. Well, I've been thinking about all night long you guys

380
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,940
Everyone you know what you can all go down this hole together

381
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,420
Let's go into the catching up on this John and you are very right about this gentleman

382
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,680
I got distracted from the conversation and I just wanted to say that

383
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,340
Bowser from shot on ah is a co-founder of a group called senior votes count

384
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,140
Which is a political action committee for old people you guys

385
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,540
I think the rest of this podcast should just be this the sound of us all just quietly click in the internet

386
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,160
And then just speaking up when you find an interesting show my third of the program usually is

387
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,780
I

388
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:52,340
Want to talk to you guys about imperfect foods because I'm genuinely wild about it. Okay it you okay?

389
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,380
So here's how it works. You know, I mean you have the the experience

390
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,460
Every week that you hold on. Let me close my eyes

391
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,460
Okay, every week you get a cart

392
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,500
Pre-filled and you go in you see you open up the car. You're like, what did you pick for me?

We don't want to hear from you. We want little bitty tiny victories

Hey, thank god. Bye. Okay. Here we go gentlemen

459
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,360
By age five most horses have how many teeth?

460
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,960
153 okay. Let's try again

461
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,280
The answer we got a between 20 and 25 B between 36 and 40 C between 60 and 71

462
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Are we just talking about the front row of teeth?

463
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,120
By age five most horses have how many teeth on the front row or the back row?

464
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,880
Face teeth or full body teeth. Are we full body teeth? Okay, 35 three

465
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
The answer was B

466
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,200
Between 36 and 40. Oh you're off by one next question. I got one more question

467
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:28,280
This is the best game the left side of a horse the side of the horse that we mount is called or the broadside

468
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,380
It's called the left flank the mount or or the near side the meatus

469
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Horses meatus

470
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
I'm gonna go with the meatus

471
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,440
Everyone's convinced. He's telling me it's the near side

472
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,200
You can really get a you can get a full boot in that fleshy meatus. We got

473
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,840
this a

474
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,440
horse has long legs so it can a

475
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,560
Run away from predators be jump out of the way of a predator chase dreams faster

476
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:08,240
See stop a predator space see defend itself against the predator. Mm-hmm

477
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,720
See keep dry when it floods so we can't D catch a prayer now

478
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,600
So it can be tall enough to eat birds right out of the sky

479
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:23,280
Yeah, he so it's a little bit closer to God. Mm-hmm. God's that's why God made his giraffe

480
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,280
Said get up here horses. He said get on your horse. I'm gonna give you multiple choice question

481
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
I'm not gonna give you multiple answers

482
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,640
When a horse's ears are laid flat. What does that mean horny?

483
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Super suit. All right. This is lightning round Griffin. You said horny wrong Travis. I

484
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,200
Made a bad investment incorrect Griffin

485
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Not horny

486
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,000
If their ears are down they are explicitly not an ounce of horny

487
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,600
Read the room Steve right by omission correct? They're angry or scared. So thank you read we're going to have food

488
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,080
I'm keeping these like on my desk. Oh, yeah, so at any moment I can reach out and grab

489
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:16,120
We also have just so you know for the future. We have care questions and breed question. Oh tight. I can't wait for the breed questions

490
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
I

491
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,980
Have a friend who absolutely hates the concept of laughing at bad movies

492
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,980
For instance, he considers watching a movie like the room to be a massive waste of time when he could be watching something better

493
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
quote like transformers

494
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,960
That's the whole of this dude

495
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,000
You know

496
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,480
My kids brothers and mr. Corbett

497
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,160
How can we get this farcical flick Debbie downer in the right frame of mind or is this a lost cause?

498
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,320
That's from bad movie buff in Brooklyn. Oh my god with the alliteration in your listeners

499
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,000
We have a we have pretty savvy pretty savvy audience

500
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,480
This actually this reminds me the first time Griffin and I watched the room with my now wife Teresa the look on her face

501
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,320
was like a combination of like

502
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,520
Confusion and frustration. She didn't know why she doesn't know why we did that to her. Yeah, she just kept saying what is this?

503
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,640
Why are we no, I'm testing you darling. Yeah, and it was like get it and she's like no

504
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,200
No, it's bad. She's bad. And then we made her watch it like eight more times and now she loves it. Oh

505
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:29,200
Oh, yeah, but sort of Stockholm soon. Yeah, honey. He's from Stockholm. Ah,

506
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,920
There is a

507
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,200
There's there's there's a real problem with the premise of this question and the transformers method

508
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,840
I mean

509
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:45,360
I don't know where to go with that because if you don't enjoy the room and you do enjoy transformers

510
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,520
I don't understand you as a human being it seems like to me like maybe his like through line like he doesn't like really good

511
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,720
Movies or really bad movies and he just wants it right down the center there like milquetoast nothing

512
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:04,640
He likes the movie protagonist of 1950s version of movies. Sure. Yeah, and he wants to be beat up by Michael Bay

513
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,560
Well, I mean I I guess there's why would you try to force someone to do that

514
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,880
I guess to marry them if Travis is to be believed, but that's the only reason as a weird doubter

515
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
I forget what the actual question was

516
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,640
Really break it down to like really parse it is how do you get someone to like bad movies?

517
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,880
And I don't I think it's a little questionable as a premise. I mean, yeah, you're not supposed to right?

518
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,600
I mean well

519
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,160
but here's the thing is because I was thinking about this on the way over when I got stuck in traffic is

520
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,560
the idea of I

521
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,800
Didn't start liking bad movies. I started as a kid watching MST 3k with dad

522
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Sure, and then through that like transitioning into liking bad movies, and I think that it's an acquired taste, you know

523
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,520
It's a thing that's like you can't show someone who's only seen like current blockbuster

524
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,920
Quote good or bad movies and then expect them to like the room and Manos hands of fate and get it

525
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,720
Like you kind of got a like clue them in with we're going to watch something that frames it

526
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,040
Like isn't this fun to make fun of I think I think you are really on to something and it it

527
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,880
You know when I when I was working on the show

528
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,960
My parents would watch and they could not they just couldn't get past the movies

529
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,200
They were just go like man that movie was really bad. You know, there's just a terrible movie. I couldn't watch anymore

530
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Take you through it a little bit mom and dad but yeah, and I don't I would never force that on people unless I wanted

531
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,380
To bury them. Uh-huh. Do you do you do you feel like you guys?

532
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,860
Like provided a really valuable service to the movie industry the filmmaking industry where?

533
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,160
If a movie studio, I feel like made a really terrible movie

534
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Before you guys came around. It was just a total loss. It was it was a disaster for them

535
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
But now if somebody makes a really bad movie, it's like well

536
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,920
At least somebody's gonna get some sort of like twisted pleasure

537
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,880
I like like there is a there has been cultivated among people and appreciation for bad movies. That wasn't there before

538
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,640
So at least we've got that at least we'll bring some modicum of joy to people

539
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,260
Especially now with podcasts and like YouTube and it's like everybody talks about bad movies

540
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,640
Yeah in a way that like people weren't doing you know in the 90s and a so for example

541
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,340
I was a teenage strangler was filmed in our hometown Huntington West Virginia

542
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,200
So when it was on MSD 3k, it was like this huge thing like it's back

543
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,080
We've done it and and it also puts the lie to your old teachers thing about nobody ever making it

544
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,080
Take that mrs. Williams. Well, no because we're all getting strangled

545
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:43,120
By by by a fellow native though, right? There you go. Yeah, so I so it's our town in the best light

546
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,440
Just we're calling the herd. We're building a

547
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,600
Staircase of human bodies for here you go. Well, I you know, I don't know

548
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,960
I we've wanted Hollywood to appreciate that service

549
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,080
We provide them for years, but but so far so far nothing. No, no fungible

550
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,580
You know, we're just not big enough problems you affect their sales and that's all they care about and when we have actually

551
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,400
Negotiated them via riff tracks for bigger titles. It is all it's like diffusing a bomb

552
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
They're very sensitive about it and we eventually

553
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,560
Shook a few, you know 90s to early 2000 titles away from them with money just with Kickstarter money

554
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,560
But they're just very concerned about the the relations the trail of relationships. They have in general

555
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,160
I'm imagining that conversation like you want to make fun of

556
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,240
Casablanca

557
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,480
No, you can't you can't come on they're all dead come on

558
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,720
Yeah, you're right

559
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:46,120
My girlfriend and I live about 1500 miles apart and one of our favorite pastimes is watching MST 3k and riff tracks together over skype

560
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,360
Which MST 3k episode of riff tracks VOD would you recommend for a young couple in love?

561
00:46:52,400 --> 00:47:00,200
Amorous in Austin, I don't you know, I guess it if he's asking me if you something that would enhance their love or sexual pleasure

562
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:07,960
I'm a little scared of that question. Frankly. What's the most erotic MST 3k episode the Apple?

563
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,920
The Roger Daltrey looking guy running around in a loincloth

564
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:20,240
It doesn't get can you just repeat the chapter with the sex song in it the song that takes place in the sex

565
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,160
I was I was drunk at that point of the movie the the time that I watched it

566
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,440
But I do distinctly remember there being a sex song that somebody's saying while having sex

567
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,220
Which I guess one of your brothers can sing it sex song from the Apple. Oh, man, it's gonna be bad

568
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,920
I'm gonna it's a double entendre. I believe it is a

569
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,240
single entendre. It's 1.2 entendres. I'm coming

570
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,860
Is memory foam bad for sex

571
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:00,160
Thinking of getting either a memory foam mattress or a topper update also, I mean good sex not boring sex

572
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,960
insight oh

573
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,360
Well, I'm quite clarified because memory foam is great for boring sex

574
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:13,920
I mean, I don't want to show my hand but I make love like I'm slowly being absorbed by quicksand

575
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,720
Mm-hmm. I don't want I don't want here's their problem

576
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,920
You can use a memory foam mattress. It'll make sex sex better, but only if you get a memory foam

577
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,880
Mattress after you've been having sex for a while

578
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,440
Because if you have sex for the first few times on a memory foam mattress and then later you're still having sex on it

579
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,120
You're gonna look at those in previous indentations

580
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,840
What was I doing?

581
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,760
Memory foam remembers don't remember that what's with all the elbow imprints?

582
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,160
What was I doing?

583
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,600
the weird thing is when you plug your memory foam into your computer and you

584
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,360
Download all of the information and it gives you all the stats off of your previous lovemaking sessions

585
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,800
Yeah, it's me clippy good number of pumps there trout

586
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:08,680
I'm gonna keep track of your pumps. Hey clipping. I'll track your pumps for you travel. Hey, have you tried minecraft?

587
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,360
See you added a swerve trap

588
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,920
Trap we can virus alerts. Hey sure you need to compensate for the angle trap

589
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,480
You know what I'm talking about need to run a McCaffrey virus check buddy

590
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,120
I can't help but notice not cuddling afterwards you jackass

591
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,760
What have you read it his erect penis had a red squiggly line underneath it

592
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,120
Boy you spelled

593
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,840
I

594
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,080
Mean I

595
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,280
None of us own a memory foam, right? I didn't I know what that we're making a lot

596
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,600
I know we're making a lot of money on this show, but not that minecraft money. No

597
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:08,280
It seems to me though, like it wouldn't be ideal unless for some reason while you fuck

598
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,080
You like to have glasses of wine all around you that you don't want to spill over onto yourself

599
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,960
it seems it's so funny to me because it seems like

600
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,200
40 years ago. The thing was like it was like water, you know water mattresses

601
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,240
yeah, what are those called water beds water beds, which is like the polar opposite of memory foam memory foam is like

602
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,520
Oh, you can like bounce a bowling ball

603
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,280
Nothing happens and like a water but it's like oh you moved your elbow and you flipped the other person out of the bed

604
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,580
Yeah, oh, well, I think that the I think that making love when you make love in a memory foam

605
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:51,160
You are nullifying a lot of the earth's natural physics and effects and a lot of the

606
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,160
simple machines

607
00:50:54,080 --> 00:51:00,800
Featured in a traditional mattress and I think that I think I I mean, I love extreme restraints

608
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,320
But I I get by with those simple machines, you know, I mean springs levers screws

609
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,480
Thank you in crime in client planes things like that and in a memory foam you are floating in the negative zone

610
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,240
You know what? I mean, you're in print you are imprisoned in the negative zone and I don't think Zod

611
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,320
I love making love and that can be pleasurable kneel before Zod

612
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,280
But I don't think it works for everyone

613
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,940
But isn't that true of all lovemaking Griffin, maybe one man's memory foam is another man's sleep number bed

614
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:49,540
And I sleep another man's inflatable camping mattress sleep number bed would be great because I have always wanted a fuck number

615
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:56,580
That's something they do not feature in the advertisements, but you say what's your sleep number 28, what's your fuck number?

616
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,740
35

617
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:04,980
Yeah, and then someone's like is that the number of people you've slept with and it's like no that number is zero. I

618
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:10,900
Just know my I know my fuck number in preparation for that special they find that for you in the store

619
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,900
That number is zero and looking

620
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,500
Ladies zero plus and then you say why is it zero and he says

621
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,100
True love waits and it was a commercial for true love waits the whole time

622
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,460
Okay, guys, marry fuck kill. Are you ready?

623
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,260
Sleep number. Yeah, memory foam. Yeah, graphmatic adjustable

624
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,700
Memory foam. Yeah graphmatic adjustable. Oh my god

625
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,700
I didn't kill the graphmatic just because it would kill you I think to try and

626
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,860
um

627
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,240
Make that two back piece up on that you get fold up like a panini

628
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,660
Um the sexiest panini

629
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,780
Uh, is it weird to buy toilet paper in bulk?

630
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:59,940
My husband refuses to buy or be seen with me when I buy toilet paper because I prefer to buy a 24 pack instead of

631
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:06,420
A four or six pack because it's cheaper and something will always I assume need you assume

632
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,740
I assume

633
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,220
Okay, roger. My butthole is just gone

634
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,180
Sweet, you know, we don't need

635
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,140
Roger leaves got really soft all of a sudden

636
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,380
My husband is very embarrassed by my large toilet paper purchases

637
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,380
And believes other people will judge us and find us weird for the large purchase

638
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,380
Is it a legitimate concern?

639
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,780
Is it worth sacrificing the extra dollars and time?

640
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:37,540
I'll spend shopping more regularly for tp to avoid having other people think I must poop a lot. That's from cabinets

641
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,500
full of toilet paper in term

642
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:47,220
I when I see that at the grocery store and don't get it twisted when you buy a 24 pack of charmon

643
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:54,820
At the grocery store, that's all that's going in your cart. That's problem. Number one. Yeah, but when I see that when I'm exposed to that

644
00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:00,020
I just think like you've got a lot of shitting

645
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,900
to do

646
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,140
I assume

647
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,260
Hold on

648
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:12,340
But what's the what's the worried implication that someone sees you pick up a 24 pack of toilet paper like, oh lose butthole

649
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,020
Like what's the you know when you buy i'm saying that there should be a stigma

650
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,300
And i'm saying like when you go to the when you go to a fucking

651
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,720
Walgreens and you pick up a pack of rubbers or jimmy hats or whatever the fuck we call them now jazz raincoats

652
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,460
we

653
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,780
Some jazz raincoats or you buy them. You don't put them on in the store

654
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:37,140
Although they should let you do that because it's not a one-size-fits-all thing no matter how much they fucking tell you

655
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,740
It's not a one-size-fits-all and the crazy thing is once you get them home and open them

656
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,220
They don't let you return them. They don't let you return them

657
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:48,900
Um, especially once after you've used them you have to google condom sizes like some sort of caveman

658
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:55,720
But anyway, when you kind of google caveman you go to cvs you say let me get they're all in centimeters you go to cvs

659
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,860
And you say let me get a pack of

660
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,180
Smokes and they say we don't sell those anymore and you say fuck

661
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:08,820
Let me get some jimmy hats instead then and you feel embarrassed about the jimmy hats

662
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,300
because they know that your dick's going in that and they know that you're you're

663
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,780
You're detritus is probably going in that too and that's gross and you're embarrassed

664
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,060
But you buy toilet paper like oh you're doing some pooping. Yeah, cool. Cool. Cool, and it's not a thing

665
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,040
I think that you should apply the same level of discretion

666
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,820
to tp that you do

667
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,900
to to to condoms and diaphragms and and and

668
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:40,740
And new verax. I feel like i've mentioned this before but I I can't help but apply narrative

669
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,940
When i'm buying toilet paper, I always feel like the implication is whatever i'm buying

670
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:51,060
With that toilet paper is going to make me poop. I feel like if i'm buying like

671
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,940
If i'm buying like a heath bar and some toilet paper, I think the short story

672
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:02,980
A big day plant. I need this heath bar and it's gonna give me diarrhea. So I need the toilet paper for that

673
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:07,140
That's right. You put the heath bar on the counter and then you put the toilet paper just in case

674
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:15,000
What if we look at this as a business opportunity and i'm always looking at things like business opportunities

675
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,660
um

676
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,140
If we open up our own toilet paper manufacturer and distribution company

677
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,860
And it comes in an unmarked box and no, no you sell it at grocery stores

678
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:31,300
But it's just a single you just buy one roll of toilet paper at a time and the name of the company is

679
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
Carpe Diem toilet paper company

680
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,620
That person is living for today

681
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,060
That's great because you grab that one roll and you go to the counter and kind of like wiggle a little bit and do a

682
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,300
Little dance like okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on

683
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,260
All right, come on come on come on

684
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:53,860
I I as much as I I I mean there's another way of looking at this which is if you buy a huge

685
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,420
bulk of toilet paper

686
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:02,340
That's rarer that people are going to spot you buying toilet paper if you go at like two in the morning

687
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,140
To the walmart to buy your toilet paper

688
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,860
Then you know, you can never be spotted. It could be a stealth mission you do that once a month or something

689
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:16,180
Mm-hmm. Oh or go every day and buy a 24 pack every day and look the guy square in the eye every time i'm back

690
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,140
I'm back. There is can I i'm basically like a basically like a sandworm essentially i'm just

691
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,220
I I consume and process and expunge

692
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:30,020
I'm also not good at conserving toilet paper. No, how many pieces sorry, I gotta go

693
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:37,060
uh, nobody likes buying a huge thing of toilet paper, but there is I think we can all admit a

694
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:42,500
A special kind of feeling of security and luxury. Oh, yeah when you peel

695
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:50,260
Of single roll off of a 24 pack at home and you think oh man. I have got a lot of toilet

696
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:57,060
Whatever whenever I that happens I have the feeling like i'll never have to buy toilet paper. Oh, yeah. Yeah

697
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,660
You buy a 24 pack. You're like, well, that's toilet paper sorted for life

698
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,660
What next?

699
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:08,100
Give me that giant container of oats. Okay, let's take my idea and flip it on the inverse and we start a company called

700
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:13,540
For life toilet paper and you buy it it costs. How much would you how much would you pay?

701
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,620
How high is this ceiling? I would I would pay thirteen thousand

702
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:25,620
Thirteen thousand dollars for a four thousand eight hundred and twelve pack. Are you ready for this? You call it call of nature box. Okay

703
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,140
Every two weeks someone comes to your door and just hands you

704
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:36,980
I don't want I don't want a shit paper interaction every 14 goddamn days. I want to knock it out

705
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,300
Once i'm going to save up my money and put in a down payment investment in myself

706
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,980
Why are we this is our bedroom and this is our living room and this is our toilet paper room

707
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:52,100
Why are we shipping things to people that I would like healthy snacks that I would be proud to buy

708
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:58,580
I would be proud to stride into the store. Why are we not secretly shipping people toilet paper? It doesn't make sense to me

709
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:04,420
It's sickening. It's because it doesn't have that stigma and we need to we need to make people ashamed of their bowel movements

710
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:10,900
Everybody just should be more ashamed of their bodies in general. Yeah. Oh god, especially the evil that comes out of it

711
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,820
Um

712
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,740
Let's try this yahoo auto sin and by rachel sperling game recognized game. Thank you. Rachel

00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:31,220
Start in a dark forest at midnight and there is a girl named alaina who gets hypnotized and bitten by a slow down slow down

715
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,500
Okay, okay

716
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:39,940
Start in a dark forest at midnight and there is a girl named alaina who gets hypnotized and bitten

717
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,740
By a vampire named josea. I want eye contact hypnosis, please

718
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,460
Okay, first of all, that's called thrall

719
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,700
It's not called hypnosis

720
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,180
You're in the thrall jeez amateurs

721
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,180
Amateurs

722
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,660
Glamour is what I prefer

723
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:03,060
Glamour is something that masks you so it's more like uh, you would cast a glamour on someone to so they would ignore you

724
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,660
No, yeah, but in true blood they call it glamoring they verb it

725
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,820
I go he glamored me into doing this

726
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:13,700
I think that means you dress them up in sequence and and you made them more glamour that's dazzle them

727
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,660
What a fucking stupid show that sounds like

728
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,220
Never seen it, but it sounds pretty goddamn dumb can someone

Please write me a vampire story. Please please please please please i'm

730
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:30,020
There is not enough vampire fiction out there erotic

731
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:34,100
Vamp fiction. So is the question asker asking someone to write them a story

732
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,740
Uh-huh, and it's gotta have a girl named alaina and a vampire named josea and it's gotta have eye contact hypnosis

733
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,580
Can I just say I really like this because I think we could call it choose my own adventure

734
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,180
And it's just like hey i'm gonna tell you what I want in the story

735
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,620
I think I used to have a book like this where I was a little kid and mom and dad brought it

736
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:54,980
Bought it for me for my birthday where I went to like planet travis and they can I machine that worked on wishes?

737
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,060
I think a choose my own adventure book is just a book

738
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,220
Right, I wish I wish

739
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:08,260
God, I wish books would just choose the fucking adventure for me. Just tell me a story

740
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:14,260
I didn't buy this fucking thing to write it myself. This is garbage neil patrick harris you lazy shit

742
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,940
What do you think this person wants the story for

743
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:24,820
Do you think it's an assignment where they have to write it and they're going at least i've got all the bones of it

744
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:29,400
But I just can't put the meat on it. Yeah from from their their teacher miss clitoris

She's starting but fair

Can someone fucking write this person?

748
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,740
Okay, so let's go through it. She's in a dark forest at night

749
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:49,460
Okay, how much time do we have left in the show? Uh enough time to write some erotic vampire. Okay, let's let's let's

750
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,940
Let's write one. I'm the oldest

751
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,660
I'll start. Okay, and

752
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,860
Oh like an exquisite corpse

753
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,380
Yeah, uh, maybe not once okay. Yeah, we'll do one sentence at a time. That'd be good. Okay

754
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:11,700
Okay, the night was dark and also horny the the forest was as dark as it was horny, too

755
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,540
I'm my name is elena and this forest got me feeling real horny down there

756
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,580
I swired a shape

757
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:24,580
In the darkness that was white but had eyes and a cape

758
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:29,140
And maybe fangs. It was definitely glamorous, but also erotic

759
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,860
His name was josea. He didn't

760
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,300
Tell me that but he looked like one

761
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:40,660
He looked like my friend josea. It's there's more than once there was a semicolon in there

762
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,980
He looked like my friend josea from work at dress barn

763
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:50,180
I got closer to him. I saw that underneath the cape

764
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,980
He was wearing some sensible jeans and no shirt

765
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:59,540
But he just had like a cape and his muscles were like, yes, and I didn't know much but he was definitely bonered

766
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,060
Dude

767
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,340
I could see it through his jeans. I could see the boner through his jeans

768
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,680
Another semicolon was in there. They were as sensible as they were see-through

769
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,700
Uh, it's not your turn. Oh, sorry

770
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,180
I looked dude's eyes

771
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,620
They remind me

772
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:22,420
Of josea my friend at dress barn and that's that's that's when it occurred to me

773
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
I'm gonna bone this dude. No

774
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:31,620
I feel good. I don't know where these thoughts are coming from. They definitely weren't my own

775
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,860
No, you said that's what occurred to me that I was gonna phone this dude

776
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,580
Well, and also I hate to take umbridge, but and then it occurred to me is not a complete sentence

777
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,740
I there was a high fit. There was ellipses at the end

778
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,940
um chapter two

779
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:56,500
I got fired from just barn today

780
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,780
I got fired by my manager josea. I thought he was my friend

781
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,900
Also, he has amazing muscles and he doesn't wear a shirt and he wears a cape

782
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,500
But a different cape this is we're talking about a different josea here. I can't express this enough. I wish

783
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:20,260
I wish I really try to get a hook into this story travis. You were just not letting me try

784
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:23,480
I wish everything in my house smelled like dress barn josea

785
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:30,120
Suddenly there was a clattering at my window. It was santa claus

786
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,700
He I fucked my brain and the sexy stuff

787
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,900
Turns out it was a was a drakul all along

788
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:45,460
santa climbed in my window and he opened up his sack and he

789
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:50,100
And he let it fall to the ground and inside there was just one gift

790
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,580
And it was josea the vampire from earlier and not the dress barn josea

791
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:02,500
He looked deep into my eyeballs and I got totally totally bonered for him. And then santa claus was like well

792
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,660
I guess I should get going

793
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,740
Seems like things are about to get a little bit lusty in here

794
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:15,220
I've got other sex draculas to drop off a kid's houses like you

795
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:22,820
And then josea spun around and he drank santa's blood I don't know until he died

796
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,260
And let me be honest. It was a huge turn on

797
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,980
So I reached inside of his

798
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,300
sack and I got out

799
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,780
hundreds of sex draculas

800
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,940
all for me

801
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,940
Um

802
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,580
I'm not done. I'm not done

803
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,820
I crowd surfed

804
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:57,700
On the sex draculas like buckethead at a corn show when buckethead was stealing corn

805
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,580
Was he ever tamed?

806
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:07,860
Did he did he glamour him? Yeah. Yeah. I said the thing about the eye fucking. Okay. I think we just covered all our bases there

807
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,820
Also, wait, hold on

808
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,900
Oh, hold on. Somebody's at my door. Give me a second

809
