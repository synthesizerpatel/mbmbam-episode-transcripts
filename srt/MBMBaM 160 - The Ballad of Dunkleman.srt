1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:47,920
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,120
oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:07,280
It's how I commune with my dolphin brethren. I'm Griffin McElroy and a baby brother.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,760
Why are you communing with dolphins?

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:22,720
You know how there's a type of people in the world who have a chance encounter with a dolphin

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
and then that's like their whole lives? Usually they're an art teacher.

11
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,480
I did not know until I had a chance encounter with the dolphin that I'm one of those people

12
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,680
and now I'm all about that endless ring of light, you know?

13
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,880
Is that what a blowhole is?

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,680
I guess it's a novel. Maybe you should go to a library.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
I think in that case a dolphin, doesn't he swim through endless rings of light?

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,520
There are light rings. Guys, dolphins, I don't know. They're just big, slippery,

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,880
perfectly designed piles of muscle just designed in sinew and they're so glorious

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,480
and I got to touch one and kiss one when I was in Mexico.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:14,080
So weigh for me the majesty of a dolphin versus like a beautiful horse.

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,880
Fuck. I think we've said before that dolphins are just the horses of the sea,

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,160
despite the fact that there are things already called sea horses out there.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,120
You think they would get the title but no.

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
Griffin, may I ask you an impertinent question?

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
How good a kisser was the dolphin?

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
Really great. This is a fun story.

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,760
My, the trainer who was like leading me on,

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,680
it was called Dolphin Discovery and it was the most inexpensive of the dolphin packages.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Welcome to Dave's Discount Dolphins.

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,200
It was so fucked up.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,720
Half of them are manatees. We don't pay that guy's attention.

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,040
The travel agent that booked this excursion for us,

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,200
because when you stay at all inclusive resorts, you have excursions

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:07,440
because you have to find reasons to get away from the comfort of it all, the paralytic comfort.

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
And he was like, there's three packages.

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,600
There's Discovery, and then there was like two others more expensive

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,080
called like Extreme Zone and the Royal.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,600
Extreme Zone. I don't like the sound of that. That sounds like-

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,560
It was so fucked up because in those more expensive ones,

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
he basically said like in Mexico, they let you do more stuff with the dolphin.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
You get to like third base.

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,600
He said, you can do more stuff with the dolphins because they have,

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,160
quote unquote, because they have tequila.

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,200
And when he said that, the world became a little bit less of a special place for me.

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,120
But I kissed the dolphin and the trainer, as I was like going up,

45
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,640
like ready to just fucking lay one on, his name was Pacal.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
As I was getting ready to lay one on him, she goes,

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
Griffin, have you ever kissed a boy before?

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,680
And I was like, hey, why did you just put me on blast

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,040
in front of my fiance in this like huge family?

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,680
Griffin, have you had a gay experience before?

51
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
Let's all talk about it.

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,800
Let's talk about it.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,320
And then I had to like stand there and be like,

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,440
I hesitated for a few seconds, like thinking like,

55
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,120
have I ever kissed a dude before?

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
I lied. I said no.

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I didn't want Pacal to feel less special.

58
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Did, if you tried to pull something with the dolphin,

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
would it, would they try to charge you more?

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
Like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you didn't get the Royal package.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
No touching.

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Well, no, I mean, I'm not talking, they don't let you fuck the dolphin.

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
I'm not talking about dolphin prostitution,

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,200
but they do place your little like safety tank

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,480
right next to their extreme zone tank where no shit,

66
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,040
they would have you lay on your belly in the water.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,920
And then two dolphins would come up and press and swim

68
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,400
against each of your feet, propelling you into the air.

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
And I was like, fuck, that was like 30 extra bucks.

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,240
It would have been totally worth it.

71
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
I got to just kiss him.

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,800
How much do you have to pay to kill them with your bare hands?

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
If you want to kill one dolphin.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
That's the double Royal package.

75
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
And then there's the triple Royal,

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
which is where you kill a dolphin while another dolphin watches.

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,280
How much do you have to pay for the dolphin to end your life

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
because you're suffering?

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,560
How much for a dolphin Asia, Griffin?

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,000
That's what I'm asking you right now.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
I just need a dolphin angel of mercy.

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
I don't think you can get that through the travel agent.

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
I think you have to book that on the side.

84
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
And I think you can really only get it

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,960
after you've established a certain level of trust

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,480
with the dolphin and its trainer.

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,880
If you're just some random gringo who's strolled down

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,200
for the weekend, they're not going to let a dolphin kill you.

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,760
Right.

90
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
They don't know what you have.

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
Can we not say kill?

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
Can we say release from this mortal burden?

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah.

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,600
And if a dolphin kills you consensually,

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,120
then your spirit is released into the dolphin,

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
the dolphin lifestream.

97
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
That's actually the only way new dolphins are made.

98
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,040
It's a really weird life cycle for dolphins.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,120
How do you, how much do you have to pay?

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,920
It's kind of, it's basically like the Highlander.

101
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,600
How much do you have to pay to kill a dolphin

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
as it kills you and you get to ride it into heaven?

103
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
How jealous will everyone in heaven be?

104
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm St. Peter.

105
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,640
I've been up here forever.

106
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,520
I've seen it all.

107
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,760
Whoa, holy shit.

108
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,520
That dolphin's wearing sunglasses.

109
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Yeah.

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
I put them on him while we were in the stratosphere.

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
I put some sunglasses too so he could go to heaven.

112
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
And I killed these sweet, these sweet Tommy Bahama jams

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
so they could go with me up to heaven too.

114
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,080
And I killed a case of Corona so I could bring that also.

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
As you've almost certainly guessed by this point,

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,760
this is an advice show for the modern era.

117
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,720
Let's get into it and let's help some folks out.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm 18 and I want to get a tattoo.

119
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
Problem is my parents.

120
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
Don't want me to get one.

121
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Normally this wouldn't be a big issue for me,

122
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,480
but I don't know if my wanting a tattoo comes from the fact

123
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,920
that I actually want one or because I just want to do

124
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
something to rebel against my parents.

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,840
What can I do to sort out my confusion?

126
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
That's from thanks.

127
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,240
That's from a tattoo snafu in Toronto.

128
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,080
That's so rare for people to realize that they're,

129
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
that they're rebelling,

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,120
that they're doing something other than-

131
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
It's a remarkable amount of insight.

132
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,080
Well, they call me crazy,

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
but I almost feel like because you're having the insight,

134
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,480
it means that you're not just doing it

135
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,080
because your parents want to do it.

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,200
But it don't want you to do it

137
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,040
because it's like if you think about it and you say,

138
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,400
wait, am I just doing this

139
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,320
because my parents don't want me to do it?

140
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,040
And like by recognizing that that might be a factor

141
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,720
and then still wanting to do it,

142
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
it almost seems to cancel it out.

143
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
Chav, you have more tattoos than Justin and I put together.

144
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
How many of them were done out of rebelliousness?

145
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,000
Um, only one, but it was a rebelling against myself.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Yeah.

147
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,680
I showed me.

148
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Yeah.

149
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,000
You really, you really lost your religion with that.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
Is it, which one, which one are we talking about?

151
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
It's the long nest monster.

152
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,080
Yeah.

153
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
That one was just a big fuck you to myself.

154
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,880
I feel like-

155
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,320
That one's on you forever.

156
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,680
Yeah. No, I know.

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm really feeling it.

158
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
You know, it was a huge punishment for something.

159
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
Did you, do we talk about how you're going to Scotland

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,040
and how you're going to be in the UK?

161
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,360
And how I'm going to fucking ride the Nessie Hunter boat?

162
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,880
And do the sonar and shit?

163
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,320
No, I think Justin's saying how you're

164
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,800
assumedly going to remove your shirt at some point.

165
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,560
And someone's going to look at you and say,

166
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,520
in a Scottish accent,

167
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
I'm not going to try to do this fucking guy.

168
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,800
Well, that is why I don't plan on undressing in Scotland.

169
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,560
Ever.

170
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:32,800
Yes.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,280
I think the tattoos are pretty personal.

172
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,520
The only reason you should want to get one

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,280
is if you really, really, really want to get one.

174
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,240
I mean, really, really, because they are going to be there.

175
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
And I'm going to say an obvious thing,

176
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,040
but it still needs to be stated.

177
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,240
When you get a tattoo,

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
not only is it always going to be there,

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
it is going to say something about you all the time.

180
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,440
You know, like I have a pineapple tattoo on my wrist

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,520
and like every time somebody sees it,

182
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,760
they instantly go, oh, a pineapple.

183
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
And it's like, oh yeah.

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,880
No, now I have to like engage with you on this

185
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
and tell you all about the tattoo on my wrist.

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,400
It's like, basically, it's like getting advertisement

187
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,880
on your body that says like, hey, ask me about this.

188
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
Yeah, and if you're going to do that,

189
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
then you may as well get actual advertised.

190
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
See if you can commoditize yourself

191
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,160
and for like maybe like right over your left breast

192
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
for like MGD 64.

193
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Sure.

194
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
Something where you're going to get payment out of it.

195
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,600
Or free lunches.

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,160
Sometimes like restaurants will have like,

197
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
you can eat free lunch here forever

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
if you get our logo tattooed on your face.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,880
It says Pennzoil across your butt cheeks.

200
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,520
And man, it makes it look like your butthole is the O.

201
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,760
Oh, free meal changes for life, I guess.

202
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,280
Or maybe you could get a tattoo

203
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,840
that looks like a birthmark that signifies you

204
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,280
as the last in the line of some kind of royal family line.

205
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,520
And then you could become like the King of Denmark.

206
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,280
You're asking for the King Ralph now.

207
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,780
Yes.

208
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,000
I think it's actually kind of weird how little,

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,760
how infrequently I think about the fact that I have a tattoo.

210
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,880
I have a fairly prominent tattoo on my left arm.

211
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,240
And unless I like really think about it,

212
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
when I actually notice and remember it's there,

213
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,560
it's actually kind of weird

214
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,440
because I have forgotten about it to that extent.

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,920
Like that's how little consideration I give it day to day.

216
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
And the one in the back of my leg, forget about it.

217
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
Oh, I got the one on my shoulder blade.

218
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,040
And every time I see it, it's like an out of body experience

219
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
where I'm like, whose shoulder is that?

220
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,840
Who did that?

221
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,760
I think there's a ratio between,

222
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,680
I think everybody forgets about their tattoos.

223
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
So the more like shocking,

224
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
if you did get Pennzoil butthole tattoo,

225
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,320
I think that the disconnects between like,

226
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,840
you're never thinking about it

227
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,360
and the first time somebody seeing it

228
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,680
would be like world shattering.

229
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
Like somebody's like, it says Pennzoil on your butthole.

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
And you're like, oh, that's real.

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh, that's right.

232
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
No, how could this be?

233
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,080
Oh God, it's like, it's like Clean Slate,

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
the movie Clean Slate or maybe Memento.

235
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
That's basically the same thing.

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
Basically the same movie.

237
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
So I hope that helps.

238
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,240
Use one of those old yourself apps that you can download

239
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
and it lets you take a picture of yourself

240
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,760
and it turns like your face old.

241
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,840
Do you know the apps I'm speaking of?

242
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I don't think they're gonna get the Mike Tyson

243
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,720
their first time out.

244
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,960
I think they'll probably get like a discreet ankle tattoo.

245
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,400
No, you gotta take a picture of your butt

246
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,120
and then age it and picture a Pennzoil tattoo on there.

247
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,040
Right, you can actually, Travis is right.

248
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
You can use other parts of your body

249
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
on those old yourself apps.

250
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
They don't tell you that.

251
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
My friend Justin Minsker did it on his torso

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
and it made his nipples look like eyes

253
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
and his belly button look like a mouth.

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
It was real funny.

255
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,560
Okay, so we hope that helps.

256
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm just saying you can have fun with apps.

257
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,920
You don't have to use apps.

258
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
You don't have to use apps in the way

259
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
that they tell you to use apps.

260
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
You can have fun.

261
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,640
Why is there not just for business?

262
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,400
You can have fucking fun with them, right?

263
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,320
Why is no one talking about apps?

264
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
They're out there, they're fun.

265
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,320
You can have some.

266
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,400
They should say there's an app for that,

267
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,000
but something else too.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It should be, you know, with all the shit

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,840
that's going on in the news these days,

270
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,280
how about a little bit app news?

271
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,920
You know what I mean?

272
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
Just something like, hey, there's Star Wars Angry Birds.

273
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
I'm like, oh, thank you.

274
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
Thanks, that's CNN.

275
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,960
How about this guys?

276
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,560
How about you could call it what's happening with apps?

277
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,440
Why not just call it what's happening?

278
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,940
Fuck.

279
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
Griffin, do you want to do Yahoo

280
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,480
or you want to answer another question?

281
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,240
I feel like we didn't help that last person too much.

282
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,240
As opposed to normal.

283
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
Yeah, you mean all people ever.

284
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,680
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

285
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,400
Are you Ira Ray?

286
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
Who wants to know?

287
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,240
Thank you, Ira Ray.

288
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark who asks,

289
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,760
what's the most pain-free way to become blood brothers

290
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
with my roommate and best friend, Adam?

291
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
Me and my roommate want to become blood brothers,

292
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,640
but neither of us want to cut ourselves.

293
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,160
What would be the most pain-free way for us to cut ourselves?

294
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,520
Where would it hurt the least?

295
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,360
Should we be afraid of bleeding to death?

296
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
That's for question mark.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Wait for your period.

298
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,440
I don't think his best friend Adam is going to get there.

299
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,920
It feels that way sometimes when you're growing up.

300
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
All the other people are getting them and you think,

301
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,520
I'm never going to get mine.

302
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,920
And then the visitor comes.

303
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Can we have a brief menstrual aside?

304
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,160
Quick menstrual sidebar.

305
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
I fucked up so bad this week.

306
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
I was in a meeting with some of the reporters on the site

307
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,080
and one of them told me that their brother had adopted a dog

308
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,280
a female dog and that he quickly discovered

309
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,920
that the dog was having its period and this horrified me

310
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
because I had never thought of dogs

311
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,280
as being something that could do that.

312
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,120
I thought it was entirely a human invention

313
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,000
because I'm six and I don't think my dad

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,120
ever had to talk with me.

315
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,760
It's not about dog, I'm sorry.

316
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,720
I do not think the the scope of the talk quote unquote

317
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,520
extends to dog periods.

318
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,200
I think there are super responsible parents out there

319
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,440
who say now ladies for for several days

320
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,160
out of each lunar cycle have periods

321
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,800
and not just human ladies but dogs fucking cats,

322
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
dolphins, snails.

323
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I think if you're a dad though or a mom

324
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
you're gonna find that your knowledge

325
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
of how far down that path it goes

326
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
is gonna dry out pretty quickly

327
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
because your kid's next question

328
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
obviously is gonna be what about bees

329
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,440
and then you're gonna have to look at him

330
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,400
dead in the eye and say I don't know

331
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,240
if bees get periods, I don't know.

332
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,400
Okay are you happy?

333
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Let me break out the encyclopedia

334
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,160
Britannical Periods edition.

335
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,160
Or you can just ask Jeeves and horrify him.

336
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
Jeeves what gets periods?

337
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,120
Jeeves is like how long do you have?

338
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
Sit down, get comfy.

339
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
Get comfortable, crack open a beer.

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
It's gonna get weird in here.

341
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,360
Here's a cup of hot cocoa I made you

342
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
because I am for some reason also a butler.

343
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
Crack a window already, it's gonna get live.

344
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,600
Does it cast a shadow?

345
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,120
If so.

346
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,560
It'd be easier to answer what doesn't get periods.

347
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,000
Rocks, trees.

348
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,960
Armchairs.

349
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,460
Clouds.

350
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,680
Rain is just cloud periods.

351
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,180
Nope.

352
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
This is accurate, this is scientific.

353
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
I saw that on Bill Nye.

354
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,960
I think the most pain-free way,

355
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,280
well it's not pain-free but you don't have to

356
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,040
put additional unrequired pain

357
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,120
is just wait till you both accidentally

358
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
cut yourselves naturally.

359
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,080
Like on a, well cliff diving or something.

360
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,720
Try to use your iPhone.

361
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,760
Why won't you pick up?

362
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
This is gonna clot soon.

363
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,640
Dude, you gotta get down here.

364
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,360
You could obviously just get those necklaces

365
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,200
that were like two halves of hearts

366
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
that look like they have broken in two

367
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,040
and said like best friends forever.

368
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,120
But the ones I just said like B-E-F-R-I-F-O-R

369
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,120
and then half of the E.

370
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,480
And then you cut yourself with them?

371
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
And then you cut yourself sharp?

372
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,760
And then you jam it in each other's eyeballs.

373
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,640
Don't think they want to trade eye viscera.

374
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,160
Well and then you switch them.

375
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,320
So you pluck out the eyeballs and you switch the eyeballs

376
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,080
and then you can see how the other person sees.

377
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
We're eye viscera brothers.

378
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,800
It's a totally, it's a totally weird thing.

379
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
We're marrow bros.

380
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,360
Marrow bros.

381
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
Super marrow bros.

382
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,160
That's good.

383
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,840
Why don't you just wait for a nose bleed?

384
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,200
And then like sneeze into, oh God.

385
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,120
And then rub your nose blood into his nose.

386
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
I'll give each other Eskimo kisses

387
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,920
while having a nose bleed.

388
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, what about jizz pals?

389
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,520
Hey, everybody, can we just like go to the movies

390
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,960
and see Pacific Rim and maybe go to Max and Irma's after

391
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,800
and not trade bodily fluids to prove our love?

392
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,400
Are you guys not blood brothers with anybody?

393
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm blood brothers with you.

394
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,880
You, that's not, come on.

395
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,360
We're not even blood brothers with each other

396
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,880
because we haven't fucking cut ourselves

397
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,040
and slapped each other's palms with it.

398
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,440
Our DNA is very similar.

399
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
You must have said D and D.

400
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Our D and D is so legit.

401
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
So similar.

402
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,200
It's very similar.

403
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
You're telling me you have never-

404
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,680
Look at this strand of D and D.

405
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,920
You have never locked friends.

406
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,120
You've never locked eyes with a best buddy forever

407
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
and been like, let's give each other some hemoglobin.

408
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,040
I actually feel like I did.

409
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,920
I have done that.

410
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,600
Who'd you do it with?

411
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,240
Alex White.

412
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,040
Cut ourselves on this wire

413
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,280
that was sticking out of a tennis net.

414
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
Excellent choice.

415
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
Excellent choice.

416
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,840
Rusty as shit.

417
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,600
It was sharp as shit and it got the job done.

418
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
And now I feel a kindredness with him.

419
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
Can you tell when he is in strife?

420
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
I can tell when he's eating a really good plate

421
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
of cheese fries.

422
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
I can tell when he's dying of tetanus

423
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,880
and it's all the time.

424
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,200
Cause he has it now.

425
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,320
Well, if he goes and I go,

426
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
it's that fucking dragon heart shit.

427
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,600
Justin, who are you blood brothers with?

428
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,640
Some of my friends in college did gang burns.

429
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,520
You had the best group of friends in college.

430
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,480
Does that count?

431
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,760
Some of them still have scarring.

432
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,920
If you see my friend Jason, ask to see his arm.

433
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,080
Is that just where you light a lighter for a long time

434
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,600
and then put that on your flesh or what?

435
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,760
You put it on your flesh and you wait for it to...

436
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
And then I think,

437
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
and I didn't question this that much in college,

438
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,720
but I think sort of essential to this is that

439
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,800
it can't cure properly.

440
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,160
Like the better it heals,

441
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,080
the less cool the gang burn is gonna be.

442
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
Cause you definitely want some scarring going on there.

443
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,560
So is that a less painful option

444
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,400
than like pricking yourself with a needle?

445
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
It's less like ghoulish, I think.

446
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,800
Really?

447
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,680
Really, dog?

448
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,120
And probably funnier later.

449
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,720
Cause there are people that prick themselves

450
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
with like diabetic people,

451
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,200
prick themselves every day for their tests and shit.

452
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,280
Very few people burn themselves.

453
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,040
Yeah, unless they have like chronic leeches or something.

454
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,240
I didn't get one.

455
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,720
And I actually started thinking about this last week.

456
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,360
Like I kind of wished that I had

457
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
cause it would be kind of a funny story

458
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,960
and it would make me feel like,

459
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,920
oh, there's a real reminder I carry around for my college days.

460
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,320
And the thought crossed my mind

461
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
and then another thought crossed my mind

462
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,320
and I thought that ship's probably sailed.

463
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,680
I don't think I could get people over to my house

464
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,920
to watch me burn my arm with a lighter anymore.

465
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm 32 goddamn years old.

466
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
They have to take care of their kids

467
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
and they've got to work in the morning.

468
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,400
Right.

469
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,480
Can you gang brain yourself by like 9.30

470
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,600
cause I have to get home.

471
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,720
Why don't you,

472
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,640
if you want like visual reminders of your college age,

473
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
why don't you just get back into frosting your tips?

474
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,800
That could work.

475
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,080
I didn't have to frost my tips.

476
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,040
Yes, you did.

477
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,840
No, I didn't.

478
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,560
Yes, you did.

479
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,360
You would have frosted my tips.

480
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,560
There was a hair coloring.

481
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,360
You went with,

482
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,120
I think you went with what's her face to get it done

483
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
and there's some leftover stuff

484
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,600
and they were like,

485
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,960
we just put it in your hair and you're like,

486
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,520
okay.

487
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,920
And you came home and you fucking had your tips frosted.

488
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
Oh my God.

489
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
You're right.

490
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,040
I forgot.

491
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,560
That was not frosting my tips.

492
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,040
I was getting some highlights in cause you're right.

493
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,400
I did do home highlights and it went poorly.

494
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,920
Does it help you out that when I think of college Justin,

495
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,440
I think of fucking Justin McElroy hyphen Timberlake

496
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,840
from It's Gonna Be Me.

497
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,360
I wish I'd had that kind of salon quality highlighting.

498
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,320
It wasn't far off.

499
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,000
Thank you.

500
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
You know, it was my first time.

501
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,160
Shot for the stars.

502
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,440
So our next question asker got a new job.

503
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,720
She's, she handles reimbursions for gym memberships,

504
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,240
which their company gives out,

505
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
but the employees have to turn in their bank statements

506
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,960
to prove that they actually got this, right?

507
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
Uh, and usually they cross out the bank statements,

508
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,440
but she says one of her coworkers submitted his statement

509
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
without crossing anything out.

510
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,600
And I noticed that the monthly charge from the gym,

511
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,280
it was right below a monthly charge to max fun

512
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,640
on each month statement.

513
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
The problem is I just started working here

514
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,400
and this is literally the only thing I know about the guy.

515
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,320
How do I bring it up and bond with this dude

516
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,400
over our awesome taste and podcasts

517
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,360
without being crazy awkward or seeming like a total creeper?

518
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,160
That's from Sincerely, the new receptionist girl.

519
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,960
Oh, you can't.

520
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,040
I can.

521
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,120
Option one, go to maxfundstore.com.

522
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,360
Buy my brother, my brother.

523
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,040
Of course, Justin tries to work as much merch

524
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,280
into option one as he possibly can.

525
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
Option one merch.

526
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
If you want to go a little cheaper,

527
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,680
if he doesn't respond,

528
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,360
he probably doesn't listen to our show

529
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
and he listens to another show on Max Fund,

530
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
unlikely as that may be to consider.

531
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,000
So you gotta buy shirts from everybody.

532
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,880
Oh, buy a Jumbotron message calling him out.

533
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,320
I know you're a fan.

534
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,440
Or submit a question.

535
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,880
This guy is probably like, wait a minute, did I?

536
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,520
Did I cross out my bank statement?

537
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,080
Does she also know about my extreme restraints purposes?

538
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,440
Oh no.

539
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
You could start singing theme songs.

540
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
God knows I tried some awkward shit like that

541
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,720
in high school and college.

542
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,160
I can't remember anything specific.

543
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,080
But when you think someone's into something

544
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
and you're not like a regular human

545
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,040
who can just say, hey, I noticed on your bank statement

546
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,560
that I was looking at, okay, you're right.

547
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,480
There is no actually cool way to do that.

548
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
No, there was like a month and a half long period

549
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,480
in your life, Justin, where you were emboldened enough

550
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,920
to make that kind of leap,

551
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,240
to sing a theme song in front of somebody.

552
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,880
And I think it pretty much aligned perfectly

553
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
with when you had Frosted Tips.

554
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
They were highlights.

555
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,480
That was your power look.

556
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
I think that maybe you could just lock the information away

557
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,760
in your brain bank until maybe you just randomly

558
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
get to know this dude and then you can be like,

559
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
oh, I noticed I was doing the thing.

560
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
No, like you can't.

561
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,600
This is the thing though.

562
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,320
To look at anything that is not like Big Ted's muscle barn

563
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,720
on his bank statement is an invasion of his privacy.

564
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
She can't ever cop to it.

565
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
Yeah, because the thing above that,

566
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
the thing above that part on his statement could be

567
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,920
the Jerkoff Tavern.

568
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,000
Now, there's probably a better name for it,

569
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,280
but like a place where people go.

570
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,360
That's the weirdest bar I've ever heard of.

571
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,920
Yakov Jerkoff's Russian masturbation house.

572
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,320
It's like one of those places.

573
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,080
It's like a Japanese capsule hotel,

574
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,240
but-

575
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,680
Filled with Jerkoff capsules.

576
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,440
Masturbating in it, happening mostly.

577
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
Happening there inside the capsules.

578
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
And it's owned by Yakov Smirnoff.

579
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
And it's owned by him also.

580
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
He's really branching out.

581
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,160
He is branching out.

582
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,680
He's an entrepreneur.

583
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,200
He's got a show in Branson that I would trade anything

584
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,160
to go see.

585
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,720
It's like, you want to talk about my bucket list?

586
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
It's just that.

587
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,720
I believe he's had a show in Branson

588
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,640
for like 20 plus years.

589
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,680
Right.

590
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,440
And the fact that with every year,

591
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,200
it becomes more likely that he's going to say,

592
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
well, I've done it all.

593
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,560
Time to wrap up the show.

594
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,600
Time to die now.

595
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm going to walk into the ocean in Branson

596
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,720
and then I'll be like-

597
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
And have a dolphin murder me.

598
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,120
To put me out of my-

599
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,000
In my country, dolphin kills you.

600
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,160
How's that low-hanging fruit taste, Charlie?

601
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,800
It's pretty good.

602
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,560
It's low-hanging, Dominic.

603
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,120
Sweet.

604
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
I know it's a bit mealy, but that's okay.

605
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,720
I got a Yahoo sent in to us by Julie Martin.

606
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,600
Thank you, Julie Martin.

607
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,560
And I've got a conspiracy theory

608
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,440
because this question was asked three months ago

609
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,960
by Yahoo Answers user, Mins, who asks,

610
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,920
what would happen if a shark got caught

611
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,320
in a whirlpool or hurricane?

612
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,440
Wait a minute.

613
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,480
Hold on a second.

614
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,880
When you get sucked into a whirlpool,

615
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,680
you can't get out, most likely,

616
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,080
and you drown.

617
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,120
Sharks don't need oxygen,

618
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,400
so would anything happen to harm them?

619
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,960
Now about that hurricane.

620
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,440
Would the hurricane be strong enough

621
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,480
to carry the shark long enough

622
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,440
that it would fall onto land?

623
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,560
Sounds a little suspiciously familiar, doesn't it?

624
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,480
Yeah, that's a little sketchy.

625
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm not, I'm, listen,

626
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
we all experienced the same moment of magic

627
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
when we watched the Sharknado trailer together.

628
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,160
Well, not together, not like in the same room,

629
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,200
but like our fucking hearts and minds were connected

630
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,480
in a moment of joy.

631
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,160
Not because of the quality of the film itself,

632
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,120
there was terror also.

633
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
But the fact that we live in a world

634
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,480
where that harbors a beautiful mind

635
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
capable of dreaming up Sharknado.

636
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
And now that fucking perception

637
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,120
that magic moment I had is fucking ruined

638
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,680
because I think they're just dumpster diving

639
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,920
into Yahoo Answers.

640
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
Looking for topics that-

641
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,720
Looking for topics to make their movies about.

642
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,080
Do you think they could put together

643
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
an entire movie in three months?

644
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
I think Sci-Fi can put an entire movie together

645
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,160
in three and a half days.

646
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,480
I think they have to get,

647
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,520
I think they have Lorenzo Lamas on Container,

648
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
on Retainer.

649
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,400
They have him in a container.

650
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,480
They have him in a container.

651
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,560
They gave Lorenzo Lamas a Retainer.

652
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,240
In a container that they keep downstairs.

653
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,360
They go downstairs to say,

654
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,560
hey, Lorenzo, he's like,

655
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,160
food time, feed, feed.

656
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
And they say, no, not feed time, not feed feed.

657
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,280
We're doing a movie.

658
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,560
It's about sharks and tornadoes.

659
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,040
Are you in?

660
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,160
Yeah, this is gonna sound cynical.

661
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,480
We'll give you four walnuts, Lorenzo.

662
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,160
Excellent.

663
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,240
This is gonna sound cynical,

664
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,360
so I apologize in advance,

665
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,720
but you look at Ancient Rome, right?

666
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,800
And you look at the fall of Ancient Rome

667
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,200
and people say, you think about all the,

668
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,720
that civilization was producing such amazing things.

669
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
If it had continued on,

670
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,440
who knows how far we could have gotten.

671
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,320
But I think if you look at America

672
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,240
as sort of an empire that's had a really good run,

673
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,040
I think we may have gone sort of past,

674
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,480
like if we were to fall tomorrow

675
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,680
and history dictated the rise and fall of America,

676
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,960
considering the fall was like post Sharknado,

677
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,120
I think we've kind of done

678
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,600
all that we were maybe constructed to do.

679
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,080
If you will pardon the pun,

680
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,920
I believe we may have jumped the Sharknado as a country,

681
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,800
just as a whole concept.

682
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,280
Well, first of all, nothing can jump a Sharknado.

683
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,840
Fucking space shuttles can't escape orbit

684
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,880
when there's a Sharknado.

685
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,320
Fair enough.

686
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,360
And also, if you're saying that Sharknado

687
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,560
is the peak that things are going to start descending from,

688
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,080
then you obviously did not see Megafault

689
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,760
starring Brittany Murphy, her final obit.

690
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,260
No.

691
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
I'm saying we peaked at like,

692
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,400
in like with like The Godfather, maybe.

693
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,280
Like that was where we should have gone out on.

694
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,400
And then after that, it was all Sharknado and Cloud Atlas,

695
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,360
and it's all just been sort of downhill from-

696
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,120
Are Cloud Atlas and Sharknado on the same level of movie?

697
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,960
Well, they're based on the same book.

698
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,080
Oh, Tom Hanks plays nine of the sharks in Sharknado.

699
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,760
And you know what?

700
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,640
He is brilliant.

701
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,880
He is electrifying.

702
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
Tom Hanks is in a new movie where he plays Walt Disney

703
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,720
and he's all shook, smiling, happy Walt Disney.

704
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,280
And it makes me feel like I'm a crazy person

705
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,120
because are we just all going to pretend

706
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,440
he wasn't a huge anti-Semite?

707
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,520
Like on the reg, professional anti-Semite all the time,

708
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,680
all day, every day, hating Jews.

709
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,320
Like are we going to pretend that that's not the case

710
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,680
and just make a movie about him?

711
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,880
Is Disney producing the film?

712
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,680
Because if so, that's a fucking master-

713
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,200
That's a masterful move on their part.

714
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,080
Because even if Tom Hanks was an IRL,

715
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,880
if you could attribute all of the terrible things

716
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,280
that Mel Gibson has ever done to Tom Hanks,

717
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,040
people wouldn't give a fuck about it.

718
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,840
We would be forgiving him like mid-sentence.

719
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,480
Because of that half chubby face of his is so lovable.

720
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
Let's make some money of our own.

721
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,960
Let's not leave it all for Tom Hanks of Walt Disney.

722
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:14,560
Let's go to Moneys of Gold.

723
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,280
I met this guy this weekend named Warby Parker.

724
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,120
He's a scientist and his specialty is glasses.

725
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,000
He's bifocals.

726
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
He's bifocals.

727
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,840
So my buddy Warby, he says to me,

728
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
Justin, this has gone far enough.

729
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,240
Glasses should not cost as much as an iPhone.

730
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm going to sell prescription glasses starting at $95,

731
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,920
including prescription lenses.

732
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
Forget about it.

733
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,920
And I'm like, Warby, you've lost your mind.

734
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,880
Quick question, Justin.

735
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,000
What is Warby short for?

736
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,680
Warbleton.

737
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,120
So Warby says to me,

738
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
I know what you're thinking.

739
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
It's a crazy idea selling glasses on the internet

740
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,920
because you don't get to try them on.

741
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,120
He's like, so here's my plan.

742
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm going to send people five pairs of glasses.

743
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,080
But they only wanted one.

744
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,080
Why is he burying his audience in glasses?

745
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,560
Warbleton is very forceful with his product.

746
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,920
You're going to send him back four of them,

747
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,280
and then you keep one.

748
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,360
All smashed, smashed to bits.

749
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,400
Smashed to bits.

750
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,080
I hate these, and this one, and this one.

751
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,880
And I hate them all.

752
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,360
What did Warbleton call this program?

753
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,160
He's not very clever.

754
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,000
He called it the home try-on program.

755
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,760
He needs some help there.

756
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,920
But it is a pretty good idea.

757
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,400
And he does non-prescription polarized sunglasses

758
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,000
from 95 bucks and prescription polarized sunglasses

759
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,160
from $150.

760
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,880
And get this.

761
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,400
This is sort of the cherry on top.

762
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,120
For every pair of glasses he sells,

763
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,920
he's very generous.

764
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,440
He's going to distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

765
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,480
This guy Warby is making it fucking rain bifocals.

766
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
I know everybody.

767
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,800
I don't need glasses, and I'm going to start because of this.

768
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,040
I'm going to go to warbyparker.com.

769
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,440
That's W-A-R-B-Y-P-A-R-K-E-R dot com.

770
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,600
And here's the sweetest part.

771
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,400
He said if you enter the code MYBROTHER, all one word,

772
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,240
then you can get new glasses in three business days

773
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,400
rather than the usual however long it takes.

774
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,280
Longer than that.

775
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,040
10 usually, I think.

776
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,240
10 business days usually.

777
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,760
He's going to give them to you in three

778
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,560
because he's so tight with me, Justin McElroy.

779
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,840
So go to warbyparker.com.

780
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,280
I'm glad you met Warby Parker.

781
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,400
I know, he seems like a good dude.

782
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,760
Go to warbyparker.com, use the coupon code MYBROTHER,

783
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,200
and get those glasses fast and get your face right.

784
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,520
What if you have 10 eyeballs?

785
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,640
Can you keep all the glasses?

786
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,320
I think you can, but I think you're going to pay a premium.

787
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,400
Yeah, a mutant premium.

788
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,560
I have a message to listener Eric with a Y

789
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,520
from his cousins, the Regan brothers,

790
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,080
who says, hi, Eric, we know that chemo blows,

791
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,160
so we wanted to say, hey, cheer up.

792
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,920
The Mubim Bam brothers totes rejected

793
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,680
your cancer etiquette question,

794
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,160
so we wanted to give you a chance to finally hear them,

795
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,560
their premium colon cancer goose.

796
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,080
Hopefully it makes all the nausea and fatigue

797
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,120
go down a little easier.

798
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,400
Signed, Tom, Joe, John, and Pete.

799
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,160
Hey, Tom, Joe, John, and Pete, go fuck yourselves.

800
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,120
Wow, guys, just because you pay to do a message like this,

801
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,960
you think this means you can just abuse us?

802
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
We're not dancing monkeys.

803
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,800
Do you guys like how quixotically

804
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I just charged into that message?

805
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,000
That was a sensitive message, a very accusatory message.

806
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,960
It was.

807
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,160
I was just like, fuck it, let's just do this thing.

808
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
I felt attacked a little bit.

809
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,920
Did you feel attacked by Griffin?

810
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,040
Because I feel like that a lot.

811
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,640
Basically, I mean, not like verbally.

812
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,760
Griffin was just a messenger.

813
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm not going to fall in for that.

814
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,800
Griffin's also kind of a dig.

815
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,760
Hey, shut the fuck up.

816
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,680
Hey, Eric, get feeling better, buddy.

817
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,280
Yeah, beat that thing.

818
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,560
Yeah, Eric, we love your ass.

819
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,120
Wait, not the part of your ass that has cancer, of course.

820
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,160
We just want that gone.

821
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,760
Not the cancer, the part of your ass can stay,

822
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,040
but the cancer on it sucks.

823
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,320
Get out of here.

824
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,120
Get out of here, you.

825
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,720
Max Hayes, and I got a message to you from,

826
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,880
and this is just what was written here,

827
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,480
so I have to read what's here.

828
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,720
Philly cheesesteak and kiwi.

829
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,560
They say, happy birthday to MBMBAM's biggest Canadian fan.

830
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,640
Maxie, we love you, and this is the best

831
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,880
slash most appropriate gift we could think of for you.

832
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,080
Wish we could see you in person when you hear this,

833
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,880
but such is life.

834
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,480
That's from, he says, PS, Mario Lopez dispenser.

835
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,200
Maybe that's perhaps a private joke that they stole from us.

836
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,520
Yeah, and it's not so private, because we said it a while ago,

837
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,020
TM.

838
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,560
Happy birthday, TM.

839
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,440
Happy birthday, TM, to Max Hayes, and I hope it's a great one,

840
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,680
and I hope you can introduce us to your friends,

841
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,240
Philly cheesesteak and kiwi.

842
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,880
Which is also what I'm going to have for lunch,

843
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,960
so thank you for putting that idea into my head.

844
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,920
That classic joke.

845
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,280
I will move on to this, Travis.

846
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,440
You know, I have a little anecdote.

847
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,640
So, today, or no, a couple days ago,

848
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,520
while hunting for props for our upcoming show,

849
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,800
I found myself in an adult store.

850
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,000
Is the show too huge dicks of Verona?

851
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Well, I needed some handcuffs for non-sensual purposes,

852
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,080
and I stopped into an adult store that I will not say the name of,

853
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,280
because I don't want to cause any bad blood,

854
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,320
but let's just say it was named after an adult magazine,

855
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,320
and it was the skeeziest place with poor selection

856
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,400
and not quality product I've ever been in.

857
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,960
I felt dirty, and I felt wrong,

858
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,920
and I did not hold a candle to Extreme Restraints.

859
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,600
Why didn't you just go to Extreme Restraints?

860
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,880
Because I needed it, I needed it fast.

861
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,080
I needed it that day.

862
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,580
Yeah.

863
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:26,100
Now, to be clear, Extreme Restraints may not be able to get you sexual toys that day,

864
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,180
but they do get them to you fast.

865
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,460
It's the world's greatest, in my opinion, adult superstore.

866
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,100
No, fuck that.

867
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,980
That's not opinion.

868
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,420
That shit is fact.

869
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,060
That shit, we have categorical evidence to support the fact

870
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,620
that it's the best sex site in the world.

871
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,140
It's the best site in the world.

872
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,180
Fuck Google.

873
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,900
Sorry, Google.

874
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,220
It's also, they actually are changing the name of the site to fuck Google.

875
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,720
Got you.

876
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,820
Penis pumps, penis pump accessory, large penis pump pills.

877
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,340
These are small penis pump pills.

878
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,300
Small penis, but these are just a few.

879
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,860
Maybe your penis is too big, and you want to make your penis smaller.

880
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,580
These are just a few things that I've bought from ExtremeRestraints.com,

881
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,340
and you can get some of your own.

882
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,340
It's like the fucking eat me, drink me stuff from Alice in Wonderland.

883
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,420
You have to take the large penis pills,

884
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,540
but then you have to have a small one to balance it out.

885
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
If you want to get anything done with your day,

886
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,300
you have to take the small penis pill,

887
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
or else you are exhausted by midday.

888
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,980
This company is fantastic.

889
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,660
They've always been so good to us.

890
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,180
We love them very, very, very much,

891
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,620
and we hope you'll go support them,

892
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,260
and use the coupon code Sexabunga,

893
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,780
and you can save 20% at ExtremeRestraints.com.

894
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,500
I hope you'll shame-

895
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,100
I love that every time you say Sexabunga, you get so just happy.

896
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
It's such a good code word.

897
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,580
It is, and it'll be here for maybe another week.

898
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,580
I'm just sad.

899
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,220
I don't want to be a defeatist, but hackers are everywhere,

900
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,420
especially Chinese hackers.

901
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,340
We get hit like a million times a day.

902
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,740
Hackers.

903
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,420
WikiLeaks.

904
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,860
It's all-

905
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,060
We asked Snowden to build us a fucking firewall,

906
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,180
but he couldn't because he didn't have corporeal hands.

907
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,500
Yes, I'm still working on it, brother.

908
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:08,980
Thank you.

909
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,460
Thank you, Gust-

910
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,660
I will have it to you soon.

911
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,620
Thank you, Gustin.

912
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,340
Let's move on.

913
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,260
When will it be done, you ask?

914
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,540
It's a secret.

915
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,040
Okay.

916
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,220
Hi, everybody.

917
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,500
My name's Justin McElroy.

918
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,260
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

919
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,540
I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

920
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,380
Yeah, you told me to introduce myself that way.

921
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,380
We're the newest addition to the Maximum Fun family.

922
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,660
Our show is called Sawbones.

923
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,020
It's a medical history program where we detail all the dumb,

924
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,380
hurtful, stupid ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

925
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,580
Have you tried to put mercury on your syphilis shanker?

926
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,900
Yep.

927
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,140
Or maybe you tried to drill a hole in your head

928
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,940
because you heard it would reduce your blood-brain volume.

929
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,620
It probably didn't work.

930
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,020
But the good news is you're in great company.

931
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,740
You can hear all about it every Friday on Sawbones,

932
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,420
right here on Maximum Fun.

933
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,820
I'm a chronologically-

934
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,320
Fuck.

935
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,820
Nope.

936
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,220
I'm a chronically forgetful gentleman

937
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,460
who constantly loses everyday things,

938
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,860
keys, wallet, phone, et cetera.

939
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,380
After losing my wallet several times,

940
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,100
my aunt bought me one with a chain on it for my birthday.

941
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,220
I found it very convenient.

942
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,300
I don't think you need to read the rest of the question.

943
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,660
First off, I just want to say,

944
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,820
do you know how often you have to lose your wallet

945
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,500
for word to get back to your aunt?

946
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,940
The answer is a lot.

947
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,500
Problem is the fashion statement I'm making with this wallet

948
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,700
is not consistent with my intended persona.

949
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,180
This question asker works in a government office.

950
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,060
He's 27 years old and he just doesn't think it fits with his look.

951
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,380
So he asks, am I good or is the stigma as bad as I fear?

952
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,820
It's from Shackled in Silver Spring, Maryland.

953
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,060
It's the worst you can fear, unfortunately.

954
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,620
Yeah.

955
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,020
I hate to be the bearer of bad news that you already know.

956
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,180
Would it be worse if the wallet was on one of those like

957
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,260
janitor zipline key things?

958
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,500
No, Travis.

959
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,100
That would be fucking awesome.

960
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,580
It's like, this popcorn's going to be $6.50.

961
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,500
And you're like, okay, zip, money, zip zap.

962
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,020
And you just let it go from your hands

963
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,380
and it flies back into your butt.

964
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,180
That's the best.

965
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,300
That would be awesome.

966
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,580
That'd be a pretty dope move.

967
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,500
Here's the thing about it.

968
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,020
As you get older, question asker,

969
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,540
you'll find that things that would be otherwise convenient

970
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,020
or sensible, but aren't fitting,

971
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,020
you have to fight against those because like,

972
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,300
that's how grandpas start wearing glasses

973
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,820
with like the rope tied to them.

974
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,820
Because like, oh, my glasses are always falling off.

975
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,100
I have to have a glasses rope.

976
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,620
Well, no, you don't.

977
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,060
And it's making you look so old right now.

978
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,060
But it's like a weird bell curve.

979
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,140
Because when you're a kid, you're just like,

980
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,380
I'm just going to like Velcro my shoes together.

981
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,740
That's so much easier.

982
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,580
But then like when you're an adult, you can't do it.

983
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,220
But then when you're an old person, bam, back to Velcro.

984
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,540
But it has nothing to do with age.

985
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,380
You can't have a wallet chain and Velcro shoes

986
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,460
when you're head to toe Armani.

987
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,820
What are you fucking talking about?

988
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,980
Imagine an old ass man with like a wallet chain.

989
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,260
Picture it.

990
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,980
I can actually see it in my mind's eye.

991
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,540
It's pretty great.

992
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,300
Oh, you know what'd be great?

993
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,460
You can do what they do at like gas stations and shit

994
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,060
to make sure that people don't steal keys.

995
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,300
Or you attach like a big, like a plank

996
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,420
or like a toilet seat, attach a toilet seat to your wallet.

997
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,260
Put your wallet on like a tire rim.

998
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,780
And then just you have to carry that around with you

999
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,420
all the time.

1000
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,020
And people will be like, you have a toilet seat

1001
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,620
and a tire rim hanging out of your pants.

1002
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,300
I don't know what I do.

1003
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,980
I don't think you need them both.

1004
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,300
Let's talk about, I have a brief anecdote

1005
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,460
about convenience versus perception.

1006
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:53,700
Okay.

1007
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,860
My wife discovered a pizza bread in the fridge

1008
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,660
and she knew that I got pizza bread for lunch

1009
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,420
delivered from Gino's Pub and Family Fun Center.

1010
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,860
So she said, did you not eat your pizza bread

1011
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,900
that you ordered for lunch?

1012
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:17,060
And I told her what I had done is ordered two of them

1013
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,900
because of a lunch concept I call doubles,

1014
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,020
where if I get two of something for lunch-

1015
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,180
A popular style of playing tennis.

1016
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,540
This lunch, in this lunch concept,

1017
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,260
if I get doubles of something I'm getting for lunch,

1018
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,420
then tomorrow lunch is sorted.

1019
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,940
So I don't have to think about it again.

1020
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,860
And my wife informed me that this is an unacceptable practice.

1021
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,780
I've been doing this for years with dinner

1022
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,620
and it is completely fine.

1023
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,300
Order two dinners at a restaurant,

1024
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,500
box them up, bam, lunch.

1025
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,940
I've actually been there when you do that.

1026
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,860
And the shame that it brings to my family is crippling.

1027
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,620
Justin, can I ask why you have,

1028
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,180
if you're going to go to town,

1029
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,780
you might as well go into Lincoln.

1030
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,940
Why not Monday morning order septuples?

1031
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,860
You've envisioned a world in which I, Justin McElroy,

1032
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,420
husband of a doctor,

1033
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,980
am going to eat seven day old pizza bread.

1034
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,580
Or a world where the Gino's cashier answers the phone

1035
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,380
and says, what do you need?

1036
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,060
Seven pizza breads, huh?

1037
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,700
Can't do that.

1038
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,900
I can't in good conscience do this for you.

1039
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,660
Can't actually add that many up.

1040
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,860
Don't know how much it costs.

1041
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,300
No one orders that many.

1042
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,180
The keys only go up to four on our board.

1043
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,140
I don't know what to tell you.

1044
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,700
If we try to go above that government regulators swoop in

1045
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,740
and say, you are killing this man.

1046
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,700
My point is that just because something is a good idea

1047
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,940
doesn't mean that it's going to make people around you

1048
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,100
think that you're smart.

1049
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,820
I mean, you just have to stop losing your wallet.

1050
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,180
You know, I lose stuff a lot

1051
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,300
because I have a tendency to like,

1052
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,540
absentmindedly sit stuff down and then just keep going.

1053
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,660
And it's like, I know that I've sat my keys down at some point,

1054
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,780
but I can't picture where.

1055
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,300
And what I do, and it's not exactly like a very proud moment,

1056
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,980
but I'll just loudly announce,

1057
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,620
like I'm setting my keys on the dresser

1058
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,420
and make it active.

1059
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,260
It's pretty dorky, but it works and I don't lose shit anymore.

1060
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,100
Do you ever sing a little song?

1061
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,860
Dresser keys, dresser keys.

1062
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,660
Will you be there when I need?

1063
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,260
Putting my wallet on the toilet paper dispenser

1064
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,860
in the bathroom.

1065
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,980
Gotta do it.

1066
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,620
Gotta do it.

1067
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,540
What if there's pee on the floor?

1068
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,140
It's okay if it gets on my pants.

1069
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,140
I'm just wearing these for one day.

1070
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,940
But who am I?

1071
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,700
Mister buy a new wallet every week

1072
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,780
when I get pee on it guy.

1073
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,280
No.

1074
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,460
Toilet paper wallet.

1075
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,540
You're my best friend and I love you.

1076
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,420
You know, people say Widow Yankovic has lost his step,

1077
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:02,100
but I think his tunes are as fresh as they were in the 80s.

1078
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,380
Is there anything worse than getting

1079
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,900
another person's pee on your stuff?

1080
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,040
Poop?

1081
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,940
Even that seems more...

1082
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,380
Anyway, you guys want a Yahoo?

1083
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,520
Please.

1084
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,700
I got toilet paper wallet stuck in my head.

1085
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,340
You jingles are back.

1086
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,740
This Yahoo was sent in by Ninja Farmer's Wife.

1087
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,500
Thank you, Ninja Farmer's Wife.

1088
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,980
It's by Yahoo answers user Cory Lucas who asks,

1089
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,820
does dunking at 5'10 attract women?

1090
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,860
I can dunk and I'm 5'10.

1091
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,100
Will that improve my chances of scoring with a girl?

1092
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,380
The funny thing about this,

1093
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,660
what it immediately my immediate first impressions

1094
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,580
is how funny it is to me that every time we got a question

1095
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,820
very early on about like a sports car

1096
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,900
and picking up women and stuff like that.

1097
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,780
That idea of like there being this one magical thing,

1098
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,700
like if I could just, you know,

1099
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,620
if I could just play golf better,

1100
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,380
if I could just run faster,

1101
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,900
but you know, I don't know what women there are

1102
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,220
that said they go, oh, that gentleman can dunk.

1103
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,740
I definitely want to copulate with him.

1104
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,100
And he is not that tall.

1105
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,940
That is very impressive.

1106
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,700
Compared to other basketball men.

1107
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,460
Perhaps they'd make a wonderful partner for sexual Congress.

1108
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,860
Yes, why on earth would this woman be watching

1109
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,420
amateur dumpsters on her lunch break?

1110
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,020
You are going to have to be a pretty smooth operator

1111
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,700
to be at a bar and be like,

1112
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,260
by the way, I got something special to show you.

1113
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,940
Why don't you come with me down to the Y

1114
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,340
and I can show you my special skill.

1115
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,380
I know the janitor, he'll leave the key under the mat.

1116
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,780
I am secretly, I am the janitor

1117
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,020
and we're just going to go inside

1118
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,620
and I'm going to show you something on the court.

1119
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,820
It might take me a few tries.

1120
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,380
I'm a wee little man.

1121
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,900
It's going to take me a few tries

1122
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,820
to build up the courage to jump that high.

1123
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,540
Do you think it's more or less impressive

1124
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,820
when he just hangs there for a while

1125
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,020
because he's afraid to drop down?

1126
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,380
Because it's such a long drop.

1127
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,140
Imagine this guy who goes through all the trouble

1128
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,660
and successfully moves a woman back to the Y with him.

1129
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,860
He's like, okay, here we go.

1130
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,260
And he jumps too high and goes, oh God, sorry.

1131
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,100
This isn't, this never happens.

1132
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,900
I always dunk it.

1133
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,260
I usually take it to the paint so hard

1134
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,060
and I don't get scared like a big guy.

1135
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,700
No, I'm serious.

1136
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,340
The guys jokingly call me Brian Dunkleman.

1137
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,580
That's what they say because I'm so good at dunks.

1138
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,940
I am also Brian Dunkleman and the janitor here.

1139
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:43,300
They call me Brian Dunkleman because that's who I am

1140
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,420
and that's what I've been doing.

1141
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,020
That's the name my parents gave me.

1142
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,660
So it's kind of a fun joke.

1143
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,620
Like my life.

1144
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,820
No, not like my life.

1145
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,300
I'm so sad.

1146
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,060
Thank you for coming back to the Y with me.

1147
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,580
Could you close the door on your way out?

1148
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,820
Brian, if you're listening, we're sorry.

1149
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,020
It's just a joke.

1150
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm sure you're doing something.

1151
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,500
The first time I read this question,

1152
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,340
I thought it was asking if dunking at 5 10 p.m.

1153
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:10,900
Oh man, it works out.

1154
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,780
Or 5 10 a.m.

1155
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,580
Maybe twice a day.

1156
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,140
Works out.

1157
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,260
I gotta fucking hurry.

1158
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,260
I've got a very narrow window to dunk.

1159
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,380
It's like on the equinox.

1160
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,420
You can stand an egg on his head at 5 10.

1161
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,540
This particular person, the Earth's gravitational pull

1162
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,260
has released him enough for him to get ups.

1163
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,140
Is it possible that he means that the rim is set at 5 10?

1164
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,180
And all he has to do is like lift his feet?

1165
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,140
I don't think that's going to be particularly impressive

1166
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,460
to a woman or a man or a dog.

1167
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,580
Maybe this is a child, like a seven-year-old,

1168
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,540
and then it'd be very impressive.

1169
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,180
If this is a 5 10 fucking seven-year-old,

1170
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,060
everyone get in your cars and drive into the woods,

1171
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,260
because that's where you live now.

1172
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,620
We have a Titan situation.

1173
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,620
Hey, I got another question for you guys.

1174
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:03,220
The question asker asks, I need vices.

1175
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,780
I don't like tobacco.

1176
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,060
I don't smoke pot.

1177
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,540
Due to medical problems, I can't drink alcohol anymore.

1178
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,740
I even have a low tolerance for caffeine.

1179
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,980
I hate going to parties with other 20-somethings,

1180
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,780
because inevitably, I'm the weird guy standing around

1181
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,500
drinking water while everyone else has.

1182
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,860
I'm the weird guy standing around drinking water

1183
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,980
while everyone else has fun.

1184
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,500
Any suggestions for stuff to do?

1185
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,900
That's from least cool person ever in Corvallis, Oregon.

1186
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,260
You could be the guy that takes naps at parties.

1187
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,340
That's pretty good advice.

1188
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,860
Sloth is a pretty good sin.

1189
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,740
If you think about it, smoking pot and drinking alcohol

1190
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,980
are really just leading to you getting sleepy

1191
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,180
and falling asleep.

1192
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,340
So just jump the middleman

1193
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,260
and just go straight for the sleepy time.

1194
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,500
And then there's also meth.

1195
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,060
Wait, hear me out.

1196
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,300
Meth?

1197
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,340
What about meth light?

1198
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,340
Have you tried new meth, crystal meth?

1199
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,460
You know, I'm into those e-cigarettes.

1200
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,980
It's harmless, it makes everything smell better,

1201
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,420
and there's no danger of tobacco.

1202
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,220
It's perfect.

1203
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,100
That's true.

1204
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,180
But you know, there was a foolish time in college

1205
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,460
in which I had decided not to drink anymore.

1206
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,500
And I understand this problem

1207
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,540
because I remember standing there.

1208
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,460
I think I was drinking a Gatorade

1209
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,380
where like everyone else is getting drunk.

1210
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,300
And like the worst afternoon of his life.

1211
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,740
You never feel more out of place and like,

1212
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,980
I should just go because everyone else

1213
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,540
is on a different train than I am.

1214
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,740
My train has stopped and is not going anywhere

1215
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,860
and everyone else is just powering towards Fun Station.

1216
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,540
And Shining Time Station.

1217
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,180
Travis's train has been placed outside

1218
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,180
a novelty train restaurant

1219
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,860
and children are climbing on it.

1220
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,340
Here's how I read this sentence.

1221
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,140
Due to medical problems,

1222
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,420
he can't drink alcohol anymore.

1223
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,460
Okay, scratch off the list.

1224
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,220
I don't like tobacco.

1225
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,340
Fine, scratch off the list.

1226
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,380
I don't smoke pot.

1227
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,700
You could.

1228
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,340
You're just saying that you don't now.

1229
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,300
So you're saying the question should read

1230
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,340
I don't smoke pot and then parenthetically yet.

1231
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,900
Yeah, I'm saying that this that's a thing.

1232
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,940
That's one of the things.

1233
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,260
Your answer's in the question.

1234
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,940
It's right there.

1235
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,700
You should probably also stop drinking water.

1236
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,460
Drink like a soda.

1237
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,820
No, you need to definitely hydrate.

1238
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,380
If you're gonna be smoking so much kush,

1239
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,260
you need to hydrate because of all the nasty ARB

1240
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,620
you're gonna be chiefin.

1241
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,100
You gotta fill your lungs with water.

1242
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,580
And make sure you have some Skittles on hand.

1243
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,300
You gotta Skittle late because you're gonna want this.

1244
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,220
You get high enough, you press them together

1245
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,380
and you make all sculptures.

1246
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:03,140
I always thought that Munchies was one of those,

1247
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,460
a funny thing to say that's not actually accurate.

1248
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,060
I have never felt a hunger.

1249
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,740
It's a righteous hunger.

1250
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,220
The first time that I tried marijuana,

1251
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,300
oh God, I wanted to eat everything.

1252
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,980
What other drugs have you done, Justin?

1253
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,180
Pretty much.

1254
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,660
Nani, unless you're listening.

1255
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,780
Nani's definitely listening.

1256
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,820
Our daddy's listening.

1257
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,300
Our daddy knows about our salvia trips.

1258
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:31,860
But that's it.

1259
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,420
That's true.

1260
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,620
I did shrooms once.

1261
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,180
Because at night we cleanin' out our closet.

1262
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,540
I did shrooms.

1263
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,220
I ate an entire pizza

1264
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,060
because the flavor was just so amazing.

1265
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,660
You guys are going ride or die.

1266
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,900
I'm not going ride or die.

1267
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,260
I'm locking my shit up.

1268
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:52,580
Okay, great.

1269
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,700
I killed a man once.

1270
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,060
We didn't need to end the show,

1271
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,060
but I need to share my true shroom story.

1272
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,540
Did I ever talk about this in the show?

1273
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,900
I don't think I did.

1274
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,260
No, I don't think we've ever discussed

1275
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,980
our hardcore drug use on the show before, Justin.

1276
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,300
Okay, so I tried shrooms.

1277
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,140
I probably did too many for my first time.

1278
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:09,700
That's life.

1279
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,820
And I'm at a friend's birthday party.

1280
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,100
Let me show her my nameless.

1281
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,420
We're there for 30 minutes.

1282
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,260
And I remember somebody played the,

1283
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,220
you know that slow motion Olsen Twins video?

1284
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,740
Oh huh, pizza party.

1285
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,700
Yeah, pizza party.

1286
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,500
So we're watching that.

1287
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,260
I'm thinking, man, I'm getting pretty high.

1288
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,660
And then my friend's family shows up

1289
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,620
to this party, his dad and his brother.

1290
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,780
So at that point, I've lost my mind.

1291
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,180
Oh God, this is really happening.

1292
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,940
And so when I noticed him coming in,

1293
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,100
I noticed that his brother is carrying

1294
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,220
what appears to be a cake shaped like a giant penis

1295
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,820
and a cake shaped like a vagina.

1296
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,060
And I thought, oh my God, these drugs

1297
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,820
have not only taken hold.

1298
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,860
I am like in a full, you know,

1299
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,620
I'm in a full Hunter S. Thompson-esque delusion

1300
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,260
at this point.

1301
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,340
I have lost my grip on reality.

1302
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:17,220
As it happens, when my friend came under

1303
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,860
the influence of these hallucinogenics,

1304
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,700
he had called his brother and said

1305
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,700
that he wanted him to make him a cake shaped

1306
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,100
like a penis and another one shaped like a vagina.

1307
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,940
And his brother, who is apparently

1308
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,980
the best brother in the world,

1309
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,980
acquiesced to this request.

1310
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,500
And this is a real cake.

1311
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,180
And actually the reality of that cake

1312
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,860
is something that helped keep me grounded

1313
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,900
for the rest of the night.

1314
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,660
Because whenever things got too scary,

1315
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,660
I would return to the room with a cake shaped

1316
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,620
like a penis and remember that I wasn't so far gone.

1317
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,420
I wish I had done Shroomstream my dolphin experience.

1318
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,820
Can you imagine?

1319
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,260
I can't.

1320
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,340
It would have been like living a real life

1321
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,460
Lisa Frank drawing.

1322
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,060
Listen, we've had a lot of fun here today,

1323
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,420
but it's time to get serious.

1324
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:01,700
Thank you.

1325
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,060
Drugs are bad and you shouldn't.

1326
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,060
Well, only do drugs that are natural

1327
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,100
out of the ground drugs.

1328
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,700
The ones that Jesus made for you.

1329
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,500
Thank you so much for listening.

1330
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,060
You're the best.

1331
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,980
We want to tell you about something really neat.

1332
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,580
We have entered into a partnership, a team up.

1333
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,140
A collabo.

1334
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,060
A collabo with Operation Supply Drop.

1335
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,740
So our friend Tristan the Marine is over in Afghanistan

1336
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,740
defending our freedom and we want to send him

1337
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,380
a little something.

1338
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,660
What Operation Supply Drop does is they get collections

1339
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:40,180
of gaming goodness together and they ship them

1340
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,540
over to our fighting men and women.

1341
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,500
And we're going to do that for Tristan the Marine.

1342
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,340
He's over there with some of his buddies

1343
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,380
providing intelligence support operations

1344
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:56,180
and it looks like they could use some fun.

1345
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,140
They could use some laughs.

1346
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,660
So we're going to send them a bunch of video games.

1347
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,260
We're raising money and also raising actual games.

1348
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,460
We got something lying around the house

1349
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,940
you want to donate or you just want to donate some money

1350
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,060
or you can't do that.

1351
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,180
You just want to spread the word.

1352
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,220
Anything would be awesome.

1353
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,780
Go to operationsupplydrop.org

1354
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,460
and you're going to see Modron Era.

1355
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,620
That's the name of our supply drop that we're doing.

1356
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,380
We want to make it big.

1357
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,060
We want to send them a lot of cool stuff

1358
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,660
and we'd love it if you could go and pitch in a few bucks.

1359
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,700
It's at operationsupplydrop.org.

1360
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:30,180
His top two requests are for a GameCube for controllers

1361
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,700
and a copy of Super Smash Brothers

1362
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,300
and Game Boy Advance SPs with Pokemon games

1363
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,260
and cables for trading.

1364
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,500
How do you know?

1365
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,940
Our army rules.

1366
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,060
It's the fucking best.

1367
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,060
Certainly we could do that.

1368
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,980
So please go help them out.

1369
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,300
You got till August 11th, but don't hesitate.

1370
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,260
Don't wait.

1371
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:48,900
Go now.

1372
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,620
Go help them out and help spread the word.

1373
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,940
Don't send them regular Game Boy Advances.

1374
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,140
Those were terrible.

1375
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,900
Give them the SPs.

1376
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,380
They need it.

1377
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:57,860
They need them.

1378
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,500
They're compact.

1379
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,940
They can fit into their fatigues.

1380
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,420
They're not going to get any sand in those.

1381
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,460
They're not going to get any sand.

1382
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:03,940
They fold up.

1383
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,980
They're sand proof.

1384
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,260
They can hold them over their heads

1385
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,020
when they walk through the sand rivers.

1386
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,260
The non-backlit Game Boy Advance.

1387
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,660
You can't see that in that hot Afghanistan sign.

1388
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,340
They're going to fucking think they're catching a Mewtwo

1389
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,660
and it's a dodo.

1390
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,340
And they're going to be so disappointed.

1391
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,460
And they're not going to be able to go on.

1392
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,540
They're not going to have the strength or will to fight.

1393
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,060
And then we're going to lose this war.

1394
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,260
And it's going to be your fault for sitting on this shitty model

1395
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,980
that Nintendo led the Game Boy Advance generation with.

1396
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,060
For some reason, I just don't understand it.

1397
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,900
Kids don't need to see outside, do they?

1398
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,860
Cool, cool.

1399
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,060
Just go and launch that product.

1400
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,220
Pretty good product, Nintendo.

1401
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,740
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the program.

1402
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:48,340
People like Patrick, Doug Piker, Mitch Reeder, Portland Resident,

1403
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,660
Sean Melzmer, Kathleen Duffy, Miles Tostel,

1404
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,220
Andrew Tennison, Jeff Fowler, Stymie.

1405
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,380
Thank you for tweeting about the show.

1406
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,580
Please share with a friend.

1407
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,180
That's the only way we can grow.

1408
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,620
Let me just say really quick that Sega launched the Game Gear

1409
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,220
years before the Game Boy Advance

1410
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,340
and managed to figure out that people want backlit screens.

1411
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:12,980
Yes, government.

1412
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,820
But to be fair, the Game Gear killed its batteries in 2.3 seconds.

1413
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,660
Yeah, but it was an illuminated 2.3 seconds.

1414
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,340
It was fully colored as well.

1415
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,540
And it was beautiful for a second.

1416
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,660
And then you blinked and it was gone.

1417
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,900
Sorry, what were you going to say, Travis?

1418
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,660
I was going to say that you may have noticed that we did not do farm wisdom this week.

1419
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,060
And that is because we need your farm wisdom, people.

1420
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,460
We can't just make that shit up.

1421
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,500
And we also can't just Google it because that's cheating.

1422
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,540
Yeah, you got to send it to us.

1423
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,980
We want to get it from you.

1424
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,780
Farm wisdom.

1425
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,820
Send us your questions.

1426
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:50,020
Send anything you want to mbmbam at maximumfun.org.

1427
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,180
Speaking of that domain, you can head there to find a bunch of great maximum fun programs.

1428
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,300
Stop podcasting yourself.

1429
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,820
Gosh, Jordan and Jesse, go.

1430
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,780
Judge John Hodgman.

1431
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,540
So many wonderful programs that you can enjoy.

1432
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,940
They're all waiting there for you.

1433
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,220
I got a new medical history program on MaxFun that I do with my wife, Sydney.

1434
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,180
It's called Sawbones.

1435
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,620
So check that out.

1436
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,860
And thank you so much for joining us.

1437
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,500
We'll be here with you next Monday, presumably.

1438
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,700
Also, thanks to John Roderick.

1439
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,660
Did you think John Roderick?

1440
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,980
No, I was waiting for you to do it.

1441
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,700
Usually you do it.

1442
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,580
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1443
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,980
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1444
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,380
It's a terrific album.

1445
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,580
I've been spinning it a lot.

1446
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,100
It's full of a lot of summer hits.

1447
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,420
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1448
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,220
It's a departure.

1449
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:41,060
It's been, what, like 160 episodes and you've never, like, piped up about it.

1450
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,300
You just always say, like, I want to thank you.

1451
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,100
You say we.

1452
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:44,420
Right.

1453
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,620
I'm just saying I thought after all this time that you were just, like, an ungrateful pig.

1454
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,980
No, it's just that, like, I want to say it, but I want to step in your toes.

1455
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,500
Griffin, do you have a final question for us?

1456
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,420
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Reedzilla.

1457
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,220
Thank you, Reedzilla.

1458
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,620
It's by Yahoo Answers user Molly, who asks,

1459
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:04,660
What happens at a Paul McCartney concert?

1460
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,060
I'm Justin McElroy.

1461
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,780
I'm Travis McElroy.

1462
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1463
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,420
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1464
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,140
Kiss your dad.

1465
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:29,060
Square on the lips.
