1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm your middlest brother, the old spotty dog, Travis McElroy.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It kind of fucked me up that you said hey and not hello, which is...

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, I've never said hey, it felt casual.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It felt like we were on Twitch or something more casual than...

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like a TGI Friday.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey guys.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, hey guys.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't forget to like and subscribe.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've been working on some songs during quarantine, and I finished one up just recently.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All right.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And I wanted to see what you guys thought.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, what kind of songs are you talking about?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Like what genre?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What kind of song is it?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's just one song.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's just one song.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But you said plural.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I mean, you said plural.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Does it play an instrument?

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, there's no instruments on it.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's acapella.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can I sing it?

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And please don't interrupt me or anything while I'm singing it, okay?

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And it's just a song.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How will we know when the song's over and we can start talking?

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's like one whole rest.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So if it goes longer than a whole rest.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Here's the song.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And your brothers will never know that you're eating chili while you record.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, that's a secret you'll take to your grave.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now your brothers will never know all the beef and beans you're shoving in your gourd.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They'd prefer it if you would just behave.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It is Thursday at 2.41 p.m. and this is happening in real life on the cilantro sprinkled across the bowl that was chopped up recently by your wife.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What do you guys think so far?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's verse one.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, it's not.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There's more to it than that?

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's just the beginning.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I wanted to stop for notes.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, let me say this.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Uh-huh.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's 2.41 p.m. now.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's 2.42 according to the clock at this point.

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, that's not my point, Justin.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think what you were hoping or maybe anticipating here was that we would be upset that you're eating chili during recording.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm upset that you're eating lunch at almost 3 p.m.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, it is just a...

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I feel like I clarified at the beginning is just a song.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's a song, Travis.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's just a song.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well...

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's like the...

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's like confessional standup.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It doesn't always...

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not describing what's happening right now.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It could be a recording that he did, you know, a couple months back at 2.41 p.m. now, 2.42 p.m. on Thursday.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, but there were a lot of specifics in there, Griffin.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And at one point, I believe he said, this is happening right now.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Right.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But that's in the...

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That was...

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Did you hear that that was part of the song?

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We've done this 560 episodes.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We've done it 560 times.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like, odds are we have recorded on a Thursday at 2.41, now 2.42 p.m.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Can I just...

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Can I just continue?

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, sorry.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Go ahead.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And the spoon is literally in my hand.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Me, Justin McElroy, the person singing this song.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it's not just a song.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a story about me eating chili while I record the show.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My brother, my brother and me, this episode right now.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Now that's...

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, Griffin, you have to admit that that seems suspicious, right?

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It could have described any episode.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He said this episode right now.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's when he's singing it.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's just a song.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, you said in there that it's not just a song, Justin.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, but that was in the song.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who are you going to believe, Travis?

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Our brother or the song?

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I believe our brother.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I believe our brother.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This song, he says in the song...

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's just a song.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's not just a song.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You said in the song that it's not just a song.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But I said in the song, if the song is just a song, you can't pick and choose what different parts you're going to listen to.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know what?

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're right.

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't decide you believe the part where I say it's not just a song.

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, Justin, I believe all of it.

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is the thing.

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I believe all of it from start to finish that you currently have a spoon in your hand that you're eating chili that your wife puts cilantro on that you're eating it right now as we record this episode.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Travis.

127
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Travis.

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're killing me, dude.

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's just a song.

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I would sign an affidavit with my legal name in front of a notary.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Say hi to eating chili.

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But it will not come to that because my brothers will believe me when I say that this is just a song, even though it's not now.

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, I was ready to buy in until that very last...

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Ooh, that very last kickflip there.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What was different?

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Did you not like it different?

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What part was different?

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is it because it didn't rhyme?

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was struggling with that.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, I'm fine with free verse.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's more that right there at the end you said it's not a song again.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Still not Jermaine, though.

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But it's very clearly not a song.

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Like if OJ Simpson put out a song like, I definitely did it, people would get suspicious.

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He realized that, right?

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hmm.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's...

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's...

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I mean, he did put out a book that was kind of like that.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And he wasn't like, it was just a book.

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey guys, it's just a book.

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Weird co-winky dink.

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I ate leftover chili for lunch.

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What does that have to do with me?

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Right before...

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, because that was the nature of the song.

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm not saying that that's what you did.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, thank you.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But I washed it down with a probiotic soda that Rachel brought into our house.

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
For some reason, it was a chunky soda.

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And so my body's going to make something new.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you guys doing to yourself?

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I had a fruit smoothie for breakfast and then I had a nice salad.

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's wrong with you two?

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I had some turkey and celery and hummus.

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And then chili.

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, I actually had a quinoa bowl trap from Panera Bread,

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
so I don't know what you're talking about.

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That thing I just said about the probiotic soda and the chili was a poem.

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, it wasn't a poem.

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It was Robert Frost's poem about chili.

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, I actually remember that now that I know how you say it.

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fuck.

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Excuse me?

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
My body dead ass feels quite bad.

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm actually weirdly pretty hungry because I meant to eat lunch before.

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I meant to eat lunch before we started recording and now I'm going to be hungry for the whole show.

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sure.

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I did recently do, not that I'm saying what you said is true, Justin,

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but I did recently do a livestream game in which 30 seconds before it began,

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
my wife lovingly brought me a plate with two big pieces of pizza on it.

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, God, Justin.

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And then I had to eat it on the stream by ducking down below camera level,

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
taking a couple bites, chewing and eating, then raising back up.

194
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now, Justin, do you want to make any more horrific meat slapping sounds?

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Guys, hold on one second.

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Sydney's coming in.

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No.

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, no, it was delicious.

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you.

200
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, the cilantro really, really helped.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay.

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Now, Justin.

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Probably just cut that.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That was a skit.

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now, Justin.

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's up?

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You just said.

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tell him, Justin, it was a skit.

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She said, yes.

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I said what?

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You said the cilantro was good and that was something.

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
She suggested the line about cilantro.

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah.

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They're a comedy writing team and they're doing some sketches.

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We're basically a comedy writing team?

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You get it, Justin?

218
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not going to rest until I crack this.

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You can try it.

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Whatever.

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can't run from me, Justin.

224
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will hunt you down like a dog and I'll prove you ate that chili during this recording.

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't think you ever will.

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Justin, I got a whole board set up on my wall already.

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I got strings running the things.

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The only...

229
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now, listen, I'm looking at your board via Skype.

230
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, that was just a poem.

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't have a board, Justin.

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was just a poem.

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It wasn't a real board, Justin.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Even if you did have a board, the only thing you could pin up there is that Justin repeatedly

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
stated that he ate chili during the recording.

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right.

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's a bad board.

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Can we do a...

239
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This has been a bit the whole time, Justin.

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I knew it was real and just a song at the same time.

242
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't even care.

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It was just a bit.

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah.

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What about a question?

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You know what I deserve for that?

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

248
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A Bitcoin.

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, I get it.

250
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Boy, I wish we got a coin for every bit we did.

251
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think it'd go a little something like this.

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did I invent the term Bitcoin?

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You did.

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Bit?

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Just now.

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Did I coin Bitcoin bit?

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's just you're taking so long to get...

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's taking a really long time.

259
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You get mad at me for interrupting you, but everyone knew where you were going 30 seconds

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
before you said coin a Bitcoin Bitcoin coin.

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Anticipation.

262
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

263
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now this first question is not one we normally do, but it was such...

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It tickled my brain.

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you going to read it?

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I love it.

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You do it.

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You should read it, but it's a good setup.

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Who is the best farmer in the world?

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know how there's the best soccer player or basketball list in the world?

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Who's the best farmer?

272
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Who has the most farmer stats?

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And that's from Gmail.

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And what I love about this question, and what it makes you think is, this is not saying

275
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
are there good farmers and bad farmers?

276
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Because yes, of course it's true.

277
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But is there a best farmer?

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Huh.

279
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you know how you know who the best farmer is?

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How?

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He's outstanding in his field.

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Okay.

283
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Huh.

284
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I didn't do this question just to set that up, but it popped in my head.

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
All right.

286
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I liked it.

287
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I would say whichever farm has the most crows.

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, you think?

289
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The crows have spoken.

290
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This farm is the best one.

291
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's got the best corn or grapes or whatever crows like to eat.

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Probably corn.

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think it's corn.

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I mean, it's Mr. Monsanto.

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, I love that.

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In his many farms.

297
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What I like about this question, too, is it has a deeper implication that every job,

298
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
there is a best at it, right?

299
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sure.

300
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Like that there is out there somewhere the world's best sanitation worker that can like

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
pick up a garbage can and kind of do this scoop move that launches the bags 30 yards

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
into the truck without having to walk over there, right?

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That everyone's like, oh, they're the best, right?

304
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like that has to exist.

305
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There is a ticket taker somewhere that rips it right in the middle every time.

306
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You know what I mean?

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Right.

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There has to be a best.

309
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Someone has to be the best at it.

310
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah.

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I feel like that's a dream that we all chase is being the best in whatever field

312
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
we're enthusiastic about.

313
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I feel like for a sanitation worker, it would be the robot arm that lifts up the can and

314
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
dumps it in and doesn't lose like a pizza box over the side or something like that.

315
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Like maybe they were in the military.

316
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They did one of those bomb exploding robots, and so they got good garbage arm training

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
for that.

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And now I'm writing a fucking Tom Clancy novel in our podcast.

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I do apologize for that.

320
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is there something that you guys think you're the best at?

321
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In the world?

322
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

323
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like when everybody looks at the leaderboard right there at the top, you got most saying

324
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the name of Justin McElroy or Griffin McElroy.

325
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hmm.

326
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No.

327
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Wow.

328
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's a deep dark.

329
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

330
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No.

331
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Nothing.

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No.

333
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm the best at not remembering to get a napkin or paper towel when I get my food at a restaurant.

334
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, yeah.

335
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, I've said that.

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I said that about you before.

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Griffin, every time.

338
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I come back to the table with our food, and you guys are like, where's the napkins?

339
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I'm like, I did not get those.

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And then you always say to me, you're the best at that.

341
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're the best at that.

342
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's so consistent.

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're the best at not getting those.

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's probably up there for me.

345
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Mm-hmm.

346
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Mm-hmm.

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Not the worst.

348
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean, there's less thing I'm not the worst at.

349
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You don't think there's anything you're not the worst at?

350
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Because I would say, I'm not saying that about you.

351
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I think it's way easier to be the worst at something.

352
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, sure.

353
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You know?

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No, because you get to a base level where just lack of any experience is a great leveler.

355
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You know what I mean?

356
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah.

357
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You could say worst stock trader, and you're going to hit a point of the population where

358
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
like, don't know, never looked into it, do not know about it, don't know what it is.

359
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And that's like a wide swath.

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You couldn't be the worst just because of your ignorance.

361
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

362
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There couldn't be one worst.

363
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I actually have bad news about this best farmer question.

364
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What's that?

365
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Well, I was thinking about it and how it's like all family farms, and it's like all huge

366
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
family farms over, and it's all just these big corpo farms.

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, yeah.

368
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, yeah.

369
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then I started looking into it a little more, and here's what they don't want you

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
to know, guys.

371
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What's that?

372
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There are no more farmers.

373
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh.

374
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

375
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We actually don't have farmers anymore in America.

376
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
A lot of it comes from China, and a lot of it comes from robotically run food farms that

377
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
are, but there's no farmers anymore.

378
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you're listening to this and you think that you're a farmer, someone's running the

379
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
long grift on you because we don't have them anymore.

380
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now, what about farmers only, Justin?

381
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's why that crashed in the.com bubble of pets.com, farmersonly.com.

382
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I lost my fucking shirt when farmers only went under.

383
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Luckily, I had Christian Mingle there to kind of keep me afloat.

384
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, I'm more of a plenty of fish guy, but yeah.

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

386
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, I'd like that grift.

387
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you.

388
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This one was sent in by Amy.

389
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Thanks, Amy.

390
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's Yahoo Answers user Ray who asks, how do you become the guy who controls the family

391
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
dinner table?

392
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh.

393
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Like in the show Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson?

394
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is that-

395
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That can't be it.

396
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know if that's a typo.

397
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm Nucky.

398
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It was Nucky.

399
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Welcome to-

400
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That can't be it.

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Time for me to-

402
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm assuming this is on some sort of like Boardwalk Empire-centric sub-Yahoo because

403
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that is the only place that that program would be summoned up for polite discussion.

404
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Without even knowing the rest of the question, Tony Soprano should be the reference, right?

405
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Not Nucky Thompson.

406
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's Nucky Thompson.

407
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm Nucky.

408
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Thanks for enjoying the meatloaf today.

409
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Nucky, can I ask a question?

410
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No.

411
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You can't.

412
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
In the show Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson is always the guy with the cool stories and

413
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
stuff to say at big family parties.

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'd love to be like that.

415
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
How do you become the guy who controls the family dinner table?

416
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Now, hold on though, because the question isn't about the person at the head of table

417
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
who everyone looks to.

418
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's not a locational, it's not based on orientation.

419
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I mean, that's got to contribute to it somewhat, right?

420
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, if you want to be the story person though, you want to be in the middle of the table.

421
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Because you want to just look slightly to your left and right to be able to see everybody.

422
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, I love that.

423
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Also, big hands, bigger the better.

424
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You think big hands helps you because everyone is kind of quietly, subconsciously threatened

425
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
by you?

426
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Or why the big hands?

427
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, no, sorry.

428
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I meant big hand movements, not just like large hands.

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, he gesticulates.

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay, I thought you were saying large physical hands, and then I was like, maybe that's why

431
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
they call him Nucky Thompson, because his knuckles are so ginormous.

432
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Large hands does contribute well to large hand movements though, because you have to

433
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
do a lot less work to just like, now you've moved seven inches.

434
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Because the hands are so big, it doesn't take much.

435
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Does being the source of the food help you sort of seize the day here?

436
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like if they're eating you?

437
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, well, that would certainly be a topic of like a real starter, you know what I mean?

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, if they're like serving sushi off of you, you mean?

439
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, no, I thought you were saying like, we're eating Nucky's forearm today, and you would

440
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
kind of have to talk to Nucky about that.

441
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Well, kind of both of those things, right?

442
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Kind of both.

443
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Because if you're eating sushi and you're just way too hungry and you get into it, you're

444
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
like, oh, God, I'm so sorry.

445
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why didn't you say something?

446
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you let the sushi eat off a person's body, what's the etiquette for going for the pieces

447
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
on the privacy area?

448
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That has to be less.

449
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You can't eat them first.

450
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, 100%.

451
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Nipples, I think that that's a straight, I feel like when you pick up a little hamachi

452
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
off the nipple and then you find out the nipple's under there, you can plead ignorance a bit

453
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and just be like, I didn't think the nipple would be fair.

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I would put it back, by the way.

455
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If I did that, I would just put the sushi back.

456
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
No, if somebody saw you pick it up and put it back, the party would be over.

457
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You would be uninvited from all future nude sushi parties.

458
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I would let people eat sushi off my body if I was fully clothed.

459
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If I was wearing a suit, I'd put sushi on my sushi suit.

460
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I feel like it's just whoever is the most proactive, whoever sort of starts the conversations

461
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and guides it.

462
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's less about power and strength and being naked and having sushi on your body.

463
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You don't have to wrestle that away from anybody.

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll tell you who's good at dominating conversations, it's Justin.

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm going to show you guys, Justin's going to do a little practical example here for you.

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Griffin and I will have a conversation and Justin's going to come in and nucky all over it.

467
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You ready?

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Travis, did you watch the Blues game last night?

469
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I did.

470
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Those coyotes are really giving them the run around, huh?

471
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah, but they did some great scoring and shooting, and I like the way that one of them iced another one.

472
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, I mean, Bennington's doing his best out there, but unless that defense solidifies,

473
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
they're not going to be able to keep it out of their zone, you know?

474
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, and I was amazed at how many triple dekes they got away with, you know what I mean?

475
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, those are the new hockey rules because of COVID regulations.

476
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There's the slap shot.

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It looks like Justin's trying to say something.

478
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Justin, are you trying to say something?

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, so you finally ran out of steam.

480
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
See, this is the secret.

481
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You hang back and you let everybody else burn out.

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So anyways, yeah, the Blues game was great.

483
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And then you stand up and you take control of the table.

484
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You've had your shot.

485
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
All the sushi fell off.

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We all heard how that worked out.

487
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't stand up.

488
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't you talk over me.

489
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't you talk over – I smashed a bottle on your head.

490
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Roll dexterity saving throw.

491
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I got a 17 plus 3, a 20.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You effortlessly duck out of the way.

493
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I attack Nucky.

494
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, hell yeah.

495
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Get him.

496
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Fuck him up.

497
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's a 15 plus 2, a 17.

498
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Does that beat your AC?

499
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Did you use pure silver?

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes, of course.

501
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm not a noob.

502
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, I am defeated.

503
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay.

504
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's one way to do it.

505
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I guess I haven't watched enough Boardwalk Empire to be really useful here.

506
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No, that's basically how it goes.

507
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I guess.

508
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There was a lot of D&D influence on that show.

509
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
There was also – it felt like a little Peaky Blinders in there, Justin.

510
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Was there just a little Peaky Blinders?

511
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I've watched even less.

512
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Are those two different shows?

513
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's like Boardwalk Empire and then Boardwalk Empire colon Peaky Blinders.

514
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay, I see.

515
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I got another way to control the dinner table, the family dinner table.

516
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So why don't you two start?

517
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm talking about something.

518
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey, Justin, did you see that new episode of Boardwalk Empire?

519
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No, that hasn't been on for a really long time.

520
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
No, they just started making more of them.

521
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't think that that's actually accurate.

522
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, Tom Welling's in it.

523
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Hey, get this.

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When I was recording my other member –

525
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Sorry, guys.

526
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I got a phone call.

527
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Sorry, guys.

528
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I got a phone call.

529
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

530
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No, it's me.

531
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, I can talk.

532
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, we're having dinner.

533
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Can you – sorry.

534
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Sorry, one second.

535
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Can you guys please just give me – can you please just give me a – this is really important.

536
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Can you please just give me a second?

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay, we'll just talk quietly.

538
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No, no, no.

539
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Just don't talk.

540
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Just don't talk.

541
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Thank you.

542
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm back.

543
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Thankfully, we know sign language.

544
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Uh-huh.

545
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah.

546
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
When I was recording my brother, my brother and me earlier this week, I was eating chili

547
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
during –

548
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I fucking knew it.

549
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What?

550
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I fucking knew it.

551
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah.

552
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

553
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Well, this is just in the context of a bit.

554
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We'll tell them when 2024 runs around.

555
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, same thing.

556
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Same thing.

557
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Same thing.

558
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We'll talk about a run then.

559
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah.

560
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No, no.

561
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm killing Murphy.

562
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay.

563
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Give my love to Dennis Kucinich.

564
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
All right.

565
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

566
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah.

567
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Thanks.

568
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Bye.

569
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That was my – that's another phone call.

570
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Sorry, guys.

571
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You're blowing up again, huh?

572
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Your real phone calls.

573
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That was when I'm a kid.

574
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm going to be Dennis Kucinich's campaign manager in 2024.

575
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, nice.

576
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,040
Now, do I know who that is, or is it just a name that I pulled from the void that is

577
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
my mom?

578
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Is it deeply problematic?

579
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Is he?

580
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
I don't know.

581
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
I literally don't know.

582
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Is he alive?

583
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I don't know.

584
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I don't know.

585
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Can I show one more way to kind of dominate?

586
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Yeah.

587
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Yeah.

588
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
I would love that.

589
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
This has been so good so far.

590
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Okay.

591
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
You two have the conversation.

592
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Okay.

593
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Okay.

594
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Hey, thanks for having my back on the chili thing earlier.

595
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Yeah.

596
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
It was my pleasure.

597
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
I would do anything.

598
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Ahem.

599
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,400
I will be turning in the coupon that you two gave me for my birthday for one half hour

600
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,480
of uninterrupted monologue by me, and I will now be completely recapping the plot of the

601
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Brendan Fraser movie, Blast from the Past.

602
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Yeah.

603
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,900
You see, it all began when Christopher Walken's character feared that there was going to be

604
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,840
a nuclear attack, so he built a bunker in his basement.

605
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,480
That bunker, it looked a lot like a house except underground, and there was raised-

606
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Why is he talking like this?

607
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,600
A young Brendan Fraser, and then he became old, and he was sent out to the surface-

608
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,640
Like, we just used our regular voices, but Travis is doing his weird-

609
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,840
Where he befriended Alicia Silverstone.

610
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
British affectation.

611
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,320
And I believe Dave Foley.

612
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
It's funny.

613
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,320
I think if he knew the plot well enough, he'd go faster, right?

614
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Yeah.

615
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,520
And then it turned out that because Brendan Fraser had been raised with 1950s and 60s

616
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:22,440
ideals, everyone loved him, a thing which is demonstrably untrue in today's society.

617
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,520
Let's do the money zone, maybe, while he continues to recap.

618
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
I'd love that.

619
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Hey, thanks.

620
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
I'd love that.

621
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:46,800
I'd love that.

622
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,000
We all shop online for stuff, shoes, for instance.

623
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What else?

624
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What else?

625
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sandals.

626
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,280
What else?

627
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,760
Can you give me six more?

628
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,800
Boots, Crocs, galoshes, and shoes, and sneakers.

629
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
Yeah, put six.

630
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,660
So you see that promo code field at checkout, and you're like, is there a way I could save

631
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,440
money and not spend as much money?

632
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,400
And the answer is honey, which rhymes with money, which is the mnemonic device I use

633
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
for it.

634
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,400
It's a free browser extension, and whenever you buy something that has one of those little

635
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,960
coupon code fields, it scans the internet.

636
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,400
It releases its little burr, its little sparrows.

637
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,440
Or bees.

638
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
It's little bees into the-

639
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,100
You're not a fucking asshole.

640
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,760
It releases its bees out into the internet and into everybody's phones, looking for coupon

641
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
codes.

642
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Who's got the coupon codes?

643
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Who's got the coupon codes?

644
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,600
And then the bees come back, and then honey tells you, and it's like, here's $33.

645
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,840
So that's amazing.

646
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,940
It's literally, everybody should be doing it.

647
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
It's free.

648
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,460
It sells in just a few seconds, and you can get honey for free at joinhoney.com slash

649
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,520
brother.

650
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,400
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

651
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,000
Have you guys ever eaten food for sustenance?

652
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,520
No, let me do this ad.

653
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,660
Okay.

654
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,480
How good is Sun Basket?

655
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Very good.

656
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,880

657

658
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,240
No matter how you're eating or what you like to eat, I truly believe that they are going

659
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:34,000

660
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,240
Getting a meal on the table quickly doesn't mean you have to sacrifice nutrition or quality.

661
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,760
With Sun Basket, you can actually have it all every single day.

662
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,720
So they have the meal kit stuff, and there's a huge variety of those.

663
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,120
What I love that I've just recently gotten into, they have these fresh and ready meals.

664
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,960
They're $8.99, and they come, and you basically heat them up, and it's like a gourmet meal

665
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
that you're just instantly enjoying.

666
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:08,220
They have a chili that I just tried today, actually, earlier today, and it was so delicious

667
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,480
earlier today and very recently, but earlier in this day we were in, and it was so delicious

668
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,400
that I couldn't stop eating it no matter what.

669
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,680
I would do anything, anything, to keep eating it no matter what the cost or the podcast,

670
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,800
whatever was going on in my life.

671
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,440
Even if it meant losing a relationship with one of your brothers.

672
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,400
I don't remember exactly, Tri, but it was a very strong desire to keep eating the chili.

673
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
I do remember that.

681
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,560

And I'm Bailiff Jesse Thorne.

684
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,200
Ten years ago, I came on Jordan Jesse Go and judged my first dispute.

685
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Is chili a soup?

686
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,560
It's a stew, obviously.

687
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,360
The judge has dispensed a decade of justice.

688
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,080
He's the one person wise enough to answer the really important questions like, should

689
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,560
you hire a mime to perform at your own funeral?

690
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,040
After they cry, I want them to laugh.

691
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,320
Do you really need a tank full of jellyfish in your den?

692
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,040
They smell like living creatures decaying.

693
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,200
Only if they are decaying.

694
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,960
Yeah, which they will be.

695
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,840

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
We're gonna help somebody else.

700
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Okay.

701
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
We're doing better.

702
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Do that.

Recently we've been watching movies and I recommended the 2000 Tom Hanks classic Castaway.

705
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,920
But when I brought up the film, she refused.

706
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,080
She said she thought Tom Hanks was overrated and had no desire to watch the film, claiming

707
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,360
it's too long and probably sad.

708
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,720
Yes and yes.

709
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,220
How do I convince her to watch this Thomas classic?

710
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,680
Which I'm sure she would thank me later for getting her to watch.

711
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,880
I'm stranded in Stratton, PA.

712
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,280
There's different categories of films of this type, I feel like, where there's films that

713
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,000
are culturally important.

714
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,080
And then there are films that are like, if you want to know what the whole hand on a

715
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,440
volleyball thing is, you got to watch Castaway.

716
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,240
You have to do your due diligence and spend two hours watching Tom Hanks cut his teeth

717
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,640
out with roller, with ice skates.

718
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,120
Oh, right.

719
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Yeah.

720
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,840
And that's the price that you pay.

721
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,880
Now I have a lot of films like this.

722
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,640
Whenever people quote Casablanca, I nod my head along.

723
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,800
Oh yes, yes, yes.

724
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,880
A classic gray film.

725
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I do not know.

726
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,820
I have not seen this film.

727
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,500
And so there are parts that it could patch up some of my lack of cultural knowledge there,

728
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,360
but I've decided that my time is better spent elsewhere.

729
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,440
And that's what your girlfriend has done.

730
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,960
And you know, that's what the internet's for.

731
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,200
You Google what's up with the volleyball hand.

732
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,720
Now I know I don't have to watch the film.

733
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,480
You know, you make a good point, Gervin.

734
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,320
We've entered a new period in time, this 2021, Big Dog Ren.

735
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,160
And perhaps now's the time when someone's like, you haven't seen Casablanca.

736
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
You have to watch it.

737
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,200
And you just go, no, I don't.

738
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Do you know how many other things there are within my reach at any given time that I could

739
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,720
choose to do?

740
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,520
Yeah, it's liberating in a way.

741
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,440
I will never watch a Criterion Collection film.

742
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,580
And that's a huge weight off, being able to say that out loud in such a public place.

743
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,980
But there it is.

744
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,200
It's out there now.

745
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,240
It's wild to me that that movie exists, isn't it?

746
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,320
That seems like Hollywood was like, people seem to really like Tom Hanks.

747
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,120
We should just do, just maybe just have him.

748
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
A one-hander.

749
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,400
Oh yeah, like a movie where he's having a good time and living his best life.

750
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Bad time.

751
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,720
We destroy Tom Hanks for all of America to enjoy.

752
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,520
I want to hurt Tom Hanks.

753
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,360
And I'm a movie executive, and this is my pitch.

754
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,200
I want to hurt Tom Hanks and see what happens.

755
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,920
I'm going to hurt Tom Hanks for two hours and 24 minutes.

756
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,840
Did you guys see the money pit?

757
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,760
Every time that Tom Hanks falls in a hole or gets electrocuted or, you know, wastes

758
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,160
money on this bad house, that was good for me.

759
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,320
And I would like a film that is just about that, about Tom Hanks being hurt over and

760
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,640
over again.

761
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,040
There was a period of time that I think, here's my theory.

762
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:17,120
There's a period of time where everyone really enjoyed watching Tom Hanks get hurt.

763
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,400
Like the burbs and money pit.

764
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,120
And then I think the natural culmination of that period was cast away.

765
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,880
And I think after that everyone went, I don't like this anymore.

766
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,840
I feel bad now that we've done this to Tom Hanks.

767
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,120
Can he enter the period of time where the worst thing that happens to him is he's trapped

768
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,600
in an airport terminal?

769
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,920
Thank you, please.

770
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,840
The worst thing that happens to him is he has to go back to community college, I think.

771
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,040
I never saw that one.

772
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,640
How long has it been since you guys watched Cast Away, the film Cast Away?

773
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,800
Well, when did it come out?

774
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
2000?

775
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
So I would say about 21 years.

776
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Yeah.

777
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,480
Yeah, I would estimate it's around there.

778
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Quick spoilies, just because I feel like we're kind of missing it.

779
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,920
Just for just a minute.

780
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,320
On Cast Away, he does get off the island.

781
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,800
Do you guys remember that when he got off the island, his girlfriend married and had

782
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,480
a kid and they had a funeral for him before?

783
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Justin.

784
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,680
What a picture that is.

785
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
What a picture.

787
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:24,540
Do you think Bobby Zemeckis is like, my dream is to hang out on an island with Tom Hanks

788
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,480
and just me and my friend Tom, and we're just getting buckwild on it and loving it.

789
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,160
And that's what my dream is.

790
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Can everyone do that?

791
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,920
Can we also remember that the big positive ending though is, don't worry, he still has

792
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,840
that one package to deliver.

793
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,680
So everything's not all bad for old Tommy Hanks.

794
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,320
Can everyone real quick do their best impression of Tom Hanks' character in the Polar Express?

795
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,200
I haven't seen it.

796
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Just saying like, where's your ticket?

797
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,360
Now he has to say, I haven't seen it, but I'm going to do my best, okay?

798
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
But where's your ticket?

799
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
I'm Thomas Hanks.

800
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
It's not all bad.

801
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
It's more like, my ticket, please.

802
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
My ticket.

803
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
I need to see your ticket.

804
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
See, yeah, see?

805
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
All right, I'll try.

806
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:08,160
I need to see, I need to see your ticket.

807
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,040
Tom Hanks is a hard impression to do, huh?

808
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,360
Yeah, he just sounds like everybody.

809
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,840
Tom Hanks is the default.

810
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,560
All other impressions are in relation to how Tom Hanks sounds.

811
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Do Woody.

812
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
Okay.

813
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
There's a snake in my boot.

814
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,320
No, not that line.

815
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,520
Do another line from Toy Story that Woody says.

816
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,560
You are a toy!

817
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Whoa.

818
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Hey, Trav?

819
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
That was actually Trav.

820
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
That was really fucking good.

821
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
He saw the podcast.

822
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,880
Hey, Rachel, can we get it again?

823
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,840
You are a toy!

824
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,320
It was really good, Travis.

825
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
It's good.

826
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
It's actually pretty good, Trav.

827
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Thank you.

828
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
Thank you very much.

829
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
You've been hiding your line under a bush.

830
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,720
No, I'm never going to try it again.

831
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,080
Yeah, you can't.

832
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,600
That was right off the hip.

833
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,360
Can't hit that target again.

834
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,640
Nobody ever asks Travis to do it again.

835
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
He'll buckle.

836
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,400
He'll do a really shit job the next time because we got that magic moment on tape.

837
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm so happy.

838
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,480
In that moment, I was Tom Hanks, you guys.

839
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,080
I saw his face overlap my face for a moment.

840
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Can I do a Yahoo?

841
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Yeah, please.

842
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,800
I just want to send in by Graham Roebuck.

843
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Thanks, Graham.

844
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:20,040
He's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call Dan and asks, is there a special

845
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,840
taste bud for chicken wings?

846
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,600
I like to position the foods in my mouth to taste them according to the taste bud that

847
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,840
tastes best for that food.

848
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,460
Is there one for hot wings?

849
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,360
I've recently learned that the taste bud map of your tongue is apocryphal, and this was

850
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
heartbreaking to me.

851
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Really?

852
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
I thought it was a thing.

853
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,360
No, they're all mixed in with each other, except for the chicken wing taste bud, which

854
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,480
is that dangly thing in the back of your throat.

855
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,760
Oh, that's the chicken wing taste bud is the dangly thing that dangles down?

856
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,840
So if you want to get the most out of your chicken wings, you got to shove it back there

857
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,240
and rub it against that dangly thing.

858
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,200
I always thought that was a sort of, I always called it the throdom because it was like

859
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
a-

860
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
The throdom is unpleasant.

861
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,200
No, but you know in WAP when she says, I want to gag on a joke, I want it to touch that

862
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,800
dangly thing in the back of my throat.

863
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Yeah.

864
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
That's what it is.

865
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Yeah.

866
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
That's what it means.

867
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,480
Because she couldn't say my chicken wing taste bud.

868
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
My one big one.

869
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Yeah.

870
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
No.

871
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,120
But that's why if you just hold the chicken wing on the tip of your tongue, nothing.

872
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,400
You can't even, it's like there's nothing there.

873
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Yeah.

874
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
That's interesting, Trump.

875
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,860
As it slides whole down your gullet, you get all the flavor profile there.

876
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,920
Maybe cry a little bit out of joy.

877
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,440
Do you guys, I don't want to do it all, but do you guys know what the, do you guys know

878
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,000
what the radio edit of WAP is?

879
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,280
No.

880
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,720
The radio edit of WAP, and I just want to take a quick poll.

881
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,080
The radio edit of WAP is not wet ass pussy.

882
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,780
It is in fact wet.

883
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
It's wet and gushy.

884
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Oh yeah.

885
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Yeah.

886
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
No, it's worse.

887
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
Hey, it's worse, right?

888
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,080
Like the radio edit is worse on that one.

889
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Yeah.

890
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:09,000
It falls into a category that another one there is, there is a song by the Ying Yang

891
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Twins, and the real line is, we all like to see ass and titties.

892
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,000
And then the radio edit is, we all like to see tiggle biddies, which I would argue is

893
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,240
far more offensive.

894
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Yeah.

895
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Yeah, hugely challenging.

896
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,280
A hugely challenging thing.

897
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Yeah.

898
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,000
Till the sweat drops down the walls.

899
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,080
Okay, we got wet and gushy.

900
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,920
Although wet and gushy is good because then it lets her rhyme the next line where she's

901
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,440
like, have you seen my tushy?

902
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,480
Which is in the original song, and it's sort of a slant rhyme with the-

903
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,360
Release the tapes about gushy.

904
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Yeah.

905
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Yeah.

906
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,560
There's not a special taste bud for chicken wings.

907
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,640
I wish that there was though.

908
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,200
I wish we could hack our tongues.

909
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,440
The right chicken wing engages all the buds, you know?

910
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:05,460
The right chicken wing has invites over his friend Spicy, but he makes him stand outside

911
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,460
and then he brings Sweet in, but then sends him out.

912
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:19,040
And then Sour is on Zoom nearby, and Bitter is occasionally welcomed.

913
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,220
It's Bitter's house.

914
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,080
But not all at once, Justin.

915
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,080
You're making it sound like it's stages, like a Neapolitan chicken wing.

916
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,420
That's how you feel really savoring it.

917
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,240
You're getting the heat, and then you're getting a bit of Sour.

918
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Oh my.

919
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,880
Do you know how, Trav, when Justin eats chicken wings?

920
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,260
He first dabs it on the tip of his tongue, which he has stuck way, way out of his mouth.

921
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,000
And then he just kind of rubs it in a clockwise circle around his tongue and lips.

922
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,560
He also will swirl the chicken wing around and then sniff it deeply.

923
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Yeah.

924
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
He says that-

925
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Which I've always found troubling.

926
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Yeah.

927
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,480
He says it helps him hit the flavor spot, and I don't, I don't.

928
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,000
And he'll kind of like half moan, like, look at the legs.

929
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah.

930
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You have to see its fingers.

931
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,600
He doesn't actually chew and eat it, which is weird.

932
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,120
He sets it right back down.

933
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah.

934
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,360
Spits it right there in the bucket.

935
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Yeah.

936
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,600
All naked wings that you ever eat in your entire life have been pre-lit by me.

937
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
That's true.

938
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,780
That's weird, but it's true.

939
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,000
And if they're a little bit crispy and naked, they've just been sitting out a long time.

940
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yep.

941
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They've dried.

942
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Just dried in the sun.

943
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah.

944
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,640
I've been eating a lot of chick wings lately.

945
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh, tell me more.

946
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
No.

947
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Okay.

948
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

949
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You know what?

950
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Here, I have this for you.

951
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,640
I have this for you.

952
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,720
I have this for you.

953
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
I want to munch.

954
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Squad.

955
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Squad.

956
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,720
I want to munch.

957
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Squad.

958
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Squad.

959
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,680
What I was trying to capture there was like the soul of winter that didn't have a holiday

960
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
feel.

961
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,800
Oh, see, I was thinking it was feeling very, very Georgian.

962
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Okay.

963
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Very, uh.

964
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Sure.

965
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Yeah.

966
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Very Georgian.

967
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
This is-

968
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,480
Point Petersburg, Chekhov, Three Sixers, Uncle Vanya.

969
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,720
We've never had you sort of just lay a munch squad at our feet, which is what it feels

970
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
like you've done.

971
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I brought this to you.

972
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
I usually interrupt, right?

973
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Yeah.

974
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,440
But I feel like as you get older, you don't always want to be saddled with the bad boys

975
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
podcasting.

976
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Yeah, sure.

977
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
And I mean-

978
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
You know.

979
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Especially as this segment moves into its denouement.

980
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Right.

981
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
It's final.

982
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Okay.

983
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Right.

984
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
That's out.

985
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
So the other thing is like this one is, it's like, okay.

986
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Yeah.

987
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
You know what I mean?

988
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,840
And I don't want you guys to be like-

989
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,480
It's good of you to know that about yourself, Justin.

990
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Why did you interrupt it?

991
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
You know?

992
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Sure.

993
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Sure.

994
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Like why did you interrupt us for one that's okay?

995
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Panera bread.

996
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Do you, you guys heard this?

997
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Yes.

998
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,880
I believe that it translates to bread bread, if I'm not mistaken.

999
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,980
Panera bread did a, um, God, it's really weird.

1000
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,980
You know how they have bread bowls?

1001
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,980
Yeah.

1002
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Yeah, sure.

1003
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Okay.

1004
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,880
So they've made an ice and toasty bread bowl glove.

1005
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Wait.

1006
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Okay.

1007
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Mm-hmm.

1008
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,600
So what the thing is with this is that it is a hand warmer.

1009
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,160
That's also a cup holder.

1010
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,440
So you can drink iced coffee, even when it's cold.

1011
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,560
And also it looks like a bread bowl.

1012
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Now, okay.

1013
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,760
Until you got to that last part, it's just a glove, but then, huh.

1014
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
That's it.

1015
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
It's not made out of bread.

1016
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Is it?

1017
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Uh, no.

1018
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
That's the other thing about it.

1019
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,120
Fucking cowards.

1020
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,020
It's not made out of bread, right?

1021
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,840
So like, why did you?

1022
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
Why did you do it?

1023
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Panera bread.

1024
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
You could have had, oh my God.

1025
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,760
Think of how much money they could have saved on soup.

1026
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:54,200
If they had started selling warmed, like right there, fresh from the oven bread gloves that

1027
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,800
you would go into a Panera bread, jam a couple of these on your fists and they'd be like,

1028
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
okay, that'll be 14.99.

1029
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,280
And you're like, I can't pay that.

1030
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
Look at my hands.

1031
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,680
How am I, how on earth am I supposed to pay that?

1032
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,600
That could have been so nice and fun.

1033
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,720
I sent you an image in Slack so you can look at it.

1034
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,320
It looks so wild.

1035
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:19,960
It looks like your hand is like a Lego person's hand made out of bread.

1036
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:27,080
What it looks like to me is like, there's some kind of bad guy in Doctor Who where it's

1037
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,320
like actual living dough that's trying to look like people.

1038
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Okay.

1039
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Yeah.

1040
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
I love that.

1041
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,120
And that's like how you can identify like, look at their hands, Doctor.

1042
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:42,480
There's nothing about it where, you know how sometimes you put your iced coffee into your

1043
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
bread bowl?

1044
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,960
It's like, you just combine things you had around.

1045
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
You know what I mean?

1046
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,120
Your iconography is getting fucking sloppy.

1047
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Yeah.

1048
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,080
Like if somebody saw that, even if they thought, is that a real bread bowl?

1049
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,320
Their next thought would be, and are you using it to hold an iced coffee?

1050
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
What?

1051
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Are you okay?

1052
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,960
I feel like those realizations would come the other way, Trav, where it would be like,

1053
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,080
why on God's green earth and Christ's earth do you have an iced coffee tucked into a bread

1054
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
bowl?

1055
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,000
And also, is that your hand in there?

1056
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yep.

1057
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Mm-hmm.

1058
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Mm-hmm.

1059
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,440
They did a, oh God, it makes me so angry.

1060
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,440
So they did this.

1061
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Right?

1062
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Yeah.

1063
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
They made 450 of them.

1064
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
That's it.

1065
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Fucking thanks.

1066
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,680
Like just have some fucking, some strength of your convictions.

1067
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,680
Right.

1068
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,840
You know, like if you believe people want it, you nasty pervert, then do it.

1069
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Yeah.

1070
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Right?

1071
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Then just do it.

1072
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,960
You know what?

1073
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,200
Nothing can stop me from going into Panera Bread and ordering a empty, a bread bowl straight

1074
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,000
up and cramming my little, and cramming my little paw in there, is there?

1075
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,360
There ain't no log in it.

1076
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,360
There's nobody who's going to say anything to me.

1077
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,960
No, they wouldn't take it back from you.

1078
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,380
No, I paid for it.

1079
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,380
You know?

1080
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,380
And you'll pay for it.

1081
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,560
In the release where they were talking about it, they said, they cited a statistic that

1082
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:05,080
78% of Americans told them, Panera, that they continue to drink iced coffee even in cold

1083
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
weather.

1084
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,080
Yeah.

1085
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Okay.

1086
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,400
Then you're fixing a fucking solved problem.

1087
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,240
Yeah, we already got this.

1088
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
We've got it.

1089
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,520
We're just doing it and going for it.

1090
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,440
78% said they still drink iced coffee, and 100% said they want to stick their little

1091
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,800
paws into one of our bread bowls.

1092
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,120
I think anybody, when given that opportunity, would leap at it.

1093
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,040
Would jump to, hey, I got a hot bread here, you want to jam your hand in there?

1094
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
Are you going to eat that bread?

1095
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,360
It seems like a waste of food.

1096
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,360
No, I'm not.

1097
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,000
This isn't, if you don't do it, I'm going to let somebody else do it.

1098
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,240
Oh, okay.

1099
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,680
Everybody would jam their hand in there.

1100
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,440
Everybody, everybody, everybody.

1101
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,760
Now if the glove was fresh bread bowl sent in, forget about it.

1102
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
We're done.

1103
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,280
I'm taking that all day every day.

1104
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
Yeah.

1105
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,320
I wanted to thank Liam for this one, actually, so thank you, Liam.

1106
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,360
Real quick, I did go ahead and go on over to icedandtoasty.com, which is weird that

1107
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,880
we didn't own that, but I did go to icedandtoasty.com, and there's just a big picture of the bowl,

1108
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,920
and then it says, sorry, we're all out.

1109
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Oh, man.

1110
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,480
But then under it, there's a link that says, what does this mean?

1111
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Oh.

1112
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:28,240
So I go to icedandtoasty.com, and it says, sorry, in huge letters, we're all out.

1113
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
What's that even mean?

1114
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
What does this mean?

1115
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,240
What do you even mean, sorry, you're all out?

1116
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,680
If you click, what does this mean, it then gives a really wordy explanation that breaks

1117
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,640
down to, we don't have any more.

1118
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,000
We don't have any more of them.

1119
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I clicked it.

1120
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Here's what it says.

1121
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
This is from Zach.

1122
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,520
Well, it's probably Zach, isn't it?

1123
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,000
Well, Zach, and then he's doing the rock horn emoji.

1124
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah.

1125
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,400
You may receive this message if all of the products in your area have been claimed or

1126
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,580
you're participating after the promotional period has ended.

1127
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,120
So in other words, they're all out.

1128
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,120
They don't have any.

1129
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:15,320
Well, and then down at the bottom, it then says, 11 out of 23 found this helpful, which

1130
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,080
means that there were 12 people who were like, I'm still confused.

1131
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
I don't get it.

1132
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,080
Get it.

1133
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,680
How does this help me get a bread bowl glove?

1134
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,440
Explain again, Zach, but slower.

1135
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,680
Anyway, you can't get it.

1136
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,200
I don't know why I wasted your time.

1137
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,400
It's a dumb idea.

1138
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,560
When Liam sent it, Liam said it's an edible Panera bread cup holder.

1139
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,560
That's not right.

1140
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,520
Well, it's also right in the sense that like, why the fuck else are they doing it?

1141
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,440
If they made an edible cup holder, that's like we baked in a slot for your hand because

1142
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,840
we're absolutely out of a solitary fuck to give that I'm into it.

1143
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,240
If you want to let me like hold an iced coffee and then finish it, then eat the thing out

1144
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,000
my hand because it doesn't have a purpose anymore.

1145
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,140
That's biodegradable.

1146
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,640
That's 2021.

1147
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,640
You know what I mean?

1148
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
That's new tech.

1149
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,120
I think we've talked about it on this show before, but edible doesn't mean digestible.

1150
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
Liam's not wrong.

1151
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,120
Yeah.

1152
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,600
You could eat that glove if you tried hard enough.

1153
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,360
I'm just saying if they wanted to rebrand as Panera's boutique and they only sold bread

1154
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,960
clothes, I think that would be a killer Swaperoni.

1155
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,760
Oh yeah.

1156
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,760
What else do you guys want to do?

1157
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,880
I mean, we do the questions.

1158
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,320
We only did two, I guess.

1159
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Two?

1160
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
Yeah.

1161
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Two.

1162
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
Okay.

1163
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,600
That's not bad, but I will do another one if you want or Yahoo.

1164
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,000
I think the second question is powerful and we should read that.

1165
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,200
My employer offers a small stipend for purchase of clothing with the company's logo.

1166
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,600
Most of it is pretty bland, polo shirts, light jackets, caps, et cetera.

1167
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:50,240
This year though, they're offering jeans with the company logo embroidered across the ass.

1168
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,600
What occasions are appropriate for business casual juicy jeans?

1169
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,760
How should I complete the outfit to really impress our clients?

1170
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,320
Dress to impress in DC.

1171
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:12,440
An unbuttoned, white, thin fabric shirt and there's a fan close by.

1172
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:19,720
Also, you could do a popped collar jean jacket of the same denim material and make sure you

1173
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,840
always have your back turned to them and you're looking over a shoulder.

1174
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,720
And make sure you tuck that jacket into the pants just to really complete the look.

1175
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,800
That's good, Trav.

1176
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,400
If you can find denim shoes, I don't know if that's anything, but anything that draws

1177
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,560
attention back to the ass is what you want.

1178
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,120
Let me call John Mellencamp and ask to borrow one of his many pairs of denim shoes.

1179
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
Hold on.

1180
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
Okay.

1181
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,120
I'll get them on the horn.

1182
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
Okay.

1183
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,960
This is not a skit I'm going to do because I don't really know anything about John Mellencamp,

1184
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,960
but-

1185
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:55,800
I feel like a great use of this would be if you're doing a presentation and you're like

1186
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,400
to a new client and then it's like you use it as the punchline of the presentation because

1187
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,480
it makes it look like you went the extra mile.

1188
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
You know what I mean?

1189
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:12,640
It's like, and one thing I can say about Fidelity Capital Management, we won't be bringing up

1190
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,640
the rear.

1191
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
That's really good.

1192
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,640
And you show up your ass and it's like, this company gets it.

1193
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
That's it.

1194
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,640
Yeah.

1195
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,360
And then they'll be like, why do your jeans look so dirty and smell so bad?

1196
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:29,720
And you're like, I do not take these off because I love the company.

1197
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,760
You heard the part where I talked about loving the company, right?

1198
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,300
So like, why would I take off my Fidelity pants?

1199
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,520
You could do another pair of jeans over those jeans.

1200
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,960
And then when someone's like, I can't believe you wore jeans to work.

1201
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,400
You're like, yeah, sorry.

1202
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
I forgot.

1203
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,760
It's a little too casual.

1204
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,640
And then you tear those pants away and underneath you have your business, Juicy Jeans.

1205
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,120
And everyone's like, that's what I talk about, bro.

1206
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,240
And you all high five a bunch and then maybe play some volleyball out in the lawn, I assume.

1207
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
In your jeans.

1208
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Just some jeans volleyball like you do.

1209
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
Just some jeans volleyball.

1210
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
Regular jeans volleyball.

1211
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,600
The chafing is part of the fun.

1212
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,600
Yeah.

1213
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,180
It's an endurance sport, jeans volleyball.

1214
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,680
Why do they make these?

1215
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,920
What do you mean?

1216
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,920
Why do they-

1217
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,200
It's really kind of weird, isn't it?

1218
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,080
It's kind of weird that they would think you would want to put the company's logo right

1219
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,080
on your ass.

1220
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
Yeah.

1221
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,760
No, it's not a good place for that.

1222
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,240
I guess it depends on what the company is.

1223
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:30,280
Is there a company where, other than Juicy, do you work at Juicy corporate headquarters?

1224
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,880
What about endoscopy cameras?

1225
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,760
Like if you were like, is that the right one?

1226
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,760
Colonoscopy.

1227
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,760
That's what I meant.

1228
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:47,120
Like if you were a company that produced enemas, colonoscopy, or just like a billboard company,

1229
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,520
and then it has it there and it's like, you looked, didn't you?

1230
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,520
And this is what you're trying to sell now is, hi, my name is Travis McElroy, and for

1231
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,600
$100 a month, you can buy ad space on my ass.

1232
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
That's it.

1233
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Oh, it's for sale.

1234
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,200
Does jeans but advertising work?

1235
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
Just did.

1236
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Because you looked.

1237
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
I made you look.

1238
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,200
You looked at my height.

1239
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,040
You looked at my hiner, didn't you?

1240
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Yeah.

1241
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,200
Are you looking for a house with a great backyard?

1242
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,240
And then it has like the listing for, you know, some real estate agents in there, right?

1243
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
Yeah.

1244
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,880
But it's on my ass because I have a great backyard.

1245
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,880
Yep.

1246
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,480
Next Buc-ee's, exit 23A and 15 miles.

1247
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,480
But it says it-

1248
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
Follow me to-

1249
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,480
Right.

1250
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,620
Follow me to Buc-ee's, and it says it right there.

1251
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,320
It's got basically MapQuest directions to Buc-ee's on my dumper.

1252
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,320
Yeah.

1253
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,320
Yep, yep, yep.

1254
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,320
Yep, yep, yep.

1255
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,080
Now, this started as a joke, but now I'm starting to think I could maybe sell some ad space

1256
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,080
on my butt.

1257
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,080
I think anybody could.

1258
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,080
Okay, I want to give you guys a challenge.

1259
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,080
Okay, okay.

1260
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,080
Are you guys ready for this?

1261
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,080
Yeah.

1262
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,080
This is a thought experiment for thought leaders like ourselves.

1263
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,080
Okay.

1264
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:55,160
If we had to put up a piece of McElroy Family merchandise where it was jeans but the logo

1265
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,280
was on the ass, what would you guys do?

1266
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
We have to do it.

1267
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,280
What, would we advertise on the back?

1268
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,280
Or what would that-

1269
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,280
What would it be?

1270
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Just, yeah, describe the product, I guess.

1271
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,320
I'd probably put an ad for pets.com on there, but I think it's because you mentioned the

1272
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,320
.com bubble earlier.

1273
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,320
Yeah, yeah.

1274
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
And now it's kind of all I can think about.

1275
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,480
And my brain went there, too.

1276
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
My brain was-

1277
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,720
So that would be a piece of McElroy Family merch that we would sell that would be the

1278
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
pets.com logo?

1279
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
Yes.

1280
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
Yeah, something like that.

1281
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,800
Okay, so you've already, hearing it back, parroted back at you to try to cease the cracks.

1282
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1283
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:38,400
It's a truth campaign, but not their anti-vaping thing they're on now, but like old truth back

1284
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:45,480
in like 2001 where it's like, check out this person and the machine they use to talk.

1285
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,440
But we've put that on their butt of merch pants.

1286
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,000
I think I would advertise the pants on the pants so that when people look at the pants,

1287
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,880
they're like, well, now I want to get those pants, but I don't know where to get them.

1288
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,720
It's like, well, the information's right there.

1289
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,720
Yeah.

1290
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,960
You can get ad pants right there.

1291
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,960
I like that.

1292
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:14,520
Or it's like the pants are an ad for your ass branding company, ass branding limited,

1293
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,520
let's call it.

1294
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,100
And the logo is a pair of jeans that have the ass branding limited wordmark on them,

1295
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:27,080
which happens to be shaped like a pair of jeans, so it's just infinite into your butt.

1296
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,560
Jeans all the way down, baby.

1297
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,240
Jeans all the way down.

1298
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,240
You need a kit, but the good news is if you go too deep, Joseph Gordon-Levitt will kick

1299
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,720
your chair into the bathtub, kick you right back up, right out the jeans.

1300
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,120
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that chair kicked into the tub, kicked me right out my jeans.

1301
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,640
Kicked me out my jeans, JGL.

1302
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,640
Thanks for saving me from my jeans.

1303
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, where's my top?

1304
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,600
I need my shirt that I wore with the jeans, JGL, damn.

1305
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,960
Are you wearing those jeans?

1306
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,840
Were you wearing those jeans when I went in?

1307
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Are we still in it?

1308
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,840
Oh no.

1309
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Oh no.

1310
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,840
Kick it.

1311
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,160
My wife is trapped in some jeans.

1312
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,320
Kick me again, JGL, damn.

1313
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,840
I'm in my wife's childhood jeans.

1314
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:19,480
My wife created jeans for us to live in together, but it was between our two jeans.

1315
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,480
Oh no.

1316
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,480
Let me spin my magic top.

1317
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,880
All right, damn it, I left it in my jeans one layer up.

1318
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,880
Fuck.

1319
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,640
Hey, Tom Hardy, bring my jeans now when you come.

1320
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,920
Or at least my magic top.

1321
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,920
It's in the pocket of my jeans in your jeans layer.

1322
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,040
Hey, I just want to tell you, guy, you're super old now.

1323
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Your jeans still look great.

1324
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,360
Still wear the hell out of them jeans.

1325
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,360
I believe you mean Ken Watanabe.

1326
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,360
You said the name.

1327
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,360
Extremely old man.

1328
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,360
Yes, yes, yes, Ken Watanabe.

1329
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,360
Elliot Page.

1330
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
Way to spoil.

1331
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Way to spoil.

1332
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
Yeah, way to spoil everything.

1333
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,080
Elliot Page, I need you to craft some jeans for me with your... No, the jeans were paying

1334
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,200
attention to themselves.

1335
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,000
The jeans are aware we're in them.

1336
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,600
I'm a jeans architect.

1337
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,600
You're a tailor?

1338
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
No.

1339
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,600
I've said that many times.

1340
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,720
Michael Caine, young and old Michael Caine, all this must be a dream.

1341
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,920
We're all three in jeans and kissing.

1342
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:16,480
Sydney made fun of me today for falling over in the snow, and I said, why do we fall, Master

1343
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,480
Bruce?

1344
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
It's to get back up again.

1345
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,160
And my voice started sounding like Bane, and I accidentally, and I did Michael Bane.

1346
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Michael Bane.

1347
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,040
It sounds like a Michael Caine and a Bane impression mixed together.

1348
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,040
Mr. Wayne?

1349
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
Mr. Wayne.

1350
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,040
Come in the shorts to a store, Bob.

1351
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,040
Mr. Wayne.

1352
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,640
It sounds like he's drowning now.

1353
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:44,720
Henry loves Batman, and one time I had him say, where's Falcone, as deep-voiced Batman,

1354
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,640
and now he says it anytime he plays Batman, and I feel like I've ruined him.

1355
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,600
I feel like nothing will satisfy him now.

1356
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Where is Falcone?

1357
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,720
Yeah, he asked, and he's like, who is Falcone and why does Batman want him?

1358
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,080
And I have to tell him it's because he didn't pay attention in virtual school.

1359
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,080
You think that's bad?

1360
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,400
My daughter said ba-ba-booey to me this week.

1361
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,400
Oh, that's so bad.

1362
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,400
That hurts.

1363
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,400
Thanks for listening.

1364
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,600
Thanks for listening to our podcast.

1365
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,760
We're three great dads, and we're happy to have you here.

1366
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,320
We hope you're hanging in there as much as can be expected.

1367
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:24,160
If you want to buy some merchandise, we don't have any jeans on offer currently, but if

1368
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,440
you go to McElroy Merch, you'll find some other stuff.

1369
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,680
There's a cute little boy car pin by Zachary Sterling, our candle lights special, you can

1370
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,180
now get that.

1371
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:39,200
We got a Taste of Luxury stemless wine glass and a t-shirt designed by Kevin Budnick.

1372
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,360
If you want to watch that, by the way, search Taste of Luxury on YouTube and watch it.

1373
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,360
I'd really appreciate it.

1374
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,360
It's real funny.

1375
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,360
I'm so proud of it.

1376
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
I'm so proud of watching things.

1377
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,240
We got an Adventure Zone Live virtual show this week, February 19th at 9pm Eastern Time.

1378
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,160
It's virtual and interactive.

1379
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,080
That means there will come moments when we'll need your help deciding what the players do.

1380
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,520
We're going to be playing Honey Heist with special guest Erica Ishii.

1381
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,520
Tickets are just $10.

1382
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,840
You can get them at live.themacroy.family.

1383
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,800
It's going to be a blast and a half, folks.

1384
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,920
Hey, pre-order Crystal Kingdom.

1385
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
The third?

1386
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Fourth?

1387
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,920
Fourth.

1388
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,920
Jesus.

1389
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,920
We've written a lot of books.

1390
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,960

1394
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,040
Y'all want a final Yahoo?

1395
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,040
Yes, please.

1396
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040

Thank you, Ben.

1399
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:36,160
It is Yahoo Answers user T who asks, how comes bad guys in movies don't eat an apple with

1400
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
a pocket knife no more?

1401
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,160
Yes.

1402
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,160
Thank you.

1403
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,880
My name is Justin McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1406
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,880
This has been my brother, my brother, me, Kiss Your Dad.

1407
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
School.

1408
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,880
Air on the lips.

1409
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
Okay.

1410
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,880
That was the show.

1411
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,880
Hope you had some fun.

1412
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1413
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
Go back into the world.

1414
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Face the day ahead.

1415
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:19,720
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.

1416
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,720

Hey, it's Jesse.

1421
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,040
Hi, Chris.

1422
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,720
It's Jesse calling from Maximum Fun.

1423
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,720
Hey, Jesse.

1424
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,720
I heard that you got into a car accident.

1425
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,960
Yeah, I was listening to stop podcasting yourself and I just laughed so hard that I slammed

1426
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,720
into a construction barrier.

1427
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,480
You remember what it was that was so funny?

1428
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,480
I will never forget.

1429
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,480
I'm sure.

1430
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,120
They started talking about Vegas and the, you know, if it happens here, it stays here

1431
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,120
and that's Logan.

1432
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:56,080
And then Graham was talking about, oh, you know, wasn't there some other slogan for another

1433
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,080
commercial?

1434
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,360
I was like a commercial for food and it said like, whatever's in there stays in there.

1435
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:08,760
I can't remember what it was, clams or something, just so ridiculous.

1436
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,360
And man, I got lightheaded.

1437
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,080
I was laughing so hard.

1438
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:20,280
Next thing I know, they are, they are just brilliantly funny.

1439
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:24,120
So I talked to Dave and Graham from stop podcasting yourself.

1440
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,120
We would like to pay your car repair bill.

1441
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,120
Is that okay?

1442
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,520
That, I mean, that would be super nice, Jesse.

1443
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,400
I really thank you.

1444
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:50,680
I appreciate that.
