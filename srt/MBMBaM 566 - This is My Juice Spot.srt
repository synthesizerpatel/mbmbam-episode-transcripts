1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,700
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother I mean if I show for the margin era

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,940
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis big dog woof woof

9
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,660
Well, I'm sweet baby Griffin. What's wrong? Trap? I just feel like we're in them dog days of summer

10
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,540
You know we live show and that was great. That was definitely a high point

11
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,220
Yeah, the one that people can still

12
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,780
Get and watch for ten bucks. They got a bit that I live for it slash NB NBA and virtual. Yeah, that's the way

13
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,300
No, now I feel like we're in them summer doldrums

14
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,460
Yeah

15
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,020
You know

16
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,260
You know trap. I don't feel that way at all. Oh, really. I want to yes

17
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:02,420
And you but the family pulled in 70 million dollars this weekend, and I just so fucking stoked for these room lords

18
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,780
then Michelle

19
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,060
Tyrese yeah

20
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,820
Wait, everybody does fast and the furious movie

21
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,100
Oh, yeah, dude F9 pulled it in

22
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,800
with 70 million dollars biggest

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,160
Film opening ever during a global pandemic that is still ongoing

24
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:30,380
Biggest whatever name fucking winter Malton said 9's got me feeling fine in his official review

25
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,140
I don't know if the man has passed away or not. My doldrums are cured. That's all

26
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,660
now now Justin

27
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,340
Previously, I believe I believe uh back on how maybe it was even as far back as Thursday

28
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,300
I believe it was you who is saying that there is a

29
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,220
Newspaper in Seattle that did a review of fast and the furious 9 and called it the Muppet babies of

30
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,340
The fast of the furious franchise. Yes, that is correct Travis, but that wasn't that wasn't a bad thing

31
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,940
It wasn't a pejorative now. What does it mean that I've been thinking about it for five days

32
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,620
Five days. Well, what could it just hold on? Wait, it's so important

33
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,900
This is now a f9 watch and we get it's a we didn't set that we usually say that at the start

34
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,520
But this has slowly evolved into a f9 watch and we're here now. Okay, good

35
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,660
Okay, can I fact-check something real quick?

36
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,480
Yes rotten tomato says this is the latest film in the saga the ninth that is actually the tenth

37
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,500
What okay. Yeah. I mean are we counting Hobbs and Shaw? Are we killing?

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Okay, that's

39
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,020
It is part of the saga

40
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,800
It's canonical it's part of the Steven's cigar

41
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:50,360
Honestly, they should just call this one fast and the furious one cuz it's the first one that John Felix Anthony Cena is a part

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
of welcome to the scene

43
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,740
Jonathan you you beautiful invisible man with your mini armbands

44
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,320
Do you think he has that clause in his contract that he can't lose a fight? Oh

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,460
Oh my god, then what happens when he fights the rock?

46
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,380
We are working towards a point where the rock and John Cena and Vin Diesel would get in a fight with each other

47
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,900
All three of them contractually obligated not to lose

48
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,220
Yeah

49
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,380
Run tomatoes while looking at these box office results

50
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:27,200
I got a link to a vid here that says Vin Diesel on the fast and furious future

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,180
It's not over and we'll be back more formidable than ever. Okay. No shit. Yeah, that's the name of it guys

52
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,700
This video is 55 minutes long

53
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:48,380
For 55 minutes about the fact that it's not over and we'll be back more formidable than ever. Hey guys, what's our Muppet Babies?

54
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,420
What does that mean?

55
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:56,980
No, but here's my thing. What's our what's the Muppet Babies of our franchise? Have we made it yet?

56
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:03,940
What's our Muppet Babies? Here's my thing though. Okay, we need to define what it means to be the Muppet Babies of something

57
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,420
Right. I the only way it makes sense to me and I've been thinking about it for a hundred and twenty hours is

58
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,180
if Fast and Furious 9

59
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,500
Features scenes of baby Vin Diesel and baby Rock and baby Tyrese and baby Luda and stuff like that

60
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,740
Otherwise, I have no context for what it means to be the Muppet Babies of a franchise

61
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,680
We use imaginations. I mean, yeah, it's like I guess I

62
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,540
Mean, I guess the episode of Taz we did where we were all babies and it was based on Muppet Babies game

63
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,920
It's probably the Muppet Babies. That's a probably pretty clear one-to-one. Yeah, there was also there's also a Jeffy's Place the

64
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Public access so that we did for a while that had that had that was mostly puppets. Yeah, they all learned lessons about

65
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,480
Math and how not and not and not cussing

66
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,380
There were four of the of the seven

67
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,320
Episodes in the first season four were about not cussing. Yeah, not yeah, and you know what to be fair

68
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,440
I think probably one of the reasons the show didn't hit. Thank you was we spent a lot of time

69
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
explaining what cuss words were

70
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,900
That was a deep dive, okay, this is now a Jeffy's Place watch

71
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,200
Yeah, it used to be a fan I'm watching as a Jeffy's Place watch biggest problems with Jeffy's Place. Let's start them off

72
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,760
Let's do top 75 biggest rounds of Jeffy's Place. I mean you gotta say number one

73
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,320
No, there was no character named Jeffy that created so much confusion, right?

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
There was one there's one named Jeffrey, but he was an adult human. Yeah

75
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Only reference. Yes. Yeah

76
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,720
He was like God in that and but it was very clearly not his place people kept saying like I

77
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,000
Jeffrey should get a place of his own. Yeah, our places. It's not Jeffy's Place. It's Jeffy's Place

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,280
Yeah, I would say number two is probably when we insisted on anatomically incorrect puppets

79
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
And I don't know exactly what we had in mind

80
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,040
And I never settled on it with the art department because the designs of the puppets kept changing every week

81
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Yeah, there I mean everybody remembers huge Huey and he was just like this weirdly

82
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
super muscular

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,360
Puppet and none of the other puppets looked anything like him and nobody even made a big deal out of it

84
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,120
It's just the people thought people want to see a yoke to yoke

85
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,040
None of the muscles were in the right place either. No, they were all over that. Yeah, it was weird

86
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,360
We invited Brian Henson over to look at the puppets and he said there can't be a shoulder here

87
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
Someone get someone to help there can't be a shoulder here

88
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,960
My dad would never allow this and he just started screaming. That's not how knees that's not

89
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,480
I would say one major issue is halfway through the first season when the show is tanking

90
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,160
We realized that we could maybe make inroads as having it be like a nice little bit of McGee and me

91
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,720
Christian television magic and so we sort of pivoted that direction

92
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,440
But also we didn't we also said a lot of wrong stuff about the Bible and things so that you like

93
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,360
Yeah, like God God only likes it when you yell God can't hear you and yes bless you yell your prayers

94
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Like you remember that episode? Yeah, that's called

95
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,820
God only hears you if you yell your prayers and then we got like some feedback from the Christian Council

96
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
I was like, mmm, that's

97
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,120
Yeah, what we do I still yell my prayers to this day guys, you know what?

98
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,440
What's that? Yeah, yell them through a trombone it amplifies that even more. Yep. Well, you've learned that from Jeffy's place

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,720
Yes, I did. Oh, yeah, I liked well, maybe not liked but I think maybe one of the problems was when we did yet again

100
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,120
Another episode about like not consuming household chemicals and we went into detail about where to find the chemicals

101
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,280
right

102
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,240
Yeah, which chemicals might make you imagine weird things and like which ones taste good

103
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,840
But you still shouldn't like they taste candy like but don't you still really shouldn't yeah, that was probably a misstep

104
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,500
Why did we have to start every episode with a huge title card that said brought to you by George Soros

105
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,120
Yeah, why did we decide to leave that up for 49 seconds before every episode and he didn't give us any money

106
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,320
I don't know why we didn't money. It wasn't brought to him by him at all wasn't connected to him in any way

107
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,100
I think we were trying to we were trying to court him with it. I think like it was yeah

108
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,680
There was the one episode that was an employee training video for Dairy Queen

109
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,520
Yeah, he asked us to do and we were like an episode short I guess and so we're like

110
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,720
Let's just put up the Dairy Queen video. That was the best one though. It was really good

111
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,600
It made me it made a lot of kids cry, but you know sandwiched between the bad Bible lessons and then don't cuss series

112
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,160
Just having kids like learn like and this is how you do the dippers

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,760
This is how to this is how we keep our sauces warm, etc

114
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,920
Good show Jeffy's place. Oh, when's that coming back?

115
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,300
Let's reboot it. And you know what a lot of people don't know Chris Evans first job

116
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,000
Evans first

117
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,320
We gave that kid a break and look at him now hat I have my hand buried up Chris Evans ass for so long

118
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,040
I couldn't tell where I ended and he began and that's

119
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Best puppet I ever worked with

120
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,560
Chris Evans, not a human not a human. Sorry an anatomically incorrect puppet

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,260
I'm throwing a surprise birthday

122
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:44,480
Anniversary party for my husband at the end of the year two days after I sent an invite to one of his longtime friends who will call

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,400
See, oh a little injury. I like we so rarely get that

124
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,840
My husband for colonel mustard my husband mentioned in casual conversation that he feels he's been drifting away from see

125
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,240
Man, this question is a weird one to start. This is quite a little energy

126
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,140
Yeah, our show it considering how they've grown apart. He wants to let that relationship die gracefully so he can focus on others

127
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,100
Hey, okay Trev

128
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
I'm

129
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,460
Okay

130
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,380
Husband has made it clear. He wants a clean break from see see has just sent me an RSVP

131
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,620
He shouldn't have done so many letters

132
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,500
RSVP for the party

133
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:36,060
Do I respect my husband's decision up and go about the agonizing process of uninviting somebody from a party for no apparent reason or do?

134
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,860
I play dumb and just let see show up surprise

135
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
Surprise

136
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,660
Not that last one that last one's the worst of both worlds. Yeah, because it still happens when that happens and

137
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,300
It's it and it's bad with and it's bad a bad thing you've done

138
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,780
Man, this is this is a tough one to do because there's two

139
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,300
Like causes for the dissolution of this friendship and one is just like grown-up stuff you

140
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:11,900
you know, maybe both of you haven't been putting in the effort required to maintain this relationship blown off a couple of

141
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,180
Invitations to things not respond to a few texts and then it just kind of slowly

142
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,660
Decays and that is salvageable. Yeah

143
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,240
If it's a situation where see has done something truly heinous and your husband's like I'm I am done with see

144
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,520
Then is it's your husband's birthday party. You should you should do the uncomfortable thing

145
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,840
Well, I mean it does say in the question that's been drifting away and I don't think if someone was like, yeah

146
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,680
He stole my dog and blew my car up, but I feel like we've been drifting away

147
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,720
I think we can pretty much assume now. I will say he ponzi to my dad. Yeah, so I feel like we're growing apart

148
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,840
I I would say for me. There's an added level here, which is that just on a personal level?

149
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I do not care for surprise parties

150
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,720
Oh

151
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,400
Okay, because I like to a part of the exciting thing for a birthday party for me or any kind of party is like looking

152
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,680
Forward to it

153
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,280
And like planning it I like planning it. Hey, I'm this is feeling irrelevant. No, no, no, I'm getting there

154
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,040
Okay, so here's what I would say. Here's what I would want

155
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:21,720
If I were your husband tell your husband about this thing that has happened this misunderstanding and then give your husband the option to you uninvite

156
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,040
themselves from the party

157
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,360
Right. Oh now it's a surprise on the guests, right?

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
My husband's not here

159
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,260
Yeah, you can leave your presents on the table. This is this is not that don't do that

160
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,960
We actually had somebody do that once where there was in college. We were throwing a surprise party

161
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,000
For for someone and she I found out about it and she snuck in the back door like climbed in through the window and jumped

162
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,880
into the kitchen like surprise and everyone looked at her like

163
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,040
you

164
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Have taken everything from me

165
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,280
Reclaiming the power of the event. Yeah, you like that

166
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,560
But nobody else at the party did and also the thing about a surprise party is also like surprise

167
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,400
You're hosting this party and you need to make sure everybody here is happy

168
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,320
Yeah fed and you don't get to go to bed until we all leave. Yeah, I think that adult friendships are

169
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,480
Are are difficult. I think you reach a certain age and

170
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,560
Gaining new friendships becomes a million times harder

171
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,960
and so I reach phases in my life where I'm like

172
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,960
I need to start reconnecting with some buds cuz I'm I ain't making any new ones and

173
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,980
Maybe this is an opportunity for that. But I think you I do think you need to

174
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,680
Like blow the surprise and tell your husband. What's what what is? Yeah, what's happening? No, sir. No, sir, or unless

175
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,880
There's two other things that could happen one this show

176
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:56,120
But the surprise party and then see shows up and husband's like, oh, it's you and she's like, yeah

177
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,680
I guess and your husband's like I I get it

178
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,160
I remember you know what I mean? Like you ponzi my dad, but I still love you like yeah

179
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,340
Forgiveness, you know like it's like it's bad like the bad

180
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,680
Who says that who says that who says forgiveness just be watching they both say it at the same time

181
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,520
Oh and you guys awesome dude, and then other people watching kind of like slowly start muttering like

182
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,480
It's just like yeah, this is just like that one episode of one tree Hill

183
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,960
Yeah

184
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,760
Where is that that one exactly literally this exact the other thing that can happen is?

185
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,800
See shows up and your husband looks at you like, huh and you look at your husband you mouth the words clean kill

186
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
I'm not gonna let you let it die gracefully through neglect

187
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,200
I brought him here cuz I want you to in this fuck like

188
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:52,400
Just fucking put the bolt right in its brain in this relationship in the front of done. Yeah, and it clean kill

189
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Hey everyone, I

190
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Fucking hate this guy

191
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,640
Surprise you don't have to do that. No, you don't have to do that. It could just be hey everybody

192
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,460
I don't feel as close to this guy as I used to and I don't think they're

193
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,940
Necessarily worth keeping tabs on and I don't want to feel anything when they die

194
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,660
So I'm just gonna go ahead do clean break

195
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,580
Yeah, and I think if C and I are both being honest neither one of us has been putting the energy into this

196
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,860
So this has just become a wake for our friendship

197
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,140
Oh PS pizza rolls are coming out in three make sure you save some room

198
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,300
I put them in not knowing you all were here just cuz I wanted pizza rolls

199
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,700
I hope there's enough for everybody and if you feel like you do need to choose between me and see just remember

200
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Which one of them's got pizza rolls?

201
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,740
It's me. It's me the real one

202
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,980
Your real friend your real friend, it's my birthday pizza roll team with me you promise you'd never leave

203
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,860
Can we stroll down that that yellow brick road to go and visit the Wizard of the Cloud?

204
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,500
Cloud sorry, you said Wizard of the Cloud again. Yeah. No, that's what I was gonna become inaccessible

205
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,260
Can't make it less accessible than it is currently to new listeners

206
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,620
Actually you fucking don't I don't know why you thought you got to do maybe because I do the best wizard boys

207
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,620
Yeah, you know, okay, not a bad wizard. It's offensive actually because not every wizard sounds like that

208
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Some wizards are just like what's up? Abracadabra?

209
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:31,060
No problem. No problem. That's fair. Oh, I'm spelling here

210
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
It's fun

211
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,740
So this is this one was sent in by gab thanks gab and it's a it's a

212
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,700
Wiki how article that is titled how to make your cousin jealous, huh? Which is which is awesome

213
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
I got a lot of cousins and

214
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,540
They've been right a little too high on their horses

215
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,660
And so I wanted to sort of know I want to let them know sort of what the pecking order is

216
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,980
Just a quick reminder a lot of these steps are just about sort of empowering yourself

217
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,980
Like always look your best that's good in general. Yeah, that's a good way around your world jealous

218
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,580
Yeah, but when you're but especially your fucking cousin who thinks they're so cool

219
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,160
There's another step here. It says improve yourself and your life, which I feel like I would need several other wiki how articles

220
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
To get a lot of work

221
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,820
Yeah

222
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,020
Why isn't one of the options in there lie?

223
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,780
That would be a much shorter list, huh?

224
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:46,820
I think it'd be easier to lie then number three succeed in life for focus on school to do a good job in it

225
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Oh, what cousin is like?

226
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,460
Yeah, let me check those grades though. Dumb dumb what A's and B's

227
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
shit

228
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,420
Become better than them at something. Okay. All right. Yeah

229
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,540
This is if you realize your cousin likes to paint why not take up painting to practice hard and long until you become better than

230
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,000
your cousin, uh

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,060
so

232
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,700
Mr. McElroy

233
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:19,620
Your gallery opening is a smash hit. Do you remember what it was that first drew you to your aesthetic eye?

234
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,280
yeah, my fucking cousin was talking like

235
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,940
crazy shit and

236
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,740
So I decided to become better at them than painting and that's why I made him open up a gallery next door

237
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,980
That's little and full of his shitty art and I make everybody go from my awesome art building into his awesome shitty art building

238
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,020
Make more friends from school. Maybe even date someone. Whoa

239
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,060
Okay, how did you meet? How'd you meet mom?

240
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,980
my cousin was thinking they were really hot shit and so

241
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:55,980
Be more mature such as being more alert smarter and acting older than they do that came a little late in the list for me

242
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,500
I think yeah, because like a lot of this has been

243
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:06,260
Full journeys of self-improvement based on sure competition and jealousy and then the list is like hey grow up

244
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,420
Grow the fuck up if you do that you the rest of the list doesn't matter because you will stop worrying about making your cousin

245
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,620
Jealous eight be positive nine. Don't let him or her boss you around

246
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:22,560
Ten if an adult asks you and your cousin to do something do it awesome

247
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,940
Damn, you're fucking cool cuz shit you really

248
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:33,580
Damn it. Damn it. I thought I was awesome, but you're over there mopping cuz my mom told you to shit

249
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:39,980
This is so far this list boils down to how to make your cousin jealous be better than them

250
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,900
Yeah, right. That's the obvious right put the work in got it. I want the shortcuts. It's like cousin

251
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,300
I see them three to four times a year. I don't need to really do this

252
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,260
I just got to show up at Christmas looking better with a fine partner on my arm and say I

253
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,940
Nintendo switches, right? That's all

254
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,700
Well, step 11 is get a real shortcut. It's just act strong. Ooh

255
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:13,540
Act sure, that's a good that's a good year or to boil down all the advice that we have ever given on this

256
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,940
program, yep in the end if you had to keep parsing and parsing and dividing and

257
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Eventually you would get to act

258
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,900
strong back strong act

259
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,180
Strong. Yeah, don't be strong act

260
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,820
Strong now what I like about that is that that could be a personality thing, right?

261
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,340
Or you're showing strength of character

262
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,100
But it could also be that you've like bought some inflated dumbbells that look like real dumbbells

263
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,420
And you're pretending to like curl them and it's nothing and you wear like one of those onesies with the big belt

264
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,900
Oh, oh getting canes. Oh, yeah

265
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,900
I directed a Superman musical once and we had an inflatable chair on stage

266
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,420
For this one part where Superman was really upset to demonstrate his strength

267
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
and then he picked up the chair and

268
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,940
Every night that kid would just throw the chair off the stage and it left me thinking

269
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,420
Superman would never throw his armchair through his house. That's true

270
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,260
I don't know why he's decided to add this in I don't improve this improv and every night

271
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,180
I'd ask him not to but every night the spirit of Superman would tell him

272
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,820
Act act strong it goes on to say if your cousin teases you makes fun of you mocks you or embarrasses you or even makes

273
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,780
A low comment about you just ignore it and act as if you didn't hear what they said

274
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,060
Also act like you do not care what they negative thing. They said about you. I'm hoping that step 12 is

275
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,400
Now quick get out of that room and just fucking break down crying just just absolutely lose it

276
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,300
Okay, and let it all get it all out and then go back in the living room and it's time to act strong again

277
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:48,140
That's strong. What's more now? I would argue wiki how I'm sorry that that's act of resilient, right?

278
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
Which don't get me wrong is a good thing as well

279
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,180
But I would posit this if you want to act strong and you have a cousin that belittles you

280
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:00,860
you're gonna want to get maybe whoever the cool uncle is or like the bad boy older cousin or

281
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,380
Somebody like that, right and you're gonna get them in cahoots, right? And when they see you

282
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,340
Getting bullied by this cousin they come over and they say like yeah wimp or whatever and then you turn around and you deck

283
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,220
Cooler cousin or you know, whoever the big one is and then they start crying and they're like, oh, you're so strong

284
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,300
I didn't know you're so strong and then they run off crying and then you turn to a cousin

285
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:30,320
You're trying to make jealous and you're like, do you want some now now you will have to pay your plant about a hundred and fifty

286
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,780
Dollars American that's the going rate for one of these right?

287
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,860
But if you can establish dominance that way right you don't have to do any of that other shit

288
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
It goes on to like another

289
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:50,560
Series of tips and the tips are how to develop common interests if you realize they like to paint why not take up painting, too

290
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Now this isn't

291
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,260
If they notice that you've taken up their hobby and they say you're a copycat

292
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,580
I can do it better or something the sort don't react to say well

293
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,780
You've been doing it for years and I just started this is literally one of the steps

294
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:09,380
This is like they've like damn did we explain the take up painting but become better at painting thing enough? No, let's get back

295
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,900
It's already out there. It's getting clicks

296
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,420
We can't change it now, but this is the next thing and is the last tip and so fucking important

297
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,620
I hope we should have put this first because there's probably people out there making their cousins mad jealous and they didn't hear this

298
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,000
Very important thing. It's the final thing and that's remember don't walk up to them and rub things in their faces

299
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,380
You just want to make them jealous not make them hate you. That's so important. That's so important

300
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,580
That's so important. I've never been jealous of someone who's trying to make me jealous

301
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,860
But I've definitely been jealous of people who are just flat-out better than me

302
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,180
So just keep that in mind. You don't want to you don't want to show your hand

303
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:47,060
Right. You want to make it seem like you care about your own self-development and it has nothing to do with them

304
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:53,280
And that's the trickiest part because when you get fucking kick-ass at painting and they're still like doing squiggles or whatever

305
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:00,460
You're gonna wanna make a big deal out of it. I totally get that but then they'll hate but then they'll hate you

306
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,860
But jealousy and love go hand in hand, right?

307
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,860
All hatred and jealousy and love and cousins

308
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:14,860
I'm just saying a competition is only fueled by like your desire to prove to them that you're better than them

309
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:20,980
So you care about what they think right? Yeah, and this is gonna spur you both on jealousy can be a powerful force

310
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:27,620
Look at Picasso and da Vinci. Those two were always competing at each other's fucking throats

311
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,380
But they know you know what they did though

312
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,420
They didn't take it over the top. They were jealous of each other. They never hated each other

313
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,420
No, and they only kissed twice

314
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,100
Yeah

315
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
Here's what's fucked up gang

316
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
the Q&A segment

317
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,700
Full of laughs the questions are here and they're plentiful if you want to see these answers

318
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,660
These staff researched answers is what they're calling them

319
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,940
You have to pay US dollars American money. Well, that's okay for us

320
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:03,740
No one should do that. But for us that is a business investment. That's true. We couldn't claim it is name your own price

321
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,860
It is name your own price. Well, that's like that price starts at $1

322
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,100
Which I don't know that looking at what internet people say how to make cousins jealous is worth that much money

323
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,420
I don't know if we could talk to our financial experts and say oh gang

324
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,060
It looks like you wrote off $1 on wikiHow so we are going to be audited

325
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,540
terribly

326
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,780
Hey guys, my cousin is rude and disrespectful. I told my mom, but she won't address the problem. What do I do?

327
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,460
I don't fucking know your cousin better. I guess so

328
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,600
Here's another question. My wife and I used to participate in a trivia night at a nearby dive bar

329
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Shitty beer

330
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,580
Doors on the stalls

331
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,540
Team names, I don't I don't remember

332
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:55,460
The one that Dwight and me and Sid and everybody used to do was there are received bird is two for trivia. Yeah

333
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
That's pretty good. That's a good one

334
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,660
Anyway with trivia night prizes for winning rounds varied from gift cards to food and drink

335
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,300
We went around and the host of the game came by with our prize

336
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,980
Which was a small scrap of paper that said six shots of fireball. He said we could redeem it at the bar

337
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,100
Neither of us were interested in shots that night, but figured we'd come back later with friends

338
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,460
However, due to a global pandemic. We have not been able to return to the bar in almost a year. It is now reopened

339
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
I would like to claim our prize

340
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,260
How do I convince the bartender that I did not write six shots of fireball a scrap of paper?

341
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,380
I still plan on going and paying for food drinks

342
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:40,380
But I would also like my free spicy drink and that's from does this count as money in Des Moines?

343
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,860
And this is a good question. I think right now we're talking right off the bat

344
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:51,780
there's gonna be some credibility because if you were going to write if you were going to scribble on a piece of paper six free shots of

345
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,260
blank

346
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
Right fireball is never

347
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:03,060
Unless you're our father who has from what I understand taking on quite a a pinch on for fireball

348
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:10,320
You know, you're kidding me. He makes it he makes a cocktail out of it and like diet like Coke Zero or something like

349
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Now hold on

350
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,400
Sorry, I'm dry wretching the podcast will resume soon. Fireball does have a cinnamony thing

351
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,200
I can see that going with like a like a Coke like with some grenadine

352
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Perhaps I don't know

353
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,660
I'm gonna find out what this master mixologist

354
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,720
Has not like drank drank no, no, yeah ever

355
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,340
I don't believe he started consuming alcohol on a even semi regular basis until he was 63 not even then

356
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,860
Not even then he told me I visited that full

357
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,140
I visited that fool for Father's Day. You're welcome. Dad

358
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,660
Not that he listens, but we visited that fool for Father's Day and he showed me a place outside his house and he said

359
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:05,740
Every he told me and my children right in front of my children. He says girls every morning. This is where

360
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:13,700
Peeps comes out and does a crossword puzzle. It drinks a juice. Oh boy. Awesome. So retirements going well, huh?

361
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,580
And he said that was a straight face I

362
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:28,260
I just laid down on the ground. It's so fucking depressing because we share so much genetic material

363
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,160
But that's gonna be me in 25 years. Just like anyway, this is my juice spot

364
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,260
Every morning I walk out the back door my house takes six

365
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,780
Well for me it'll be you know kind of a hover crossword, yeah

366
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:52,060
A holographic, you know, three-dimensional letter cube with hollow my hollow drink. This is where I solve my tesseract

367
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,900
Between that and me having coffee and playing a little bit of video games every morning

368
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,700
You don't probably announce it to my children. That's true

369
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,260
So the listen the

370
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,740
This is money, right? I mean, yeah, this is the thing

371
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,660
This is money, but it's not money anymore. It was money the night that you got it

372
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,800
But now it's not money if you go back there if it's Huntington like they're

373
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,940
This is not the same bar anymore

374
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:35,300
First off you're gonna walk in and it'll be like stumblers four or five you're down several stumblers at this point

375
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,440
Yeah, and it's not the same bar. They do not have to honor that that said I

376
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
feel like if you

377
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Tell them this story

378
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,040
the vibes

379
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,520
currently

380
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,920
might be

381
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,260
Conducive to in your favor for sure. Yeah, we all want that for ourselves

382
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,520
We want this to be a thing that happened nature is healing for you. Nature is feeling itself

383
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,160
You know what? Let me give you a two-word answer here. I'm strong

384
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,800

386
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,540
Totally justifiable thing because it is listen

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,720
You won you have your side deliver it like it's the truth don't shrug

388

Hey, I want you to walk up and say so here's what happened

You know now that you're all blissed out

430
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:04,660
There's that letter that you need to be sending. Oh, no, you know the one the one just telling

431
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Dartmouth College, no, thanks. No, I appreciate it. I appreciate it full ride to be your biggest brain

432
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,820
That's what it said here on the letter, but I'm I'm I said, no, thanks. I'm going to Marshall University. Go ahead

433
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,500
So that letter is not going to send itself. It's going to need a stamp in it and on it and

434
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:31,700
Stamps.com is going to help you do that. It's summertime things are getting back to normal a little bit still in the throes of a pandemic

But you do it on your fricking computer and they let you print out official US postage and shipping labels 24-7

00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:06,500
I would like to posit a new, uh, slogan for stamps. Never go to the post office again. It's very good. Stamps.com, how about this?

443
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500

That's we'll work on that. Uh-huh. It's pretty good though, huh? I don't it's a little it's coming at me a little yodo-y

447
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,780
Yodo like yodo from the trip you skip from home you ship

448
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,020
Okay, so I once yodo

462
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,700
Yeah, no need for a stamp store

463
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,780
Lady in the tramp store. Okay. Yeah, we've lost it completely

464
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:53,460
Hi everybody, my name is justin mcroy. I'm sydney mcroy. We're both doctors and no just me. Okay. Well sydney's a doctor and i'm a medical

465
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,820
Enthusiast and we create saw bones a marital tour of misguided medicine every week

466
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,860
I dig through the annals of medical history to bring you the wildest grossest

467
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Sometimes dumbest tales of ways. We've tried to treat people throughout history

468
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,740
And lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine because every time we do a fake medicine

469
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:17,220
Lately, we do a lot of modern fake medicine because everything's a disaster

470
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,460
But it's slightly less of a disaster every friday right here on maximumfun.org as we bring you saw bones a marital tour of misguided

471
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,160
Medicine and remember don't drill a hole in your head

472
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
Oh

473
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,000
Do you want a munch whoa

474
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,580
I'm, so excited to hear this one squad. Can I just do it really quick really quick because I did text dad

475
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,560
Hey, what was that cocktail you made with fireball in it and he responded

476
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,640
Cherry coke zero and free ball and then he texted fireball. So

477
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,240
He's already calls it he calls it the free ball. He's a couple free balls deep at this point. Yeah

478
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,000
Um, I actually have like kind of a survey of stuff

479
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,960
Like a lot of people been sending them in. I haven't done one in a long time

480
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
so I just wanted to mention because

481
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,480
Uh munch squad is renewed for another season

482
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,520
Oh nice. Congrats. Yeah, we got brought back. Uh, so thanks to ryan and matt for submitting some of these

483
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,840
and uh

484
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,080
So just real quick just some quick quick ones

485
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,040
All right

486
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,440
Number one and I saw this on one of my main sites for news

487
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,760
And I was first like how dare you okay. So this is a story

488
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,800
Papa john san antonio provides teacher appreciation pizza party

489
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,520
Hey, you released a news story about how you did a pizza party

490
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,560
Your papa john's that's pretty cool

491
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:08,060
They donated pizzas ending the school year on a high note for two deserving schools in edgewood isd

492
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,760
winston elementary school and et rand middle school donations were made in the form of pizza parties and

493
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,200
This is the reason i'm bringing this to you because you're right griffin

494
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,320
The more I thought about I was like, you know, I think it's kind of wild to teach your own pizza horn

495
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:30,680
But this is why corporations do charity, right? They want they want the attention and are giving it to them and the cycle is complete

496
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
I don't know. It's kind of a cynical way of looking at it

497
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Well, the wheel keeps on spinning

498
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,840
But here's the part where I had to stop for a second

499
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,840
donations were made in the form of pizza parties

500
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,400
And a visit from mr. Slice, huh? The franchise mascot. Oh

501
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,480
Hey

502
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,040
Hey, wait a minute. Huh? Wow

503
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Can we all did we just?

504
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Sorry, did you say?

505
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,560
the papa john's mascot

506
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,080
I would actually say it's even wilder than that

507
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,400
This is a specific franchise in san antonio that said hey, do you know how papa john's doesn't have a mascot?

508
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,080
Fuck that. No, travis. We do travis. No, actually it says the franchise mascot

509
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,720
It's the mascot of papa john's

510
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,600
Mr. Slice. Okay, I would argue saying the franchise means that

511
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:33,240
Location. No, sir. No, sir. I'm here to tell you that there is a mascot of papa. John's pizza

512
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,080
His name is mr. Slice. I gotta look this up. What's he look like his name is no you don't need to look it up

513
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm here. Just shut the fuck up showing you he's telling you i'm telling you i'm paying you a picture. His name is mr

514
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,400
Slice, he is his name is mr. Slice

515
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
His name is mr. Slice

516
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,680
He had he's shaped like a giant piece of pizza

517
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:58,040
Yeah, it looks a little like because it's impossible to make a good triangle costume. He looks a little deflated

518
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:04,520
His name is mr. Slice and I will say it is kind of hilarious that they said part of our donation

519
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,800
Part of our donation is a visit from mr. Slice the franchise mascot

520
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,800
So if I search mr. Slice papa john's

521
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Mr. Slice

522
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,800
The first result is a tweet

523
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,340
from

524
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,280
2017

525
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,560
Where papa john's is talking about a spotify playlist that mr. Slice put together

526
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:35,480
That's the top result the the one right after that is a papa john's mr. Slice costume for sale on ebay. Okay

527
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,320
This is your storied character. This is your franchise mascot

528
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,480
Mr. Slice, huh? Here's what's sus to me

529
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,720
papa john

530
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
resigned in summer 2018

531
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,120
so it feels like maybe a year before papa john's was like

532
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:00,600
Papa john shatner ain't long for this world. We gotta get someone new in here fresh blood fresh meat fresh sauce

533
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,120
Travis you've just sent us a link to a video of someone dressed as mr. Slice making dough. Uh-huh

534
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:15,500
Uh-huh slapping dough actually has the video describes it. Well, wait this video this video was posted on my birthday 2010

535
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,620
Yeah

536
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,780
Okay, so here's I need you to do well you have to move on to other stories but do we

537
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:28,780
Please tweet at papa john's and shack and ask him where the fuck mr. Slice is. I want to see these brands

538
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,620
Don't say fuck because the brands won't engage with you if you use profanity. Oh, right, right, right

539
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,780
But let's talk about that on jeffy's place talking about mr. Slice because where's mr. Slice

540
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,780
Now they hide again

541
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,940
I I just one last thing and I will say too looking at all the pictures I can find of this costume

542
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,860
You would think a very large brand would figure out how to structure a mascot costume

543
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,500
So that it doesn't look like a melting rocket pot. No, this is what i'm saying

544
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,900
It's it's a it's a bad costume and I see why they killed him, but please bring him back

545
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,580
We all deserve it. It's been a tough quarantine for it doesn't seem like he's dead

546
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,080
It just seems like he's on the run hiding in san antonio

547
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,120
Yeah, yeah real quick. Just want to do this isn't a joke. I have nothing to read about it

548
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,320
I just feel like it's really important that we're all united in trying to keep tabs on kraft Heinz canada

549
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,760
Because everybody knows that they have been getting buck wild

550
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,600
Uh constantly just constant buck wild attitudes

551
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,680
Um, and I do want to say that this week they decided to churn out

552
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
six different flavor boosts

553
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,360
For kd which is of course

554
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,320
Craft dinner. Uh-huh. They got six different flavor boosts for you to just sort of enjoy

555
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,200
Um, and let's let's talk about them first off when they tweet about these they have to do the tweet in english and in french

556
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,800

557
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,400
Is is nice. I wish everybody had the multiple languages for everybody to enjoy this great news

558
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,960
That they're doing some kd flavor boosts. First up is so you the thing is you make the kd

559
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,320

561
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,120
You make the kd and then you put in a flavor boost like buffalo wings. Okay that coming don't we? That's a good one

562
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:14,720

Okay, there's it makes sense for me

565
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,080
Yeah, and then we got ghost pepper. Oh boy. It feels a little

566
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,840
Oh, that's our third spicy one. I think they're saying it should be spicy

567
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,240
But why did okay? I said I want a kd that hurts but not kd that kills

568
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,520
Yeah, it's a painful brutal kd next one. And this one I y'all I can't stop thinking about butter chicken. Oh

569
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,920
These are good boosts justin this is a good boost right if the sixth one isn't wild

570
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:54,000
This is one of those rare munch squads where i'm like, yeah, you get it craft. Yeah. Well, it's cotton candy, huh? Ha ha ha ha ha

571
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,680

Guys, you all craft times canada can't fucking help themselves

573
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,360
No

574
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,000
They get so close to greatness to immortality

575
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,120
And then it's just snatched away from them by something like katie doesn't that feel like someone announced six?

576
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,400
And then they're like we said five. No, we said five. Oh fuck. We said fuck shit
