1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's the start of something beautiful.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My life, it feels like life.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My life, oh, it's better with you.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Big Dog Woof Woof Travis Woof Woof Woof McElroy.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I have a question for you guys, is this your card?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh wow, it is. It is, yes, the Joker.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But that's a place card.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, right Travis, I've created these place cards to reserve our spot at a new restaurant being opened by none other than Mr. Mindfreak himself, Chris Angel.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And it just, I didn't even want to save it for Munch Squad.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's too good for Munch Squad, and I feel like trying to put Chris Angel, who is so much a part of the tapestry of this program, into Munch Squad is like, it's kind of selfish.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's like trying to trap him in anything, really.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's exactly right, put him in anything, lock him into Munch Squad, lock him into a glass coffin, he will get out.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now let me ask you this, Justin, I know nothing about this prior to this moment.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you kidding?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I know what it's called.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it called Tummy Freak?

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, no, it's got a great name, every bit of this story is the best.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can I just say real quick, my favorite fact about Chris Angel, as far as I know, only professional living magician to be featured prominently on an episode of CSI Las Vegas.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But not as himself.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My friend Dwight Slappy, you know him, he's a star of Things I Bought at Sheets, and of course Taste of Luxury, he often talks about the Phil Collins flip, where he started listening to, or sorry, the Billy Joel flip, where he started listening to Billy Joel ironically, and then oops-a-daisy, he was like deeply in, right?

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And I feel like that happened with Guy Fieri, where I'm just like, I'm bored, I love the brand.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I feel like I'm dipping into that with Chris Angel after reading this latest thing, where like, I'm just happy he's here, you know what I mean?

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm just happy he's around.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tell me what the name of the restaurant is.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I feel like that's the last thing you learn, Travis.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh boy, okay, okay.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's so, it's the best, we could sit here, Travis, and for the next one hour, come up with names for restaurants opened by Chris Angel in rural Nevada.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And we would, the best we would achieve would be, I would say, maximum 15% as good as the name that Mr. Angel has selected for himself.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Susan Stapleton over at Eater has got the story that I'm referring to here, so thank you, Susan, for your pioneering work.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Chris Angel, the mind freak magician with a show at Planet Hollywood Resort is going into the restaurant business.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He bought a restaurant called Sugar's Home Plate, some 65 miles northeast from Las Vegas in Overton, Nevada.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So a real destination restaurant.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, now he's got, is actually a sweet story.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Apparently he's out in that neighborhood with his seven-year-old son, Johnny Christopher, who was diagnosed with leukemia, and part of the, I guess, the way they got away from it all was dirt biking.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So they're out there in Overton, and they spot this restaurant, this Sugar's Home Plate.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They say, Magic, Magic, Papa, what was that restaurant we just ramped over?

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And he said, I don't know, let's pull up.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He got out, loved the location.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's ramp through the picture window in the front.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I should mention that Chris Angel, C-R-I-S-S Angel, his son is named Johnny Christopher, C-R-I-S-S-T-O-P-H-E-R, live that brand, live that brand.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I love this man because he lives that brand.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can acknowledge the fact that if he named his son Christopher at all with a different Christopher spelling, it would be so wild.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now, Griffin, some may argue that he picked the name Christopher, so he did open that door himself.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But anyway, I think all credit to that young man.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That is going to be a unique life, and I can't wait for Johnny Christopher to live it, because that's going to be quite a journey.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But so they're at Durbeiken, right? And Chris says…

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We can just say an experience we can all relate to, right?

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Out there at Durbeiken with our magic daddy in rural Nevada.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, we've all been there.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And it's like Chris says, the more time we spent there, the more he got to know the town and the people, he just fell in love with this area.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's nice.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I mean, it's nice.

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's like opening a camp for kids also going over with pediatric cancer and their families, and they're doing all kinds of stuff out there.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Chris Angel, Heart of Gold, I guess.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Chris Angel.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's like, I'm doing this cool thing, and we'll talk about that.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think, Griffin, you're referring to…

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We are sort of backing into this, but I'm into it.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Angel is planning to build Chris Angel's Escape Camp Adventures, which is another fucking great name for a place.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
On 14 acres in this same region.

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hey, Jerick, where are you heading this Saturday?

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, me?

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I want Chris Angel's Escape Camp Adventures.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes!

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No way!

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Can you escape the camp?

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know!

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's my favorite Goosebumps Chooser and Adventure book.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So let's talk.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So he's like, you know what?

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to have a fucking restaurant here.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You know what I mean?

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So he made this announcement.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They're going to reopen the restaurant in July with dine-in service, a walk-up window, and takeout.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They're going to have…

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So it's a partnership.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:15,000
His brother, Costa Sarantacos, and a pizza maker named Mike Baram, they're going to convert the restaurant into a fast, casual…

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oops.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Almost said it.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So he's got some experienced people on board, and they're going to have breakfast, which includes…

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They got Belgian waffles, French toast, pancakes, omelets, and breakfast.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yummy!

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Nice.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
For lunch, you stayed seated.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You were so full and satisfied, you stayed in your bed, and now we're doing lunch.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
For lunch, we got you a nice Mopa chicken fried steak, chicken parmesan.

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You think they do a turkey club?

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I like a turkey club.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, definitely.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Definitely.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Burgers, sandwiches, calzones, wraps, salads, and pizzas.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Pretty standard stuff.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I was expecting a little weirder from old Tracy.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, there's a cocktail that's fun.

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They do have a cocktail named the Mind Freeze.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, yes, yes.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It says here, an eater concocted with vodka and one of more than 100 flavors of Italian ice.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wow.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's the anchor for this whole experience.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I cannot believe that it's not called Mind Freeze.

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The ambition, right?

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Right.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The ambition of 100 different flavors, and that's not even the point of the restaurant, right?

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ancillary at best.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If it had been a snow cone place called Mind Freeze that was just like, here's what we got at my place,

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
100 different flavors of snow cone and also vodka.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's go.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I would make a pilgrimage to get to Mind Freeze.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Do you think he's working the counter at Mind Freeze?

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I mean, he's going to be working the counter at this place, which is, Travis, it is called...

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, wait.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Just to refresh you, Travis.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is Criss Angel's restaurant.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Right.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Where they have breakfast, and they have lunch, and they have pizza.

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So this is Criss Angel's breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, sorry, the name of the restaurant is Kablip.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ooh.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Short for it's C-A-B-L-P Criss Angel's breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Kablip.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Kablip's the name of it.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The branding.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I love this.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The name of it's Kablip.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The name of it is Kablip.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Not since 90s Nickelodeon's Kablam has there been a name I've been so on board with.

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A coward like us, we would have thought about it for an hour and eventually just come up with Mind Eats.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And it wouldn't have been...

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sticking with Tummy Freak, but Tummy Freak is awesome.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Tummy Freak is fine.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Mind Eats is good.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But no, he just went ahead and called it Kablip, and it's going to be open in July, which is amazing.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's why he's Criss Angel, and we're just us.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, we're just living...

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Criss, as always, I would fucking love if you want to come on the show and talk about the show...

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Mind Freak is going to reopen July 7th.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The restaurant's open in July.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you want to come on, you know, get at me, bud.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Talk about your time on CSI Las Vegas.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Anything you want to do.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I would be so excited to welcome you onto the show.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thank you.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You could do some audio magic tricks?

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Audio magic.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So anyway, that's the deal with...

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's the deal with that.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Very exciting.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I bet.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Very excited about that.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I bet it's good.

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah, of course it'll be good.

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is the thing.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There's actually an aspect of it where if the only kind of Criss Angel tie-in is the Mind Freeze,

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and of course, the co-of-cublip.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But it does feel like he went like, no, this isn't a gimmick.

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is my new thing.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Damn it.

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was sent that story by so many people, and every single one of the people had some variation of this message.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I know for a fact 100% that you have been sent this a dozen times.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But I can't risk you not seeing it, so here it is again.

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So thank you to everybody that sent along co-blip.

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And you know, when we talk about support coming in a lot of different ways, this is what we mean.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Thank you.

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can we...

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The name's so funny, co-blip.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
First of all, there's no I in there, so they can try and say co-blip, but it is co-bulp.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And there's no way around that.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But even...

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, let's take apart...

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just ignore the abbreviation that they've chosen arbitrarily.

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The name Criss Angel's Breakfast, Lunch, and Pizza is such a wild choice, Christopher.

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, because otherwise it would have been Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, and then it would have been co-blad.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And that's not it.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do they close at two?

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Or is it...

204
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Can you eat dinner there?

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, if you're there at four, they flip open stuff on the side.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They have a full lunch menu.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
At four o'clock, it disappears, and just the word pizza appears.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is what you can have now.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Now you can have pizza.

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, Griffith, come on.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If pizza was included in lunch, they wouldn't call it Criss Angel's Breakfast, Lunch, and Pizza.

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They would just call it Criss Angel's Breakfast and Lunch, right?

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So pizza denotes some sort of other meal.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Not necessarily dinner, though.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Because it does seem to imply, like, we have this varied menu for breakfast.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There's varied menu for lunch.

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then I hope you like pizza.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, and if you show up Sundays 11, 14 to 2, 23, you can get the pizza brunch.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Which is kind of a...walks all the different worlds, because they've got like eggs in them.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't tell my brother, though.

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because I have not gotten him to sign off on that, and he will be so pissed off.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This is an advice show.

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Obviously.

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, obviously.

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And we're going to help people.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm looking for a place that serves breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

228
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, fuck, we can answer this one.

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, we can do this one.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No magicians, though.

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Fuck.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Fuck.

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you walk in the door later in the day, he's going to grab you by your lapel and say,

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How many meals have you eaten today?

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because if you say two, you're not eating here.

236
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We don't have dinner.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I keep telling people that.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you've already had your lunch, you could go.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
My husband and I were finally able to secure patio furniture after manufacturing shortages last year made it impossible.

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm really excited to have a change of scenery for my WFH days.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Work from home.

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Work from home.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Thank you.

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Sorry, that has been my reality for every decade.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I got it now.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Work from home days, while the weather is still nice, but I'm running against a new etiquette dilemma.

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Our porch is on the front of the house, and I can hear a neighbor that I'm friendly with next door working on his lawn.

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He can't see me, but I can hear him sneezing frequently due to yard work.

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't want to be weird and possibly startle him by yelling, bless you, from where he can't see me.

251
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But it seems like it'd be awkward to stand up, make myself known, and then say it when we're both in the middle of projects.

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I know the most logical thing is just to say nothing, but then I feel like I'm disappointing my mom by being rude.

253
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How would you handle this?

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's from Allergy Awkwardness in Boston.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That last part, the feeling of being rude, I think that's universal, right?

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sure.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If I hear someone sneeze, one, it's pretty much automatic.

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Bless you.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Something like...

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Gesundheit!

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, why did I say that?

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, gesundheit.

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Why are we still doing that, though?

265
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The demons.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No, no, jokes out of the room, just for like two seconds.

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, let's send jokes out there for a second.

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why are we still blessing people?

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You don't need to do any of it.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The only thing you're saying is, I know you sneezed, and I don't want you to die.

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
As a person, I think you're worth acknowledging, and you also sneeze.

272
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I know that what you guys are saying is true, but I just pictured someone sneezing.

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm talking to someone and they sneeze into their elbow because you've got to sleeve it.

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Right.

275
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I just look at them.

276
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah.

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And I say nothing.

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Beryl, I'm nothing.

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What could you say, okay, let me ask you this.

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What could you say that would impart the same sentiment?

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This doesn't help this question answer, but what would you...

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Nice.

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're originally saying this like, hey, I noticed you sneezed.

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There's a...

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Because you sneezed and you didn't fucking blow...

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Okay, sneezing is weird because for a second, you're not the boss.

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Right.

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
When you sneeze, you're just rolling the dice that everything kind of stays on.

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What they're saying is like, hey, I know you let yourself...

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You lost control for a second there.

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey, I know you Mr. Hide It Out for a moment.

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

293
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You lost control for a second, but I want to congratulate you.

294
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You reined it back in, and you are running the ship again, and I'm so proud of that.

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You didn't blow your ass off.

296
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You didn't try to hold it in a weird way that made your eyeballs pop out.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You are good.

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You did a good job.

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You did it.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You're back in control.

301
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Welcome back.

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Here's a fun thing that you can do at home.

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If you're ever talking to a new person and you sneeze, make a really scared look and go,

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
what was that?

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And act like it's the first time you've ever sneezed in your entire life.

306
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's fun.

307
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's got big third rock from the sun energy.

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah.

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I love that.

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, it's very...

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, bees bow.

312
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I just feel like it doesn't do anything.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I sneeze...

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
First of all, y'all can say whatever you want.

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A sneeze feels good.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I like...

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Especially when you're chasing it.

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, when you're chasing that sneeze and you get one after a long day of working at getting

319
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
that sneeze, and then you feel good from it.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I like letting Jesus take the wheel for a fraction of a second.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And then when you say, bless you, there's an element of that.

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And I'm picking up subtext.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I've also laid this subtext down of, I forgive you for the loud noise you just made.

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's fine.

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's fine.

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's okay that you just made that loud noise with the wind inside of you.

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's interesting though, because if you compare it to a burp, right?

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The burp-er is expected to say, excuse me.

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But when you sneeze, it becomes an outward problem for everyone around you to acknowledge.

330
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's just wind, isn't it?

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's just wind.

332
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How come when the wind comes from our bellies, we have to fucking prostrate ourselves and

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
beg forgiveness.

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But when wind comes from our nose, we look around like, where the fuck were you guys

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
on that one?

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The wind comes from the belly and all of a sudden you are an outcast.

337
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You don't do that here.

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But you sneeze and it goes up your mouth and your nose, then it's my problem?

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That doesn't make any sense.

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're being christened all of a sudden.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me.

342
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Bless my farts.

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's just switch it for one year.

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
For one year, let's switch it.

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And when you sneeze, you have to, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's embarrassing.

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And when you do rip, then you look around like, anyone going to cover me on that one?

348
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No.

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay.

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's so weird.

351
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Rude.

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
When you think about farts, it is weird.

353
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How did air get in the mix?

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You know what I mean?

355
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There wasn't air on my hamburger.

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You don't put air on your hamburger?

358
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't think so.

359
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's just weird.

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's just weird.

361
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Is it because, okay, and let's keep breaking this down.

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because I'm frankly, boys, I'm having a lot of fun in this space right now.

363
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If the sneeze had a bad odor.

364
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
If a sneeze smelled like a fart.

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, no, I don't even want to go that specific.

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But if the sneeze had a bad odor, then would the onus be back on the sneezer to beg forgiveness?

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There is badness in a sneeze.

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's not like you sneeze and you're like, oh, thank you.

369
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Especially in these unprecedented times.

370
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's a good point.

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I think that when you sneeze, you should have to say like, oh, no.

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Not again.

373
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Something that acknowledges a weakness in the body.

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Right?

375
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Because that's the thing.

376
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Okay.

377
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Sneezes are a weakness leaving the body.

378
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is what I'm saying.

379
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
When you fart or burp, incredibly natural, it happens every time.

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
A sneeze indicates something has gone wrong.

381
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes.

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Your body is like, listen, we have an intruder.

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I only know one way to deal with it.

384
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Right.

385
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This is what I'm saying.

386
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
In many ways, a fart and a burp is your body going, hey, thanks for that food to sustain me.

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And a sneeze is like, you put something bad in here.

388
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Do you feel like with a sneeze, there's a discussion, an Osmosis Jones style discussion in the body,

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
where it's like, listen, I don't know if this merits it.

390
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We're really not supposed to do this a lot.

391
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because it does trip them out pretty bad to not be in control.

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But I think we do have to blow this out of here.

393
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Also, Travis, and no, I'm not going to throw any stones or anything.

394
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But I don't think that you are the best evaluator of what is a normal amount of wind to leave your digestive system.

395
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay, let's see.

396
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, but Griffin, you're making my point for me.

397
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I have GERD right here.

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It makes me burp slightly more.

399
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Did you call it GERD?

400
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I've only heard about this GERD every time I've eaten within a mile of Travis.

401
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I better cover my mouth.

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think he said GERT.

403
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
GERT.

404
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I got yogurt.

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I love that stuff.

406
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If I don't cover my mouth now, my four-year-old looks at me and goes, excuse you.

407
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And it cuts to the quick of me.

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's weird that it took that.

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah, anywho, what I'm saying is I have a condition.

410
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And it makes me burp, right?

411
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Right.

412
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If you sneeze.

413
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, you could have a sneezing condition.

414
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There are so many sneezing conditions.

415
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You don't actually have a point.

416
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't.

417
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's like an anti-point.

418
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

419
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's just ignore the sounds.

420
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Here are the sounds you're allowed to comment on that my body makes.

421
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Words.

422
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
End of list.

423
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Words.

424
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Laughter.

425
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Mmm.

426
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Moans.

427
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What about a loud, like a loud, like, UGH!

428
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Like a gasp.

429
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah.

430
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Because that's a fight or flight thing.

431
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh no, Griffin.

432
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What has scared you?

433
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And will it scare me?

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I need to know.

435
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is there a bear around?

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

437
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Is there you being attacked?

438
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You need to know that information.

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But if I do a regular wind.

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's hard.

441
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think we should just ignore all body sounds.

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ignore sneezes.

443
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ignore farts.

444
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Ignore when people jizz and they say aruga.

445
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Ignore.

446
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
All those.

447
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
All those.

448
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Wait, when they jizz and their head turns into a big green wolf head and it goes aruga

449
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and the mouth gets really loud.

450
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And the steam comes out their ears.

451
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Like, don't fucking, don't even fucking bring it up.

452
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And when the shoes squeak, we get it.

453
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We got it when you've been alone.

454
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay?

455
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It sounds like a fart a little bit sometimes.

456
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
All right?

457
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Calm down.

459
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If you're feeling good and you're a politician named Theodore Cruz.

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Then you can just look at him and nod.

461
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Okay.

462
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,160
Now, the one, I would argue that the one body sound we can all ignore is when your tummy

463
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,120
gurgles a little bit because it's hungry.

464
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
And you can be like, oh, sorry.

465
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
I'm just a little hungry.

466
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Right?

467
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I think that one's still okay.

468
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Right?

469
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
That's cute.

470
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
That's cute.

471
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
I love that.

472
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Yeah.

473
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
That's fine.

474
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,000
I saw an unofficial piece of merch floating around out there that said that Ted Cruz likes

475
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,680
to pee in his pants because he likes the warm feeling between his legs.

476
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,080
And I was pleased at first, but also incensed because, you know, that's, that I would love

477
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
your IP.

478
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,640
I would let my, that Ted Cruz is my IP, but so I'm sorry, but he's a real stinker.

479
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,400
It turns out, but I was wondering, like, we can't make that shirt cause we'll be, it's

480
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,600
seems very litigious.

481
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,800
I mean, even, even saying the words out loud on this show, it does seem somewhat libelous,

482
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,320
although this is a comedy show and that's fair use, whatever.

483
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,080
But I was wondering if we could make a shirt that says-

484
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,280
And I think they originally said it on Dear Mythical Morning and we're just quoting them.

485
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
So- Oh, really?

486
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Good Mythical Morning.

487
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
No.

488
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Oh, okay.

489
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I didn't know.

490
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
But I'm trying to throw some of the blame.

491
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Right.

492
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Throw it around.

493
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Yeah.

494
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I heard, I heard.

495
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
They can handle it.

496
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Yeah.

497
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Rhett and Link can take this.

498
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Good Mythical Morning said it, not us.

499
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,760
But if we made a shirt that said Teb Cruz and it was a B instead of a D and then, but

500
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,520
the rest of the words were normal and we put it in quotes and attributed it to Good Mythical

501
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Morning.

502
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
To Good Mythical Morning.

503
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,840
So you're saying the shirt would read, thusly, Teb Cruz who likes to be his fans cause he

504
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,440
loves the warm, wet feeling between his legs.

505
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,480
Sincerely, Rhett and Link of the popular YouTube series, Good Mythical Morning.

506
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Yes.

507
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah.

508
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
And all the funny ads.

509
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,040
And we would sell it and keep, but we would get the money.

510
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,320
But we would sell it.

511
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,360
Not them and not Redbubble, not whatever.

512
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,400
Would it help if we spelled it C-R-O-O-Z?

513
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
No.

514
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,080
What if we took all the, what if we took, instead of giving the money to charity, as

515
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,760
we so, we too often do, in my opinion, we got to start funneling that a little more

516
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,280
specifically this time into a legal defense fund for Rhett and Link to protect them from

517
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,080
the lawsuits of Ted Cruz.

518
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Yeah.

519
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Ted Cruz.

520
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,520
Hey, do you guys want a question from the internet?

521
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,240
I feel like I don't have a name for this segment, but I've gotten so many different people

522
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,880
sending me replacements for Yahoo Answers when really I don't think one platform is

523
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,580
going to cover it.

524
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,240
There will never be another Yahoo Answers unless they bring Yahoo Answers back.

525
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,960
There will never be one, one size fits all solution.

526
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,080
But there's a lot of places where people can ask silly questions on the web and when you're

527
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,960
surfing it and find and see them, I think it can be fun to dive in.

528
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Yeah.

529
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Yeah.

530
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Go for it.

531
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
And I'll workshop a name.

532
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Yeah.

533
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Web questions.

534
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Websons.

535
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Websons.

536
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Yahoo Answers.

537
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,560
Some, I, we'll get there.

538
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Yeah.

539
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
New Answers.

540
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Yeah.

541
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,920
I might just say, do you want a Yahoo?

542
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,200
But it's not capitalized.

543
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
So this is-

544
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,040
Like more like this guy's a really, Yahoo, that kind of deal?

545
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah.

546
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Is that Yahoo?

547
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Some old movies.

548
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I say that.

549
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Yahoo?

550
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Yahoo?

551
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
I'm trying to protect us from Yahoo's lawyers.

552
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Okay.

553
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,600
Or somebody else, somebody's lawyers.

554
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Okay.

555
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,040
Apollo Management Group's lawyers, I think at this point.

556
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,760
Steven sent this one in and it's, it's on Quora again, but there's no long-winded scientific

557
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,960
explanation.

558
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,280
I don't know where to find who asked it because I don't know how to use this website yet.

559
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:44,760
The question is, using the five senses, how would you describe your grandmother?

560
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,680
Oh boy.

561
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:54,840
The fact that they wanted all five makes me think that this person didn't necessarily

562
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:02,920
consider the question fully before they put it on Quora or Quora.

563
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,120
I think sight would pretty much cover it.

564
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Yeah.

565
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,600
Well, now you can, what's the smell of your grandma?

566
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Everybody has that.

567
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,080
This is what I'm saying, Justin, is if I need information about your grandmother, my needs,

568
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,760
my needs, Travis's needs are met by sight.

569
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
I don't need-

570
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,920
We're so, we're all factory creatures.

571
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:31,460
Like for me, for us, mom's mom, granny, I really associate the scent of her making like

572
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:42,140
the best biscuits and gravy and bacon while smoking, just like a, I know this is going

573
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,000
to be good, but we're in a challenging environment for this meal.

574
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,140
A rich aroma.

575
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,120
There is, I will say, an aspect of going over to her house, there being a bowl of chocolates

576
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,320
on the table and eating them because I'm seven and I love chocolates, but also they do taste

577
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,080
like a cigarette butt.

578
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Cigarette chocolate.

579
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
Yeah.

580
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
Is that a taste of your grandmother?

581
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Mm.

582
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,880
I think that's as far as I want to go on what my grandmother tastes like.

583
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Yeah.

584
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
I don't think I'm going to be like, hey nonster, lean over here.

585
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Let me lick that face.

586
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Yeah.

587
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Nobody should be licking-

588
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
Let me get in there.

589
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Don't lick Nani's face.

590
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
It's 2021.

591
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
And it's like-

592
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Yeah, don't lick Nani's face.

593
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,400
I know that Fauci's like all about it now and he's like, go nuts.

594
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,920
It sucks how Fauci's like, everybody get out there and lick your grandma's.

595
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Yeah.

596
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Yeah.

597
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,400
And it's like, there's not, it's like Fauci didn't even give me a chance to like put my

598
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,600
pants back on and like they were off while I kicked it at home for a year.

599
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,480
And then he's like, all right, wake up, idiot.

600
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Go lick your grandma.

601
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,000
And it's like, did we, I guess, see, this is what was awesome about when Bath and Body

602
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,160
Works was like such a big name in the Christmas present game.

603
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Is Bath and Body Works even still, is this so-

604
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Oh no, they're huge.

605
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,000
They're expanding at the Huntington Mall.

606
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,840
They're taking over like a gigantic wing just all for them.

607
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,200
See when I think of the Nani smell, I go straight to Vanilla Bean because we would go to Bath

608
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,120
and Body Works and be like, Boop, give me all of the products that smell like this,

609
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
please.

610
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
This is my grandmother's scent.

611
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,380
And you would fucking, you would just know it.

612
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,640
You would just kind of know it.

613
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,240
Now here's the thing, you can answer about feel as like, a warm hug, that's a nice, oh,

614
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,480
I feel safe.

615
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,400
But I have this deep suspicion that this question asker would go, no, no, no, what does she

616
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,200
feel like?

617
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,880
And I'm not wild about that.

618
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,280
No, yeah, there's a lot of senses that- Oh shit.

619
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
Oh, Justin just threw up.

620
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Oh, juice, you all right, bub?

621
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Oh, fuck.

622
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
Bless you.

623
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Go without me.

624
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Oh no.

625
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Oh no, they got him.

626
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
They got him.

627
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,080
He was thinking about Nani, he sensed Nani in different ways.

628
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,560
Let's see, yeah, taste, touch.

629
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:58,440
Just in touch, let's rank the senses that you, it's acceptable to sort of observe your

630
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
grandma with.

631
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
What does your grandmother look like?

632
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,280
Why are you guys just going on with the show when I'm in this condition?

633
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Well, you muted yourself.

634
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,440
What does your grandmother look like?

635
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
What's your grandma look like?

636
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Good.

637
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
That's the easiest.

638
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
What's your grandma sound like?

639
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Like, you know.

640
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
That's easy.

641
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Yeah, I know what my grandma sounds like.

642
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
What does she- No, I didn't mean it when I said go on without

643
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
me.

644
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
You guys should be really worried, guys.

645
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,960
It went down the wrong pipe.

646
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,240
Smell is easy to describe, but difficult to ask, I would say.

647
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,800
That puts it right there in the middle.

648
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,560
Then we get into taste and touch.

649
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
You're still doing jokes.

650
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Taste is the worst.

651
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
I think brother's dying.

652
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Taste is the worst one.

653
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,480
Yeah, because touch is like shame on you for asking.

654
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,520
Like if you- Just be muted.

655
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,640
If you ask the question, no, we hear you.

656
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,680
If you ask the question, what's your grandma feel like?

657
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,440
I'm going to give you a little chin music.

658
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
That's for fucking sure.

659
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Oh my gosh.

660
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
But I can answer that.

661
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
I've held her hand.

662
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,440
I've given her hugs, right?

663
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Right.

664
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
I've tasted them.

665
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Yeah.

666
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,480
And most likely never will.

667
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Probably won't.

668
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,040
When I was 12, Nonny let me drive to Bob Evans' farm while sitting on our lap, and that was

669
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
a long haul.

670
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
That's a cool story.

671
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Huh.

672
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Any other cool Nonny stories?

673
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Yeah.

674
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:09,720
When I was at Bob Evans' farm later that day, an old man had his drink stuck in a vending

675
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,080
machine, and I got in there with my little arm and got it out, and he said, thanks, I'll

676
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,320
dance at your wedding.

677
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
And walked away.

678
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Cool.

679
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Did he?

680
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
That was dad.

681
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
It was...

682
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
No.

683
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
It was...

684
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Yeah.

685
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
No, he...

686
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
I don't...

687
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Not that I know.

688
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
He didn't get my details or anything.

689
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Yeah.

690
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Damn.

691
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Maybe he was an angel, and he did dance at your wedding.

692
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
It's possible.

693
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
That's beautiful.

694
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
On the head of a pin.

695
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Yeah.

696
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,120
Well, I think my signature scent would probably be sugar-free hazelnut coffee, mate.

697
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Huh.

698
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,920
I think I just smell like me, right?

699
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Like, just...

700
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Oh, that's Travis.

701
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
That's pure Travis.

702
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,560
That's pure uncut Travis right there.

703
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,760
You know?

704
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,900
Here's my scent.

705
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,000
Put this lotion on, you'll smell like Travis.

706
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But what's that smell?

707
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I like allure-om sport.

708
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah.

709
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Excuse me?

710
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You heard me.

711
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I didn't.

712
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Let's take a break.

713
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,520
We're going to go to the Money Zone, and there's nothing you can do about it.

714
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Okay.

715
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:17,880
Let's go!

716
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,920
Okay, Griffin, off the top of your head, could you name me between 15 and 18 different jobs

717
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,360
that might use Squarespace?

718
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Sure.

719
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Skateboard artist.

720
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Okay.

721
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
And cook.

722
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
What's two?

723
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
And firefighter.

724
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Okay.

725
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:46,120
And website maker, online retail specialist, and fighting person.

726
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Fighting.

727
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,800
Fighting, and crossing guard, freelance crossing guard, and...

728
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,880
If you want to show how well you can cross guard or guard crosses, I guess, you can set

729
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,080
up your website on Squarespace.

730
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Pharmacy one.

731
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
No, don't.

732
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
You should...

733
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Hey, listen.

734
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,400
There are many different ways that you can use Squarespace, but please do not set up

735
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,600
your own pharmacy using Squarespace.

736
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,800
We cannot advocate for that, Griffin.

737
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,280
That's a good point.

738
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Yeah.

739
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,960
If you're working at a big pharmacy chain, they probably have their own website.

740
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,360
You don't have to double up.

741
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,440
I've wanted to start my own pharmacy for a while, so I built a website.

742
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,240
It's a place you can go online to order medicine.

743
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,880
It's like, yeah, I'm a pharmacist at CVS, but their website sucks.

744
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,760
So now I've made a website called Keith's Drugs.

745
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,160
You can showcase your work, sell products and services of all kinds, well, it does say

746
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,640
of all kinds, physical or online businesses and more.

747
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,340
They've got beautiful, customizable templates created by world-class designers, everything

748
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,400
optimized for mobile right out of the box, analytics that help you grow in real time,

749
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,800
free and secure hosting, and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

750
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,400
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial, and when you're ready to launch,

753
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,560
Now, yeah, I told them, I was, I did the whole like, oh, I'm coughing so bad, you guys gotta

754
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,560
do the ads without me thinking, that's fine.

755
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, basically getting like paid not to podcast, you know what I mean?

756
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And no, they bought it.

757
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,040
Hey Justin, you actually are unneeded, and we clocked you out.

758
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,320
Actually, this is embarrassing because we're hearing it.

759
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
We're hearing it.

760
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
We clocked you out.

761
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
As soon as you needed.

762
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
No, no, no, I just tossed the headphones on the table.

763
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
I don't have them on.

764
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
No, we clocked you out.

765
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
Yeah.

766
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,120
No, I don't think they would have the guts to clock me out.

767
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
No, I'll text them.

768
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Hold on, I'll text them.

769
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Okay.

770
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Well, one of them's texted.

771
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
Hold on, let me get it.

772
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Justin.

773
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
We can hear you.

774
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Sentence.

775
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Brrrr.

776
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
That was the vibration.

777
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,160
Are you fucking, you should fucking stop it.

778
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Sorry, guys.

779
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,640
I'm real choked up over here.

780
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
Oh, like emotionally?

781
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
You need to calm down, Justin.

782
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
No, it's just way down the wrong pipe.

783
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Justin, you need to calm down.

784
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,440
That was a good segue for you to hit.

785
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,240
I'll try to calm down, but I don't know how I do it without an app or something.

786
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,560
Oh, right, right, right.

787
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,520
Listen, Justin, we're partnering with Calm.

788
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,880
It's the number one mental wellness app to give you the tools you need to improve the

789
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
way you feel.

790
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,280
Mostly, I think, mentally, right?

791
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,440
I don't know that they can stop you from fake coughing to get out of work, but you could

792
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,600
clear your head with guided daily meditations, improve your focus with Calm's curated music

793
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,640
tracks, and drift off to dreamland with Calm's imaginative sleep stories.

794
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,520
Oh my god, they're the best.

795
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,120
Sleep more, stress less, live better with Calm.

796
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,680
Hey, does this work on seven-week-old babies?

797
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Sure.

798
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
Because it's so...

799
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Gotta get down there.

800
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
It's unreal.

801
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,920
Imagine they have all these really boring sleep stories, like where they just talk to

802
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,600
you about a train trip.

803
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
You know what I mean?

804
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Not boring.

805
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,160
Like, just chillin' uneventful, right, as you're supposed to put you to sleep.

806
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,800
Imagine Cillian Murphy telling you about crossing Ireland by train to help wisp you

807
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
off to sleep.

808
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Wait, they got that?

809
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Harry Styles?

810
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Yeah, he'll talk you to go to...

811
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,480
It's called Dream With Me for 40 minutes.

812
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
You and Harold...

813
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
Harry Styles.

814
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
You and Harold Styles.

815
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Harold...

816
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Dr. Harold Styles.

817
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Do you enjoy watermelons?

818
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
He does.

819
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
I!

820
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
You know they got Idris.

821
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
They got everybody.

822
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Everybody.

823
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
It's fantastic.

824
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
How do we hear it, Justin?

825
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,480
What do we do?

826
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,360
Well, you go to calm.com.

827
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,160
That's C-A-L-M.com slash my brother.

828
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Although I'd argue if you don't know how to spell calm, maybe you shouldn't try to relax

829
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
right now.

830
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,200
Maybe you should get more focused in your life.

831
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,340
Calm.com slash my brother for 40% off unlimited access to Calm's entire library.

There's a limited time promotion of a 40% off a calm premium subscription at calm.com

834
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,520
slash my brother.

835
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,800
Somewhere between science and superstition, there is a podcast.

836
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.

837
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,020
She says she's the devil himself.

838
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,400
That thing is not my daughter and I want you to tell me there's a show where the hosts

839
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:21,000
don't just report on French science and spirituality, but take part themselves.

840
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,560
Well there is, and it's Oh No Ross and Carrie on Maximum Fun.

841
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,320
This year we actually became certified exorcists.

842
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,880
So yes, Carrie and I can help your daughter.

843
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,840
Or we can just talk about it on the show.

844
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:42,360
Oh No Ross and Carrie on MaximumFun.org.

845
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,840
I really want to tackle the next question, boys.

846
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:52,240
I think it's, it's not something we normally do, but I think we could help.

847
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,080
How do I sleep over at Buffalo Wild Wings?

848
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,600
Yeah, this is fun.

849
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,240
That's a fun question.

850
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,920
In the museum sleepover setting, which is the traditional, hey, what are you doing here?

851
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Sleepover setting.

852
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,200
You just go, you go and you know, pull a Franklin Wilder in the fucking bathroom and just like

853
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,320
chill up in a stall and like kick it there and just like wait.

854
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
But Buffalo Wild Wings is a little bit smaller.

855
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,880
It's easier to put eyes on all of its dark corners and crevices.

856
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,660
You know they have somebody who sweeps it like, and not with a broom, but like sweeps

857
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,480
it like looking for you, looking for, for wing squatters.

858
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,600
Yeah and people are taking chicken naps.

859
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,920
So bathroom's not going to cut it.

860
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,060
First of all, I've never actually been lucky enough to get into a bathroom stall at a Buffalo

861
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,720
Wild Wings.

862
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,000
So bodacious are the queues to access that.

863
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,520
They're booked wings out, it's out of sight.

864
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,800
It's out of sight.

865
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,480
So you gotta be a little more creative than that.

866
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,040
It's interesting Griffin that you went that way.

867
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,840
Because when I first read this question, my thought was, you know, people always talk

868
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,160
about where they want to have their birthday party and it's like a Chuck E. Cheese, right,

869
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
or something.

870
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,840
But like maybe I want to have a lock-in sleepover experience at a Buffalo Wild Wings.

871
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,480
Is that a service that they offer?

872
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,640
Well let's, I don't want to squash this dream before we get into like actual tactics and

873
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,740
strats for how to sleep over at a Buffalo Wild Wings, but I do want to say that there

874
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,440
probably won't be anybody working while you're at the Buffalo Wild Wings.

875
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,180
So like if you're thinking like you're gonna have like a huge like wing chomping like festival

876
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:44,920
for yourself, then that, unless you cook them yourself, which you don't know where they

877
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,160
keep the good sauces.

878
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,360
What about the wings that they made that nobody ate during the day?

879
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,440
Those are probably just sitting out, right?

880
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,960
You could probably just eat those.

881
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,000
The gently used wings, what do you do with those?

882
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,840
That can be a fun sleepover activity is to pick through those.

883
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,440
You can make bone art.

884
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,760
There's a lot of stuff you can use.

885
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,600
There's a lot of stuff you could do at a BW3 sleepover, actually, now that I think

886
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
about it.

887
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Bone armor, bone weapons.

888
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
You can do bone art, bone weapons.

889
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
You can hunt for the wek.

890
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Where's the wek?

891
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Yeah.

892
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Where's the wek?

893
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
In the wek.

894
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,000
You could play trivia by yourself.

895
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, sure.

896
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Do they still do the trivia?

897
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I can't imagine they still do the trivia.

898
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,480
Do you think they still do the trivia?

899
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
They have to.

900
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
They have to.

901
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Right?

902
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Probably on their phones and not-

903
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,240
It's probably on your phones now, right?

904
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Yeah.

905
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Hey, kids.

906
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
Hey, kids.

907
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Come around.

908
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Hey, kids.

909
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,160
You'll never believe this, but for a while, if you went to BW3s or Damon's or several

910
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:47,000
other places, you could ask a person for a device that they would give you to play trivia

911
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
on.

912
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It was like a big chunky keyboard.

913
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It was a speaking spell.

914
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
A big chunky keyboard.

915
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,120
Essentially, that you would punch in things and the TV would be like, you're not smart.

916
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,480
You're a loser.

917
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,160
Look at this person in last place who put their real name, Griffin McElroy, at table

918
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
14.

919
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Idiot.

920
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,960
I would argue, though, that in our dad's 65 years, it was the only time he was ever

921
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
truly happy.

922
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Yeah, that's true.

923
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,400
Sometimes you'd see dad come in fourth in the nation, and it was so inspirational.

924
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,080
We would often have three at the table, because nobody else would fucking do it, but dad would

925
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,960
be so laser focused.

926
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,440
He might as well have not been there.

927
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,680
Those are the times when I missed my daddy the most.

928
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
This is gonna be fun.

929
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Shit, boys.

930
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,520
I was all ready to stomp all over this one, but I think a sleepover at Buffalo Wild Wings

931
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,720
would be one hell of a night.

932
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,160
Some of them have arcade machines, too, so that would be fun.

933
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
Yes.

934
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Some golden tea.

935
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
Fuckin' forget about it.

936
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Oh, dude.

937
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
I love that.

938
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,080
The basketball ones, where it's kind of a game, but also reminds you that you're bad

939
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
at sports.

940
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Yes, okay.

941
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
We gotta do this.

942
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,200
How are we having our Buffalo Wild Wings sleepover?

943
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,680
So you spent your entire time deciding that you do want to do this.

944
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
I do want to do this.

945
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,240
It sounds fucking fun.

946
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Yeah.

947
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Okay, what about this?

948
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,760
You need to get yourself, and this cannot be hard to find, get yourself a Buffalo Wild

949
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,200
Wings uniform, and then be there maybe an hour or two before closing, and you're gonna

950
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,680
start cleaning some things, right?

951
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
Okay.

952
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,560
And then just one by one, as people clock out, you just keep saying, oh, no, I'll lock

953
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
up.

954
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Yeah.

955
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
I'll close down.

956
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Yeah.

957
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Oh, okay.

958
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
I like this.

959
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,560
Until you're the last person there.

960
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
And then you just stay, baby.

961
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,600
Well, it would have to be a pretty huge Buffalo Wild Wings for somebody to not go, hey, I've

962
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,080
never seen you before.

963
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
You do not work here.

964
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
There are six people here.

965
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,880
You think every Buffalo Wild Wings in put, I'm new.

966
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
Boom.

967
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
I'm wet.

968
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
I'm wet.

969
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
I'm wet.

970
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
I used to be here, but then I left.

971
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I don't, I don't, I don't know about this strategy, but let me hit you with this.

972
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,400
Get seduced by the owner of a Buffalo Wild Wings franchise.

973
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
And it-

974
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Wait, not seduce them.

975
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
No, no, no, no.

976
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Okay.

977
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,400
It's gotta be there, because you know that they are looking out left, right, and center

978
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,600
for people to seduce them to try and have a sleepover.

979
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
A Buffalo Wild Wings.

980
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
Okay.

981
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Yes.

982
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I'm sorry.

983
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
What was I thinking?

984
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,120
If you create a real honeypot, and you allow yourself to be seduced-

985
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Oh, man.

986
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,080
If you haven't tried the honeypot sauce, by the way-

987
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
It's the best.

988
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Allow you-

989
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,600
It's honey and CBD, which is really nice.

990
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,320
Which is really wild.

991
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,000
It's like, if you were the franchise owner of a Buffalo Wild Wings, you know that you're

992
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,080
gonna be using that sexually to your advantage, as much as you possibly can.

993
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
And this is-

994
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
With the power to be able to-

995
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
The power.

996
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Look, I have the keys.

997
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,440
Yeah, I have the keys to the Buffalo Wild Wings.

998
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,160
Do you wanna go make love in there?

999
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,920
And then you could say yes, and then, you know-

1000
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,120
I could show you the weck.

1001
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,520
I could show you where we keep the secret weck.

1002
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
This is a-

1003
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,240
And then, you know, maybe you do fall in love, but it's probably just for the sleepover at

1004
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
Buffalo Wild Wings.

1005
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,760
But the one thing you never plan on when you're planning on a sleepover at Buffalo Wild Wings

1006
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
is to fall in love.

1007
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Is you fall in love.

1008
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
Yeah.

1009
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
Yeah.

1010
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Damn it.

1011
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
It's too risky.

1012
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Don't do mine.

1013
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Okay.

1014
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Hey, don't do mine, guys.

1015
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Okay.

1016
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
You're gonna need a mascot costume.

1017
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
All right.

1018
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,600
And then you're gonna need a friend, you walk in wearing the mascot costume.

1019
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,560
You're a new mascot for Buffalo Wild Wings.

1020
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
What's that?

1021
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,000
You have a letter from corporate that explains everything, right?

1022
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,440
Now you're gonna need a compatriot.

1023
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,660
Your compatriot is gonna come in, they're gonna eat a regular meal.

1024
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,460
But then at some point, you're gonna switch the costume to them.

1025
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,800
Now they're gonna leave, right?

1026
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,720
So they'll see the costume leave.

1027
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,960
But what's that?

1028
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,240
You're still there.

1029
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
Okay.

1030
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
Whoa.

1031
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
Yeah.

1032
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Where?

1033
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
In the walk-in freezer.

1034
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,200
And then underneath the mascot costume, you were wearing like a thick starter jacket.

1035
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Oh.

1036
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,440
They never saw it coming.

1037
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
You're very warm.

1038
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
That's good.

1039
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
What's the team on the starter jacket?

1040
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,040
It's the Green Bay Packers.

1041
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,640
So then you're going to release yourself from the lock-in.

1042
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,360
Now, this is important.

1043
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,360
You need to make sure before you close the lock-in door that there is a way to release

1044
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
yourself from the lock-in.

1045
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,160
You've gotta put some tape over the thing or like-

1046
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Something.

1047
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Something.

1048
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
Something.

1049
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,400
That's the one part of the plan where you could die from it.

1050
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Yeah.

1051
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
This is the-

1052
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Listen.

1053
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
This is so important.

1054
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Stuff some tissue paper in there.

1055
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Something.

1056
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,400
Because listen.

1057
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
If you want to-

1058
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,960
If you really want to sleep over at Buffalo Wild Wings, you have to accept the fact that

1059
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,000
you might die in the process.

1060
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah.

1061
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
There's a risk.

1062
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
There's a risk.

1063
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,440
But you've got to risk it for the basic sometimes.

1064
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
If you want to sleep-

1065
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Listen.

1066
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,720
Now, I will say that in extreme cases, if you do get locked in that lock-in, you can

1067
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,200
start consuming the frozen blazin' sauce.

1068
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Yeah.

1069
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,560
It will buy you some time.

1070
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,120
It'll get a stopgap measure at best, though.

1071
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Yes.

1072
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,200
Now, you can also usually find some celery in there, which is cool.

1073
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
Okay.

1074
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Yeah.

1075
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,200
Now you're gonna have to free yourself, right?

1076
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,720
Now you're gonna need to avoid the cameras.

1077
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
Oh, did I mention?

1078
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Oh, shit.

1079
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
Those cameras.

1080
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,720
Yeah.

1081
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,720
But this can be accomplished by dressing like a ghost underneath your starter jacket.

1082
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,720
That's right.

1083
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,040
Take your starter jacket off, and you're the ghost of the guy who died doing the Blazin'

1084
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,480
Hot Wings challenge.

1085
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,640
He's there anyways.

1086
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,200
It won't be suspicious.

1087
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Okay.

1088
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,360
Now, time to play that basketball game, my friend.

1089
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
Enjoy.

1090
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,360
Enjoy.

1091
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,440
The hard part's over.

1092
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,200
Now in the morning, you will be going to prison.

1093
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
You'll go to jail.

1094
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
Yeah.

1095
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
But it's worth it.

1096
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,440
But then you take off the ghost costume, you're wearing a shirt that said, I didn't steal

1097
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,440
anything.

1098
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Uh-huh.

1099
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440
I don't plan to steal anything.

1100
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
I'm not a burglar.

1101
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,200
I don't plan to burgle this place.

1102
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,760
I'm just having fun.

1103
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,880
And it says that on your shirt.

1104
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,440
And so when they see the security camera footage, they're like, who is this burglar?

1105
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,760
And then they're like, no, read his shirt.

1106
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
And you're like, read the shirt.

1107
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
Read the shirt.

1108
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
It's right off the perfect crime.

1109
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,820
And then they're like, oh, it's just a harmless little adventurer who's going to have a great

1110
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,320
story coming out of tonight.

1111
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
I'm proud of him.

1112
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
I love him.

1113
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I would marry that adventurer.

1114
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
I would marry that person.

1115
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,280
A lot of these scenarios are going to end up with you finding the love of your life.

1116
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
Yep.

1117
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,160
But that's Buffalo Wild Wings.

1118
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,640
That's Buffalo Wild Wings, baby.

1119
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:10,280
To back up, it used to be called BW3, and the third W was for Wek.

1120
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,440
It was Wings Wild and Wek.

1121
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,600
And I think Wek was maybe a kind of bread or like an Irish thing.

1122
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,000
I don't know exactly.

1123
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,120
But that's why we kept saying Wek earlier.

1124
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,900
Was that not clear?

1125
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,080
This has been, you're listening to this with director's commentary turned on.

1126
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,520
You can turn me off at any point.

1127
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,400
We should do that more.

1128
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,440
Hey, you know that joke we've been making for the last 20, that's a reference from a

1129
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,680
TV show that only the three of us watched and had two episodes.

1130
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,200
And that's why it was only funny to us and no one else ever.

1131
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,440
Should we do another question?

1132
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,040
Yeah, I think so.

1133
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,640
I was going to do, there's like news in the chicken sandwich wars, but I don't really

1134
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,040
feel like, I feel like things have been so stressful that like more conflict is not really

1135
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,040
what we need right now.

1136
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Okay.

1137
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:04,720
But just so you do know, Pringles is making Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich flavored chips.

1138
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,720
Yeah, good.

1139
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Huh.

1140
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,720
Crisps.

1141
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
That's it.

1142
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,720
That's all we need sometimes is just that.

1143
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,720
Yeah.

1144
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,720
All right.

1145
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
You should just know that, that that's going to happen.

1146
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,720
Cool.

1147
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,720
And it's out there.

1148
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
Awesome.

1149
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,040
And also Taco Bell said that it refuses to join the chicken sandwich wars.

1150
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,840
Well, damn it Juice, I do actually need more details on that.

1151
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,560
Bun, mayo, chicken, pickle, bun.

1152
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,560
Not familiar.

1153
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
Yeah.

1154
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,560
Yeah.

1155
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,560
Yeah.

1156
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,560
Sorry.

1157
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,560
Yes.

1158
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,560
Maybe not this because, well, I mean, you know what?

1159
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,480
Actually I could tell you the story, but let me just play this brief documentary.

1160
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:46,800
The great chicken war, the battles began where most tragedies do with a bun in 2019, a brioche

1161
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,920
bun carrying pickles, mayo and chicken became an agent of disruption and desire, the chaos

1162
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,920
immediate and the copycats inevitable.

1163
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,160
Time sandwich syndrome sprang up everywhere.

1164
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,520
People were forced to endure hours long waits for a taste.

1165
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,080
Journalists had to find new ways to describe this blah, blah, bun banality.

1166
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:17,240
The victims were many, but in chaos, a single meal dare to do the undoable, get naked.

1167
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:24,200
And so it was, but Taco Bell's naked chicken chalupa returned to menus nationwide, unburdened

1168
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,640
by bonds, the fried chicken shell carried something greater than the sum of its ingredients.

1169
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
Imagination.

1170
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
Did it end the wars?

1171
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,200
No, of course not, but it did offer something better, a chalupa.

1172
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,200
So-

1173
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Fuck, that's a good commercial.

1174
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:48,240
No, it's not because you can't say we're better than the chicken wars.

1175
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,280
So we've got our own little chicken war going on over here where we're the only combatants

1176
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,080
and we win.

1177
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,600
That's bullshit.

1178
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,280
It would be like if you saw two people shooting at each other and then you taped a gun to

1179
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,520
your head and you're like, I'm not in the war.

1180
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,760
I'm in a different war that I'm the only combatant in and I win gunhead war.

1181
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
So-

1182
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,620
I'm just saying that listen to them, like, listen, Justin, you can't tell me that there

1183
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:21,720
is a strong, strong thread of truth to the listening to journalists talk about the blah,

1184
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,400
blah, blah, chicken sandwiches.

1185
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,640
I mean, I'm part of the problem aren't I, Trav?

1186
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,120
I mean, I'm part of the machine, so it's hard for me to have that kind of distance.

1187
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,880
I will say this is a great quote from Liz Matthews, Taco Bell's chief food innovation

1188
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
officer.

1189
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,600
When you look at the industry, you see the same sandwich being introduced as new everywhere.

1190
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,440
But at Taco Bell, being a follower isn't our philosophy.

1191
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,400
We've listened to our fans and we're confident this is the perfect time to bring back this

1192
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,400
fan favorite.

1193
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,480
You listened to your fans, you followed your fans.

1194
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,280
So Liz, you followed your fans and also followed yourself, the chalupa you did again.

1195
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,560
And also, you fucking didn't invent the taco.

1196
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,200
You can't say that.

1197
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
You didn't-

1198
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
And it's-

1199
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,840
This is probably not the best time to remind you it's not a chalupa, but I guess I'll

1200
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,880
go ahead and do that too.

1201
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,880
It's- you're in the chicken sandwich wars.

1202
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,940
Like I don't know how- if you can't do a commercial about the chicken sandwich wars that ends

1203
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:20,920
with you revealing your chicken product, like that- that is also unacceptable.

1204
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,320
You're in the shit now, Taco Bell, congratulations.

1205
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
You could have just as easily-

1206
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,320
Yeah, you're in the war.

1207
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,360
You could have just as easily not- like you didn't have to do a commercial saying, fuck

1208
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,640
the chicken sandwich wars.

1209
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,440
Or it could have ended with you revealing that you'll now be selling like reasonably

1210
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,840
priced but durable work boots, you know?

1211
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,280
If they had made a commercial that didn't end with them announcing a product and had

1212
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:48,260
just been, these fucking losers keep talking about their identical chicken sandwiches.

1213
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,260
Fuck that.

1214
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,260
Come get some Taco Bell, baby.

1215
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,900
We're gonna Doritos blast some shit and you know you're gonna be here for it.

1216
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,900
You're fucked up.

1217
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,900
I'm fucked up.

1218
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,900
Like let's party.

1219
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,900
Ignore all these fucking squares.

1220
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,820
They don't know what they're doing.

1221
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,440
But we don't have anything new for you today.

1222
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,040
We just are so fucking tired of it and we know you are too.

1223
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,520
Fucking Popeyes, fucking- just do whatever you want.

1224
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,160
Like go eat a chicken sandwich but like just chill for like a minute.

1225
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,520
Even talking about the chicken sandwich wars gives more credence to the idea that this

1226
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
exists.

1227
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,720
That this is- because it is like a wild phenomena of like everyone just decided there was a

1228
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,200
war and then we all said there was a war and then the war happened.

1229
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,760
That's how it really works.

1230
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,280
Now I want to talk about the chicken guars.

1231
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,000
It's where the banquoir primarily writes songs about chicken.

1232
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,720
Hey that's- let's call it a show.

1233
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,880
I think this is a show and we really appreciate you listening to it.

1234
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,200
We hope you're having a good day.

1235
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Huh.

1236
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,200
We don't say that enough.

1237
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
Yeah we don't.

1238
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,200
I hope that you've done something nice for yourself and someone else today.

1239
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,680
Yeah thanks.

1240
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
I appreciate you.

1241
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
Thanks.

1242
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,680
Hey thank you.

1243
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,680
Hey.

1244
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,680
Thank you Justin.

1245
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,160
I like the way you read the questions.

1246
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
Thanks Trav.

1247
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,600
I like the way that you responded to them and did some of your own jokes and the whole

1248
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
thing.

1249
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,600
I want to say-

1250
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,600
Hey Griffin you did a good job too.

1251
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,720
I thought Justin would pass it on to you.

1252
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,720
Yeah.

1253
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,480
And he kind of then just passed it back to me.

1254
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,480
It's okay I don't need it.

1255
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
I don't need it.

1256
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,320
I want to say that Montaigne will always be my Eurovision 2021 winner.

1257
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Yeah.

1258
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,240
End of sentence.

1259
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,680
That's who I say won Eurovision 2021.

1260
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
End of sentence.

1261
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,000
Won our hearts for sure.

1262
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And the competition.

1263
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And the competition.

1264
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And the competition.

1265
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah.

1266
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,040
And thank you to Montaigne for the theme song to our program.

1267
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,640
My life is better with you.

1268
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,520
I know a lot of people want the full version of that.

1269
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,520
It's good.

1270
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,520
I've heard it.

1271
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,080
And it should be out like, we're not in the music releasing business folks.

1272
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,080
You know?

1273
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
We're barely in the podcast releasing business.

1274
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,080
It'll be out later.

1275
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,080
Yeah.

1276
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,080
It's not in our control.

1277
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,080
They're-

1278
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Montaigne rules.

1279
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,800
No it is in our control.

1280
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
McRoyMerch.com.

1281
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,820
Go over there and check out our pin of the month.

1282
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
It's a tub pumpkin.

1283
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,120
It's really great.

1284
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,240
It benefits the Equal Justice Initiative, which is committed to ending mass incarceration

1285
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,560
and excessive punishment in the United States to challenging racial and economic injustice

1286
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,320
and to protecting basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society.

1287
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,840
You can also check out, we got an Adventure Zone logo decal there and a new Appalachian

1288
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:26,640
workshop sticker with a portion of those proceeds going to Habitat for Humanity of the Tri-State.

1289
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:32,240
I do some Twitch streaming over at twitch.tv slash TheTravisMcRoy.

1290
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
Speaking of, you can go check out our YouTube channel.

1291
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,400
We got Taste of Luxury over there.

1292

We got Monster Factory.

1293
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,440
We got some video game streams we did.

1294
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,200
We got some stuff that we put up during the Max Fun Drive that you can watch.

1295
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,500
All kinds of great stuff over there.

1296
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,920
You can also pre-order Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom, the next graphic novel in the series

1299
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,320
Miss your chance to pre-order it and get that pre-order gift from our publisher for a second.

We're doing some fun world-building stuff, and I think you're going to really enjoy it.

1305
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
Yeah.

1306
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,160
Do you want Final Yahoo?

1307
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,160
Yes.

1308
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,800
Yeah, this one was sent in by Chester.

1309
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,800
Okay.

1310
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,840
Thanks, Chester.

1311
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:44,600
It's Yahoo Answers user, Bam, who asks, how many of you do not know when—

1312
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,400
I'm sorry, what?

1313
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Say it!

1314
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
Where did—hello?

1315
00:54:50,400 --> 00:55:10,520
I fell—I fell off my bike and my nuts hit a car?

1316
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:18,280
Should they go to—should they go to jail?

1317
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,740
Can they let them go?

1318
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:28,880
Is there someone that borrowed your bike or anything?

1319
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,320
I'm sure there's someone else there.

1320
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,280
No one left.

1321
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,000
What?

1322
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
43才?

1323
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,800
In five now.

1324
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,800
Is better with you

1325
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,800
My life, ah it's better,

1326
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,800
it's better with you

1327
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,800
It's better with you

1328
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,800
My life, ah it's better,

1329
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,800
it's better with you

1330
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,800
This is true, ah it's better

1331
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
it's better with you

1332
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:15,800
My life, ah

1333
