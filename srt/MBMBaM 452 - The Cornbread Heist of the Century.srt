1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:46,240
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,000
me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Hey, this is your baby brother, Griffin McElroy, 30 under 30.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,400
Oh man, I hope I make the cut. I'm really worried about downsizing here at My Brother,

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,360
My Brother, Me, and I'm really afraid that when it comes down to it, if we don't hit our goals,

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
if we don't make budget this year, I think the middle-est is the first to go, because

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,200
what do I even do?

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
Well, we're going more peer-to-peer, and the peers are me and Justin,

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
and so we don't need an intermediary.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm literally the middle man.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
Yeah, you know how on the show I'll do a joke, and then you'll say it,

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,120
and then Justin will laugh at it, and then sometimes it goes the other way?

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,680
I know.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I've been thinking maybe instead of the three of us being on

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,160
two two-way calls with you, Travis, me and Justin could just fucking call each other.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,680
Whoa, but hey, if you do that, then what would I do?

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,880
So anyway, this little skit is something that we came up with at Bible Study,

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,120
and we wanted to do it on you so that you would know the real-life stakes of the Max Fun Drive

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
2019 week two edition.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,680
That's right.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
If we don't hit 25,000 new and upgrading donors, I'm out.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,480
I'm out on the street.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,160
I am really excited to welcome a new edition to the soundboard.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,040
Yeah, as you know, the soundboard, as it stands now, here's a quick update.

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,000
It's got this music.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,880
Is that a good volume for you?

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,120
I mean, no volume's a good volume on the soundboard.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,920
Okay, but here's the new one.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,720
Are you ready?

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,600
And this is to remind people, every time you hear this, I want to create a Pavlovian response

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,240
that every time you hear this sound, it makes you go to Maximumfun.org forward slash donate

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,240
and increase your support of the Maximum Fun Network, specifically the shows that we make.

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,720
Here it comes.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
Every time?

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,640
Every single time.

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,140
You ready?

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,480
I think, Travis, once you hear this new soundboard edition,

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,720
I feel like you are going to retract your incredulity.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
Is this the sound?

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,640
Was that it?

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
No, that wasn't it.

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,760
Here it comes.

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,880
Ready?

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,600
Get that money.

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
One more time?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
One more time?

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
One more time, I guess.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,720
One more, wait, what?

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,880
Yeah, give me some volume, give me some gain on that.

55
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,680
Okay, here it comes.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
Get that money.

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,360
One more time?

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,240
Just one more time?

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,360
Get that money.

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
Now, Justin, could you, and I'm horrified to ask this, use it in a sentence?

61
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,100
Sure.

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,400
Travis will be forced to leave that show if we don't.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
Get that money.

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,520
Okay.

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,760
So who did you get to do the word money?

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
I actually got Brad, I got Brad Garrett.

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,280
Wow.

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,760
Yeah.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
Can you make him say something else?

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,940
Sure.

71
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,560
Do that now?

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,280
Do that right now?

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,680
Now?

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,240
Now, please.

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,880
He can't, he's, no, listen, I can't afford to-

76
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,680
Toronto!

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,040
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,680
I can't afford-

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,880
Is that Brad Garrett?

80
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,280
What?

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
Is that Brad Garrett decided to be at Toronto doing an impression of Kiss?

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,320
Yes.

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,760
Paul Stanley?

84
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,800
Can you, can we do a stretch goal where if we hit 30,000 new and upgrading donors for

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,120
the maximum fund drive, I want to get four big men to stand on the sound board with all

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
of their weight and see what happens after that.

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,720
I cannot state my disdain for this new feature loudly or enthusiastically.

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
It would probably sound, it would probably sound a little something like this.

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,080
Oh, God, no, oh, God, no.

90
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,680
Oh, Jesus Christ.

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
There's something like this.

92
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,880
Well, goodbye, everybody.

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,760
Anyway, maximumfund.org forward slash donate is the address.

94
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,840
We are trying to get 25,000 new and upgrading donors.

95
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,840
Your support of the maximum fund network, around 75% of that goes directly to the shows

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,920
that you say you listen to when you fill out the brief survey upon donating.

97
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,000
The rest goes to help fund the great work at maximum fund.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,240
That includes doing this drive and the pledge gifts, which include at our $5 donor per month

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,840
level, you get over 225 hours of bonus content.

100
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,200
Did you run the math on that?

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,840
It's like the best value in entertainment, I think, which includes us doing all manner

102
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,480
of garbage.

103
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,400
I mean, just like videos and weird stuff, other weird recordings.

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,120
This year, our wives once again recorded an episode of my Slim Slam, my sister-in-law,

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,840
my sister-in-law and me.

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,120
There's a new episode commentary featuring us and JD Amato for episode three, I think,

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
of the Brother, My Brother, Me TV show.

108
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
The famous Travis does a hit episode.

109
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah, if you want to hear all the dirty secrets behind that.

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,840
Also, I did a toilet crime behind the scenes that episode that JD fully puts me on blast

111
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,160
about.

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,560
Oh, yeah.

113
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
At the $10 a month level, you're going to get all that content, plus you're going to

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,200
get to choose one of several fantastic pins.

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,960
$20 a month, you get the pins, you get the bonus content, and you get a beautiful puzzle

116
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
featuring the view outside the max fund offices.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
It is not about the gifts.

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,200
Those are nice.

119
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,520
It's about supporting content that you feel should be in the world.

120
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,880
What do you want to see more of?

121
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,160
Do you want to see more nasty superheroes battling it out?

122
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,080
More of those raunchy, just sweaty.

123
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,000
I see Shazam and his penis everywhere and the lightning bolt obviously pointing right

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,640
down to his region.

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,320
Oh, my God, Griffin.

126
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,600
You have transitioned directly into, I think, a perfect opening for this week's episode

127
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,120
of Brother, Brother, Brother, Me.

128
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,480
It's a Shazam watch.

129
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,560
Shazam watch.

130
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Shazam the movie is coming in April 5th.

131
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Now, it looks like there might be some sneak preview showings in the Huntington area looking

132
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,720
at some early reconnaissance that I have here.

133
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,600
I've already seen it, and let me tell you my favorite part of the movie is that every

134
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
so often someone will be walking around with Shazam and a song will start playing on the

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,200
radio overhead, and people will look at him and say, what's that song?

136
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,120
And he has an encyclopedic knowledge of what the song is, and Shazam.

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,480
Oh, man, Trav.

138
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,840
You got to know that's a stinker.

139
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
And this is the episode where he asks people for cash.

140
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
Oh, I get it because it's like the app.

141
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Oh, boysy, Trav.

142
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
And you're pot committed to the stinky joke at this point.

143
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,440
No, because it's a real thing that happens in the movie.

144
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,200
I know, but it's Zachary Levi is a boy who gets bigified into a superhero, and there's

145
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,200
a lot to play with there, but you made an app pun like a teen dad.

146
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
I sure did.

147
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,760
Can we talk about the muscles?

148
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,800
The muscles on the Zachary Levi costume of Shazam.

149
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,400
Shazam is a story about a beautiful boy who's learning all about being a teen, and he transforms

150
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,560
into Chuck sometimes with the power of lightning that he has harnessed.

151
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, when he eats a spicy food.

152
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,880
When he eats a spicy food, he transforms into Chuck from the show Chuck, and he just gets

153
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,080
crazy on it, and he is having so many fun adventures.

154
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,320
And what I could tell from the previews, he also brings, even though he is now a superhero

155
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,920
boy with invincibility and strength or whatever, brings a normal human boy with him into dangerous

156
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,200
situations.

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,480
Yes, as near as I can tell, he's bringing another young boy who's just learning about

158
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
his teenage body.

159
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,960
What do I have to eat to get a big adult body?

160
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,440
Well, come with me to danger, I guess, where there's guns and stuff.

161
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,640
Whoa, will your superpowers make me also invincible?

162
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,080
I don't know.

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
Maybe we'll find out.

164
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:34,800
But whenever a criminal threatens Shazam, he uses his big adult Chuck body to kill them

165
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,880
with his strength, and I love that.

166
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,000
That's probably my favorite thing.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
It takes a dark turn.

168
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Never really deal with that, but Iron Man has killed a lot of people with his rockets

169
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
and lasers.

170
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, but he was an adult.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,960
He was a jaded adult.

172
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,920
That's fair, fair, fair.

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,960
Can Shazam vote?

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,640
Huh.

175
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,280
I hope there's a scene about that in the movie, where he uses his greatest superpower, the

176
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,240
ability to vote.

177
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,760
There is a protracted scene where Shazam dies.

178
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,400
Wait, how long?

179
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
It's about 14 minutes long.

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,520
He dies of an undiagnosed liver infection, and it is extremely sad.

181
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,080
It's right in the middle of a fight, and he just dies.

182
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
My one weakness, my organs.

183
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,840
At the end, his torso explodes open, and the boy climbs out, and it's very much Attack

184
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,440
on Titan, which you didn't expect, except instead of a big scary Titan, it is Zachary

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
Levi's huge adult body.

186
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,300
Yeah.

187
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,200
I love it.

188
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
A big scary Levi.

189
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,520
I love it.

190
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,760
It takes him a long time to get through the suit, because it's made of super stuff.

191
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,800
I have a question.

192
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,680
When's Shazam 2 coming out?

193
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
Yeah, sure.

194
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,520
That's what's on my plate right now, is I feel like I've already absorbed every part

195
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,840
of this, and I would love to know, when is Shazam 2 due?

196
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
When's it coming?

197
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
In two months.

198
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,560
It's out in June.

199
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
They're doing another one.

200
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Six a year.

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
That's what he signed up for.

202
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,560
So, the second one is just called Shazam 2, colon, pubes, and this one's mostly about

203
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,840
the pubic experience.

204
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
There is, okay, thank you, Griffin, for reminding me.

205
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,560
There is a 13-minute scene earlier in the film.

206
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,800
Just before the liver cancer, before the undiagnosed liver infection claimed Shazam.

207
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,040
There is an earlier scene where he marvels in his thick forest of pubic hair for roughly

208
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,840
13 minutes, just lifting up his golden- Off camera, off camera.

209
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,360
Don't worry, it's very tasteful.

210
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,880
You just watch his beautiful boyfriend, his friend boy, the young boy who brings into

211
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
danger with him, sits in an adjacent room and continues to turn up the television louder

212
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,280
and louder to try to cover the sound of his friend marveling.

213
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,160
Whoa, look at it.

214
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
Now I see why people call it a bush.

215
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
I bet it's invincible, he yells.

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It looks like the prickly mulberry bush outside of my mom's house because mom and dad are

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,680
divorced and I can't put them back together with my superpowers.

218
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,840
But whoa, these pubes though.

219
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
No, don't turn up, Maury Povich, listen to me.

220
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
It's a good flick, got a lot of heart.

221
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
April 5th, get there.

222
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,840
It's probably doing good on Rotten Tomatoes, I haven't looked.

223
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,320
Mark Strong's in it, he's a talent.

224
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I do enjoy Mark Strong.

225
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,920
Mark Strong's a huge talent.

226
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,560
Can we do it?

227
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, first question.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, when is Shazam 2 coming out?

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,800
All right, I already told you.

230
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,080
That was the first one.

231
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,320
My girlfriend and I went out for brunch at a diner near her home to find it was much

232
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
busier than usual.

233
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,280
We were able to get a table and enjoy our meal with only slight delays, but it appears

234
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,760
we've been forgotten and our check isn't coming.

235
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,920
We've been served by a rotating cast, so we're not sure who to even ask.

236
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
And all the servers are moving at lightning speeds with arms full of plates, so interrupting

237
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,040
them seems like a bad idea.

238
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
What is our next move?

239
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Do we dine and dash from a place we really like, would like to return to?

240
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
Do we live in this diner now?

241
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,200
That's from Munch Money Misgivings in Minneapolis.

242
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,720
This is, you know that dine and dash is not an option, right?

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,920
It's 2019 and it's not 2015.

244
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
And so that's not an option anymore.

245
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,800
No, because the government, the GPS will, there's dine and dash and then get followed

246
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
by satellites.

247
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
That's the actual thing.

248
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,040
In the meatloaf.

249
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,680
Yes, there's nanotech in all foods.

250
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,280
So that's Justin's brand now.

251
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,000
You know not to dine and dash.

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,040
I don't know what to tell you on this.

253
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,520
These people are doing their jobs and you got to just assert yourself and squeaky wheel

254
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,080
it and go get your own fucking check.

255
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Just punch it into the machine.

256
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,320
It's easy.

257
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
What table are you seated at?

258
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Look, count the number of tables around the room.

259
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,840
Whatever number you land on when you stop is yours.

260
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,760
And you go up and you tap that number.

261
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
Now what's the dollar sign say?

262
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,180
15?

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,440
That's good.

264
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,640
That's how much you do it for.

265
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,280
And if it's not yours, then you just paid it forward.

266
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
And it also kind of sounds like they're super busy.

267
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,960
Maybe once you're done ringing and you're in check, maybe grab a tray and maybe bus

268
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,840
a table or two.

269
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
Get your fucking hands dirty.

270
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,160
By which I mean, dunk them in the soup and start just giving it to people.

271
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Yeah.

272
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,120
What's that?

273
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,760
Order up.

274
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
Here's a handful of soup.

275
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,360
Oh, thank you.

276
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,120
I've been waiting for 10 minutes for my soup.

277
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,120
It would be, and when the outback steakhouse manager comes out and says, you've got to

278
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,440
stop.

279
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,320
You got to stop.

280
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,440
You got to say, well, if you're not going to fill this charge that you've been given,

281
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,760
then you can't complain when somebody else decides to do your fucking dirty work, Broderick.

282
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,760
And when Broderick tries to fire you, you say, are you ready to pay my unemployment?

283
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,000
Huh?

284
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,040
Because I haven't been given any written warnings yet.

285
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,760
So if you jump right to the termination, I'll see you in court.

286
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:54,000
There is, we give a lot of guff to cash, dirty, filthy money, but there is something to be

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,720
said for the ability of being able to figure out how much your meal is, calculate it in

288
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,160
a tip, and then just leave some money and just walk.

289
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
You can bolt whatever you want to.

290
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,800
Yeah, when you look at your money and you think it's disgusting, because statistically

291
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,040
every dollar has been touched by a bug at some point.

292
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,640
Yuck.

293
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,880
But you got to look at it like they're awesome blossom coupons.

294
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,200
Awesome.

295
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,440
They're tickets to an awesome blossom experience.

296
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,000
And you can just leave them on the table and scoot at all and not worry about it.

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,200
You know, I've been a waiter slash server slash host several times at different places.

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,720
And I think that if I had a table full of people and then I looked over and they were

299
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
gone, I would immediately go, oh, and I go look at the table and I'd be like,

300
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
oh, there's like three twenties here, huh?

301
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,560
That could be fun.

302
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,800
I guess maybe the money is in like physical form.

303
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,920
That's weird.

304
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I hope they enjoyed their mimosas or whatever.

305
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
I wish there had been four twenties.

306
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
Oh, Trav, you almost had a good joke, bud.

307
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,280
There's four twenties here.

308
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,920
That's good.

309
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,720
Edit that anger.

310
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,680
I'm blazing.

311
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
Well, I'll have to delete yours, Justin.

312
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,160
You okay with that?

313
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,600
Yeah, I don't remember having one, so it won't be missed.

314
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,200
Um, yeah, I think that asked an answer.

315
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,920
How about a Yahoo?

316
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,360
I'd love that, dude.

317
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,080
I love it.

318
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,320
Yeah.

319
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,520
Adrian Cowell sent this one in.

320
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
Thanks, Adrian.

321
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,880
Rip it.

322
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,600
Get it out here.

323
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,480
All right.

324
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,520
Asked by Goji Fan, who asks, if you raise a crocodile since its birth, will it ever turn on you?

325
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,720
No.

326
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,600
Next question.

327
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
Justin, you have an opinion?

328
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,880
Um, no.

329
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,400
All right.

330
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,040
All right.

331
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
As long as it doesn't taste human flesh.

332
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,600
Yeah, it does once, and that's pretty much the ball game, I think.

333
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, that's true of most animals, though.

334
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,720
Yeah.

335
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
Like most pets, at least.

336
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,760
Don't let that turtle get a nip.

337
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,400
Oh, God.

338
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,800
We've all seen the videos of the people who, like, grew up with the lions, or rather,

339
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,400
the lions grew up with them, and then they don't see the lions for a grip,

340
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,880
and then they come back and see the lions, and the lions charge at them,

341
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,600
and you're like, fucking all right, here we go.

342
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,720
But then they just hug them.

343
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,960
I don't know that a crocodile is going to do this.

344
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,480
I don't know that a crocodile is going to be like, is that you, Davis?

345
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,880
And then run up to you and throw their scaly arms around your soft, supple neck.

346
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
I don't think you're going to get that exchange.

347
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
I've always loved you, Brian.

348
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:32,160
I don't know how a crocodile shows its affection except for not running fast at you and snapping

349
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,120
its big jaws.

350
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,640
Do you ever think, whenever I see, like, those unlikely animal friends,

351
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,360
and it's like a lion and, like, a Labrador retriever,

352
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,280
all I can think is that the Labrador retriever's like,

353
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,480
ha ha, yeah, we're friends.

354
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,440
Get me out of here.

355
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,160
Get me the fuck.

356
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,200
What are you fucking doing?

357
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,920
Look at this thing.

358
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,280
It's a fucking lion.

359
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,800
Ah, yeah, let's play with the ball.

360
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,240
The fun thing about the unlikely friends, animal friends, is that every time you see

361
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,240
one of those, know that the beginning of that story is some cat who's like, I don't know,

362
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,960
maybe.

363
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,600
Fuck it.

364
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,240
I'm drunk.

365
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,240
Also, for every, like, one of those you see, there's 18 that didn't quite pan out.

366
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,880
Sure.

367
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, that they just didn't click on a friend level.

368
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm trying to think of what a crocodile's friend is, and I'm thinking about these birds

369
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,360
that ride on the crocodile's back sometimes, just chilling in the middle of the lake or

370
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,640
the swimming pool.

371
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,920
And then I think that's the only one that they're going to get, because if a bird can

372
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,760
feel the wind changing, can feel a single drop of sweat forming on their crocodile friend,

373
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,800
their crocodile life partner below them, and know that the chomp is coming, and then they

374
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,040
can immediately leave upwards.

375
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,480
They can leave in a direction that the crocodile cannot follow.

376
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,440
I feel like it's a lot more like Dread Pirate Roberts at that point.

377
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
Like, I'll most likely kill you in the morning.

378
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,000
Like, cool, cool.

379
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm going to sit here so I don't have to keep flying.

380
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm very tired.

381
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,960
Extremely tired.

382
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,460
All right.

383
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,400
I used to love playing rock band and guitar here when I was a kid.

384
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I recently dug out my old, I'm sorry, they have a curse word here, but I'll just say

385
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
it, shitty, plastic instruments.

386
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,120
Do we have to go blue?

387
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,240
Out of my attic and found I was missing a set of drumsticks.

388
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,960
There are a few music stores within driving distance where I can buy some, but I don't

389
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,320
really play the drums.

390
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,160
I'm afraid someone will ask me something about my drums or what kind of drumsticks I want

391
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
or really anything at all.

392
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
I'll look so stupid.

393
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,240
What do I do?

394
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,200
I mean, there are electric drums, right?

395
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,920
Like, you could say I'm an electric drummer.

396
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,480
They probably don't say that.

397
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
Tell me about what kind of electric drum set you got.

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,880
I have a...

399
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
Get the fuck out of here, you're a fucking liar.

400
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,720
No, no, no.

401
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,520
I know the brand.

402
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,160
It's a microphone dice.

403
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,520
What?

404
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,320
Monitor.

405
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,760
Microphone dice monitor.

406
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,840
Are you just looking around your own room looking for things you see?

407
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
It's Good Beats.

408
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,720
It's a Good Beats.

409
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,760
It is not.

410
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,040
It is not a Good Beats.

411
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,240
Good Beats hasn't put out a drum set in over 20 years.

412
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,120
It's vintage.

413
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
It's vintage?

414
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,040
Really?

415
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,160
It's a vintage Good Beats drum set.

416
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Where did you get a vintage Good Beats?

417
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
Those are like $50,000.

418
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,360
Get out of here.

419
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,800
That's just a guy in the background playing the guitar really loud

420
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,760
so that you know how good he is.

421
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,880
In every music store ever, could you keep a down guy on guitar?

422
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
I'm talking to this dude about his vintage $50,000 Good Beats.

423
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,640
Yeah, I sure will put the headphones in.

424
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay.

425
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,040
So tell me more about what kind of drum set you...

426
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,160
You're singing out loud.

427
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,920
Excuse me.

428
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,480
You're saying it out loud while you're playing.

429
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,600
Yeah, I do that.

430
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,720
Helps me visualize the tunes.

431
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,200
What's up?

432
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
It's me, Sammy Hagar.

433
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,320
Whoa, in my store?

434
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,600
Sorry, I said it wrong.

435
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
It's me, Hammy Sagar.

436
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,280
Hammy, you gotta talk to this dude about his $50,000 vintage Good Beats.

437
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh no, he already stole all the drumsticks and ran out the door

438
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,080
while you were talking.

439
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,600
It's the perfect crime.

440
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
Yeah, he never saw that.

441
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,240
So get Hammy Sagar.

442
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
You're working with a local Sammy Hagar impressionist.

443
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,760
You're working with a Jillbin, a Silbin?

444
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,440
There's one of those letters, man.

445
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,360
Wait, are you really Hammy Sagar?

446
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,920
Maybe, I just burst out of your brother's torso.

447
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,760
Now I'm a podcast man.

448
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
Whoa, I don't know where in a bit.

449
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
Are there any famous drummers?

450
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,800
Okay, like let's say, how about Keith Moon, Ringo Starr?

451
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,160
Keith Moon's dead, that's not good.

452
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,240
Let's say Ringo Starr.

453
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,280
Can you go in and say you are Ringo Starr's assistant

454
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
and he's doing a concert nearby.

455
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
You don't know fucking anything about drums

456
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
and I need a pair of drums, drumsticks.

457
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
And they're like, what kind of drums do you play?

458
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,440
And then you can be like, I think you should know it's Ringo Starr.

459
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
You tell me what kind of drums he plays.

460
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
And then they feel like the idiot because they don't know

461
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,960
and they're just gonna sheepishly sell you them at a great rate.

462
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,440
Or better yet, when he's like, what kind of drums?

463
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,520
I don't know, it's my first day working for him

464
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
and start crying.

465
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,040
You'll probably get a discount at that point.

466
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,120
You could also say, let me get some drumsticks

467
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,960
and they'll say, oh, what kind of set do you play?

468
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,920
No, it's for eating corn cobs off of.

469
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,200
No, I just have big hands

470
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,960
so traditional chopsticks don't work for me.

471
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,920
They don't work for me.

472
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm Hammy Sagar, look at my huge palms.

473
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,880
I have to use drumsticks because I want everything I eat

474
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,800
to taste like rock and roll.

475
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,760
No, I'm trying to fight some rock vampires

476
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,040
and this is the only way I'm gonna be able to get close to him.

477
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,520
Itadakimasu, it's me, Hammy Sagar,

478
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,720
ready to enjoy this delicious meal you've prepared for me.

479
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
Does Sammy Hagar have a restaurant?

480
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,760
Does Sammy, he should, shouldn't he?

481
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,880
It seems like he does.

482
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,040
I'm gonna follow my spirit on this

483
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,600
and just Google Sammy Hagar restaurant

484
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,400
and see Sammy Hagar's Beach Bar and Grill.

485
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,160
Fuck yes, it just seemed like he would and then he did.

486
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,200
Check and mate.

487
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,760
He's got five.

488
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,960
Holy shit.

489
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
If you wanna enjoy Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill,

490
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,440
you can head to Glamorous, Honolulu, Maui, Las Vegas,

491
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,680
Cleveland, Southland Park Gaming and Racing Center.

492
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,280
Now I can justify the first three

493
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,760
and I bet Cleveland it's close to the Hall of,

494
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,200
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

495
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,040
Maybe, maybe.

496
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,680
When I'm walking through the hallowed halls of Hall of Fame

497
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,760
learning about all my favorite rock legends,

498
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,400
I see Sammy Hagar not in there, I think.

499
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
All I can think is, boy,

500
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
I wonder what this man could do to a set of chicken wings.

501
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,640
And that's how he made it into the cooking Hall of Fame.

502
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,120
True, multidisciplinarian.

503
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,040
Can we talk about the Max Fun Drive again?

504
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,120
Cause it's been so long that I'm starting to get the jitters.

505
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
I would love to.

506
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,200
Can I tell you, all right, yep.

507
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
So fucking funny, dude.

508
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,000
Thanks, dude.

509
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
So here's what I wanna say.

510
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,040
Can I be personal for a moment?

511
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,200
Get personal, dude.

512
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,160
Let me open my heart like Shazam

513
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,560
and let my little kid inside out.

514
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:36,960
All right.

515
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
I keep a boy in my chest.

516
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,120
Okay, what do you wanna say here?

517
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,000
No, that's what I wanna say.

518
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
I keep a boy in my chest.

519
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,080
Jeez, Trav.

520
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,640
But I wouldn't be able to do that if it weren't for donors.

521
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,600
Well, you're a broad-shouldered gentleman,

522
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,960
so I could see somebody meet Davin in there

523
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,360
with a certain amount of comfort.

524
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,040
You could have also gone with Krangin.

525
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,000
I would have given you that.

526
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,560
I think there's a thing in Men in Black

527
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,800
where there's a person inside a person's chest.

528
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,840
Anyways, we are all at this point

529
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
full-time professional podcasters.

530
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,120
And the only reason we are able to do that

531
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
is because of donors,

532
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,280
because of MaxFunDrive and the MaxFun donors.

533
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,800
And it's one of those things where,

534
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
and I tweeted about this last week,

535
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,960
but I do about every four weeks,

536
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
14 episodes of content for MaxFun.

537
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
And that's a lot.

538
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,040
But the reason I do that

539
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,480
and the reason I care about it so much

540
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
is I know how much it matters to you.

541
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,360
I see people tweet about it all year

542
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,280
and people show it to our shows.

543
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,360
But during MaxFunDrive, I get this big burst of inspiration

544
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,120
because I see all these people saying,

545
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
this is why this matters to me.

546
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,840
This is why I love MaxFun.

547
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,680
This is why I love my brother, my brother and me

548
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,280
and the Adventure Zone and Sawbones

549
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,560
and Schmaners and Wonderful

550
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,800
and Trends Like These and Still Buffering.

551
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,160
And that just, it fills me with so much joy and gratitude.

552
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,120
And horny power.

553
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,160
And horny power.

554
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,160
And that horny power is what fuels me for another year.

555
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,280
That horny fire in my soul just keeps me going.

556
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,240
Yeah, I think what Travis is trying to say

557
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,000
is you can support the things that you care about

558
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
and that you want to be in the world.

559
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,480
And that support means the world to us,

560
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,040
even no matter what level it is.

561
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,400
We get a lot of tweets from people saying like,

562
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,080
sorry, I can only do $5 a month.

563
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,040
That's huge.

564
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,880
That is you advocating for the stuff that we make.

565
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,680
And that's like the most meaningful thing

566
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,480
that you can do for a creator.

567
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
And you've been so kind to us in the past

568
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
with your donations and your support.

569
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,160
So if you just started listening

570
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,800
or maybe you're listening to more shows on the network,

571
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,240
consider donating.

572
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,040
You get to pick the shows you want to directly support

573
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,520
and your money will go to them.

574
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,040
And yeah, this is the time of year

575
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,720
where just think about what you have gotten

576
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,840
out of the shows that we make.

577
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,400
And if you have the means and you feel comfortable doing so,

578
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,160
go to maximumfun.org slash donate

579
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
and get those great rewards,

580
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,880
like the bonus content at five bucks

581
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,440
or the pins at 10 bucks.

582
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,960
There's a lot of options there.

583
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,280
This is also the best time to upgrade your donation.

584
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,200
Maybe you've been a member for a while

585
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
and you've started listening to more shows

586
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,320
or they filled an even more important part of your life,

587
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,120
whatever, maybe you got a big raise at work or whatever.

588
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
You know, maybe it's time to bump up from five to 10

589
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,560
or 10 to 20.

590
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,680
And when you do,

591
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,400
you will also get some of those new rewards for this year.

592
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,200
And I also want to say one last thing

593
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
before we move on to other questions.

594
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,560
I know that not everybody can donate.

595
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,320
You know, there was a time in my life

596
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
where $5 a month was out of the question

597
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,680
for stuff like this,

598
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,400
but you can still help out by going to Twitter

599
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
or Instagram or whatever social media you use

600
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,960
and sharing the link maximumfun.org forward slash donate

601
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,600
and use the hashtag maxfundrive and tell people

602
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,680
why they should donate and why the shows matter

603
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,920
and why, you know, like if you have a friend

604
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,280
who, you know, listens to the show

605
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,120
and, you know, maybe say to them like,

606
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,680
hey, did you know the maxfundrive is going on?

607
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,120
And make sure that they know about it.

608
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
All those things really help us out.

609
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,480
Can we just talk real quick about the bonus?

610
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,120
Just like, can I just talk about the bonus content real quick?

611
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,520
Go for it.

612
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,720
You can give $5 a month.

613
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,040
Just our shows, right?

614
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,280
There are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

615
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,920
nine, 10, 11 bonus episodes of My Brother, My Brother, Me

616
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,920
in there, which includes the Ghost Horse Fugue

617
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,280
for Brother Horns demo by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

618
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,080
Him singing that demo is in there.

619
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,600
The one and only episode of Big Gulp Live

620
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,080
is in the archives in there.

621
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,040
There are videos of us goofing on like educational videos.

622
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,440
There is Still Buffering played D&D.

623
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
We played Honey Heist.

624
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,960
Oh shit, that was so fun.

625
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
For Taz, it was really fun and funny.

626
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,600
We also played, Lin and us played Dungeons & Dragons one time

627
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,120
and he was a bard and it was really fun

628
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,880
and there's just like so much great stuff in there

629
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,120
and you get access to all of it for donating five bucks a month

630
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,680
and I think it would really mean a lot to us.

631
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,320
One last thing, and I'm recording this after the fact

632
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,240
if you can't tell because we forgot to mention it.

633
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,520
We are going to do a few other stretch goals

634
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,000
for numbers we hit as the whole MaxFun community

635
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,200
for this drive.

636
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,240
The first thing may be relevant if you know the history

637
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,600
of My Brother, My Brother, and Me

638
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,960
and our failures.

639
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,680
At 12,500 new and upgrading MaxFun members

640
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,160
which is half of our station-wide goal of 25,000

641
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,240
we're going to put out the May the 4th Star Wars episode

642
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,160
that we did live at Detroit, the Detroit disaster episode.

643
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
We're going to put that in the donor bonus feed

644
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,280
which again you get access to at five dollars a month

645
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,760
and at 15,000 new and upgrading MaxFun members

646
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
we're going to put out the episode

647
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
of the Adventure Zone Elementary that we recorded

648
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,800
on the Joko Cruise in which we had a fifth Sherlock Holmes

649
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,040
who was Pat Rothfuss and that one, wow, the mystery

650
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,640
really got away from us that time.

651
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,440
So yeah, two additional bonus episodes

652
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,120
that we're going to put up as stretch goals

653
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,160
and we may do some more later on this week.

654
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,200
TheMaximumFun.org forward slash donate.

655
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,960
Get that money.

656
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,320
I don't know what's soundboard

657
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
and what's not soundboard anymore.

658
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,880
What?

659
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,160
I want a munch.

660
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,800
Squad.

661
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
I want to munch.

662
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,480
Squad, oh.

663
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,680
I put a little British ant fuzz on that one

664
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,640
and a little bit of British stank.

665
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,160
I got a little, is it ACDC out of that, was that?

666
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,720
A little bit of ACDC or acted.

667
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,640
Or air conditioned and air conditioned.

668
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Air conditioned Dave Coulier as they sometimes are known.

669
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,800
It's back.

670
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,240
Pizza Hut brings back cult favorite Pazon from March Madness.

671
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,280
Folks, the Pazon is back.

672
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,520
This isn't even that funny of a one.

673
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,200
It's more like Max Fun Drive time

674
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,440
to give back public service announcement.

675
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
The Pazon is back.

676
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,720
That means I have to stop referring

677
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,080
to a person's genital triangle as their Pazon

678
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,400
because now it means something else again.

679
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,640
It could get confusing if you're like,

680
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
hey, can I have some of your Pazon?

681
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,200
And they're like, oh.

682
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
My genital triangle?

683
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,600
No, no, no.

684
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,920
It's a perfect addition to any March Madness watch party.

685
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,720
Customers can choose from pepperoni,

686
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
meaty and supremo recipes.

687
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
Oh yeah.

688
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,600
Yeah, so you got a lot of options.

689
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,920
Here's a quote from Marianne Radley,

690
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,440
the chief brand officer of Pizza Hut.

691
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,280
The McElroys talk about this all the time.

692
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,520
So we thought we might as well bring it back.

693
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,480
It's not a wiener.

694
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,000
March Madness is not a wiener.

695
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,040
It's one of the most captivating sports moments of the year.

696
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,280
We're excited to bring that back to Pazon

697
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,440
as part of our $5 lineup during a time

698
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,040
when friends and family will be gathering

699
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,280
in anticipation and excitement.

700
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,600
Boy, it sounds like Marianne has maybe

701
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,320
never been to a party before.

702
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,480
You know how when your friends and family gather

703
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
in anticipation and excitement,

704
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,480
do you mean a party to watch sports, Marianne?

705
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,920
Hey, do you guys want to come over

706
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,440
and anticipate another basketball game with me?

707
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
I guess so.

708
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,320
Listen, Marianne, who is not a robot, continues,

709
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
even if your team doesn't advance in the tournament.

710
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,920
Even if the human players don't score enough points.

711
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,560
If ball does not enter ring a satisfactory number of times.

712
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,880
The comeback of the Pazon is something

713
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,760
we know all fans can rally around.

714
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
I see here you've written at the end of your bracket,

715
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,480
the Pazon back baby, and you write,

716
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
here's $25 million.

717
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
You won the universal bracket competition.

718
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,160
You won it.

719
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,240
Hey, Pizza Hut, bring back the Bigfoot,

720
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
you fucking cowards.

721
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,480
I want to achieve my life's goal

722
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,360
of being crushed to death by a Bigfoot pizza

723
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,280
falling over on me, and that's not gonna happen

724
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,400
without your help.

725
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,560
God, this fucking press release, it continues.

726
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,480
The ads, there's gonna be ads

727
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
during March Madness for the Pazon.

728
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,560
The ads include some of the most famous

729
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,040
March Madness reaction memes from recent years.

730
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,000
That sounds pretty good.

731
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,240
From recent years, like the what just happened whale

732
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,600
featuring John Phillips, a diehard Northwestern fan,

733
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,760
and viral sensation from the 2017 NCAA tournament.

734
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,080
It's just like, are you advertising,

735
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,720
are you advertising the memes that are in your thing?

736
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,480
Is that what's going on?

737
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,160
Yeah, I guess this is a guy who got sad in a way

738
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,680
that everyone really liked, and so because of him,

739
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,240
I will eat your pizza, though.

740
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,400
I get so hungry seeing other people's

741
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,160
disappointment and sadness.

742
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,880
Yeah, well, it was sad in a way that I thought

743
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
I found entertaining in a big way,

744
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,800
so it did make me hungry for your pizza zone.

745
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,080
Yes, a lack of empathy really gets me salivating.

746
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm just trying to find a clip of this fucking sound,

747
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,160
like this whale that apparently is so funny

748
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,640
they've gotta use it to sell pizza calzones.

749
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,880
What happened whale?

750
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,000
The what happened whale?

751
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
I'm not moving on until I can find it,

752
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,960
so just warning you.

753
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,280
Now the first thing that comes up for me

754
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
is an article from the Natural History Museum

755
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,600
that says what happens to a whale when it dies?

756
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,880
It's probably not that, right?

757
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,760
I'm reading about a whale prison.

758
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,440
A guy, like the first result is just this kid,

759
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,240
it's just a GIF.

760
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,840
It's just a GIF of a kid, I mean,

761
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,960
it's just a GIF of a kid who's sad about basketball.

762
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,760
Like, it's just a GIF of a kid who's sad about basketball.

763
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,120
I want to watch this guy get sad

764
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,400
and have a fun time with him.

765
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm gonna put it in the thing.

766
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,200
It's just, it's nothing.

767
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,160
It's from 2017.

768
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,720
This kid's got a home and three kids right now.

769
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,960
What is marketable about this?

770
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,480
Well, he's really, he's genuinely sad.

771
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,440
He's the son of the athletic director of the losing team.

772
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,720
I imagine he's quite upset about his father's,

773
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,240
you know, his father's shameful sports defeat.

774
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,320
He just loves his boy.

775
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,160
Watching this child, this has no retweets and no likes.

776
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,880
There was somebody at Pizza Hut

777
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,200
who very much enjoyed watching this boy

778
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,400
watch his father get sports defeated

779
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,440
and thought that it's gonna sell mad zones.

780
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,400
It's just, you can't even find,

781
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,960
so the Northwestern kid, I guess, was a thing.

782
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,520
He was just really sad about the sports.

783
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,280
Yeah, he was just a sad boy.

784
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,080
He was just a sad boy who was sad about the game.

785
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Anyway, I got another story.

786
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,080
I remember when my dad got fired from the radio station

787
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,880
and fell down a flight of stairs on his way out

788
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,960
and I cried and then someone took a picture of that

789
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,760
and then they started selling Big Macs with it.

790
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,920
Okay, this goes on to brag about Book It

791
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
and it says the literacy project,

792
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,240
you know, Book It?

793
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,280
Yeah, dude.

794
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,720
You read books, you get free pizza.

795
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
You get free pizza.

796
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It says here, in partnership with Philips, who is,

797
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
oh, Philips, I guess the boy, the crying boy.

798
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,920
After my dad lost the big game, I read a bunch of books.

799
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,000
They're partnering with the boy

800
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,280
to provide equal access to books and educational resources.

801
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,440
Pizza Hut is donating $20,000.

802
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,280
Wow, you shouldn't have.

803
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,040
You made that five minutes ago, you fuckos.

804
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,880
Really?

805
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,640
$20,000 Pizza Hut?

806
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,480
Are you sure?

807
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,200
Unbelievable.

808
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,760
But they're making this sad boy pay for it.

809
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,200
The sad boy has to clear out his college savings.

810
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,520
He's gotta wash ditches at a Pizza Hut

811
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,200
to earn that $20,000.

812
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,960
Griffin, you had a Yahoo all lined up for us

813
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,320
before I so rudely interrupted you.

814
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,040
Yeah, so I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Kalen.

815
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,880
Thanks, Kalen.

816
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,000
It's Yahoo Answers user, Dan, who asks,

817
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,240
I don't get it.

818
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,240
What's the point of bubble bath?

819
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,320
Ever since I was a kid,

820
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,960
I never understood what the deal is with bubble bath.

821
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,320
Does it get you cleaner than just soap and water?

822
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,680
Or is it just a stupid load of crud?

823
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,640
Or is it meant to make you feel

824
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,720
like you're a millionaire when you ain't?

825
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,200
Or does it have some function I never understood?

826
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,360
Like, is the whole point of it

827
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,960
so as you can have someone else in the room

828
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,920
while you're bathing and they can't see your private parts

829
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,160
because of the bubbles?

830
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,840
Or is bubble bath just totally pointless?

831
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,960
This person just listed three great things about bubble bath

832
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,720
and they're still wondering what the point of it is.

833
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,760
You're getting it.

834
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,160
Yeah, there's not some secret hidden bubble bath agenda

835
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,000
that you're, yeah, that's it.

836
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,240
It makes you feel like a millionaire when you ain't.

837
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
That's the first thing, no question.

838
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Two, people can't see your private parts.

839
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,080
Absolutely.

840
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,920
It's great for taking pictures of your kids.

841
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,680
You could not show the act of bathing in most films

842
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,800
without, or else, you know?

843
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,720
Yes.

844
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
Or take tasteful pictures of your toddlers

845
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,200
because there's a bubble bath and it's adorable.

846
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,040
Oh, it's so funny.

847
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,960
Oh, it looks like they've got a beard and a hat on

848
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,000
and you can't see their pizones.

849
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,920
And Travis has just touched on the next thing,

850
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,120
which is the Santa beard is very good.

851
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,040
Santa beard is very good.

852
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,400
I bet this guy goes to the park

853
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,640
where kids are playing with bubble wands

854
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,800
and he's like, what's the point?

855
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,200
Does it get you clean?

856
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,040
I mean, it could.

857
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,880
Does this get you high?

858
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,080
Does it get you high?

859
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,240
These bubbles get you kids high?

860
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,080
I don't get it.

861
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
What's the point?

862
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,640
I do wanna say this about bubble bath.

863
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,960
I wish there was a off switch.

864
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,640
Once you board the bubble bath train,

865
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,160
you can't go back to water bath.

866
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,240
You simply cannot.

867
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,960
And it is for this reason that my,

868
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,880
I used to draw a bubble bath for my son

869
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,360
and I did it for a while

870
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,960
and then he started just requesting no bubbles.

871
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,720
He's the only two-year-old that I know of who's like,

872
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,240
I'll just do a water one this time and every time.

873
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,440
I hate those bubbles because you can't turn them off.

874
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,040
They're just always there once you do them.

875
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,280
And you can't actually,

876
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,360
it's so hard to rinse bubbles off.

877
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Like, yeah, it is a, yeah.

878
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,760
Bubbles, bubble baths are a lot.

879
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,320
Also, if kids are real young,

880
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,160
you shouldn't do bubble baths.

881
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
It's bad for their skin,

882
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,440
especially young people with vaginas.

883
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,280
It's not great for them.

884
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,920
Just a little PSA for me.

885
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,640
I would like to pitch this, a new bubble bath strat.

886
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,480
Okay.

887
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,800
Make a little bucket of bubble bath on the side.

888
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,520
Then you can place the, you can do the bubble hat.

889
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,920
You could do the bubble beard.

890
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,800
You could even tastefully place some bubble coverage,

891
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,800
but you have sequestered the bubbles over in a safe area

892
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,120
where they can be admired.

893
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,700
Oh, those are some great bubbles,

894
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,480
but they're not over here infesting my whole bath zone.

895
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,340
That's fun.

896
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,580
There's also this, a second bathtub

897
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,800
that sits in the ceiling above your current bathtub.

898
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,240
And when you fill up your bathtub,

899
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,000
upstairs bathtub also gets filled up.

900
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,960
And then when you want the bubbles

901
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,720
in your fun bath to go away,

902
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,920
when the person's left the room

903
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,800
and you can lock your genitals to really

904
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,100
just scuba around down there

905
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,800
without being obfuscated by the suds,

906
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,160
then you pull the lever

907
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,020
and the floor of your tub opens up

908
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,560
and it falls out of the house.

909
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,600
And then the floor of the upstairs bath opens

910
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,320
and it instantly refills with clean, beautiful,

911
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,760
easy breezy, beautiful bubble-free water.

912
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,440
And Gromit brings you a sandwich or whatever.

913
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,680
Yeah, and then your breakfast gets made

914
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,320
and your Mr. Bean or whatever.

915
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,400
Mr. T cereal pours out

916
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,360
and you only eat like two pieces of it.

917
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,920
You can laugh at me, but let me ask you this.

918
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,880
Okay.

919
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,720
You ever seen Mr. Bean's dick?

920
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,840
Oh, Griffin, please don't let me talk about this again.

921
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,680
I didn't realize it was Sunday afternoon already.

922
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,760
It's time for a regular weekly conference call with Griffin.

923
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,440
Have you ever seen Mr. Bean's dick?

924
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,720
Listen, they had to put butts in the seats

925
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,420
at Johnny English 3 somehow.

926
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,200
Griffin, by the last time, Johnny English isn't Mr. Bean.

927
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,320
You can fucking pry that out of my cold, dead hands.

928
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,280
You can lean over my casket at my funeral

929
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,200
and be like, it's not true.

930
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,920
That's the only way you're gonna take that from me, bud,

931
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,280
because he is Mr. Bean and he talks normaler.

932
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,400
He gets up in a wacky hijinx and he can't,

933
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,880
he fucking, you know, his pants falls down

934
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,480
and he doesn't do being a spy good.

935
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,800
Hello, does that sound like Mr. Bean

936
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
who goes into the museum and makes a big mess?

937
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,680
Hello, Mr. Fly. Thank you.

938
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,400
I can't believe that you're not on my side on this.

939
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,980
I'm actually kind of heartbroken about it.

940
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,080
I feel like you're just being devil's advocate.

941
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,320
No, I'm sorry, Griffin.

942
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,360
All right.

943
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,280
It's a different person.

944
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,240
He's also not the same guy from the remake of Rat Race.

945
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,680
He is similar, though.

946
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,240
Mr. Bean is very similar to the guy from Rat Race.

947
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,040
I think he only says the one thing, it's an ace.

948
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,720
Like, that's the only thing.

949
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,280
But he's also not Blackadder.

950
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,840
Blackadder is a completely different character.

951
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,300
That's different, that one's different.

952
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,000
But the other ones where he's Mr. Bean,

953
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,760
I think he's actually Mr. Bean in those.

954
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,220
So like, wait, so does Johnny English

955
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,240
come before Mr. Bean where maybe he sees too much

956
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,920
and he's like, I'll never speak again.

957
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,760
I'll never, I can't.

958
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Johnny English never comes before anyone.

959
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,920
He's a proper British gentleman

960
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,880
that knows how to make a lover laugh.

961
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,880
He knows to take care, it's like eating Chinese food,

962
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,720
it's not over till everybody gets their cookies.

963
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,080
That's a line from Alec Baldwin's movie.

964
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,200
Boss Baby.

965
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,020
The Shadow in Boss Baby.

966
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,860
Yeah.

967
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,740
I watched Boss Baby fucking twice on the cruise.

968
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,880
How was your guys cruise?

969
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,720
I had fun.

970
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,000
I didn't get diarrhea against the will of God and man.

971
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,560
And I watched Boss Baby twice.

972
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,720
Pretty good time, I think, I had.

973
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,280
Did you know there's a Netflix series?

974
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,100
You can just transition straight into that.

975
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,580
I think it's on its like eighth season.

976
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,360
Six episodes of our show on TV was done,

977
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,200
but we've got, we're up to like six seasons

978
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,480
of Boss Baby bossing around or whatever

979
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,320
the fucking Netflix show is called.

980
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,960
Are you really trying to compare the quality of our show

981
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,440
to the quality of Boss Baby, Griffin, or Justin?

982
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,280
Which one are you?

983
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,140
I mean, the animation is about equal,

984
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,140
but the voices in ours are a lot better.

985
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,640
All right, let's start.

986
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,840
You remember who made it, so be nice.

987
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,760
Oh, you're right, it is a DreamWorks thing.

988
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,120
Get that money.

989
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,680
Okay, you got me on that one.

990
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,200
That one is really good.

991
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,040
I thought that one worked.

992
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,240
Yeah, you should do the next one also.

993
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,260
I did have a lot of fun with Boss Baby.

994
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,740
The National Cornbread Festival is coming up next month

995
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,320
and I was thinking of checking it out.

996
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,480
Fuck yeah, why not?

997
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,320
Fuck yeah, I'd go.

998
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,140
Get there.

999
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,980
Why not?

1000
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,480
I noticed the words no drones allowed

1001
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,480
were written at the bottom of every single page

1002
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,120
in bold orange font.

1003
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,840
I reached out to the organizers through email

1004
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,200
about a week ago.

1005
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,320
Bless you, good for you, excellent.

1006
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,880
I reached out to the organizers through email

1007
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,600
about a week ago, but have not gotten a response

1008
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,720
and it doesn't say why they're banned anywhere on the site.

1009
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,800
I hope when you reached out to them,

1010
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,440
you emailed to say, hey, I know, I get it,

1011
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,800
but can I bring one drone?

1012
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,640
I'll be cool.

1013
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,200
Just the one drone.

1014
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Oh man.

1015
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,760
It doesn't say anywhere.

1016
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,320
And so why are drones banned?

1017
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,780
How can I find this out?

1018
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,280
Now we've been making a push recently

1019
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,280
for more, just to really, you gotta send advice questions.

1020
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,440
I, however, have gone to nationalcornbread.com

1021
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,320
and have found that really prominently,

1022
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,920
at the bottom of every single page,

1023
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,440
it does say no drones allowed in huge orange letters

1024
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,560
and I don't understand.

1025
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,480
It's like, it's really prominent.

1026
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,000
The only reason that happens

1027
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,320
is if at a past cornbread festival,

1028
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,920
they did not have this rule,

1029
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,160
some drone showed up and ruined everything.

1030
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,040
Yeah, I mean, man, it's really just on the masthead there.

1031
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,280
It's above their address.

1032
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,240
Yeah, it's above their address.

1033
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
If you can imagine this, friend,

1034
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,480
if you're not at a computer,

1035
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,640
at the bottom of the page, there's like the links

1036
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
for Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.

1037
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,760
Boy, I bet the Instagram of National Cornbread Festival

1038
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,880
just kind of bookmarked that.

1039
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,520
Click away.

1040
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,060
Oh shit.

1041
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,040
It's a bunch of cornbread up on here.

1042
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,540
It looks real good.

1043
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah, it looks actually really delicious.

1044
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,840
Now that I'm looking.

1045
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,420
And then at the bottom of the page,

1046
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,480
there's like their address in white

1047
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,320
and then above that, in three times as big font,

1048
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,320
in huge orange letters, it says no drones allowed, so.

1049
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,800
Did the website maybe used to be something else

1050
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,840
and then they updated every part of it

1051
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,440
but couldn't figure out how to remove no drones allowed

1052
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,280
from the masthead?

1053
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,520
No drones allowed.

1054
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,400
Do you think, do drones eat?

1055
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,560
Oh, okay, I got Brad Garrett to do that too.

1056
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,120
I got Brad Garrett to say no drones allowed.

1057
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,600
Do drones eat cornbread?

1058
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,760
They do like it, but like,

1059
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,960
do they like it more than the rest of us?

1060
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,800
I don't know.

1061
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,520
I'm just saying, listen, if I worked hard to make some,

1062
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,760
and I'm hoping to like win the blue ribbon,

1063
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,600
make some like award-winning cornbread, right?

1064
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,120
And then a drone swoops in and eats it all up

1065
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,080
before judgment again, what am I supposed to,

1066
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,240
how am I supposed to stop a drone, Griffin?

1067
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,920
Now I will say there's, let's Occam's Razor this

1068
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,080
because what's more likely?

1069
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,160
Drones love to eat and enjoy and digest

1070
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,600
and then I guess shit cornbread?

1071
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,620
Or at the National Cornbread Festival

1072
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,620
in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, there was executed

1073
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,640
the fucking heist of the century,

1074
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,040
an aerial cornbread escape and nary a flake

1075
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,920
of this sweet yellow bread crossed the gums

1076
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,600
of the attendees and participants of the festival

1077
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,400
as they lifted off into the skies.

1078
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,880
And they even did the thing that they do

1079
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,280
at the Super Bowl sometimes where it'll form words

1080
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,080
like Maroon 5 or Pepsi Good.

1081
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,080
And it said like, fuck yous, this, you know,

1082
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,220
biscuits are where it's at

1083
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,040
from the National Biscuit Council, eat our ass.

1084
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,400
Whoa, it was a spite thing?

1085
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,720
It's possible. I love that.

1086
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,360
I thought it was good, I thought you were headed

1087
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,800
towards like, you know, a super villain

1088
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,320
who has like a crazy craving for some cornbread

1089
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,980
and they've stolen like 5,000 pounds of cornbread

1090
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,040
right under the nose of that cornbread festival

1091
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,480
who's always thwarting them.

1092
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,320
Yeah.

1093
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,920
And another possibility is that if you see the way

1094
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,640
that the tents are lined up and the parking lots

1095
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,880
are lined up and the corn maze is lined up,

1096
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,800
the whole thing when seen from way above Bird's Eye View,

1097
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,000
and this is just an accident,

1098
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,680
it's just kind of how it came together,

1099
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,120
it does look like a dog sitting on its butt

1100
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,880
with a huge boner and they don't want anyone to know

1101
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,080
and it's too late to change it.

1102
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,360
Do you think maybe the organizers

1103
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,200
of the cornbread festival are worried

1104
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,040
that people would show up just like super excited

1105
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,280
for cornbread and then they'd look up and be like,

1106
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,200
oh shit, are those robots flying in the sky?

1107
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,440
Yeah, fuck cornbread.

1108
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
I wanna find out about this.

1109
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,680
Yeah, that's way more interesting.

1110
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,600
I'm going to Skybot Festival.

1111
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,040
So it should list some other things

1112
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,000
that are more interesting than cornbread,

1113
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,600
like yo-yos or bread.

1114
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,560
Pencils, paper.

1115
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,800
There's so many pictures on the cornbread festival website

1116
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,120
of people pretending to be super jazzed

1117
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,440
about the idea of cornbread.

1118
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
Tell me you're wrong, I love cornbread,

1119
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,920
but these people, it is as if they have never

1120
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,880
eaten food before.

1121
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,720
I kind of really want to go now.

1122
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,560
I tweeted at them.

1123
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,880
I see that Justin has now tweeted,

1124
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,040
hey, our drone's allowed at the cornbread festival

1125
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,240
to the cornbread festival.

1126
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,080
And that's always.

1127
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,080
And then I just follow up with that afterwards with just one

1128
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,840
because I want to make it clear, I don't want to bring

1129
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,440
a lot of drones, just the one drone.

1130
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,960
Sure, and this is a fun thing that Justin likes to do

1131
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,520
to Twitter accounts with 600 followers

1132
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,560
is sort of just sort of bring the hammer down on them.

1133
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,640
A joke hammer.

1134
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,040
How about a Yahoo?

1135
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,800
Yeah, I'd love that, thank you.

1136
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,800
So here's one that was sent in by Jessica Williams.

1137
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,640
Thank you, Jessica.

1138
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,080
It is from Yahoo Answers user.

1139
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,240
Oh, they are anonymous.

1140
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,240
So I'm gonna call them Sally.

1141
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,240
Sally asks, was I right to leave the party

1142
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,960
because there was nowhere for me to sit?

1143
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,400
Yesterday, my grandma had a party at her house.

1144
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,120
My whole family went and extended family too.

1145
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,320
It started at like 10 a.m. and I got there at 12 p.m.

1146
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,920
I drove there to find there were no seats.

1147
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,000
I walked in the backyard and everyone was sitting down

1148
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,360
and I got offended because no one offered me a seat.

1149
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,080
I would have had to stand up the whole time

1150
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,520
so I got in my car and left.

1151
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,760
Was I right to do that?

1152
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,360
Now the whole family is talking about me

1153
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,360
and thinks I'm weird.

1154
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,240
Here's the thing that Sally wasn't,

1155
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,280
isn't telling us, it's not her family.

1156
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,840
Oh, I see.

1157
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,520
She showed up and everyone's like, oh, she's back.

1158
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,320
And she's like, no one's giving me a seat

1159
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,200
and she left and everyone was super relieved.

1160
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,200
Yeah, also Sally is a baby black bear

1161
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,000
who just keeps coming onto my lot

1162
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,480
and keeps falling in my swimming pool

1163
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,040
and scaring my child a lot.

1164
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:03,880
That's possible.

1165
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,720
It could also be that you showed up two hours late

1166
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,640
to your grandma's radical party

1167
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,600
and so maybe you just don't get a seat.

1168
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,520
How long was grandma's party going

1169
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,480
that two hours was an acceptable window to you?

1170
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,240
Did grandma put 10 a.m. to question mark?

1171
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,280
You're at it all day.

1172
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,640
Now if it's a Memorial Day thing in Ironton,

1173
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,800
that's kind of a come and go situation.

1174
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,520
Because you're gonna be going to all the neighbor's houses.

1175
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,200
Yes, especially if it's on the parade route.

1176
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,160
Oh, forget about it.

1177
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,400
Especially if you've got an easily accessible bathroom,

1178
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,960
people are gonna be hitting you up all day long.

1179
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,840
Hey Bill, it's Steve.

1180
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,600
Yeah, whatever, where's the crap?

1181
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,120
Of course.

1182
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,600
Love it, so good catching up.

1183
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,120
I gotta shoot the dick real quick.

1184
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,000
Thank you for your service.

1185
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,480
I never actually, can I shit in here?

1186
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,100
That's a closet, okay.

1187
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,320
This would be, generally speaking,

1188
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,580
is it okay to leave a party

1189
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,880
because there's nowhere for you to sit?

1190
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,520
I certainly, in my collegiate days,

1191
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,200
before I learned how to speak to other human beings,

1192
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,640
I left parties for far less reasonable reasons

1193
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,080
than this reason.

1194
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,920
Like too drunk reason.

1195
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,240
Too drunk or someone showed up who looked like someone

1196
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,840
that I have beef with, but it didn't end up to be them.

1197
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,360
There were drones there,

1198
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,240
or you thought you heard an ice cream truck.

1199
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,240
You thought you heard an ice cream truck,

1200
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,320
you gotta chase that shit down.

1201
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,160
Gotta see what's happening out there.

1202
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,360
I think that rather than tell someone,

1203
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,880
like if someone's like, hey Sally,

1204
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,720
why'd you leave the party?

1205
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,680
Don't say there weren't enough seats there.

1206
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,360
Say, I knew there were more seats somewhere else.

1207
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,440
That's what put a positive spin on it.

1208
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,760
I'm still at the party.

1209
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,600
I'm just sitting down at my house.

1210
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,640
Now I have annexed my house as part of your party

1211
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,960
because that's where I knew the seat was.

1212
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,240
What if you told him you went to buy more chairs,

1213
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,120
but the chair store had burned down so you went home

1214
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,720
because it was very far away from the original party.

1215
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,080
You can do what I do whenever I show up

1216
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,920
to any social function, which is walk into the room

1217
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,000
and introduce my presence,

1218
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
and then just very, very slowly start sitting down

1219
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,680
wherever I am and hope that somebody puts a chair under me.

1220
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,800
And I make a big deal out of it like, oh.

1221
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,640
How often does that work?

1222
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,280
Oh no, here I go, gonna,

1223
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,360
I hope I don't smash my tuchus on the ground.

1224
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,320
Someone please give me a thing to land.

1225
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh no, I'm almost losing my balance thinking my tuchus.

1226
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,560
Now Griffin, you have broken your coccyx like 80 times,

1227
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,800
right?

1228
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,960
I don't, it's really just kind of a metal,

1229
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,440
it's kind of mostly just a truck hitch

1230
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,560
back there at this point.

1231
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,800
Which is cool because I can.

1232
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,160
Yeah, you can pull a trailer.

1233
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,120
Yeah, I can get a boat down to the river just on myself.

1234
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,260
Which is exciting.

1235
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:02,060
I would leave the party because I don't wanna stand up

1236
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,880
while a bunch of sitters in the same way

1237
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,560
that I do not wanna be the only person sitting at the party

1238
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,740
talking to a bunch of pizones.

1239
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,600
I would find some place lower to sit down.

1240
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,440
Oh.

1241
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,000
Like if everybody's sitting on a chair,

1242
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,280
you could sit on like a footstool.

1243
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,120
You know what I mean?

1244
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,600
So now it's like, I'm even more comfortable than you are.

1245
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,720
Damn Trav, that's funky and relatable.

1246
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,640
Thank you.

1247
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,320
Twisted too, I'd say.

1248
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,360
Thank you, well that's just what I bring to the party.

1249
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,840
Get a shovel and start digging a hole you can sit in.

1250
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,720
Yeah, do that.

1251
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,560
The lowest one is the-

1252
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,840
Or just lay down and look up at your grandma.

1253
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,160
The lowest, the lower you are, the cooler you are.

1254
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,000
Yes.

1255
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,040
Because you're closer to the center of the earth

1256
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,280
where it's hot, baby.

1257
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,840
And maybe just grab the whole bowl of potato salad

1258
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,920
and pop a fork in there.

1259
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,120
No need for a plate.

1260
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,880
Yeah, don't leave.

1261
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,440
That's not gonna get even with them.

1262
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,700
These motherfuckers wanna be chair hogs.

1263
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,880
I think you gotta just upend the hot dog tray.

1264
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,120
I think a good way to get a bunch of people standing up

1265
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,280
who are sitting is just walk in and say,

1266
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,120
oh, sitting, huh?

1267
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,280
And then just don't say anything else

1268
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,320
as you look around the room slowly.

1269
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,440
That would work on me.

1270
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,720
I'd be like, wait, what is it?

1271
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,240
What's wrong with, oh.

1272
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,080
That's wrong with sitting?

1273
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,240
Yeah, that's really bad for you.

1274
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,840
I heard that sitting for five minutes

1275
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,360
is like having 30 heart attacks.

1276
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,200
Whoa.

1277
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,280
Is what I saw on the news.

1278
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,440
Yeah.

1279
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,280
I'm a stander.

1280
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,040
The problem is is then once people start standing up

1281
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,040
with you, you can't then sit down like,

1282
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,880
oh, you know what, I'm gonna risk it.

1283
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,220
I read another story.

1284
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,140
They've updated, the science has changed.

1285
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,500
You know science.

1286
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,540
The science on sitting is different now.

1287
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,340
Oh, you know what I love when confronted

1288
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,020
with my grandma in her rude chair stealing ways

1289
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,940
is you get a whoopee cushion under there.

1290
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,200
Oh my god, this sounds so funny.

1291
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,260
Nobody talk.

1292
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,900
Well, you gotta blow it up first

1293
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,060
and you don't wanna see them to see you do that.

1294
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,660
So go in the bathroom and say, I've got a shit,

1295
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,780
and then you go in the bathroom

1296
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,780
and you blow up a whoopee cushion.

1297
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,660
But do make it seem like you're actually doing the deed

1298
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,860
because they're gonna be like,

1299
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,020
what are you doing in there blowing up a whoopee cushion?

1300
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,580
And so roll the toilet paper roll a few times

1301
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,640
and tear a piece off so that they think.

1302
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,540
Spend some time praying loudly.

1303
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,100
Well, no, I'm talking about usual bathroom stuff.

1304
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,220
And so you flush it down and wash your hands good,

1305
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,180
but you don't have to, you can just turn the water on.

1306
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,780
And really you can do that anywhere,

1307
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,980
but that's a whole different pro tip.

1308
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,140
And then you're gonna go outside

1309
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,420
and everybody's sitting in the chairs.

1310
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,420
At this point, the whoopee cushion's in your belly

1311
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,940
up in your shirt, and you're gonna walk out.

1312
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,380
And you better do it to grandma

1313
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,700
because it's gonna be the funniest,

1314
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,180
like it's funnier when an older person passes gas.

1315
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,020
Yes, yes, yes.

1316
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,220
You are gonna go stand behind them

1317
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,220
or maybe crawl behind them so everybody else doesn't see you.

1318
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,840
And once you get there,

1319
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,980
you're gonna have to get that whoopee cushion

1320
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,020
under granny's behind.

1321
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,540
Yes, this is the part of your plan

1322
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,860
I'm most interested in, if I'm being honest.

1323
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,260
Sure, sure, sure.

1324
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,100
So we're talking about what is a whoopee cushion?

1325
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,660
Well, I'm glad you asked me that very question.

1326
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,760
It's just a bag full of air, and what is air known for?

1327
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,220
It can fill any space that it occupies.

1328
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,380
And so if you just put it sort of against your granny's thigh

1329
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,460
and the chair, the surface,

1330
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,660
and you just kind of start pushing

1331
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,780
that big balloon against her hiney,

1332
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,820
it's gonna get under there eventually.

1333
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,660
The question is what is there distracting her

1334
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,060
against this very obvious sensation?

1335
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,880
That's the obvious question.

1336
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,820
I know you think I'm a real goofball by suggesting this.

1337
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,380
Another thing you need in this situation

1338
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,620
is a pill caddy full of bees.

1339
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,340
Okay, yes, a pill caddy full of bees.

1340
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,620
Yeah, and you're just gonna start

1341
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,820
opening those up one by one.

1342
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,100
And once they start getting bored with one bee,

1343
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,060
you open up Tuesday bee, Wednesday bee, Thursday bee.

1344
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,980
Wait a minute, why not just have, sorry, I'm sorry.

1345
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,640
Why not then just have a box of bees?

1346
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,820
Because it's harder to catch a box full of bees.

1347
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,580
If you open up a box, Travis.

1348
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,860
Thank you, yes.

1349
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,820
Even a small box, like a box for shoes,

1350
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,860
and then fucking seven bees fly out,

1351
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,580
people will be like, that was not.

1352
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,740
Not impressive.

1353
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,340
But if you throw a pill caddy for one week down,

1354
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,860
and you then walk over to what you've just thrown down,

1355
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,180
and one by one open all the doors.

1356
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,140
It does heighten the scare factor

1357
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,540
because people will look at it and think,

1358
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,540
oh my God, that's a week's worth of bees.

1359
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,500
That's so many.

1360
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,600
So you would open one bee, right, at least one bee,

1361
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,660
then you would go and scoot some more of the cushion

1362
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,540
underneath Grandma.

1363
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,820
Oh no, people are getting bored.

1364
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,100
You go back out to the center room, open Monday bee,

1365
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,700
and then you go back more cushion.

1366
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,620
Exactly, the problem is that you've chosen a target

1367
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,540
who is maybe the least mobile person at the event,

1368
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,640
and so you need to confront yourself with the reality

1369
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,980
that this thing, this dog just is not going to hunt,

1370
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,640
even, no matter if you have something ridiculous,

1371
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,620
like two full pill caddies full of bees.

1372
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,180
And so at that point, your granny's gonna catch you,

1373
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,780
and it'll do the funny exclamation point thing

1374
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,220
like in Metal Gear Solid, and she'll be like,

1375
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,260
what do you do?

1376
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,620
She'll be like, what do you do?

1377
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,140
And then that's when you just take the whoopee cushion back

1378
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,660
and you just squeeze it so that the little rubber lips

1379
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,420
of it is blowing the fart like at her derriere.

1380
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,560
And that's gonna be not ideal, obviously,

1381
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,040
but you get something out of it, so.

1382
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,540
My only sadness is that you've edited all this out

1383
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,740
and no one will ever get to hear any of this madness.

1384
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,660
That's the only thing that makes me sad.

1385
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,020
No, I think that one made the cut.

1386
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,860
It did.

1387
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,680
Oh, that one's in there.

1388
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,100
Wow, I'm actually surprised.

1389
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,380
Can we talk about the max phone drive?

1390
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,500
Sure, I guess so.

1391
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,460
Is that okay?

1392
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,380
Yeah, maximumfund.org forward slash donate is the address.

1393
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,020
If you could donate five, 10, $20 a month,

1394
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,460
at $20 a month, you get a puzzle and a pin of your choice

1395
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,700
and all the bonus content.

1396
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,180
$35 a month, you get an engraved mug

1397
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,980
and the puzzle and the pin and the bonus content.

1398
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,140
That engraving, by the way, as I should have mentioned,

1399
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,420
you don't get to pick the engraving.

1400
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,740
It's the max funnel logo.

1401
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,700
But it's cool.

1402
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,420
Like, that's a cool thing to have on your mug.

1403
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,460
The Arby's, the Arby's logo.

1404
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,820
I love that.

1405
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,440
There are more gifts at higher donation levels,

1406
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,420
which you can go see at the website if you want to.

1407
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,860
But the main thing is just subscribing.

1408
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,340
Even if it's just five bucks a month,

1409
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,200
it really does add up and help to keep this network going.

1410
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,660
It is the reason that we have all been able

1411
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,980
to make this our jobs, spend a lot more time on the shows,

1412
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,460
improve our equipment, and-

1413
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,020
And start new shows.

1414
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:47,860
Start new shows, yeah.

1415
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,260
We started with Just My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1416
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,340
And look how many we're doing now

1417
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,380
because being a part of this network is so great.

1418
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:57,040
Yeah, it is a great place to do our thing.

1419
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,020
And we are very fortunate

1420
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,340
that you all have been so supportive in the past.

1421
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,360
So think about, it's really quick too.

1422
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,900
Go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

1423
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,760
It takes like just like a minute to pick your show

1424
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,660
you want to support and get all your stuff in there.

1425
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,800
I want to say my, let me also encourage you.

1426
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,740
If you're thinking about doing it and you want to do it,

1427
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,580
do it now.

1428
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,160
Like as long as you're not driving or something,

1429
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,760
if you can safely like get on your phone

1430
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,140
or computer or whatever, because, you know,

1431
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,020
it's so easy to say like, oh yeah, I'll do that later.

1432
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,620
And then like you completely forget about it.

1433
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,880
And then you're going to miss your window

1434
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,900
to get all of these awesome rewards

1435
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,380
and to be part of the drive and all that stuff.

1436
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,100
I would say also for whatever it's worth,

1437
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,180
and I don't want to like get into gilding anybody,

1438
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,220
but for the first couple of days,

1439
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,180
we had some problems with the Max Fund website.

1440
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,600
And speaking frankly, we're a little bit behind

1441
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,740
of where we would like to be.

1442
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:48,260
Considering the network-wide goal is 25,000

1443
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,420
and we're sitting at about eight here

1444
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,660
as we're recording on Friday afternoon.

1445
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,260
Hopefully it's slightly higher than 8,000,

1446
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,020
which is what it's at currently on Friday,

1447
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,980
because you're listening to this on Monday.

1448
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,180
But we would really appreciate it.

1449
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,960
We need your help basically is what I'm saying.

1450
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,640
So if you would come to leap to our aid,

1451
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,800
like a brave, cool night, we would really appreciate it.

1452
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,620
And please don't hesitate.

1453
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,380
Maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

1454
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,740
If you like the stuff we do

1455
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,740
and you want more stuff like that in the world,

1456
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,780
this is how you vote for that stuff.

1457
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,980
That's how you fill the world with things you like.

1458
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,820
So please.

1459
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,220
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1460
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,060
for these for our theme song.

1461
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,740
And to Departure, ask the album putting the days to bed.

1462
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,980
How about a yahoo?

1463
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,500
Oh, one more thing before I forget.

1464
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,560
We have a YouTube channel, McElroy Family on YouTube.

1465
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,640
And we've been doing a bunch of like live streams

1466
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,620
and extra stuff on there.

1467
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,860
Maybe by the time this comes out,

1468
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,480
I'll have posted, Teresa did like a retro hair tutorial

1469
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,660
on there.

1470
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,500
Go check it out.

1471
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,460
And we will probably do some more live streams on there.

1472
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,000
So McElroy Family on YouTube.

1473
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,720

01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,180
Thanks Teresa.
