1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300

Wait what yeah if lightning McQueen wins. He's gonna have a night with my wife

16
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,700
Yeah, Griffin is gonna be cuckolded by lightning McQueen. I mean it makes it might not be sexual it might not end up

17
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,940
Yeah, it might not end up being sexual they might just connect on a deeper level

18
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
There's only one way you could okay

19
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,940
stretch goal

20
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,620
This is a threat this one's kind of a threat yeah, and I don't love this, but I'm saying it

21
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,860
Yeah, we are currently the max fund drive our goal is

22
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,740
20,000 new and upgrading donors and boosting donors as well

23
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,980
And if you are able to help us make our shows make our shows possible

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Which is only possible through your generosity?

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:47,080
generosity go to maximum fund or first let's join you're gonna get for $5 a month you will get tons of

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,600
Bonus content over 15 days. I believe it has to be measured in days now

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,320
yeah for $20 you could get a per month you could get a hat and a

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,280
patch

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,200
It's unbelievable the bargains are unbelievable

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,680
What's the goal Justin the goal well Trav? Here's the goal, but the goal is for us to not be destitute and that

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,840
Is only achieved by you going to maximum fund or for size join five bucks ten bucks twenty bucks

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,200
Or if you want to kick it up two or three dollars, whatever will take anything you got give us your lunch money nerds

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
But here's the goal

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
20,000

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:33,400
New upgrading and boosting donors uh-huh right now as we record this it is three thousand six hundred eighty three

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,960
So it's a little ways to go just shy

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,640
We've got a little ways to go and the worst part is if we don't make it Griffin Mackerel will be cuckolded

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:49,280
By lightning McQueen racing legend lightning McLean I should I ask Rachel before we commit to this bit

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Oh, yeah

40
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,920
Well, I'll take a shooter attacks right here attacks and see like because this is obviously be

41
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,300
Her discretion right lightning McQueen is nothing if not a gentleman and by gentlemen, I mean gentle car

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
But I can't imagine anyone

43
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,800
Not being down the clown when I think legend lightning McQueen yeah when I talk to him. He's like

44
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,360
You know the real nitrous in my tank is consent. Yeah, and he loves it. Yeah

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,800
It's wild for this enthusiastic consent to he's very clear on that

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,680
Hey, how do you feel about lightning McQueen and then I should add like this is for the this is for the show

47
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,720
So she doesn't get confused. This is for should you add like a brackets sexually in brackets?

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,640
Or do you think you're just gonna get hey, how do you feel about lightning McQueen's?

49
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
Sexually well that seems like I'm sort of like

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,140
Forcing the issue a little bit like yeah

51
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,700
Yeah, cuz also I'll say like how do you feel about lightning McQueen and if she's like sexually good, then I'm yeah, yeah

52
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,820
That'll be nothing more need be said

53
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,100
Normally our show is just like this

54
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,640
Yeah, three brothers talking a bunch of nonsense and it's for you and we don't have to do it

55
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,780
I mean there it is. I should clarify. He's the red car from I think she would know that

56
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,120
She knows it. You have a young boy in your home. We're not we're not a we're not a fucking cars fan

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,660
That's right. Really. That was a geek check. I don't want any cars people. You gotta get that shit together my man

58
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,780
It's a great movie. It's not the second one so much. Oh

59
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,900
Man, but wouldn't you rather be cuckolded by lightning McQueen than tow Mater? You know what I mean? Yeah

60
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,220
Now if it was the Hudson sexiness of a cars if it was Hudson Hornet I fucking get it man

61
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,740
Okay

62
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,540
Rachel says he's not for me in two senses. Okay, so we have we have currently

63
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,340
Hi

64
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,460
It's Jesse Thorne here. I regret to inform you

65
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,700
I've discontinued the promotion in which if we don't meet our goal griffin back where we will be cuckolded by lightning McQueen

66
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,580
unfortunately

67
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,940
That is not gonna come out

68
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:08,380
Should I ask if there's another character in cars that she is is there any of the Pixar canon but non-human car from cars? That is good for you

69
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,140
What about the dinosaur from Toy Story?

70
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,720
Or the text from Toy Story. I don't know why I'm the one sort of jumping on this grenade

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,820
So there's a lot of really amazing marital aims in this

72
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:28,980
And what Griffin it would be weird if I was asking your wife if she would have sex with lightning McQueen. Come on. Yeah, think about it

73
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,800
Okay, she says the dino is definitely for me so that they're now there are stakes

74
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,600
Okay, can I read you guys some names of characters in cars? I would love nothing more

75
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,260
Strip weathers. Nice. She kicks. That's a good one. Finn Mcmissile

76
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,820
Finn missile Finn Mcmissile

77
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,740
I love that. That's surreal. That's cool. Miles Axelrod. Yeah. Hell yeah

78
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,300
Let's see text Dinoco. I can't believe we all had two chances to name human beings

79
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,720
I know we we beefed it so hard and we didn't go with Corey Turbowitz. Yeah

80
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,140
If I had had a boy it was gonna be text Dinoco

81
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,820
Bob Cutlass, that's a good one. Yeah, that's a good one. Oh my god guys rod torque redline

82
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,180
I like that the most so far. It's really good Vladimir trunk golf. Yeah

83
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,540
How did that happen?

84
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,740
Well, that's gotta be the second one. That's gotta be the second one with all the spy shit in it. Jay Kirby Gremlin

85
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,280
Yeah, that's gotta be another oh my god. There's one named Jeff Gorvette

86
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,460
Maximum fun.org slash join again is the name of it the

87
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,340
Way to go to rip clutch Gonski rip clutch Gonski, huh?

88
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,620
Brent Mustang burger

89
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,980
On your support now more than ever

90
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,740
And this is the this is the content. This is what you wipe out

91
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Wait one more game

92
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,500
punchy

93
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
punchy punchy

94
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
like PONCHY

95
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Yeah, Eugene

96
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,020
Carbooski, okay. All right, and and and we appreciate yes

97
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,300
I have a list of some of the recent people who have just joined up. We got Ernie Gearson

98
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Thank you, David Hobbs cap

99
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
This is wild cuz these still sound

100
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,380
Nigel Gearsley then to be fair this actually makes a lot of sense Griffin because we have been appealing to a very cars centric

101
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,100
Demographic for the last like ten minutes. That's true. So it makes sense that

102
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,720
This live feed of car of donors are also

103
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:52,060
Anthropomorphic cars. Yeah. Yeah, but they can't rely on the cars from cars to support the content that you love

104
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,540
That's only about 50% of our supporters. That's or like even if you like it, you still have to pay for it

105
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,820
I don't love the food I get at McDonald's, but I still have to pay for it. I mean

106
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:09,740
But bada bada bada they've gotten rid of a lot of my favorite fresh options like the Southwest salad and the chicken

107
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,380
Snack wrap. Oh, they got rid of the chicken snack wrap

108
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,420
They got rid of everything as part of a streamlining effort at the peak of the pandemic and they scaled back to a very

109
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,820
Sort of like button-down menu without a lot of the fresh options not wild about that. Not

110
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,140
Are they gonna bring it back? Oh, I don't know

111
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,540
am I gonna reopen a supply chain to hit Justin up with his snack wrap or make the

112
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,260
Southwest chicken salad that they may have called the Justin McElroy because I'm the only person that got the salad

113
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,940
I got that from time to time. It's pretty good. Honestly, not bad if you like a fresh option. Yeah, I do

114
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,940
This is an advice show obviously a fundraising effort. Hey, can we just be real for a second?

115
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,120
yeah, please go the link and and pledge some money, but it's

116
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,280
We just really need it would be really kick-ass really kick-ass

117
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,280
Thank you, and then let us on Twitter if you do so we can say thanks

118
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,140
At least one of us will I Griffin's, you know, kind of stepped away

119
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,600
He's really focusing on his family right now and his ministry. Yeah. Well, I've been working

120
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,300
I did get hired at focus on the family and thank you guys for

121
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,140
Announcing that here and I know some people are gonna be p.o'd about that and try to get me, you know

122
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,060
Uh, try to get me canceled, but please don't I thought it was focused features. You got hired at

123
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,940
Oh, I got no that was a short sort of thing and then they found out how just I don't like anything

124
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Secular in films. Yeah, okay

125
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,900
Yeah, and they are all about that life so it was a short-lived partnership

126
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,740
What do you what are you focusing on over and focus on the family Griffin daughters this month its daughter month

127
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,320
It's all daughter content all the time. Just McGee and me

128
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,700
Let's start time with daughters. Yeah. Well, that's when I showed thank you so much. No, this was the start

129
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,760
What this was the start this is the start you're there you're in it

130
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,860
I thought all that talk about Lightning McQueen betting Griffin's wife extramaritaly was all just for us

131
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,020
It's kind of intramaritaly because Griffin would be a willing cuckold in this situation

132
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:24,380
I would have to be because the because just he asked me to in the email. Can we please do lightning have a partner?

133
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:33,420
What does like you speed is his wife? Oh, okay, but not like another car named speed. No speed is his wife speed racer

134
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
No speed like speed

135
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,200
While on a walk around my apartment complex I and you guys ever taken a walk

136
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,080
I don't get out for a long time while out on a walk around my apartment complex

137
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,120
I ended up noticing I feel like if somebody says they're out on a walk

138
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,080
They're doing something that they didn't want to admit. You know, I mean like yeah

139
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,200
I I ended up noticing a securely wrapped perfectly fine

140
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,920
If not super melted package of Reese's chocolate on the floor next to a car and I walked what is Reese's?

141
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:14,120
Chocolate Reese's Reese's chocolate. It's kind of like Reese's Cup Reese's Cup guys Reese's Cup. I figured that

142
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,400
They don't just make a bar right? I'll make a chocolate. I mean

143
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,100
They make a chocolate. It's just not on the bar. I

144
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,500
Figured the chocolate must have fallen out of the car and the original owner hadn't noticed especially with it right next to the driver's seat door

145
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,800
Seeing as I had been complaining about a lack of chocolate

146
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,040
I

147
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
See where this is going now

148
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,160
Seeing as I have been complaining about a lack of chocolate two hours prior

149
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,520
I figured this is a sign from the gods to eat it, but my partner and best friend

150
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,880
Convinced me that eating mostly melted but securely packaged floor chocolate was not in fact the best idea I've ever had

151
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
My question is this brother

152
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,520
Yeah, I don't think we should go singing praises just yet

153
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,700
My question is this brother should I have eaten the floor chocolate or should I have taken it home to refridge and eat later?

154
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,180
Now that's from chocolate less Floridian. You have two options here that both in with

155
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,920
You eating the floor chocolate, right?

156
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,840
Well, it doesn't sorry that's the middle step in the journey that they will be going on

157
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,680
I don't think your friends the instep will be not just the emergency room

158
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,280
but one sort of bathroom in the emergency room complex that you are gonna you may as well bring a

159
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,920
Pillow and a good book. I mean, I would love it if it worked that way

160
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:41,000
But life isn't a fairly brothers comedy Griffin. The realistic answer is you'll eat the chocolate and it'll be fine. But

161
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,840
For the next few days after uh-huh in the back of your head

162
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Yeah, every little creaking pop every little squish and squeeze in your body that you feel every every pang every floating

163
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:01,460
Flash of light but in front of your eyes everything now, you're gonna wonder is this it is this

164
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:09,080
My time is this the chocolate? Why did I do it? I did. I know where stores is. Why did I do it?

165
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,200
Let's put the tiger on the table and yell at it for a second. Just okay 20 seconds

166
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,320
There's a lot of food waste and food insecurity both in our country and in the world

167
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,840
That's not what this is. That's not what this is. No, that's not what this is

168
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,700
What here's there's two other factors here that I think have to be considered one other people were with you

169
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,640
Right. So even if that chocolate is perfectly fine, even if you eat it nothing happens

170
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,840
Even if you eat it and you never think about it again

171
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,720
There were people who observed your behavior and maybe children maybe children

172
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,160
Maybe even children they saw you and let's take all context out of the back

173
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,560
They saw you pick something up off the ground and eat it

174
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,800
Yeah

175
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,000
With your only mouth with your only human mouth as far as I know

176
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,520
And you put it in your own human body and put it on you have and you don't know the origin

177
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
You do not know

178
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,500
You know where this began. You only know if we're talking in terms of like

179
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,860
An Antiques Roadshow, you don't know its provenance. You only know it's got a lot of patina on it and you ate it

180
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,720
And then you ate it. That's what they do on Antiques Roadshow, by the way, if you haven't watched it lately

181
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,440
They're doing a lot of just sort of eating the antiques

182
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,860
Oh, this this is a old quilt from the Revolutionary War era made by Martha

183
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Washington and hold on one second

184
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,380
Now it's nothing now it's energy it's cake house for Iran

185
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:38,820
And the second thing to consider here is I'm starting to wonder now if the generation after us maybe even two generations

186
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,580
I don't know how old we are

187
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:47,140
Are they also being like drilled into their heads that people might inject drugs into candy or was did that stop after us?

188
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,460
I think we were the last ones to get that

189
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,140
Yeah

190
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,020
I think everybody knows that we're just everybody else is kind of too busy to be injecting drugs into chocolate

191
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,260
So who's just giving away free drugs like that? Well

192
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Oh

193
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Okay, don't eat I

194
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,020
Feel like we can cut most of these quite kinds of questions off at the pass. Don't eat for chocolate

195
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,580
I know that times are tough out there and like Travis said the big thing about food waste and I know all about that

196
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,820
But and care and care care about care about it, but you can you can probably get chocolate

197
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,820
That has been ethically sourced

198
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,540
Do you know what I mean? That's not going to hurt you and your body

199
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:38,700
You know because in the capitalist system we find ourselves in here you exchange your healthy body minutes for

200
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,500
What I call chocolate dollars, which is money that you spend to get your own chocolate

201
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,620
And if you hurt just regular dollars, sorry just dollars and if you hurt that body hurt that body

202
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,900
Make sure that you don't hurt that body by eating chocolate you found on a floor

203
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,380
Then you won't you will be too ill to earn more choco bucks, which is what you call chocolate dollars

204
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,180
No, it also occurs to me reading the question again that in your supposition

205
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,700
You found the chocolate and you were you decided this chocolate came from this car. It was next to

206
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,020
So I could easily place this chocolate somewhere where the driver of the car could discover it once more

207
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,900
But since the driver didn't know

208
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:26,300
Ah finders keepers to high heavens. Do not eat this fucking chocolate. They already ate the chocolate didn't they?

209
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,180
They ate the chocolate already. I do appreciate I do think that there is it's a little bit of security theater

210
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,780
But the idea of like well, no, you don't understand. I put it in the refrigerator and solided it back up again

211
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,720
So it's better now. It's safer now

212
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,560
It was melty before and that would have been bad, but I put it in the fridge

213
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,180
So I got cold so any germs on it got too cold

214
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Don't eat the chocolate and

215
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,140
Do you all want to approach the wizard and ask him about his day?

216
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,860
Yeah, I'll give us some cool advice on how to do a great thing

217
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,300
Which is to say how to host a warrior cats theme birthday party. Are you kidding me?

218
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, serious so many people have sent this in over the months and I feel like I've been saving it for a special occasion

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
maximum fun dot org slash joint

220
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,280
Preparing make sure your parents agree

221
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,140
I don't necessarily have to tell your parents the theme of the party slash sleepover

222
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,840
But you still need to make sure you can have one in the first place. This feels duplicitous to me

223
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah

224
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,520
Because if yeah if if one of my beautiful boys comes to me and says I want to have a sleepover and I'm like, yeah

225
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,560
Sure, whatever and then I come in and there's big balls of yarn and everyone's got tails and they're fucking

226
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
fighting and there's

227
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,040
desiccated birds

228
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Yeah, I'm gonna be

229
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
confused and probably upset

230
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,000
and also just side note if my

231
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,680
If one of my beautiful children came to me and said I want to have a sleepover and I said what's okay

232
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,640
What's the theme and they said no theme I would also be disappointed. That's true, right?

233
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,760
It's gotta have everything you're gonna throw away that chance to have a themed party of any sort. Really? Yeah

234
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
one time at the Minskers

235
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:17,400
Basement we had a slumber party that ended they just kind of turned out to be an Austin Powers themed sleepover

236
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,680
like it wasn't that was not the intention, but then we all showed up and

237
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,040
We were all just sort of like in the headspace of thinking about and talking about Austin Powers a lot

238
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,640
And then we watched Austin Powers and it was just like oh, it's we are

239
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:37,360
We are accidentally having an Austin Powers themed sleepover party and it was one of the best ones that I've it was one of the best

240
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,480
Austin Powers sleepover parties. I think I've had and Griffin didn't make you horny, baby. No

241
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,160
Start planning early. Even if you plan extremely early when not when not anyone is even thinking about your birthday coming up

242
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,960
This is good. You will have more time to think about what you really want to do

243
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,680
But you can't I I'm of the opinion you start planning too early. Yeah

244
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,620
To invite a couple people to the party see if they like the idea of having a warrior cats theme

245
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,100
Oh, they won't they probably won't and then what kicking around a few different ideas

246
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:16,740
if I could run past you kind of like having a clown or I don't know I thought about kicking everybody in

247
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:23,860
The ass when they showed up. Yeah, or maybe warrior cats one of those definitely one of those you it's got to be

248
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,360
Got you gotta switch those steps around right? You gotta ask people before you plan it, right?

249
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,560
Otherwise, you're gonna get so far down the pathway. This is the first step in planning it

250
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,520
This is the charts. I haven't begun to plan. We're just kind of blue sky and see if they would come

251
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,880
Yeah, okay. So also this is more of like I'm just I'm just floating this idea

252
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,400
Like this isn't necessarily an invite or a plan few different options. Just kicking them around if I did

253
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,640
What would you say also step one keep your grades up keep those grades up or your parents?

254
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,840
Will not let you dress up like kitty cats in a fight and desiccated bird

255
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,640
No way decorate before your guests arrive decorate your houses with post your houses

256
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,880
This is a this is we're having a progressive for your kids party. Nice

257
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,680
Yeah, we go from one house to another to sort of represent the different phases in a kitty cat's life. It's a crawl

258
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,400
It's a kitty cat crawl. It's a kitty cat crawl. Happy birthday to me. It's a kitty cat crawl

259
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,280
Yeah, I need you to drive me and my other kitty cats over to Doug's house for the starters

260
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,780
No, they're dry. Their dad says we can drink wild roses

261
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,620
Okay, decorate your houses with posters paw prints or anything else that will complement the theme if you have party games

262
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Make sure anything you need for those games is ready

263
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,280
spider web how is that specific to a warrior's cat is

264
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,680
Preparation a big part of the Warriors cat ethos

265
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,380
Well, Justin you think a warrior cat just like wakes up one day and like I'm a fucking warrior cat now

266
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,340
No, that takes it takes a lot of work make each room a den

267
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:03,240
So you have sort of different home bases for the Warriors den make small nests of green spider web or three pillows to make a sleeping

268
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,980
Area when there's the leaders den for this you should choose the largest least occupied room

269
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,160
The couch can be your bed cover with the spider webs or pillows

270
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:18,560
Cover the floors in colored blankets or brown to give it that dirt and sand effect cover your cover your floors in brown

271
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,640
Why why spider web such a prevalent theme here? Is that a big thing and warrior cats or cats just love?

272
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,100
Have you been in the kind of woods that?

273
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,020
Feral cats make their battlegrounds trash not for a long time very

274
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
spooky and haunted and spiders

275
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,920
You will need an apprentice tin. I like the idea of you having a den

276
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,680
That's yours. So people show up and you're like fucking draped across your your

277
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,120
Shays lounge like bear. Oh, you've brought me a what is this a nerf gun?

278
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Excellent put it on the pile

279
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,760
Perfect choice. Oh, I would have preferred a saucy of milk

280
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,040
Uh, there's other dens here, but Justin skipped ahead

281
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,080
So I may as well join him in the future which is to say make the high rock

282
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,800
Use multiple pillows stacked or use a chair or couch let the other cats sit below you on pillows or just spread out

283
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,440
Oh, I'm sorry. What if I don't want to be

284
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,340
The kitty cat who sits on the high rock at my own birthday party

285
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,120
Well, I think that says a lot about you Griffin, but I also understand it cuz heavy is you know heavy head. Yeah, sure

286
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,800
Joshua I don't care if it's fucking Plymouth Rock put the couch cushions

287
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,840
I'm gonna make your friends go home. I don't care if it is your birthday. Those are the guest room pillows

288
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,160
Use your pillows. What do you mean? Your pillows are the spiderwebs? Oh

289
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:55,080
God Timothy's pissing everywhere and not for the normal reason. So can you please ask him to stop?

290
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,520
I don't think the theme was Space Jam. I look like an idiot. I mean basketball themed treats. I'm here in a jersey

291
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,040
I invited somebody who's like dressed up as bugs and I'm feeling like a fucking idiot and then some of your friends fucking

292
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,260
Obliterated him cut him cut him wide open to our house guts put him on the fresh kill spot

293
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,080
Which is the next step in the wikiHow article in the middle of camp place a cardboard piece that is cut out like a stump

294
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,760
And decorated and when it comes to hunting the cats can put their fresh kill or stuffed animals on the stump

295
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
This

296
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,280
Sounds fun. I would that part got me that parts that part sounds good. I like that that this is my fresh kill

297
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,800
It's a Mickey Mouse that teaches you the ABC

298
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,820
It does it did skew a little bit Lord of the Flies there if I was a parent president this thing like oh

299
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Wait, what is it? Huh?

300
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,200
Next oh, we're in the we're in the games section now

301
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,520
Welcome each guest maybe with a dip of your head or a whisper of welcome to the home of the clans

302
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,440
Probably not that one

303

Sniffle whiskers has committed the gravest sin and shall be banished to the Space Jam annex

312
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,560

313
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Yeah, there's a pretty good fucking idea. Yeah

314
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Everyone could be one RP character roleplay and one real warrior. What the fuck does that mean?

315
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,280
If you're sure showed Joshua showed up as Sylvester, he can walk between planes

324
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,980
Why do you have to like put a number cuz that's not a hunt Griffin. That's that's fetching and cats don't fetch

325
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,360

Yeah, there's spells so that each one gets magic spells. They're different colors

331
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,200

338
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,160
We're not playing the game anymore Derek. We're out of the game for a second Derek

339
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,720
If you actually would go over to the space jam party, I feel like it would really

340
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:20,400
Derek I do notice that you did hide Timothy's inhaler out in the quote-unquote forest and we do need you to tell us where that is

391
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,480
For for well for all of us of me and Rachel. I had a baby this year and it's been

392
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Thanks. Yeah, I was waiting for any kind of acknowledgement

393
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,160
I thought you already had a baby. We yeah, we did it. We doubled down and

394
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,240
Too it's been it has been if I may get serious a little bit

395
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,560
difficult we have had

396
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,320
pretty inconsistent childcare between sort of

397
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,660
nannies, you know getting sick and

398
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:48,020
Daycares sort of closing basically every other week and the only reason why we have been able to sort of stay consistent is because we hired

399
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,600
an editor last year Rachel Jacobs who's been doing an incredible job and

400
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,720
All all of that is possible because of the support that we receive from from you all in the max fun drive

404
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:28,000
stress a whole bunch about that balance because we have hired people that have helped us out using the money that you have

405
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,240
Given us in past drives. So it's it is a very meaningful thing to us professionally personally

406
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,900

00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,500
We've got videos. We've got clips of live shows. We've got

426
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,980
There's videos where we riff over old movies

427
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:29,340
Yes, there's visual movies there's a demo of a song that Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote for us

428
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:36,140
there's commentary on five now of the Bim Bam TV show episodes with us and

429
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:42,820
episodes that our wives recorded together there's a griffins vor podcast that he recorded one episode of

430
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,180
There's a video home movies of us. There's our

431
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,220
absolute debacle of a

432
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,220
Show in Detroit about Star Wars that I actually did not realize had been

433
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,020
uploaded and I'm now not as enthused about people going to

434
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,220
Enjoy this there's last year. We did an episode called Pranky Doodle Dandy. Was that last year?

435
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
Fuck that was good. Yeah

436
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,740
No, no, no Pranky Doodle Dandy was 2020 freaky fun day freaky fun day. We switched all the bits around

437
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,660
That's right. And then this yes this year we developed the next great McElroy

438
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:25,900
Creative project and god damn it. Joel was on board. You gotta listen folks. You gotta get it. You gotta yeah

439
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,980
It's horrifying and incriminating. Did we announce the other thing that we recorded or is that secret stuff?

440
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,080
You know what? I think by this point, hopefully by this point we've hit it though

441
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:41,180
We recorded we took the transcript from an episode and then assigned the part we switched brothers

442
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:47,300
And yes, it's a remix. Yeah, it's a remix. Yeah, and so like I think I did Griffin Griffin did me

443
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:54,580
I think Justin was me. I was no I Griff Travis was Griffin and I know you were Travis

444
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,900
I was Griffin and Travis was me and we like did it it was

445
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,900
It was the dumbest silliest things. I was in a fugue state for most of it

446
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,180
It was genuine by the end. I was crying laughing and just crying

447
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,620
I was like whacked out on cold medicine when we first read it

448
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:20,300
And so hearing Justin sort of try to capture that in his performance was a true delight

449
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,420
I mean, you'll only hear that one if we hit the goal to release it and to you if you are max fun supporter

00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,660
I actually am mad now that it's been out a couple days the adventure zone one where we

453
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:46,340
Turned classic board games into an RPG and it hasn't taken the world by storm yet. So it'll get there. It'll get there. Okay

454
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:54,460
Uh, please maximum fun org slash join. Let's let's do another question while they go to that link and do all their stuff

455
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,060
Okay. Sorry. I've moved away from the well, I was thinking maybe we could have some interactive fun

456
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,820
And everybody could join in and play along at home. No

457
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
You're done with this one like

458
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,140
Here's here's the thing that I thought about cuz on on last week's

459
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,640
A wonderful. Yeah, Griffin and Rachel talked about me and how great I am

460
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,220
And I was like, that's really nice

461
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:24,700
And so I thought we could play a little play along home where I asked you trivia questions specifically about me

462
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:31,780
Right see how well you two and the audience at home know me. Do you think they'll like that?

463
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,780
I think I will

464
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,140
Right, but you're one and they are many. Yeah, I'm like one third of the host

465
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,980
So at least 33% of the hosts are on board with it when you think that way

466
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,220
Well, we know you pretty good. So let's get through this about as fast as we can

467
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,620
Okay, what is Travis McElroy's favorite dessert?

468
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,540
cheesecake

469
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,980
That's very good Griffin that was right off the bat. Yeah, I don't need it. I don't cheesecake. Sorry

470
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:05,460
There's two points for each. I don't think that Justin should get points because he's

471
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,980
Like I don't like Griffin it was clearly I like okay

472
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,180
Should we start? Well, should we restart the call to try to get this lag fix because maybe we should do a count again

473
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,660
Just see how bad the lag is. Okay, so juice go ahead

474
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,100
I don't think we need to know go ahead and just do the count so we can tell that the lag is good

475
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,020
One

476
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Two yeah, that's pretty bad

477
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,300
Yeah, I told you juice you responded to what I said just then really fast so quickly

478
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,220
That was really maybe he was just ready to say it. Okay, what size shoe does Travis wasn't that fast?

479
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,220
What size shoe does Travis wear ten and a half?

480
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,580
I'm gonna say eleven to twelve. Come on guys. I got it. I got it. That's a big boy

481
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,260
I'm very stable point prices. Why no, it's exact or nothing

482
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:01,820
You how comes how comes how comes I'm like a little bit taller than you but your feets is I were a 9.5

483
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:07,340
I've got petite feet. Well, do you notice how you fall over a lot when there's like we see feeling up TV?

484
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,100
What are you rocking with juice?

485
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,460
What do you rock? What do you rock? I'm the 10. I'm the so

486
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,700
This is I'm usually a ten and a half, but if it's a narrow shoe, I gotta go up to 11

487
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,020
Wide Fred Flintstone. I do that's for me. That's for me

488
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,300
It's a 13 like cowboy boots something what's 12 and a half guys roller skates 12 and a half

489
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,580
So we all have pretty we we've all got I've got sort of a chode foot. Yeah

490
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,340
Christian band by the way from the from the mid-ops

491
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:45,420
Hello lost Crucis we are chode foot. Let's get ready to worship Jesus Christ

492
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,660
Why did you give switchfoot a sort of cockney?

493
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,380
Draught there, you know, they love that. So

494
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,300
That wasn't switchfoot. Griffin was chode foot. It was chode foot. It's a different thing completely different. Yeah, sure

495
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:06,020
Okay, one last one. How many tattoos just Travis have and Christ for a bonus point? Which one was his first?

496
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,380
Okay, I know the first one was the family

497
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,700
So crusty and fucked up and did you ever get that fixed or I did get it fixed

498
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,820
Okay, cuz that was a fixture lasered off. No, I got it. I got it redone

499
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,100
There are lots of hidden Justin's in there. It's like a hidden Mickey

500
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,500
Little hidden Justin and all the curlicues. That's fun. It's like a puzzle, but I'm gonna get a hidden Mickey tattoo

501
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,540
Okay, good. Don't tell me yeah good

502
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
I'm gonna say I'm gonna

503
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
I'm gonna say

504
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,460
Here's what I'll say. I'm gonna say eight

505
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,860
I'm gonna name the ones I can think of

506
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,460
there's

507
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,820
Haram, there's Nessie. There's a pineapple

508
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,820
There's a family crest

509
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,300
There's the all you can do is all you can do do. Yeah, there's five

510
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:01,460
There's the Triforce. Yes. Yeah, six. We all got that one. That should've been easier to remember. Yeah, it was

511
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,620
Are we forgetting? Oh, yeah, so I got that all you can do is all you can do the pineapple

512
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:12,900
I have the microphone with flowers. I have the wine glasses cheersing with flowers

513
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:19,340
I have the d20 that's all 20s that says I do that. I have the sheriff's star that says, you know morons

514
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,860
I have a lot of tattoos. You have two blazing saddle. Correct. I have the Triforce

515
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:32,020
I have the family crest and I have the Haram. So how many is that? One, two, three, four, five six

516
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,620
seven eight

517
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,220
Nine ten eleven. I got it perfectly. Eleven. I actually said eleven

518
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:44,700
Okay, then you got it Griffin wins, I guess how are you how are you guys not more impressed by that?

519
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,020
I guess the number of tattoos on my brother's beautiful body

520
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,420
I also would have accepted twelve because I had the one on my back redone. I would have accepted twelve

521
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,340
Okay, but it is exactly eleven, which is you win

522
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,980
I know your beautiful body so good, but not this feet the feet are a little bit. I try not to look at your feet

523
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,420
Yeah, I get that. They're so large. I got you this best brother trophy Griffin. All right

524
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,900
I also got you a best brother because you're both the best brothers

525
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,340
Participation trophy thanks for our first actually. Yeah

526
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,460
Participation trophies, huh?

527
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:24,380
Made ahead of time. How did we not talk about Jeff Foxworthy making a participation trophy joke in 2022 in his new net?

528
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,020
Yeah, they really there's a thing that went it did go viral online because it was Netflix is a joke

529
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,700
Which I guess is they're like comedy thing. They tweeted out

530
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:41,420
Clip or some screenshots with captions of Jeff Foxworthy's new special where he said, you know

531
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,240
It's funny back in my day. If you wanted a trophy when you're competing you had to win

532
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,060
That's the good shit right there baby, it's not even like

533
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:02,980
Like that observation itself is a decade. Yeah, so choice. There's a guy

534
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,740
so there's a Geico commercial on the air right now where that fucking

535
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:14,700
Slippery sexy gecko is talking to a woman at a diner and she's like I'm an introvert and he's like yeah

536
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:21,380
Lots of people are introverts. She's like no, I'm a very I'm an introvert and that's very special and I'm over here

537
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,220
I laugh so hard. I shit my pants. Yeah

538
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,820
because it's like a Griffin who is normally an extra became

539
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,580
Because it's like we're all busting up about how lots of people say they're introverts over. Oh, I did it again guys

540
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:44,680
I didn't even have to laugh this time the Geico gecko made this shit come out with his awesome awesome introvert jokes

541
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,180
Also

542
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:53,220
Jeff also he's getting to a point now where I don't know that I trust that he's never gone a participation trophy

543
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,820
He got a Netflix special in 2022

544
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,580
That's your

545
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,660
Around long enough. Yeah, you're still participating in life

546
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:09,140
And so you have a Netflix we came back around we gave everyone else who was kind of problematic and bad a Netflix special

547
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,180
So now we come back to you. Can you step up your problematic badness? So maybe I don't

548
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,820
Don't think anybody's even gonna want to put in the legwork

549
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:23,140
To do that to Jeff Foxworthy. It's like bigger and better. You know what I mean? Like he doesn't

550
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,780
What do you accomplish?

551
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:32,500
By by smashing Jeff Foxworthy like that by smashing him good. I don't I don't if you're a Jeff Foxworthy

552
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,980
You might be irrelevant. Is that anything?

553
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,980
I don't want to die

554
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,980
He might be the one to give us our big break

555
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:51,060
You guys ever think about that maybe he goes around also like if you look at how far we are from 20,000 new and upgrading donors

556
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,540
Like I feel a little Foxworthy myself

557
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,060
Maybe maybe we shouldn't peak not yes the EB peak. That's fair

558
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,060
Okay, I have an alternate joke then how about this is like okay sure and out

559
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,580
Participation trophies. He only gives them to people who are Foxworthy. Is that anything? I don't know

560
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:20,100
It could be something we it needs about it needs about a good month worth of punch-up in the writers room

561
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:27,660
But it's it's there's a seed there that I is. Oh, yeah, it's germinating. We've done one question

562
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,860
Really? Yeah, let's do it. Is that right? Let's do a second question

563
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,900
Okay

564
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,460
Here comes the second question every day. I take a walk around my neighborhood

565
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,140
Another what I mean another was weird

566
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,140
Yeah, you know what it is

567
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,660
Temperatures going on. Yeah, there is you want to get out there get your day a few

568
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,540
Be careful that terminology there my dude. Yeah, you heard it, right?

569
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:58,380
You're or is for our friends across your vitamin. There is your vitamin dick a

570
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,740
Few days ago. I noticed a plastic Easter egg in my neighbor's grass

571
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,500
It seems to have been missed during the Easter egg hunt is now six days past Easter

572
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,020
At what point does it become okay for me to take it?

573
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,180
It looks like there's something inside and I want it really bad this from hiding from the bunny in Dallas

574
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,820
Is this another I did more handy person? This was not on trying to eat some ground

575
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:24,600
I didn't organize these that way you're on purpose. Okay, listen, but at this year I did put

576
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,920
Lego ninjas in the Easter eggs. Yeah, and by I I mean

577
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,420
The bunny did it the bunny at my mother-in-law's house put 62 cents

578
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,620
For grandkids for eggs each one had 62 cents in it when I said hey

579
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,900
Why is there 62 cents in this egg?

580
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:48,140
She said that's the amount of change I had that would evenly break up before four kids and I said Becky next time just two

581
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,600
Quarters my kid doesn't need the taxes

582
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,980
That is an absolutely

583
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:59,780
Bonkers thing that I asked BB the other day if she was gonna get a job when she grew up and she said I don't

584
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,060
Have to I already got money in my bank because she has about two inches worth

585
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,660
In a like one of those big clear coke bottle bank about two inches worth of loose change and as far as she is concerned

586
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,160
She is set for life. So yeah, two quarters probably would have accomplished the like I got money feeling

587
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:21,140
Is it all from Becky all from Becky are they all Becky bucks just like I get changed and I'm like

588
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,380
I don't want to put this in my point here. This is your allowance or whatever

589
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,220
I did I do that

590
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:31,700
I'm very cavalier with with like change that I get and I put it in the girls piggy bank and then

591
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:37,540
Inevitably, I'm like going to the car wash or something like oh fuck. Hey guys, I'm sorry

592
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,020
One day my daughter will catch me in bed

593
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,940
Dad I called the police on you I saw that you took two dollars and fifty cents

594
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,940
I think I had to I had to put air in the tires. Oh, yeah, tell it to the judge dad

595
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:58,540
I think that this is a failing on the parents part or whoever has hidden these eggs

596
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:03,480
Yes, you gotta take pictures on your phone every time you hide an egg. So that's a very least

597
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:10,660
Account you need to know how much now that does get difficult to do when you're like the Easter Bunny told me

598
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:16,980
He hid 32 eggs and we only got 31. So the Easter Bunny said so so hey, did you look over there?

599
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,100
I got a strong feeling the Easter Bunny might have hid one

600
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,420
But it is human nature to see a little what is essentially a treasure chest

601
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:31,260
Oh, yeah, and want to know what's inside of it because maybe it is floor candy. Maybe it is for to grass chocolate and

602
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:38,860
By which I mean a new cool futuristic house for ants. Yeah that they live in like whoa, this is so modern

603
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,620
What is this Philip? I love it. It's so an egg for ants. Oh, that's

604
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,260
What if it's a real always get my if it's a real Easter egg, oh

605
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:57,240
Oh, and it like starts you on a whimsical journey through the fantastical where you partner up with the Easter money

606
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,680
Like that's the thing is like this is if we approach more things with the wonderment and trust of a child

607
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:06,280
We would go on more adventures because think about how many times you've seen something you're like

608
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,940
I should pick that and you're like, ah, that's garbage and most of the time it probably is but moves a magical ring

609
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,940
That would start you on a fantastical journey of love and acceptance like an Easter egg like a secret in a movie or a game

610
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,620
Oh, it might be that to click on it. It's like how in the second Sonic the Hedgehog movie

611
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,440
You there's like one scene where they're playing basketball and you can see

612
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,340
dr. Eggman's balls

613
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:36,820
Really and it but it's like a secret just for true fans just for true believers just for true believers in it

614
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,260
Hey question asker

615
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:44,580
Are you maybe telling a little tale on yourself when you say there seems like there's something inside you definitely picked it up and shook

616
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,660
It right you weren't you weren't clocking from a distant

617
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:53,040
You weren't using your x-ray vision on the egg hold and like you held it up to the light at the very least, right?

618
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:59,500
Yeah, maybe they saw the wind blow it and it didn't move. So they just assumed like it's got some sort of

619
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,460
Lego ninja or something inside of it

620
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:08,420
Gee, have you guys seen the Easter bunny that they had up to the White House? No, was it a bad boy?

621
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:12,520
Was it a bad one? This is my this is my fear. I'm gonna drop the picture now. I'm talking

622
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,500
This is my theory is that there is no oh man

623
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:23,940
Try to find a picture of the Easter bunny that does not bother you that is is non not a problem at all

624
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,300
And it can't be done. That's not it

625
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,700
That's not it. This was not it. This is it looks like a fucking

626
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,340
Furry fan movie about the government. This is literally which by the way, I would watch the full

627
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:45,540
God, yes, please. It is a person in a white bunny costume with a purple dress wearing a gigantic

628
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,260
Mass and all standing at Jim Pulaski's podium

629
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:57,420
At the white and strangely it looks like a crepe paper valentine on their chest. It's horrific. This is a terrible bunny

630
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,220
They're all bad expression on their face is one of

631
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:07,740
Absolute shock. Oh, I would have said condescension, but okay. No, I mean this is clearly clearly

632
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,700
Dr. Jill Biden has said something here that is

633
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:19,220
Unprecedented and these bunnies are not loving it. And also why are these bunnies wearing so much eyeshadow that now that's from 21

634
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,980
Can you imagine if that bunny was at the podium when?

635
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,780
Some like very serious news came out and they're like, I'm just being handed this. Hold on

636
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,220
Now I actually just give I like this second bunny more

637
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,940
But not a lot not a lot but more

638
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,940
a

639
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,460
Listener they're like community theater tricks. Like you cannot find a good Easter by that makes you feel good

640
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:47,740
This is your bunny does look like a character designed from a rankin bass, right? The first one is

641
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:55,020
Complex in in my feelings about that one, but the second one that's definitely being voiced by like a Joel Gray

642
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:00,220
To tell me about the miracle of Easter and when Jesus came and gave us eggs

643
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:05,660
We're at the mall. I asked Cooper if she wanted to get her picture taken with Easter Bunny and she said no, I

644
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:11,420
Want him to be gone. That's god. That's good. Yes, that's accurate. Yes, correct way better

645
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,300
Yes, what happened to me, which is my daughter wanted a picture with these running

646
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:21,980
I was like, okay and she walked over and then she said you too daddy and I can't say no, so I had to

647
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:29,160
Get my picture taken with this Easter Bunny and at that point like I know and the Easter Bunny knows and we're both there

648
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Doing this that it was a lie

649
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,720
There was a lot of

650
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,160
Sorry that I just say real quick the flowers in this White House picture are kind of sad

651
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,940
That second one they're they're not well

652
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
They're very droopy

653
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:56,480
I want a month quad. Holy shit. Some fun org join. I want a munch

654
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,320
Looks like the Easter Bunny is like one of the cabinet members and isn't

655
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,720
They are droopy right? Thank you

656
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,040
They're really true. This is weird. They're droopy. It doesn't matter

657
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,140
This is a maybe they were taller and then you couldn't see and so they just smushed them down

658
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:21,020
Maybe KFC is offering fried chicken bouquets for Mother's Day

659
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,020

660
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,660

677
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:07,300
All right, I you know what I this is no secret. I love I love fried chicken. It's one of my favorite foods

678
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:12,980
Not my favorite, but one of my favorites, but you know, I've always thought that it was missing a certain rose

679
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:18,940
Flour and a leaf rubbed against it quality. Yeah that I think will really heighten it

680
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,980
Oh this chicken tastes good, but it doesn't taste enough like it's been rubbed on

681
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:28,020
Uncooked plants has it been close to plants and on them. Yeah getting some of the flavor dust

Do I have to pull this out of a glass container?

Myself and do it like some kind of I don't know weird monster

Are you asking me? Yes

685
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:48,220
Okay, this is where I love these because I feel like if you're writing one of these maybe you get to a point where like I

686
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:53,300
Can't just be that this is what I'm supposed to be doing all day today is writing this press release

687
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,300
I can't I mean I've covered everything

688
00:56:55,300 --> 00:57:00,760
What else can I write? Let's see. Um pair the size lover's meal with a Kentucky fried

00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,320
But a kit for a DIY arrangement that you can make for mom with the food

695
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,920
Okay, don't tell me what kind of chicken then it's like certainly that's long enough. No, you're gonna have one more paragraph. Okay, boss

696
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,280
Why bouquet you might ask well like any iconic duo?

697
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,760
Kravitz, Bennifer, Brangelina, etc. What was the first one? Am I in that one?

698
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,800
Kravitz? Is that me? Is that is that Kendall Jenner and Travis?

699
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,360
Some something? I think it's me and Zoe Kravitz, but I'm confused. Okay Kravitz, Brennifer. Zoe Kravitz and I broke up.

700
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,360
Janderson

701
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:15,540
Brennifer is breakfast Jennifer Aniston. Waste to be fair is my favorite couple.

702
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:24,500
Miss Aniston, can I come in? Not right now. I'm having Brennifer. That's what I call it. Have you ever seen Jennifer Aniston and breakfast together? Fucking happy.

703
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:33,360
I've actually never seen them in the same room. Oh, maybe they're the same person. Yeah, I'm just saying Jennifer Aniston is breakfast.

704
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:40,440
Hey ladies, let's go get some mimosa at Brunchifer. That's what I call it when I have brunch. Okay, Miss Aniston.

705
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,640
So like any iconic duo you combine the two icons in this case

706
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,040
Bucket and Bouquet and get Bouquet. They literally have a paragraph

707
00:58:53,160 --> 00:59:00,280
Explaining they're broken down busted little bit of needleages. Hey, here's how a portanto works buckle up

708
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,560
Yeah, anyway, if you aren't already in fucking stitches, let's break it down

709
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:12,200
Now do you guys we got if two famous Jennifer's started dating each other that like tabloids would just explode?

710
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,840
Or do you think they would just like this is Jennifer Jennifer or?

711
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,780
Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer of her

712
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:26,360
Jennifer Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lopez together today and our brains exploded

713
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,480
Nick Chavez the CMO for KFC

714
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,800
the

715
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,720
Sorry, his title is CMO KFC US a

716
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,560
Regular bouquet of flowers is a good gift for mom

717
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,760
Okay, but a sides lovers meal and Kentucky fried bouquet is a finger-licking

718
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:50,200
Good way to take Mother's Day from a 10 to 11 one of the worst sentences. I've ever read my how was your mother's day?

719
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,400
Oh, it's great. Honey. Was it finger-licking? Yeah

720
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:59,720
Mom, tell me the honest truth was a finger-licking Nick continues with three sides four

721
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,280
Buttery biscuits and the unforgettable truly fried chicken and flour table decoration

722
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:12,840
Everybody is sure to get something they like to eat and mom is sure to smile for the mom who only has one partner and two

723
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,560
kids

724
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,560
the perfect choice

725
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,640
since

726
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:23,100
1952 KFC has been bringing families together for Mother's Day with a bucket of its world famous fried chicken

727
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,080
KFC sells nearly four hundred

728
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:34,120
Thousand buckets of fried chicken. So my chicken really making it one of the best sales days of the can't just be us alone

729
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,560
No, right

730
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,240
Well, I don't know. Yeah, it's gotta be international

731
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,360
But Mother's Day is just a US holidays. Yeah, but I'm saying other places still you they don't they don't say

732
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,600
Well, it's Mother's Day. No fried chicken today. Don't want to add to the numbers. Yeah, sure

733
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,560
I asked my I asked my Japanese tutor if he was getting KFC for

734
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:01,840
Christmas because that's a big tradition in Japan is getting your bucket of KFC for Christmas and he said oh no

735
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,640
It's a sad chicken

736
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,000
It's not wrong, maybe it's better over there we don't know

737
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,280
But anyway, you can do that. That's now remember you gotta wait till the first. Is it the first now?

738
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,280
Uh, no one knows

739
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:25,960
It doesn't matter. I can't remember but like you got to do on the app to get your sides lovers meal

740
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,280
And I guess they'll ship you the flowers. I can't imagine how this works

741
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,520
I'm sure that there's a helpful person in app to walk you through it with no confusion

742
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,280
Yes, and I'm sure if you go to any KFC in the country and tell them

743
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:46,080
They get drippy and he's like I see you're trying to order from KFC. Can I help? It's me drippy

744
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,040
the sentient gravy drip

745
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,400
That's a great character that I don't like I've been talking about this for too long but drippy is actually pretty yes

746
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:02,240
Well, I'd like to make an appointment the genius part. Yeah, what seems to be a problem? I can't get drippy off my phone now

747
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:10,360
I'm on your finger. Yeah, I see you're trying to take a snap for your friend
