1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:52,320
Live from Coachella, it's Hologram. My brother, my brother, and me, we're made of light 2012.

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,960
That's the name of the tour, but also we are holograms. Hello everyone, beep boop bop boop.

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,560
Beep. I've secretly been a hologram this entire time. You are made of light,

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,080
and as a result, you know Tupac. Yeah, me and Tupac hang out. We were both made of light and ghost

9
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,000
magic, and we both performed at the Coachella stage, but you couldn't see me very well because

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,360
my light wasn't turned on very bright. Oh, that sucks. If you look really closely at the videos,

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:32,480
you can see me in the back, and I am just viciously sea walking. The problem that hologram Tupac ran

12
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:41,120
into is he was out of time reversal cubes. That is a joke about the- That is a time traveler goof

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,160
that like- Literally two people, and they're both on this show with you. But it's a hologram game,

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,760
you see. Yeah. Yeah, I got that. My boy Rick Dyer, creator of Time Traveler the Hologram Game.

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,880
Maybe let's try new goofs. Am I the only person that when I hear Coachella, I always just assume

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,280
it's an Italian liquor? You are the only person that sees that. I'm the only person that does

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,200
that? I think most of us are like in the loop on Coachella, right? I don't know what Coachella is.

18
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,240
I did not know this until a couple days ago, my roommate pointed it out. So Coachella, right,

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,160
they had the weekend lineup, which for two weekends ago, and then they brought that same

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,360
exact lineup back, the same exact schedule for this past weekend. What? They did two weekends

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,800
of identical Coachellas. Why? I guess it's so big that they can't fit it all in one Coachella.

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
But do you think that like, imagine being a musical act, it's like, all right, let's do this

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,280
whole same thing again. And also imagine like you're high on Coke weed, and you're like, what's

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,280
happening? Is Tupac back again? Yeah. Saw this already on YouTube. Thanks, though. I want you

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,160
guys to know that before I knew that there was a hologram angle to the story, and I just read

26
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,480
like the article headline, Tupac performs at Coachella. Yeah, I lost my mind. Sure. I was like,

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,440
I knew it. I've known all along. I knew it. Second performance. Check this out. Second

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,720
performance. Hologram Tupac. Everyone's like, Yonzo. And then who's that? Hologram B.I.G.

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,960
What are they doing? Laser tag. They're shooting hologram lasers from their fingers

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,600
and fighting each other. They hologram, but hologram Tupac gets shot. He gets derezzed,

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,960
right? And then what happens? Yeah, he gets shot by hologram Biggie.

32
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:42,160
15 years from now. What's up? Hologram of Tupac's hologram. Hologram hologram Tupac.

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:52,000
Machiavelli rise again. 9-11 was a hoax. That was a Tupac thing, right? He was in the spare change.

34
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,000
Why do you have to? Was that a Tupac thing? I can't. I don't recall if that was a Tupac. How

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,760
could that possibly be related to Tupac? I feel like he was he was 9-11 his numbers and so is two

36
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,200
and two is in Tupac. Tupac. I do. I do enjoy his music. I do not enjoy his holograms. This is

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,520
my brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,400
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, hologram Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother,

39
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,720
holo Biggie. I'm also Griffin McElroy. And I'm Jim. It's a shame that Jim didn't come out because

40
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,720
it seems like once you have Tupac, hologram Tupac, that you're missing opportunity if you

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,360
don't have Jim and the holograms also performing. You could have hologram Jim Belushi out there

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,760
all day long and no one would watch him. Wouldn't that be a fart in the face if you were still

43
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,800
alive and instead they went with the hologram thing and they're like, no, we don't need the

44
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,360
real person. We'll just do a hologram Travis. Also, wouldn't that be crazy if people went to

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,760
see Jim Belushi on a stage, hologram or no. In any context basically. Are you going to see the

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,720
Belushi tonight? Sold out Madison Square Garden in this bathroom. The bathroom, the first floor

47
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,640
bathroom, men's bathroom, Madison MSG. He's playing there. It's a 10 seater. With himself.

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:21,040
I miss Jim Belushi. I wish I wished. What's he doing now? Is he still according to Jim?

49
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,120
He's programming the Tupac hologram. This is my greatest creation. I thought it was the pilot

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,960
script which I had a consulting credit on of according to Jim, but no. No, it's this. It's

51
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,560
hologram Tupac. If I die, if I ever do die. That is not my plan, but if God ever finally gets the

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,240
better of me. Will you guys promise to never make a hologram of me? I can't do that. It just seems

53
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,480
don't because they were making him say stuff. He never said. He said like, what's up Coachella?

54
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Which wasn't invented until like three years after I died. I love PBR. Yeah. How you doing?

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,560
Wait, so wait, I did not. I did not see this video. Is it? Was it sort of like a was it like

56
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,400
a Pirates of the Caribbean vibe where it was like hologram animatronic Tupac? Is that is that the

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,280
score? No, he was just doing lines from Pirates of the Caribbean. Why would it need to be two?

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,040
Why would you need to be hologram and a puppet? Because they're making him say stuff you said.

59
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,920
He was saying stuff he never said, which the magic for that. I do not know how that I guess.

60
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,160
Maybe they got maybe DMX. He kind of sounds like Tupac. He's got that gravelly voice.

61
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,520
That's right. That's right. No, he's got a gravelly Tupac like voice. Maybe they brought him up

62
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,480
because he's not doing much of anything nowadays. Right. He's not really the hit maker that he used

63
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:50,000
to be. But don't make me don't bring me back to life in a hollow form and then make me say shit

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,640
that I wouldn't have said IRL. What if what if we can promise to stay really true to the

65
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,320
Griffin McElroy character? Mm hmm. That would be great. Just talk about like,

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,440
yo, can't wait to go to Walgreens and get some on sale Easter candy. That is totally,

67
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,640
I wish I wish Disney would release bug juice on DVD. Now we're just reading my tweets.

68
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,280
So as you've probably guessed, this is an advice show for the modern era. As as as important as

69
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,600
hologram Tupac is, maybe we should get to the advice. Hey, brothers, just so you know,

70
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,480
I took your advice and moved in with my wife and we're engaged. We got married on February 29th.

71
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,840
Yes, leap year. No, she does not poop in the shower. And finally, I have a question about

72
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,760
our anniversary. Should I do something small every year on February 28th and do something

73
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,000
a bit bigger every leap year? Or should I wait till leap year and do something freaking huge

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,360
four years worth combined to one? That's from leaping into it. Jesus. Yikes. You got you can't

75
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,160
save it up like that. Like the expectation every four years, you would have to, like,

76
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,320
turn your body into like stars and then shoot into the heavens on a psychedelic trip into space.

77
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,320
I like that. I have some bad news. So far, you're not good at marrying marriage. You messed up

78
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,680
basically the first thing. Yeah, that you can't don't get married on imaginary days. Yeah,

79
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,680
they when do you have your anniversary? It's crazy. I'm sure it seemed not. I did not need

80
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,720
it. Did it sneak up on you? Were you like, we'll just do it this Sunday. And it turned out to be

81
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,120
February 29th. Like, were you that casual about it? Maybe he was trying to make a goof. He's trying

82
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,600
to, you know, sneak his way out of it. He says, Yeah, we can get married on February 29th. If

83
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:49,840
such a day were to even exist on December 32nd, she caught you. She caught you. You got to just

84
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:57,360
do something February. Effectively, your your anniversary is February 29th. But you can,

85
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,800
you should absolutely observe it February 28th. Now here's a good thing. February 29th should is

86
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,880
technically also, I mean, it's more accurately March 1st. So if you forget on February 28th,

87
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,680
you got like a built in cushion. Well, I like to observe it on March 1st. That'll work. That'll work

88
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:27,440
once. I I feel like my anniversary is one of the things that I'm it's one of those like as you get

89
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,000
older, I think the novelty of birthdays and it kind of wears off because it's like, oops, gonna

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,200
die. But I think with my anniversary, that's one of the few that I actually feel pretty proud of

91
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,640
because it's like, Hey, world, nice try this world of a fragile marriages and Kardashians. I'm still

92
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,360
I'm still saying that we did we did it again. Sorry, world. But and here's the other thing

93
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,000
leaping into it not to tear you down. But it's also one of the few you actually get to pick

94
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,240
the day of. You don't get to pick your birthday. Don't get to pick Christmas. You can schedule

95
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,680
your anniversary ahead of time. Well, no, you can't. But yeah, you can say I think our anniversary

96
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,520
should be in June. Let's get married in June. That's not how that works. I think it is. I'm

97
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,920
almost certain when you get married. Justin, when you and Sydney decided on July 1st when you

98
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,920
dedicated your lives to each other, that beautiful, beautiful Friday afternoon. I think is a Saturday.

99
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,720
Did you think like, oh, man, this is gonna be a totally killer day for for all all future years

100
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,800
to come? No, I thought this will be easy to remember. It is because I can do it. And I'm

101
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,080
yeah, I am not involved in the arrangement at all. Not in the slightest. It's actually the very first

102
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,200
day of the second half of the year. So yeah, you take it off with a bang. Take it off the second

103
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,800
kick it off three Q3 this fiscal quarter of marriage. We're rocking into it with in a big way

104
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:04,240
year over year. We are looking at huge dividends by which I mean, I guess like sex stuff. I just

105
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,600
made myself uncomfortable. I prefer you. We not discuss this. We don't have if you my younger

106
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,640
brother Griffin, though he is not married, he has a he had he is very adept apparently at marriage

107
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,520
because if he could not be right more correct that if you try to combine four years of anniversaries

108
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,240
into one, someday your fiance will remember February 28 as the day Ricky threw himself out

109
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,160
the plate glass window because you're never you're never going to be able to handle that.

110
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,680
You can do maybe one of those be like, hey, I rented out all of Australia. Let's go crazy.

111
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,000
Right. You can't do that twice. It'll kill you. You'll die. I taught our baby to sing or something

112
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,240
tar baby to dance and he sings your favorite song and he wrote it. So the baby wrote your favorite

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,560
song and he's three months old. This is our anniversary. Yeah, but I also want to picture

114
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,880
the conversation on the off years where you're like, not this year, baby. No, man, I got something

115
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,640
cooking. I've been down in the lab all week. This is only year one of the four year cycle.

116
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,600
You got three more years of anticipation. Can we fucking just like go to Ponderosa, though?

117
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
Can we just like go to Ponderosa? No, no, no. I gotta stay in the lab. I'm gonna sleep straight

118
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,440
through the day. You have to make sure that I don't do anything nice for you. If you can't,

119
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,320
if your wife asks you to take her to Ponderosa and you say no, you don't have a good reason for

120
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,120
that. I guarantee you. But here's the thing. If your wife is asking you to take her to Ponderosa,

121
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
you've already set a troubling precedent in your relationship at some point.

122
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,760
You got bigger questions to answer. Yeah, you got bigger questions than exactly how much pudding

123
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,520
can I eat? Yeah. Where can I find an open Ponderosa? What is your driest steak? Give me

124
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,920
your very driest meatloaf. Can you carve a rib off of that giant piece of beef for me?

125
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,640
That actually sounds great. It's our special day.

126
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,800
Honey, I hit a ring inside of your ribs. Your literal ribs. Get it out. Saw six.

127
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,120
This year. All right, this is plenty. Griffin, that's plenty of help. Just don't do that dumb

128
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
thing you said that you probably know is dumb. Yeah, you do something every year on the 28th.

129
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,640
Do something every year on the 28th. And couple it with an apology every time.

130
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,600
I got you this and also I'm sorry that we did it on the 29th.

131
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
Here's a related question. This one was sent in by Steve Lewis. Thank you, Steve.

132
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mary Mary X 3 0 who asks. How do I improve my scorpions?

133
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,520
My scorpions are OK, but not the best. How do I improve them? I've been struggling with them

134
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:59,840
for months. That's it. That's so important. That's the context. Best at what? By the way,

135
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,720
when I said that it was related, I meant. Completely diametrically best in what?

136
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,920
In what capacity? OK, well with scorpions, you have four basic criteria for for judging their

137
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,600
quality. It's there for danger zones, right? Yeah, the four danger zones you've got to worry about

138
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,960
one exoskeleton. Yes, two. What kind of chitin is he working with? Yeah, how do we improve it?

139
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,280
How's your chitin? Is he getting enough vitamin D? That's huge for chitin D is. I say I've always

140
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,000
said what's your what's that motto you always tell people and you have it cross stitched up on

141
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,880
the hanging up there in the den above the fireplace. What is it? It's about. It's it's you gotta have D

142
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:55,200
if you want. If you don't, if you. Don't shed your don't shed your skin. Don't shed that chitin put.

143
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Yeah, it took it took our mom weeks to stitch exactly that, but Griffin.

144
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,960
And she was not a swearing woman. She did not enjoy swearing, but I would. Griffin was very

145
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:17,760
specific so armor armor. That's number one. Second, of course, claws. Does it look like a little crab?

146
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,680
Do I know if scorpions have claws? How are the pincers? How are the pincers number three? Obviously

147
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:36,400
pointy tail. What's in there? Who knows? Caramel poison. I hope I injected some caramel into all

148
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,880
your treats. I'm the best scorpion ever. And then what's the 4th one heat coming off the genitals?

149
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,480
How is how is its genital heat? Also, can you find my scorpions genitals for me?

150
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,520
Also, can I make a 1980s movies called Genital Heat? I've been over this motherfuckers thorax

151
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:00,560
with a fine tooth comb. No genitals to be found. And also for your scorpion. A big thing is

152
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,840
is how hard did it nail the solo in Rocky like a Hurricane? Because that's vital. That's huge.

153
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,800
For scorpion. Is it possible that this person is actually saying how do I make my band the 1980s

154
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:23,440
band scorpion better? I bought them from some kind of closeout sale. Got them at Ollie's at the

155
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,760
Grandview weekend outlet on bargain. They just don't have the luster they once did.

156
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:36,320
Well, that's guaranteed. I one time I thought I stepped on a scorpion. That's a real thing I have

157
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,160
to deal with down here in Texas. In rural areas there there just are scorpions and I have to deal

158
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,040
with the reality that the scorpions are. That's terrifying. For me, like scorpions might as well

159
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,200
be dragons. Yeah, you know, because you never you've never seen one or because they are just

160
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,280
doom bringers there. Well, they're that far from my sphere of reality. Like, yeah, like,

161
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,560
what would you do if you walked out of your front lawn and there was one there right now?

162
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,040
I would. I mean, I don't know what I would. I mean, the reality is so far from I would sooner.

163
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,920
I would be less confused if I saw a naked blonde woman standing in a pile of ashes with three

164
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,920
scorpions crawling on her and talking about how she's going to to lead the Dothraki armies. Like

165
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,560
that was that would be the context in which scorpions would be acceptable. If I just saw one

166
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,760
in like my day to day, I would probably assume that it was the matrix like that that Morpheus

167
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,320
was fucking with me. Oh, something's gone wrong in the in the programming. A hiccup in the

168
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,840
programming. Justin saw a scorpion. So it was wearing a tiny top hat. You would improve this

169
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,960
man's scorpions by making them invisible and also in space. If you see a scorpion in your house,

170
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:59,440
yeah, your very next stop is a is like a is an open house. Century 21. Yes. Pardon me. I this

171
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,800
is a lovely open house. Thank you for having me. I'll take it. Here's my I cannot sell my old house

172
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,720
because the scorpion lives there now. It's his now. It is now. I'm going to try to charge him taxes

173
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,800
on the sale, but I don't know how the scorpions die. Money. Can we can we improve the the mass

174
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,640
marketability of these scorpions? You guys are missing the obvious answer. What's that, Travis?

175
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,320
Steroids. Travis, I don't think that. Wait, you're running away from me because you want to make

176
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,880
these scorpions like super beefy. I don't know that they have beef. Right. I don't know that

177
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,240
they have beef to to in beefing. You know, I think it's just just. Well, not yet. You got you got to

178
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,480
get him on a regime. It's all chitin and on a regimen. It's chitin and just hate in there.

179
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,600
Maybe you could paint paint paint their shells like hermit crabs. OK, now see, I like that.

180
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,440
Paint the scorpion for human for kids for kids. This is what I'm talking about. Can we make

181
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:07,520
scorpions the new Furbies? Of course, just a tiny cork on on their stingers. OK, that would be

182
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,120
adorable as though and rubber bands on their claws. Did we talk about the claws? Is that been

183
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
verified? That's just that just kind of looks like a scorpion who's into like weird bondage,

184
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,720
which I can't imagine a more terrifying thing. Why do I have? I think scorpions are so hateful

185
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,560
that if you cork their tails and rubber banded their claws that they'd like learn to bite or

186
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,760
learn how to grow things, how to use a gun or just become really spiteful, use their words to hurt

187
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:43,680
you. Looking fat today, J-Man. Hair's looking a little thin. Not as young as it used to be, J-Man.

188
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,960
So he turns into Beetlejuice. It reminds me of that. It's an old parable. It's an old story of

189
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,920
the frog and the scorpion and the frog gives the scorpion a ride across the river and halfway

190
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,640
across the scorpion starts calling him. I don't know, like fat and stupid and stuff. And the

191
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,920
frog starts crying. It's like, why are you such an asshole? It's in my nature. Yeah. Yeah. And then

192
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,840
he's. But then does he sting him? No, because he's got a tiny cork on his tail. Oh, that's right.

193
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,600
He just batters him with the cork like that. Oh, my eye. Oh, this is my new line of frog

194
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:24,480
safe scorpions. Each one is $20. Who is the first to buy? Can you imagine a frog with a scorpion

195
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,480
on its back? And the frog is also full of hate. And then like you get that, you get that lethality

196
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,920
of a scorpion with the mobility of a frog. Well, we're done. And the frog is secreting some sort

197
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,560
of hallucinogen. So the scorpion is just freaked out. And also the frog has a really high credit

198
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:52,800
score. So he's able to like get a house. Why would that be? Why would the scorpion knows the

199
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,080
scorpion knows American Sign Language so we can talk to deaf people? And one of them is played

200
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,440
by Ray Romano. Oh, my God. The frog is Ray Romano. Oh, OK. Oh, and the scorpions played by Tim Allen.

201
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,200
We've got a hit. Listen, this is not the least productive meeting we've had about Madagascar

202
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,400
for yet. And I think I need to go back to the drawing board and really see where we went

203
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,200
astray. I have a theory that it's when we introduce scorpions. Yeah, they ruin everything, including

204
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,120
our Madagascar for production meetings. I'm reading more of this Yahoo answer,

205
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,280
and I think that a scorpion is a yoga position. Oh, moving on.

206
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,760
None of this. None of that was helpful to the person. You don't know. You don't know. You

207
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
throw out of the wall. You see what sticks. They might have found something. And here's what it

208
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:58,640
takes. Scorpions. Their feet are like needles. Yeah. Hey, brothers, there's someone someone

209
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,040
really into yoga that's been screaming at their iPod for five minutes. You dumb motherfuckers.

210
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,920
Hey, brothers, I got out of a two year long relationship in February and I got over her

211
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:20,720
very quickly, a la the recovery sandwich. Problem is, I'm finding it hard to ease into a relationship

212
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,480
or casual dating. I dove in and started dating another girl. It didn't work out and I got out.

213
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,920
Now I'm seeing another girl, but we went from meeting three weeks ago. She's spending three

214
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,120
or four nights a week at my place in that short and sweet time. What advice do you have for pumping

215
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:44,160
the brakes to ease into this relationship? That's from Love a Lanch in Louisville. Oh, gosh, this is

216
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,040
this is thorny because here's the thing. It may be maybe it's real. And if that's the case,

217
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,320
then there's nothing there's nothing wrong. But I think the fact that you are asking how

218
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:08,880
to pump the brakes means that it is moving a little too fast for you. You know, and I see it

219
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,120
a lot and I don't know if we've talked about it before, but when you leave, whatever circumstances

220
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,560
and a long term relationship, there's this just minefield of immediately wanting to get back to

221
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,640
that level of comfort. And it's unavoidable. You're going to do that when you get out of

222
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,600
a relationship and you never really casually dated. Like, yeah, it's the reason that you see.

223
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,720
It's the reason you see rebound so quickly, you know, so often is because it's that it's a weird

224
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,840
kind of it's a weird kind of rebound because it's not like it's not like you're just like

225
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,280
swinging through bars trying to get trim, you know, you're you're trying to find a new replacement

226
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,960
for that, you know, that long term girlfriend. I bet you see this rebound more often than you

227
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,640
see the swinging through bars rebound. Yeah. You may try that for like two days for a weekend.

228
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:15,760
So my only worry with with rushing this is and I'm not like typically I'm I'm I'm sort of a go

229
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,520
for it kind of guy. I think, you know, whatever, you only go around once and who knows how much

230
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,880
time we have. So just go for it. But I do think that you're going to burn through a lot of good

231
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,760
stuff by moving this too quickly. I mean, there's a lot of getting to know you type stuff that you

232
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,200
lose. I think once you are not lose, but you can miss out on if you rush right into like we're

233
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,320
living together, which is where you are careening towards now. Now, I hate to interrupt Justin, but

234
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,440
it also might be possible. I know it also might be possible that it's just your M.O. because I

235
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
know that I am a fast moving person in relationships. So it had nothing to do with,

236
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,760
you know, any kind of past relationship I was getting out of. Just I met my girlfriend,

237
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,200
we hit it off very quickly and we were living together like three months later.

238
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,240
Yeah. You know, three months is a far cry from three weeks. I agree. I agree. But they're not

239
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,520
living together. Yeah. They're just spending three or four nights a week. They met three weeks ago.

240
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,760
I mean, I don't think there's anything if you didn't send in this question to us to ask us

241
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:31,040
what you should do, then there would be no problem with good point. Like if you if you think like

242
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:38,800
it, my advice, the best thing I can offer you is to wonder if you are worried things are moving too

243
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,440
fast because like society or your friends say that, or if you're legitimately worried things.

244
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,560
It's not that it's that you've got to have it. It's it's a reasonable level of doubt.

245
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,080
When you get out of a long term relationship, everything in your body tells you, OK,

246
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
let's take some time off. Let's just do some quiet reflection because that's the best thing

247
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,240
you can do after a long term relationship is do do like a fucking long debriefing and just like

248
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,880
figure out what went wrong, what qualities in that person drove you away from them and what

249
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,520
qualities in yourself you can improve to make yourself better for the next person and do all

250
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,000
that stuff. And it's hard to do all that stuff when you are like in another beginnings of a long term

251
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,760
relationship that completely discounts the the possibility that you just meet someone really

252
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,680
important. And like, are we going to keep him at arm's length because you got to get your shit

253
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,360
worked out? Well, see, that's why I think like it's really hard to be this kind of self self

254
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,480
reflective. But you got to look at it and say, like, is is any of this forced or was there just

255
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,920
a supernatural, you know, super automatic connection with this person? And I'm worrying

256
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,840
about it too much. Yeah, I think that that's the import. I think that that's the key thing

257
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:07,680
is just to know thyself. I know. Know why you are doing this and try to, like, take a really sort of

258
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,520
practical look at your own state of being and see why you are moving it so fast,

259
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,520
because if it if it's moving that fast and you don't feel in control, that's a problem because

260
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,720
that's your self conscious trying to push you back into a long term relationship.

261
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,240
As far as pumping the brakes on this relationship, I don't know. I feel like this situation is kind

262
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,560
of ubiquitous for anybody who's ever been in and then out of a long term relationship.

263
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,160
You got to go full disclosure. You got to say, yeah, I got out of this long term relationship.

264
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,680
It didn't work out. I rushed into another one that also didn't work out because we just moved

265
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:55,040
too fast or whatever. I really like you, but I don't want to, you know, I don't want to move

266
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,000
this thing too fast because the last time I did that, it didn't work out. But I do want to keep

267
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,480
my exclusive deal on dating you. I want to keep an option to move this forward, but I want to keep

268
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,400
exclusivity. Well, that's going to be that might be harder to negotiate. That might be too much.

269
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,240
You've got to have that in the contract. You got to have that in your deal. Don't bring paperwork

270
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
into it because that's intimidating. Well, you could have like a non biting mediation.

271
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,120
Okay, good. I would have a get a notary public there and and have them sort of oversee your

272
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,640
conversation and have them sworn to secrecy. Cool. So we were on a tear there for like three

273
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
minutes. We're actually saying things that a person could actually do in real life.

274
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,920
You can get a notary public. Yeah. How hard is that? Like, sure. I'm going to try to become one

275
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,480
before the end of this show. And we'll see. And we'll just see who's laughing. Get on Google.

276
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:58,880
Just Google. You're in the tall grass, my friend. But at least you're not cripplingly lonely.

277
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,600
Yeah. Hey, don't just don't don't psych yourself out. Yeah. Yeah. Just stay yourself and be honest

278
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:14,000
with her. You are in a completely no matter what you actually want, you completely have the the

279
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,960
moral high ground here. Just be careful that you don't miss out on something really great

280
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,040
because you're second guessing yourself too much. Yeah. Yeah. It may just be the right person and

281
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,400
you may not have met them at the ideal time. And sometimes you just got to roll with it.

282
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,800
Yep. Because if it's the if it's the one, your special one, then you won't burn out living

283
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,320
together. And you know what? I think it's probably just good advice overall to relax,

284
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,120
you know, and maybe that will help you slow down or it will help you take stock of the relationship

285
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,520
as is. So maybe not try to know where it's going and how it's going to turn out and not try to

286
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:58,720
rush it, but not try to slow down and just take it at its own pace. So breathe. I feel like we just

287
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,440
touched I feel like half of our listeners are probably going through this right now. Yeah,

288
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,480
probably. And I you know what? It's funny because the older the older I get and the more

289
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,680
shows we do, the more I can basically tell a question askers age just from the question.

290
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,240
Because if they're because of a 30 year old person finds 31 like myself,

291
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,320
find someone who wants to be with them. It's like, oh, thank God. God, I'm not going to be alone.

292
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,160
Please sign this. Please sign this. Please, please. I just want I don't want to die. I don't want to

293
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,600
die in front of my Mori Povich. I can't stop eating frozen Frenchman pizzas. All I've been

294
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,680
eating is frozen Frenchman pizzas. Just love me so I'm safe. I'll throw out my tortillas. Just

295
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:48,240
please don't leave again. I don't know. I'm keeping my options open. We're moving too fast.

296
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,880
Fuck that. Focusing on my career. I'm moving too fast through these empty cartons of Ben and Jerry's.

297
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,720
Please move in with me. Please. I just need something to hang on to. Some kind of lifeline.

298
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm drowning here. I'm drowning in my own loneliness. Please. You guys want to do a Yahoo?

299
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,800
Yeah, please. This Yahoo is sent in by Yasmeel Cruz. Thank you, Yasmeel. That's a dope ass name.

300
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:22,320
Yep, good work. It's by Yahoo Answers user Sydney who asks, how to end a sexting convo?

301
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:31,840
Please don't judge me first of all. My boyfriend wants to sext me. No pics. But I don't really

302
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,960
want I don't really know how to end the conversation. My friend says she just

303
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,280
doesn't reply. But I don't want to do that. How would I end it? Thanks, smiley face.

304
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,160
You break up with them. Man, I hope that's not my wife.

305
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,080
Justin, it's S-Y-D-N-E-E.

306
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,560
So shit. How do you end a sexting conversation?

307
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,520
I love well, I don't love. I'm terrified by the sentence. My friend says she just doesn't reply,

308
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,480
which to me I'm just imagining like an iPhone where it's all just like one side of a text

309
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,360
conversation. Like I'm touching my penis now. I'm touching it again. I'm touching it a third time.

310
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,040
Do you hear me? I'm still doing it. Yep. Just now I'm just flicking it.

311
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:23,040
I know you're there. But the best way to end any sexting conversation is to continue the fiction.

312
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,920
So then you text the person. Now I'm going to the bathroom to wash up. I'm taking a quick pee.

313
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,720
I'm seeing what's on TV. It's nothing good. I'm making some eggs.

314
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,560
I was out in the garden for like three hours. I'm like super grody down there.

315
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,640
Wait a minute. Now you're starting off the fiction. You're starting the fiction.

316
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,000
The classic gardener and gardeness fiction. I'm trying to end. I'm saying you end it.

317
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,280
You say like, I just played like six hours of Frisbee golf.

318
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,040
It's super crunchy. It's really, really swampy. That's how you keep from sexting in the first

319
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,720
place. Right. That's what you say. Oh, I've got a real bad headache. So you're saying how do you end

320
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:14,240
it before you begin? Oh man, I am so bloated. Let's not. Hey, do you smell that? I ate a whole

321
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:21,760
Subway footlong. Just let me sleep. I wish I'd gotten Golden Corral first. Let me sleep off this

322
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,840
footlong. The only thing on the footlock was black olives. I think I'm septic.

323
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,960
Hey, does this look infected to you or what? Oh, my stuff is pickled. Please let me sleep.

324
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,080
I got some real bad bubble guts. Oh, Christ. I'm on a family plan. I'm on a family plan with my dad.

325
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:54,400
Please stop. I don't get free texting. Oh, my hair's falling out. You keep interrupting my games

326
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:03,360
to draw something. How am I supposed to Fruit Ninja with this? Please no. Hold on. Let me put my leg on.

327
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:17,440
Oh, shit. No, that's not fair. The McCarthy woman's beautiful. Jenny McCarthy? No,

328
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,240
Jenny McCarthy can ramp a Volvo into a pile of flaming shit for all I care. I hate her.

329
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,720
I'm talking about Mrs. Paul McCartney, the one-legged lady who's so sweet. She's very good.

330
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Okay, so sexting endings. Buh-bye. Just is like, nope. Is that not? Nope. Thanks, but no.

331
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:49,840
No, you are not touching it. Yeah, I disagree. You could subvert their fiction. That's good.

332
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:57,600
I start unzipping my pants, and then it gets stuck, right? It's stuck, and you're hopping around the room,

333
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,080
and you're like- And you realize you put your underpants on backwards, and the flap's on the other side.

334
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,360
And then you're hopping around so much that you fall over, and your head hits the corner of an end table.

335
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:15,840
Oh, God, you're bleeding. Not like this, God. Not like this. Not again. You smell smoke coming from the door.

336
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,400
Do you touch it with the back of your hand, or go to sleep? Create a choose your own adventure!

337
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,600
Turn to page 57. Oops, you died. You found the cave troll. You can try again on page 38.

338
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,040
Maybe this time don't grab the magic sword, by which I mean your dick. You encounter a troll.

339
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,000
Check your satchel to see what you have with you. North. You go north and die in the fires.

340
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,600
Please don't try to fuck me on my phone. It's my dad's phone. Why do you keep texting my dad?

341
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,960
I called you from this number once.

342
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,080
Is it this hard? Can't you just- I'm starting to think the non-response is the way to go, though.

343
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:08,400
Yeah. No, because that's- No, that's giving them free reign to just- To just molest you with words.

344
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,360
I wouldn't let someone send me a romantic novel that they wrote about me and them.

345
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,600
You know what I mean? That's- You say you wouldn't?

346
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,000
I would not. I probably would.

347
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,720
I was gonna say. If somebody called you- If it was well written. If the syntax was good.

348
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,960
If it had vampires, because that's huge right now. That's real big.

349
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,640
Just like biting a wiener. Is that- I don't know. Don't-

350
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,600
Wait, what?

351
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,800
Like the vampire, like, drinks wiener blood. Isn't that why it's so hot right now? It's like

352
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:50,640
the thought of like- I'm imagining, isn't that why vampire sex, when you do mouth stuff, the fangs?

353
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,280
For pleasure.

354
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,720
Just keep going.

355
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,280
Yeah, keep going. I gotta know more about this.

356
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't know. I don't understand why vampire sex is so great and why it's so hot in the TV.

357
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,360
Only thing I could think of, mouth stuff, fangs. Good.

358
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,480
Oh, okay. All right. I think I'm kind of with you now.

359
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,560
So you put two and two together and make gross.

360
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah.

361
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,760
Okay.

362
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
I've never sexted.

363
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,680
I don't think anyone above the age of 15 has ever sexted.

364
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,960
I bet you're probably wrong on that front, Trev.

365
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,800
You think? I'm just trying to imagine, like, how one as an adult, like,

366
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,400
with a job out in the world starts that without being embarrassed.

367
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,240
Well, like, have you ever done karaoke?

368
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah.

369
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,120
It's basically the same thing. Okay.

370
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,920
So you get a couple drinks in you, and then you just roll with it.

371
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,000
You're home, home in your bathroom.

372
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,200
You watch someone else do it really badly, and you're like, I can do better than that.

373
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,760
Yeah.

374
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,480
Yeah.

375
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,160
I could sext you. Let me sext you better.

376
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,320
I can sext you better than that.

377
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,840
Step aside. Let me show you. Let me show you.

378
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,480
Step aside.

379
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,160
What I really want is a written permanent record of my feeble, humiliating attempts to be sexy.

380
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,480
That's great. That's fantastic.

381
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,600
How quickly can you get this on Reddit? That's my question.

382
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,200
How quickly can we spread this around?

383
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,280
I want everyone to know what a Lothario I am with the texting.

384
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,360
That's why it's also important that you include pictures.

385
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,400
Oh, yeah.

386
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,960
But because, you know, you can trust the person that just texted you, hey, show me your dick.

387
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,200
Yeah.

388
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,920
Well, I think I would put a little bit more flavor in your ear than that.

389
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,320
What would you rank us off? What's that thing you had crossed in?

390
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
I'm so turgid right now.

391
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,480
Okay. Okay, I'm turgid.

392
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,800
I just went from flaccid to engorged.

393
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,360
My member is voluminous.

394
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,760
It keeps glowing.

395
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,360
It's billowing. It looks like a beautiful parachute down there.

396
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,680
I meant to talk to you about that, actually.

397
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,160
I don't think anybody should be sexting because it's a sin because no babies can come of it.

398
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,160
So obviously my religion doesn't permit it.

399
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,400
Sure.

400
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,720
It's got to be for procreation.

401
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,680
You disapprove of rumping for the very same reason.

402
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,120
Yeah, I'm sorry, is that the butt?

403
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,200
Rumping?

404
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,440
Yeah.

405
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,080
Oh, God.

406
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,040
It obviously is.

407
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,000
What if you sext a rumping fiction?

408
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,120
Sext a rumping fiction.

409
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
That's my favorite Belle and Sebastian song.

410
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,000
Do you mean like saying like, I don't know, can we not?

411
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,160
No, I backed out of this.

412
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,280
Yeah, I'm like done.

413
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,840
I don't want to do this.

414
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:47,200
I prepare my fanny, send, wait, response.

415
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,560
Nope.

416
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,120
I powder my fanny in preparation.

417
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,480
You know that fanny doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means across the universe, right?

418
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
What is a fanny in other parts of the universe?

419
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,520
It's a vagina.

420
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,560
Holy shit.

421
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,760
Holy shit.

422
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,880
My butt's a vagina?

423
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,440
That didn't make any sense.

424
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,080
Pretty much nothing we've said for the past 40 minutes, Jesus.

425
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,120
First law and order, now the word fanny.

426
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,360
Is there anything the UK can't ruin?

427
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
You guys are so lucky that we got into the Doctor Who and we're helping you out on that.

428
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah, we'll fix it, don't worry.

429
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
You guys can't be trusted with anything.

430
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,240
You know what?

431
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,560
You know what you can trust us with?

432
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,760
What's that Justin?

433
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,560
Your money.

434
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,640
Of course, we don't want you to give us your money.

435
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,480
We want you to give your money to our dear friend, Brintle Floss.

436
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,000
Yes, and this isn't one of those bullshit internet friendships.

437
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,280
This is real world.

438
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,360
Travis, tell us about Brint.

439
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,200
Well, I met Brint my freshman year of college and we've been friends ever since.

440
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,000
That's not true.

441
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,320
Freshman year of college, we did not like each other.

442
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,600
But then we moved in together sophomore year, still not liking each other,

443
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,240
and then we became best friends and lived together for three years

444
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,000
and have been friends for like the last decade.

445
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,120
Here's some great advice.

446
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,840
Don't do that.

447
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
No, it actually worked out really well.

448
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,360
I would recommend it to anyone because if you move in with like your best friend,

449
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,520
you're going to annoy each other and ruin it.

450
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,680
If you move in with someone that already kind of annoys you,

451
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,720
you'll actually find all kinds of things that you have in common

452
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,520
and things that you really like about each other and become best friends.

453
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,720
But let's not focus on that.

454
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,400
Let's focus on Brint.

455
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,160
What's Brint do, Travis?

456
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,840
What's his game?

457
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,600
Honestly, he's brilliant.

458
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,320
I'll tell you this.

459
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,720
My brother, my brother and me would not exist without Brint.

460
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,480
Brint is an internet comedian and basically he takes all kinds of video game music

461
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,200
and writes video game inspired music,

462
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,640
basically adds lyrics and does really funny YouTube videos.

463
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,000
And he's just put out a second CD called Bits of Me

464
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,640
and I got to listen to a sneak preview of it.

465
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,000
And it is both hilarious and at some points, moving.

466
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Travis, you got that sneak peek.

467
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,520
You want to hook us up?

468
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,120
Give us a taste.

469
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:29,360
Yeah.

470
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,080
Zelda!

471
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,560
Why?

472
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,600
Why, it's me!

473
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,720
It's little Linky!

474
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,600
Don't you know me?

475
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,200
Meet me in the dungeon, dear

476
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,760
Or wherever danger's near

477
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,480
How I miss your little baby face

478
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,280
In my arms, though, you're out of place

479
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,080
How I love the thought of you in chains

480
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,760
Please get kidnapped again

481
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,200
Be my damsel, but be in distress

482
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,280
Please let me have a second quest

483
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,120
So you like Zelda, you like Mario, Mega Man, Star Fox, Castlevania 2, Contra, Banjo-Kazooie.

484
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,280
He riffs, I could say, can I say riffs?

485
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,800
He riffs on all of those in musical styles, ranging from rock to bluegrass to Dixieland jazz.

486
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,320
They got more guests.

487
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,880
And the best part about it, even if you don't know about those video games,

488
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,920
like my girlfriend, we just listened for, you know, I made her listen to his first CD.

489
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,040
She loved it, ate it up.

490
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
And she doesn't know half the video games that are on there.

491
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,600
So he's brilliant.

492
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,160
He's brilliant.

493
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,120
He's great.

494
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,520
And the thing is, you can get his new CD.

495
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,120
You can preorder it until April 26th for $12.99.

496
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:05,760
You just go to Brentalfloss, B-R-E-N-T-A-L-F-L-O-S-S.com and preorder it and then say,

497
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,840
like, hey, I'm preordering this because I heard about it on NBNB AM.

498
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:16,480
If you go to Brentalfloss.com, you can also listen to some samples, I'm sure, of his work.

499
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,000
And while you're there, you can also see the webcomic that he puts out in which he and I are roommates.

500
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,920
And it kind of tells some real, some made up stories of our time together as roommates.

501
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,200
Um, has he written a song with music from Shenmue in it?

502
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,440
Not yet.

503
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,120
Has he written a song with music from Seaman in it?

504
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,120
Not yet.

505
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,120
What's the point?

506
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,880
NFL 2K5.

507
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,560
Yes.

508
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,280
Okay.

509
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,920
Brentalfloss.com, go right now, preorder it.

510
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,520
You only have until April 26th, so you've got, like, three days to get this CD and you're going to want it.

511
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,960
I've already preordered mine.

512
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,960
I could not be more excited to enjoy it and I would suggest you do the same.

513
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,760
Brentalfloss.com.

514
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,560
Travis is Brent's roommate.

515
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,080
You can't trust Travis on this.

516
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,840
Me, I hate the guy's guts.

517
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,960
I just love his music.

518
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,600
I preordered it and I can't stand to be within 100 miles of the guy.

519
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,080
So take it from me, an unbiased, an unbiased listener of music and enjoyer of it.

520
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,880
Brentalfloss.com.

521
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,920
Now, Griffin, are you going to sing a song?

522
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,720
No, fuck that.

523
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,360
Should we just play another clip then?

524
00:45:37,360 --> 00:46:07,120
I float towards you, it's deep and it's blue, sink or swim.

525
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:15,120
Baby, don't go, love it here.

526
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Wait for me, I'll come and set you free.

527
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:33,120
But until then, I'll keep on swimming in the sea.

528
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,320
I have a good, loyal, kind friend who is tragically incapable of romantic success.

529
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:47,840
He is constantly too drunk lamenting his last rebuke to lay down game on the next potential.

530
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,120
You want to try that again?

531
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,120
Yeah, let me just try.

532
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:59,440
So he's too hurt from his last refusal from a girl to flirt with the next girl.

533
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,240
Thank you.

534
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
What are some good wingman moves?

535
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,160
I can use to get him hooked up so he will be happy and stop complaining.

536
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,840
That's from Dating Delegate in Davis.

537
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:18,880
Can we get rid of the defiction of the wingman?

538
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,440
I don't think that it's possible for anybody to get anybody else laid.

539
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,160
See, this is the problem, Griffin.

540
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,360
If they don't have the magic inside of them-

541
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,840
The wingman is a real position, but we as a society have the wrong concept of it.

542
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,680
The wingman, as far as I understand it, wingman is code for,

543
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,680
I am married, but I have a great excuse for flirting with girls.

544
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,560
Exactly.

545
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,040
That's basically-

546
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:52,560
Wingman, you are there to be the non-threatening guy who backs up your friend when he fails.

547
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,360
You can't throw an alley-oop to somebody who's taking a nap in the press box.

548
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,440
Right, you know?

549
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,560
Slam a jammer.

550
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,160
They're not going to jam that slam.

551
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,480
The ball will fly free.

552
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,640
Okay, so let me, because I wish that someone had told me this when I was like 23

553
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
and thought I was being a good wingman.

554
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,000
This is not a good move.

555
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,160
Walking up to a girl and saying,

556
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,080
listen, my friend over there thinks you're really cute,

557
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,120
but he's too nervous to come over and say anything.

558
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,920
You should-

559
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,520
Don't, don't do that.

560
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,560
Why would you do that?

561
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,600
No, don't do that.

562
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,720
Travis actually did a not bad job of it.

563
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,160
I've never told you this before.

564
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,720
Oh, thank you.

565
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,120
Travis's jam was, it was very similar to have you met Ted on How I Met Your Mother.

566
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,480
He would just go up to a girl and just say,

567
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,920
hey, this is Griffin.

568
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,400
And then ghost disappears.

569
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,120
That's all, that's really all.

570
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,720
The hard part about meeting people isn't like coming up with a clever thing to say.

571
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,600
It is coming up with a salutation.

572
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,640
That's all you need.

573
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,480
And if you do it right, you also provide good conversation material

574
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,000
so your buddy can be like, I'm sorry, Travis is an asshole.

575
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,840
You know, I am Griffin.

576
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,960
You know, like you're not only opening the door,

577
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,880
you're also creating something to talk about at first.

578
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,080
Yeah, you can found your relationship on your mutual dislike of your brother.

579
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:20,800
That's what I'm saying.

580
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,720
I think the important thing about being a wingman

581
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,920
is being willing to embarrass yourself so that your friend doesn't have to.

582
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,800
Here's my problem with wingman or ladies.

583
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,800
I know, see, I think ladies prefer pack hunting.

584
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,000
I think pack hunting metaphors are better for the ladies.

585
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,600
They seem to travel in packs.

586
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,520
So like an alpha and beta.

587
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,720
Like an alpha and beta.

588
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,280
You gotta kill, wait, the werewolf curse won't be lifted unless,

589
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,000
no, here's my problem with the wingman.

590
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,560
And if I am going to begin a relationship with a new partner,

591
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,960
I don't anticipate ever doing this again.

592
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,520
But in my young days, when I had to,

593
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:09,360
I can't have my ability to lie stymie by my friend who knows me being around.

594
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,200
Like I'm gonna say a lot of things that aren't true or exaggerations of the truth.

595
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,720
And I can't have my friend look at me like, you're lying.

596
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,080
I gotta be on my own.

597
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,160
If that person does that, they're a terrible wingman.

598
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,880
If they call bullshit on you.

599
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,120
He's lying.

600
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,560
Justin, why are you compulsively lying to women though?

601
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,280
Well, it's not just women, hey?

602
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,520
Compulsively is not-

603
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,040
Men, women, children, babies, goats.

604
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,440
Well, guys.

605
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,680
I'm not saying like lying like-

606
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,000
I've got a real hearty penis.

607
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,200
No, I'm not talking about lying like-

608
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,920
It's like a can of Senka down there.

609
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,760
He's talking about lying like saying things like, no, I'm not afraid of masks.

610
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,720
Yeah, right.

611
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,840
Pretending like I'm not afraid of the robot woman from Superman 3.

612
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,160
Should that come up in casual conversations.

613
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,120
Well, you know who I like?

614
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,680
You know what never scared me?

615
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,360
The HBO logo they used to show for the movies in the 80s.

616
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,960
I never really scared me.

617
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,920
I used to scare the ever loving shit out of you.

618
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,640
It was no big deal.

619
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,920
It was pretty frightening.

620
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,960
No big whoop.

621
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,000
I think to answer your question, it is your job as wingman to not-

622
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,160
It's not a defeat.

623
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,800
That's the thing.

624
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,120
If a girl is like, nah, I'm not interested.

625
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,480
Or even in the worst, shooting you down.

626
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,200
It's not a defeat because you have not lost anything.

627
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,160
And so when your friend starts to like, fuck it.

628
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,960
I'm just going to do like nine shots because she doesn't want to talk to me.

629
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,760
You need to be like, hey, bro, it's not that big a deal.

630
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,560
Don't worry about it.

631
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,240
That's a bigger problem, I think.

632
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,560
Yeah.

633
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:58,480
I also, guys, I think the term, the idea of the term, the concept wingman has been

634
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,320
just so steeped in so much bro.

635
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,040
I agree.

636
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,960
That it's, I don't even think you can go with the idea anymore.

637
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,160
It's been bromented.

638
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,600
Do you know what your only obligation as a wingman is?

639
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:11,920
What?

640
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,400
To not make your friend go out to a bar by himself.

641
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,920
That's it.

642
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,560
Really?

643
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,240
If you do that, you're already head and shoulders above anyone else.

644
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,600
You know my ideal wingman?

645
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,320
What?

646
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,800
Somebody who will just buy every other pitcher and play some darts.

647
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,120
Yeah.

648
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,680
That's a pretty good wingman to me.

649
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,680
Well, no ladies tonight, but you threw a real nice 301.

650
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,720
Do you want to know who the world's worst wingman is?

651
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,000
Who's that, Travis?

652
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,840
It is my dear friend Michael Bradbury.

653
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,200
Why is he so bad?

654
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,760
Because he is the most naturally charming person I have ever met.

655
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,040
If you bring a girl within a 15-foot radius of Michael Bradbury, she is lost to you.

656
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,120
Yeah, he can't be too charming.

657
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,360
This is my wingman, John Stamos.

658
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,160
Oh, you're gone.

659
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,280
You're fucking John Stamos in his car.

660
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,000
Great.

661
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,600
I am the perfect wingman because I'm just charming enough

662
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,320
that I don't necessarily come off as a serial killer.

663
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,160
This is my dear friend Michael Fassbender.

664
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,120
He's dark and mysterious and you're making out.

665
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,240
Maybe you've seen his penis in the movies.

666
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,920
He is legally required to take it out during every one.

667
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
Here's the one thing that I learned you don't want to do as a wingman.

668
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,080
If your friend starts doing well with a lady or fella,

669
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,560
you don't want to start running around the bar screaming,

670
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,680
how am I going to get home?

671
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,400
My friend is doing well with a girl.

672
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,600
I don't know how to get home.

673
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,200
And then flapping your arms.

674
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,520
You know, Justin, you pointed out something earlier that it's just clicked to me.

675
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,480
That was a great point.

676
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,440
Oh, that's rare.

677
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,000
What'd I do?

678
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,400
Women are pack hunters.

679
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:48,960
Yeah.

680
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,720
So your job as wingman is to help your friend

681
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,920
not feel like he's singularly approaching a group of women.

682
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,920
So you're there with him.

683
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,800
You're backup to talk to other people.

684
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,280
So you got to tank the other women.

685
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,880
Yeah, but he's rogue.

686
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,920
He goes rogue and you tank.

687
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,600
He goes rogue and you're tanking.

688
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,600
Meanwhile, you can find a wizard.

689
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,720
The druid is in the corner healing you.

690
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,600
And by all means, when you're talking to this special somebody

691
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,120
that you're trying to connect with,

692
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,880
make sure you tell him that you're the rogue

693
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,000
and your friend is the tank

694
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,760
and he's tanking the mobs that came with it.

695
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,200
You're trying to DPS.

696
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,400
If she gets it and laughs, marry her.

697
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,160
Don't, no way.

698
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,840
No, cause she is probably being paid to seduce you, sir.

699
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,320
She is a spy.

700
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,760
She is a spy.

701
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,720
You're a dead man.

702
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:47,440
This is also such a great reminder of

703
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,040
it's so hard to meet people and found lasting relationship.

704
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,640
How do you meet anybody?

705
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,280
Anybody.

706
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,720
How do you make friends?

707
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,800
You know what I'm coming to realize in my life

708
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,320
is that it's just like when people try to come up with a formula

709
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,600
to help them figure out the winning lottery numbers

710
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,080
or to figure out what stocks are good.

711
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,520
There is no formula.

712
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,080
If I just have this wing man and go to this bar

713
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,560
and say this line, I'll meet the perfect person

714
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,520
and be happy forever.

715
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,720
Your best, the best thing that's working in your favor

716
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,440
is that everybody is equally desperate.

717
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,600
I just want a friend.

718
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,200
Please, please.

719
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,720
I need someone, please.

720
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,880
That could be your opening salvo.

721
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,160
Please, please.

722
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,840
I'm gonna lay it all out of line.

723
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,960
I'm super lonely.

724
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,400
Just a warm body to throw darts with, please.

725
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,920
Please just come hang.

726
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,200
And this is all, this is all of this question

727
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,360
and the answer is all predicated on a fiction

728
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,280
that things are a lot more tactical in a bar

729
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,640
than they actually are.

730
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:48,960
Yeah.

731
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,440
Really just have enough drinks that you think you're cool.

732
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:51,680
Yep.

733
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,880
I'm in dire need of advice on smiling.

734
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,200
I simply cannot do it on command for pictures.

735
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,040
It's not that I frown.

736
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,200
I just end up sarcastically smirking

737
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,040
or simply sitting there with my mouth agape.

738
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,960
People, especially my mother and girlfriend,

739
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,720
detest this shortcoming.

740
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,280
Please help.

741
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,440
That's from Expressionless in Pennsylvania.

742
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,680
Wow.

743
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,400
That's a good one.

744
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,240
You know what my jam was?

745
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,720
What was it?

746
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,320
I just found like a funny face.

747
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,280
Like what?

748
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,280
You know, and just pulled that in every picture

749
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,320
for like two years.

750
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:20,640
Okay.

751
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,360
I did that too.

752
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,840
And it's, I don't recommend it.

753
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:29,760
I, nobody has taken a good picture of me since 1991

754
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,560
when I was a baby and I got in a basket.

755
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,800
And someone took a picture of that.

756
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,240
But that's what, that's the problem, Griffin.

757
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,400
You used it all up when you were four.

758
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,240
In that one image that I lost it.

759
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,480
That one could be like a National Geographic

760
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,600
like cover of the month.

761
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:43,760
Yeah.

762
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,280
Babies in baskets issue.

763
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:45,440
Yeah.

764
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,720
Now National Geographic cover of the month,

765
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,240
is that a contest they run or?

766
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,560
I'm not familiar with National Geographic's

767
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,520
cover of the month contest.

768
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,400
I meant cover of the decade or like cover of the century.

769
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,200
But the time frame I pulled out was month.

770
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,280
I'm pretty sure every National Geographic cover

771
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,720
is a cover of the month.

772
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah.

773
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,880
Shut up, you guys.

774
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,520
When I smile, my teeth do a weird thing

775
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,280
where they like shoot in different directions.

776
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,680
Like a picket fence that got hit by a tornado.

777
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,960
And I get this crease in my forehead that I can't explain.

778
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,280
It's a vertical, which is a weird crease.

779
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,960
And then like my eyes turn like,

780
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,320
I would say like 45 degrees diagonally.

781
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,000
And I look like some sort of horrible ghoul.

782
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,880
Griffin's expression in pictures is reminiscent

783
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,160
of someone who's incredibly excited to be opening

784
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,560
a birthday present, but suspects it may be

785
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,320
the severed head of a dead puppy.

786
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,680
Like he's starting to think like, wait a minute, what if?

787
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,000
It's because you can see behind the eyes.

788
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,440
Behind the eyes, there's terror.

789
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,120
Like it's halfway between a genuine smile

790
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,160
and straight up Godfrey.

791
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,960
Like that's usually where I come in.

792
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,040
If I could land on either one of those extremes,

793
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,800
then it would be fine.

794
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,400
But I mean, that's a McElroy thing.

795
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,160
It's like if we smile too big,

796
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,920
our eyes just automatically close.

797
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,000
I don't know why that is.

798
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,040
I don't see.

799
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,840
I don't know.

800
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,680
My wife gets mad at me because I don't look.

801
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,520
I look silly in pictures.

802
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,200
I'm trying to what is finally started to pull me out of it

803
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,760
is when you're when you're taking the picture,

804
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,840
try to think about how the fact that you're not dead.

805
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,480
But someday someone might look at this picture

806
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,600
and you may be dead.

807
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,280
So you want to look happy about it.

808
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,560
You want to look happy now.

809
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,920
Help cheer them up.

810
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,480
You're gone.

811
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,840
You're not there to take care of them anymore.

812
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,160
So just put a smile on that phrase.

813
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,600
Kind of frown upside down.

814
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,320
You know, it's particularly troubling for me is that

815
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,560
I have a couple of friends here who have nice cameras.

816
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,640
And so they take a lot of pictures whenever we have,

817
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,240
you know, hang out events

818
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,800
and get a lot of candid pictures taken to me.

819
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:53,520
And I I never just my rest state is not very happy.

820
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,680
I look very, very sad and angry and like lost in thought

821
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,440
pretty much like ninety nine percent of the time.

822
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,920
Is that how people are naturally?

823
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,200
I mean, that's how you are naturally.

824
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,600
I was going to say I'm I'm pretty happy.

825
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Like most of the time I'm smiling a lot.

826
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,880
My eyes are alive.

827
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,120
We are we're at PAX East.

828
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,080
We're in Boston.

829
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,360
Boston last month.

830
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,200
I ran into John Drake, a friend of ours from harmonics.

831
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,520
He said, I ran into Griffin.

832
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,360
I said, yeah, he said, man, that guy is just over it.

833
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:30,960
What?

834
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,200
That's not the vibe I get from Griffin.

835
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,840
But I don't know.

836
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,000
Griff, maybe you're throwing out that over it vibe.

837
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,160
I think it's just that I'm a very I'm I'm just super intellectual,

838
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,280
you know, just yeah, that's that's probably I'm thinking

839
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,160
about the poetry that I read earlier that day and like what it means to me as a person.

840
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,040
You know, I don't really have time to think about like all the joy that is in life.

841
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,800
See, that's why if someone looks at me and they're trying to figure out what I'm thinking,

842
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,800
I'm loudly singing the Doug theme song inside of my head.

843
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,400
Is that and that kind of keeps me smiling.

844
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,480
Can someone just like tell me how to be happier?

845
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,880
Sing the Doug theme song inside of your head.

846
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:23,520
I'm just thinking about the Holocaust again.

847
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:24,960
Damn it.

848
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,480
How about Yahoo?

849
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,440
They usually cheers you up.

850
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,000
OK, I'm not thinking about the Holocaust.

851
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,480
How about a Yahoo answer?

852
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,480
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Steve Lewis is by asked by Yahoo.

853
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,560
Answers user Jerry Brewer, who asks.

854
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,560
How do I get my dogs to romantically eat spaghetti?

855
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,480
I have a cocker spaniel and some kind of mutt.

856
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,400
I have a little table set up in a replica,

857
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,880
authentic Italian restaurant built in my basement.

858
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,600
I have tried everything to get these dogs to eat romantically,

859
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,960
but they do the exact opposite.

860
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,560
In fact, they just eat it really fast and fight each other for the spaghetti.

861
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,920
I don't know what else to do.

862
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,520
I am very serious about this.

863
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,000
Please only serious answers.

864
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,880
Taxidermy.

865
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,840
Tiger.

866
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,280
Tiger can't change his stripes.

867
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,520
Dogs can't change the way.

868
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,760
They'll just eat this.

869
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,720
They'll just eat fucking.

870
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,240
They'll just eat fucking spaghetti.

871
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,840
They'll eat anything you put in front of them.

872
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,680
You can't say.

873
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,200
Hey, slow down.

874
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,720
You can't teach a fucking cocker spaniel cotillion, you dummy.

875
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,600
Well, not, not easily.

876
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,240
Not easily.

877
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:36,960
It takes time.

878
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,800
I bet Caesar could do it.

879
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:39,920
Caesar could.

880
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,240
Your only hope is to find Caesar, the dog whisperer, to come to your house.

881
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:44,640
Yep.

882
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,360
Yep.

883
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,560
And the dog's like, oh, he's right.

884
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,560
He's like, sit, shake, salad fort goes on the left.

885
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,040
Please put the napkin in your lap.

886
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,800
No, red wine goes with pasta.

887
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,520
Damn it.

888
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:55,920
Coordinating.

889
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,200
Your problem is your pasta noodles.

890
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,400
They're not long enough.

891
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:00,640
Yeah.

892
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,520
Yeah, you need one long noodle.

893
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,720
You guys want to know God's honest from watching Lady and the Tramp?

894
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,000
I used to think that spaghetti was made with one big, huge, long noodle.

895
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,640
Animation has given you that impression for years.

896
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:20,400
How many times have you seen a character put a fork into a big plate of spaghetti and turn it

897
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,160
and turn it and turn it and it's all in the fork?

898
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,680
And oh my God, I've been on accents for like a week and a half and I'm losing my mind.

899
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,160
I have to eat something.

900
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:28,880
Are you back in?

901
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,040
Are you back on trying to get that ketosis?

902
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,680
God, I just really got to get ketosis.

903
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,800
I got to get fit.

904
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,080
We got Max Fun Con coming up June 1st.

905
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,080
I'm going to be hobnobbing.

906
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:45,200
I guess I could say hobnobbing with our friends, John Hodgman, John Roderick,

907
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,160
Chuck Bryant from Some of You Should Know.

908
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,520
The one takeaway I want everybody to have from Max Fun Con is, wow, Justin has got a hard body.

909
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:55,760
Yeah.

910
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,880
How was your Max Fun Con?

911
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,000
It was okay.

912
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,600
Justin was looking great.

913
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,400
I've never met him before, but I could just tell that his body's gotten significantly harder.

914
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,680
I think he's on ketosis.

915
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,880
He's inspired me to make another Long Winter's album.

916
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,400
I'm really going to finish it now.

917
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,800
This one's called Justin's Ass is Rockin'.

918
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,200
Yeah, it's called Rockin' Justin's Ketosis Fine Ass.

919
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,360
So anyway, yeah, I just really would like some pasta.

920
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,400
I'm literally considering, well, I'll actually get some spaghetti squash for lunch.

921
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,160
Is that where you take squash and you noodle it down?

922
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,520
You get it in the spaghetti?

923
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,520
No, it's like a type of squash.

924
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,320
You cook it in the microwave for like six minutes, and then you scrape it with a fork,

925
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:40,240
and it's basically like spaghetti noodles.

926
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:40,960
Basically.

927
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,040
Wow, that sounds really sad.

928
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,080
That sounds like the saddest.

929
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,600
Well, it's healthy.

930
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,320
You like health.

931
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,640
You want to live forever, don't you?

932
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,040
I do.

933
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:49,200
No.

934
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:56,000
I'm never going to die.

935
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,880
Oh, youth.

936
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,160
I remember that feeling.

937
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,680
Going around, sex anything that walks.

938
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:02,800
Drinking anything.

939
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,160
Sexting anything that can read.

940
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,520
Drink anything that'll melt.

941
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:08,880
I've been there.

942
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,760
Eating anything that casts a shadow.

943
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,000
Eating anything that casts a shadow.

944
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,600
I've lived that life.

945
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,320
Shooting up anything that walks.

946
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,520
I've been there.

947
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,360
We've all toured with the stones.

948
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,400
You guys aren't cool.

949
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,000
Snorting anything that'll grind.

950
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,880
Ah, god damn it.

951
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,280
What are you going to go with?

952
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,920
Putting long cylindrical objects in your ears.

953
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,600
Making, putting down anything that'll congeal.

954
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,160
I've been there.

955
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,000
Experimenting.

956
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,520
It's the 80s.

957
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,880
Something about your butthole and doing stuff to it.

958
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,680
Picking stuff up with your butthole.

959
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,320
You've been there.

960
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,400
I was in Blue Man Group.

961
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,000
I know how these things go.

962
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,080
I know how kids are.

963
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,600
Are we helping this guy with the dogs?

964
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,640
I wasn't paying attention.

965
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,720
Yeah, I pretty much erased him from the planet with my thoughts.

966
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,480
Perfect for choosing these questions.

967
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,440
You'd think he would choose people that he thinks we can help.

968
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,040
People who we can reach out to.

969
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,120
I imagine it would be easier to find people willing to dress up like Lady in the Tramp

970
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,920
and eat spaghetti for you in your tiny basement Italian restaurant than to train dogs to do it.

971
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,640
There is only one way that fucking short story ends and it's with Chop, Chop, Chop,

972
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,800
Trunk Clothes, Broom, Lake, Park, Splash.

973
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,400
Well, that's the end.

974
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,000
That's the whole Lifetime movie.

975
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,840
Lifetime movie, book.

976
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,160
And all that would be predicated on jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk.

977
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,800
Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk.

978
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,800
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop,

979
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,680
chop, chop, chop.

980
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,720
Trunk, drive, jerk, jerk, jerk a little bit, splash.

981
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,360
Jerk, jerk, jerk to fall asleep.

982
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,520
Get home, clean up the spaghetti.

983
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,160
Lifetime movie.

984
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,080
And jerk it to the Lifetime movie.

985
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,600
Go to the office the next day.

986
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,120
How was your weekend?

987
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,840
Tell everyone about it.

988
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,040
Oh, it was great.

989
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,640
How was your weekend, President Obama?

990
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,840
Horrible secret revealed.

991
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,160
What a reveal though.

992
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:13,440
This episode of my brother, my brother and me was paid for by the campaign to elect Mitt Romney.

993
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,600
President Obama is definitely, definitely a lady in the Tramp murder fetishist.

994
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,160
He's the lady in the Tramp killer.

995
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,800
Connor, good job.

996
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,640
Good job, FBI.

997
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,720
Nice job, Sherlock.

998
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,200
Oh, I'll say Sherlock.

999
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,640
How long before, how long before presidential campaigns start taking us to the money zone?

1000
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,720
Would you guys even care like who, who we affiliated ourselves with as long as we got

1001
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,600
that, do I care?

1002
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:45,840
Yeah.

1003
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:49,200
If we got like a big enough hunk of that super pack pie.

1004
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,720
Oh, you saying that I would do Nader.

1005
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:53,600
Yeah.

1006
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,320
And a heartbeat.

1007
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,040
He's got that.

1008
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:55,520
Right.

1009
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,560
He's coming back.

1010
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,160
I'll do Gingrich at this point.

1011
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,000
Just because he's adorable.

1012
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,240
And by do you're talking about fucking them, right?

1013
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:02,960
No, Griffin.

1014
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,080
I would do an ad for them, a commercial for them.

1015
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:13,280
You haven't looked at Gingrich's chunky dumps and been like, I could, I could see myself in that.

1016
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,320
No, I, I no way.

1017
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,680
Cause I'm planning on having cancer someday and I want somebody who's going to stick by me.

1018
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,240
That doesn't, that doesn't fit the bill with him at all.

1019
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,080
See now we'll never get sponsors.

1020
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:26,480
Great.

1021
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:27,680
Damn it.

1022
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,400
Damn it.

1023
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,320
We're never going to get political ads at this rate.

1024
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:30,880
Oh shit.

1025
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,000
So, Hey, this has been our advice show.

1026
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,040
My brother, my brother, me, it's modern era and everything.

1027
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,800
I'm Justin, the oldest one.

1028
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,120
Whatever.

1029
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,280
I'm Travis and I'm the middle.

1030
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,800
Why are we doing it again?

1031
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,840
No, we're starting again.

1032
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,720
I want to do it over.

1033
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,440
I did it wrong.

1034
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,240
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show.

1035
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,360
We want to welcome our new Tony award-winning fan, Lin-Manuel Miranda.

1036
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,320
It's super good to have you on board.

1037
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,000
Thanks to everybody else tweeting about the show.

1038
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,920
If you get a Tony, let us know.

1039
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,360
We'll say your name on the show.

1040
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:03,520
Yeah.

1041
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,520
That's, that is the new barrier for entry.

1042
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,960
We hit 100 and we just raised the stakes.

1043
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,480
Rod as I roar.

1044
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,320
RD awesome.

1045
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,560
Our dear, dear friend, Eric Nier.

1046
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,400
Sean Fish.

1047
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,920
I almost said Travis McElroy.

1048
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:18,800
Yay.

1049
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,320
Hooray for me.

1050
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,080
Incredible K.

1051
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,040
Uh, Joseph Bloomberg, Thrashworth, Ross Butler, everybody.

1052
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,760
Flame Drake's, uh, we, we super appreciate, uh, everybody tweeting about the show and,

1053
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,920
and, and helping us to spread the word.

1054
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,920
Um, you're the only reason that we are still doing this and the fact that we like to talk

1055
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,240
to each other, but other than those two things, that's the only reason.

1056
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,480
So thank you for spreading it.

1057
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:50,880
If you get a second this week, um, tweet about the show with the NBNB AM hashtag and make

1058
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,280
sure to include that bit.ly forward slash.

1059
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,080
It's my boom, bam.

1060
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,080
That's our sampler and it's a fun way to get people in the program or just tell a friend

1061
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,440
about it in the meat space.

1062
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:00,480
Yeah.

1063
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:04,960
Tell a real world friend if you can still have those, um, just hand them a CD and say

1064
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,760
you're welcome.

1065
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,260
Yeah.

1066
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,880
And then make them listen to the podcast.

1067
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,920
Uh, I want to thank everybody who, who gave us well wishes on our hundredth episode.

1068
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,280
That meant a lot to me.

1069
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,720
Um, I also want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme

1070
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,120
song.

1071
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,400
It's a departure off their album, putting the days to bed.

1072
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:29,680
Uh, it's a, it's a super good album and that song is on it and it's a super good song.

1073
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:34,080
So, so go purchase that on Amazon, MP3 and iTunes and vinyl.

1074
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,520
And I want to thank rental floss for sponsoring this week's episode.

1075
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,880
Make sure to go to rental floss.com and pre-order the CD pre-order ends on April 26.

1076
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,080
So hurry up, Griffin, bring us home.

1077
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,720
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by Mike Sherwin.

1078
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,440
Thank you, Mike.

1079
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,200
It's by Yahoo answers user, Mr. Dang, who asks, how long have you had a crush on Gary

1080
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:57,920
Busey?

1081
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,360
I'm Justin McElroy.

1082
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,560
I'm Travis McElroy.

1083
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,600
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1084
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,360
This is me, my brother, my brother and me.

1085
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,320
It's your dad.

1086
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,680
School wear on the lips.

1087
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,640
Keep your heart three stacks.

1088
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,080
Keep your heart three stacks.

1089
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,040
Keep your heart.

1090
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,200
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

1091
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,240
Keep your heart.

1092
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,240
Man, these girls are smart three stacks.

1093
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,360
These girls are smart.

1094
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:45,600
Play your part, play your part.
