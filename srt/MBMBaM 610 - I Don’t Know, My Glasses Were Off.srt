1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,100
I'll just sign you can't control what your voice sounds like yeah, really that's a great SNL character

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,340
I don't know if you ever

19
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,020
If you ever heard about that it's also kind of like the one thing we do for a living on a regular basis

20
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,340
It's make the voice sound like something else. Yeah, I mean, I don't know I I I just want everybody at home to know

21
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,940
I'm not sad

22
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:28,560
Cuz I ate I ate so many fucking acai super berries this morning, and it's got did you hear me laugh? Yeah?

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,740
Yeah, that was better. I like that intentional or did it just slip out it just came out cuz I was thinking about all the delicious

24
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,640
Big and juicy acai berries that stained my fingers when I ate him like a naughty boy in grandma's garden

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,080
And so I do feel I feel so I feel good and strong and powerful and energetic and

26
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,460
That so look, but go I have layers

27
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,420
Behind my behind the sad the obvious sad behind blue eyes

28
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,940
Did you guys hear about what James Cromwell did I did actually I don't know

29
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,060
I don't I don't know James Cromwell from Madden, okay?

30
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,940
He's the farmer from babe, but he's the farmer from babe and other things

31
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,860
Oh, all right from babe, and he did that'll do I think he was probably in Star Trek, and he's in secession

32
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,580
Oh, he was definitely in Star Trek. He was the he invented the war the warp drive for crying out loud

33
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,060
But that's not really what's important Griffin. I want to tell you about what James Cromwell did

34
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Uh-huh

35
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,700
James Cromwell got himself in a little bit of a sticky situation

36
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,460
Cuz what happened Griff is that James Cromwell popular old man James Cromwell

37
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,560
Superglued himself to the counter of a Starbucks in New York. Yes. Yes

38
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
Which part of himself?

39
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,140
And he superglued his hands to the counter

40
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,780
To protest the fact that they up charge for vegan milk

41
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
All right

42
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,020
Can you imagine you're just trying to get through your day

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,980
You see the farmer from babe, and he's like check this out. I'm a sticky bandit. Yeah, he loses his hands

44
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,380
To the counter, and that's your day, but it feels like I could get I

45
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,300
could hand my credit card to the cashier and receive my

46
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,100
expensive

47
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,820
You know

48
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,660
oat milk latte

49
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:36,180
Like around James Cromwell, do you know I mean like he's got gaps like we could go through the armpit or between the legs

50
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,220
Like there's a lot of ways to get coffee past Jim Jim Cromwell. I feel like

51
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,380
Could you hand me the

52
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
Oh

53
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,260
This story stick in your mouth for a second, please thank you Jim if you're listening

54
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,300
I understand it is I would say a bad practice because it discourages the ordering of the vegan option

55
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,480
And it's unfair to people who can't have you know that would do I get it

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,860
I get the environment to yeah for sure I like Jim

57
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,060
But you know it's not the person behind the counter who sets the prices right here

58
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,820
You know that right Jim Jim that person with a trendy haircut and like a dyed hair

59
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,020
That's not the color that appears in nature Travis

60
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,020
He was not protesting that morning that his cough his personal

61
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,060
superglue in his pocket

62
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,820
And he was like how much for a bit fuck that yeah

63
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,140
But he actually he actually loudly announced several times don't get it twisted. I have 70 cents

64
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,780
I mean the only person he's inconvenient like yes

65
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,980
That's gonna make its way up the chain to mr.

66
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,900
Coffee who's kind of an asshole about it or whatever but that person the person he's inconveniencing is the person who's just like

67
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,500
Listen, man. I'm just counting down until my break. Please please Jim. I need these tips Jim, please

68
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,180
Um yeah, what's your all's favorite way to sort of sneak a coffee past James and sticky James Cromwell like

69
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,460
under the right arm

70
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,820
Under the right arm, and then I'd like to stick my arm in there and pretend like it. I'm James Cromwell

71
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,140
I'm gonna scratch my nose

72
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,900
I would do like a high-five with his free hand and

73
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:24,240
Then when his arm was up like he has made a defensive sort of gap in the in his in his sticky armor

74
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,500
And I would definitely get one past him did he just do one hand I?

75
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,380
Guess he would have to well no no he did both hands

76
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,940
I think how did he get out of this how do you get out of this it says that he used a knife?

77
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,180
Oh, no, yeah, yeah nail polish remover will take care of that Jim

78
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,980
I mean if he if you bring nail polish remover to your superglue protest

79
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,660
You're basically saying like I'm not really committed

80
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,740
I like a minute, but I will also say if he did both hands then someone else had to wield the knife

81
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,180
At actor James Cromwell use his mouth use his fucking mouth

82
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,660
Finally they had Sir Paul McCartney write a letter to this former CEO of Starbucks to ask that they would eliminate the extra vegan

83
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,580
Milk fee yeah, because they did that in the UK and so he's probably like all right check it out. It's good. Yeah

84
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,060
Well won't you strike McCartney or James Cromwell strike it down of it over there

85
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,100
And then this that was that was Sir Paul McCartney speaking to former CEO Kevin Johnson

86
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,940
Which I guess he was like can you please ask the real CEO?

87
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,900
To stop doing it that way. It's me Sir Paul McCartney. I'm not sure how business works

88
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,500
Are you his dad is that it, but if you would tell him?

89
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,900
Okay, so I watch the video. He did glue one hand

90
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,500
Oh, that's how like just so he did have one hand free. Yeah give thumbs up to local tourists or whatever do you think?

91
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,140
He did that first hand and the people behind the counter like waited

92
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,540
Expectantly for him to do the second hand too, and then when they didn't he was like oh, oh

93
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Okay, I guess I just okay

94
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,420
And the heartbreaking thing is this is an autograph in hand that he glued down

95
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,340
So he couldn't even like you know spend some face time with the with the fans

96
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,760
That was anyone can draft an email to former CEO Kevin Johnson

97
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,300
But Sir Paul McCartney's never gonna glue his hand to the counter of an American Starbucks

98
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,480
I think that they I I like to imagine that they had to talk him down to gluing his hand to the counter like

99
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:39,820
I'm gonna go to Starbucks, and I'm gonna blow myself up like well no James Jim Jim. That's too far. He's like okay

100
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,100
Well, I'm just gonna cut my legs off like now. I don't think so. Okay. I'll cut my hands off. No Jim

101
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,700
I don't want that either. Can I super glue both my hands to the counter getting closer warmer?

102
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,300
Just I'm gonna super glue my testicles to the count

103
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,340
We told you a thousand times. You can't do that if you want to do that at home. That's your thing

104
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,300
Just what the one hand I'll just glue one hand to the counter. I was can't why would you do one finger Jim listen?

105
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,780
I'm drawing the line at one hand principles if I attempted this which I fucking wouldn't but if I attempted this I

106
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,900
Could I be crazy became a thing Griffin? I would love it. This is the new

107
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,500
Starbucks the glue yourself to a Starbucks challenge

108
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,180
From the creators of punch your teacher comes the glue yourself to the star

109
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,700
I feel like if I I could go on I could not eat or drink for a day

110
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:40,900
I could fast for a day and then slap my sticky hand down on that counter and within I'd say two seconds

111
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,660
I my brain would immediately go. Hey piss sounds pretty good right about now, doesn't it?

112
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,380
Brain I literally

113
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,660
Pissed right before I pissed and then I put the super glue on my hand and then I slapped it down and my brain

114
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,340
Yeah, I know but oh, yeah. Did you get it all out?

115
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,660
It doesn't feel like I had to go to the the you know politics corner

116
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
across from Baskin-Robbins

117
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Happens on a day. Yeah, definitely. I went with Sid to like do the honking waves thing with cars drive by she asked me

118
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,180
I was like, wait a minute

119
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,980
You want me to stand?

120
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,980
For one hour in a unbathroomed locale just like standing there

121
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,740
So I couldn't leave to go use the bathroom at home if I wanted to write so one full hour and damned

122
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,580
It's the first car honks. I didn't have to like immediately use the bathroom. Like I have to be right now. It's it's urgent

123
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,300
Yeah, you're a great husband Justin. Thank you for making that sacrifice. That means a lot. I'm sure means a lot to your wife

124
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,440
I just pissed pants. Yeah. Oh, well that actually I think makes you let me check the chart a slightly worse husband

125
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,280
Oh, no, but I but in the but in the Cromwell power rankings, you've moved up there

126
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,660
Yeah, you're still out there, but you moved up for the sacrifice, but then you moved slightly down

127
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,260
So a net positive you crumbed extremely well. Yeah, you crumbed hard

128
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,720
My name that's what he has when he reaches his next level crumb heart. Yeah, when you use a moonstone on it

129
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
Then he's Jim crumb hard

130
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,180
You sticky slap crumb hard crumb hard

131
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,780
Crumb hard use something. Oh, that's not what I thought sticky slap was crumb hard. Don't ever do that move again

132
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,180
Delete that move put in quick attack. That's suck crumb hard

133
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm going to

134
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,300
Do rail us from this comedy gold for a moment just to say thank you to everybody because I didn't get to say this last

135
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,360
Week who became a new upgrading or boosting member?

136
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,420
And also in case you missed it cuz man there I don't know if you guys are gonna believe this

137
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,580
But there's some lucky few who are not on the social media. Yeah, we had to do a lot of dumb shit

138
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Because you guys were very supportive

139
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:56,260
That included let's see macro mix-up or my brother my brother and me remix whatever we called it where we did

Redid an episode

141
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,260
In the 300s, I think of my brother my brother and me and we switched parts

142
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,880
So I was just it was Griffin Griffin was Travis. It was silly. The drive is over. We don't have to sell

143
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm just letting people know that it's there in case they didn't see it on social media

144
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:22,220
But also we had to get each other haunted dolls. Oh, yeah, I'm not arrived yet. So are you sure I got it

Like cuz you did an unboxing video. I've been waiting for like a good muscle day, you know

153
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:12,200
Yeah, like it's today a good muscle day act. Yeah a day where I look not having done anything but like I

154
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,260
Just happened to look jacked and swole. Oh, yeah

155
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,700
Yeah, yeah

156
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,740
Like maybe you drank a lot of water the day before you retained all of it and all of it somehow went right to my muscles

157
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,380
Yeah, yeah for like a really strong muscle day. Well, I actually mean neutral Roberta have really been hitting it off

158
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,740
She liked black coffee and gardening. Yeah, so I give her a little bit

159
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,580
Coffee every day. Have you heard the night yelling? Yeah, no, because I think I've been keeping her in a pretty good mood

160
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,220
So she hasn't been sad. I think that we're getting well it has nothing to do with her emotional

161
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,780
State it's like when she when she fills up with spectral energy

162
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,700
She lets it out by yelling really really loud when the moon and stars are out

163
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,760
okay, yeah, so it's like it's less like a

164
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,600
Feared yelling and more of like a you know steam escaping a kettle. Oh

165
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Okay

166
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,340
You're gonna love it though. You're gonna really like the way it feels I guarantee it now

167
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:16,760
I have noticed in the listing it says unexplained sounds and movement, but I also have two dogs and a five-year-old and a two-year-old

168
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,360
So it's always hard to tell

169
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,840
Which of those is moving at any time? Yeah, just assume it's neutral Roberta. Uh-huh. Okay

170
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,760
Now it also says and I love this that a lot of the information about her

171
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,240
Comes to the seller via smoke work. That's like hell. Yeah. Okay. Yeah

172
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,600
No, she does vape tricks for sure. Yeah, I love that

173
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,840
Well, we're gonna have these things in our rooms where you can see them and they can see us for one calendar year

174
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,960
So I can't wait to see how we really settle into the space. I am I am I will say this

175
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,200
Uh a little confused and Justin you're a bit more of a hundred doll expert. So maybe you can explain this to me

176
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,840
This line Roberta is a good spirit. I put the neutral label as she has a very sad disposition

177
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,000
If you had a sad friend who is good all the time

178
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,560
I think it would be positive is it that her sad disposition brings her spirit down to neutral because that's a bummer

179
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,840
It's cuz it's all garbage. Oh, okay. Great. Yeah. I don't want to punch

180
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:26,640
Down or up or sideways, but the thing is about it is it's all nonsense. I think at this point

181
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,360
They're mostly generated by AI. This is my current theory that there's a that there's a robot

182
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,480
it wouldn't be hard by the way to make a robot that just like

183
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,960
buys

184
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,680
untended

185
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,120
Shipping containers full of disused dolls all individually generates all drop shipper

186
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah

187
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Bezos drones are bringing haunted dolls one last thing I'll say about neutral bird is a real

188
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm just gonna say a real steal a real bargain cuz she came with her own chair

189
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,520
So I got a hundred eyes and her own chair now the chair if you watch the unboxing

190
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,180
Came with I'm gonna say about an inch and a half long spike on it

191
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,280
Then I think you're supposed to jam her butt down on to keep her in place

192
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,560
I removed that spike and I'm hoping that will help with her sad disposition. It will certainly keep her more

193
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
neutral

194
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,440
Yes, if someone said hey for the rest of a training you're trapped in this doll

195
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,080
I'd be like, ah bummer and also also you'll be impaled ass-wise

196
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,600
I would not be wild about that scenario remain neutral though while while this happens

197
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,120
This is I don't know if you've heard but it's an advice show

198
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,840
And what we do is we take your questions in terms of alchemy like into wisdom

199
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,440
And I am very much looking forward to helping you our beloved listeners. Oh great

200
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm in a thrift shop checking out some cassette tape decks

201
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,580
I hit a jacked on one and there happens to be a recording tape in it with no markings on it

202
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,840
I am dying to hear what is on the cassette, but I'm not interested in buying the deck

203
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,060
Is it stealing if I just take the tape?

204
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,400
Technically the tape is not for sale, right? That's from copping cassettes in Colorado. Hmm. Hmm

205
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,480
Well, you take a you take a thing without paying for it

206
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,320
You know, I have a friend who would be really helpful with this and his name is Macklemore

207
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,740
What what what what what is Macklemore how's it going?

208
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,880
Not good. No, that's I I'm hearing it. It's okay. I was had to step away. Sorry. That's just how I answer the phone

209
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,920
Hey Macklemore, how's it going? It's going pretty good. How's it going? You sound exactly the fucking same as my middle brother so close to Travis

210
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
It's all right. Yeah, I've heard that before

211
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,640
Try clearing your throat. Yeah, I'm like Macklemore. Yes me Macklemore

212
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,760
What's up, Justin J dog? Hey, hey M money. Um, I uh, I

213
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,720

214
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:03,240
Yeah, you're listening to our live record. Yeah, baby. Hey Macklemore. I want you I would can you say his name again?

215
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,680
It don't stumble, please. Yeah, so it sucks. Hi Macklemore. I'm Griffin McElroy. Hi Griffin. How do you like it?

216
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680

217
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,720
Griffin McLeroy, huh? I just wanted to let you know that you talk cool. Oh, thank you so much, man

218
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,880
All right, you're back in it. Yeah, okay, so your voice is cool in the way you the words you pick is cool

219
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh, thanks dog

220
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,560

221
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Is that okay? Yeah, Benjamin. You just call me Jamin

222
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Jamin

223
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,360
It's crazy that you had you changed your name and you didn't make it been Jamin cuz that like

224
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Jamin, yeah

225
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,080
Yeah

226
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
That's what my best friends call me

227
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Been Jamin. Okay. So like here's the deal with this is like what he is it stealing if you take a tape out

228
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
Of a tape deck at a thrift shop. Oh

229
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,520
I'd say it's a package deal if it's in there. That's part of it, right?

230
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,320
You wouldn't find a deck of cards at a thrift shop and say well, I can just take the ace of hearts, right?

231
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
It's in there. It's in the package

232
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,720
So is it I'm confused by heat by that

233
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
shit

234
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,840
How's Ryan doing Ryan Lewis? Yeah, we don't talk anymore. We don't talk anyway, you know, yeah. Oh dang. I'm sorry

235
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,000
No, it's it's about an eboard

236
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,960
Hey, is it true back of war that you have a

237
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
painting of a nude Justin Bieber

238
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,680
Yeah, it wasn't new to start off with but I every time

239
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,280
On the club, you know, it's every time I looked away the picture got neuter and neuter and

240
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,920
Somewhere Justin Bieber wore more and more clothes. It was really weird man. It was totally messed up

241
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,080
I don't want to talk to you anymore. Why yes you do. We just started talking about this

242
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,400
I know, but I don't really want to talk. Hold on. Let me message you guys a nude painting of Justin Bieber. No, I

243
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,600
Already have it. Oh

244
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,920
Too late. That's cool. Why did you send this to me?

245
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,600
Because this is a painting of McLemore owns. Hey, anyways, this tapes probably haunted. I gotta go. Bye

246
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,080
I can't believe that we had a McLemore on the show. We didn't ask him about

247
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Like any of his other works?

248
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,600
Did his other saw the one song that he did that was supposed to heal the world. Yeah that number. Yeah

249
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,200
Same love same. Yeah, is that what you're thinking?

250
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
Oh, there was also the time that he said like a great white shark on shark week, and that was pretty good

251
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,980
I like that one. Yeah, so we've actually reached I've reached the McLemore

252
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,480
Horizon, right? Oh, no. Yeah, I don't want mess up way to talk about our cousin. You want to talk about a McAless?

253
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
This fucking hell dude. So

254
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,400
Yes, the

255
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,400
The wizard sent sent us in this one by actually oh the wizard sent it. No art sent approach me

256
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,500
This is the lowest art Senate and thank you are it's the lowest score. I've seen this one has a

257
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:12,020
50 percent rating. I didn't realize there were ratings. There are there are and I'm sorry, that's the lowest you've ever seen 50%

258
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,260
Yeah, so holy shit. It's got 43 co-authors Wow

259
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,540
Takes a village if one of them voted a hundred percent on it

260
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,540
It would definitely be higher than this right who's not pulling their weight

261
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,120
Yeah, I don't I I there's no credits on it

262
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,500
So I can't say but it is how to use chocolate to spice up your relationship

263
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,180
Oh, yeah, chocolate and romance are often considered to go hand-in-hand in the love department. In fact offering

264
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm sorry Griffin one one quick note. Yeah, did you say love again with a couple more O's in it?

265
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,180
Department in fact offering a box of delectable fine chocolates on Valentine's Day to your lover is a common standard

266
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,820
Standard historically considered to be an aphrodisiac inciting passion and attraction. Do you already know what it is?

267
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,720
Yeah, so let's get a cow and you get rock-hard. Yeah, the cacao makes you turgid. So

268
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,060
Turgid enough to hold up a syrupy pancake. Yeah

269
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,460
He is gonna know you don't have to be careful too much chocolate will turn it fully into a pancake

270
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:27,140
You gotta be so careful starts if you get to turgid spreads out left to right and you are gonna hate that the way that feels

271
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,620
Yeah

272
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,180
So it's first step out of what is just all of them are so good

273
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,020
But the first one is conduct a sexy chocolate treasure hunt

274
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,280
Huh?

275
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,260
Choose a child choose a time when the kids are with friends and create a steamy game of chocolate hide-and-go-seek

276
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
Don't tell your signal about I

277
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:53,120
Mean it does it's just implied right is in my butt it is if they're the instant the map you had all the clues with

278
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,060
The milk milk lemonade turn around for just me you had everything you needed to solve the case

279
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,260
Don't tell your significant other just allude to an evening of intimacy and to quote be ready

280
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,940
Okay. Okay. Okay. How do you allude?

281
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:14,380
To a sexy chocolate treasure hunt without explicitly saying that in a way that's that is not concerning

282
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,480
Yeah, I mean if anyone tell if if my wife tells me hey, just so you know

283
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,400
It's gonna get steamy tonight. Be ready. Be ready

284
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,480
I don't like that actually gives me less information. Yeah, and if she just had told me nothing

285
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah, like that's gonna send me into a bit of a bit of a panic

286
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,180
Just get just say you're gonna be looking for some clues. What did you do?

287
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,760
I just don't worry about a there's some stuff hidden around what it what did you do?

288
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,800
The friends are with the kids be ready

289
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
create

290
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Purchase a large box of pre-wrapped chocolates preferably your partner's favorites created either a trail of chocolate pieces and rose petals

291
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,560
Leading to the boudoir or devise an interactive treasure hunt. I got dogs. I can't do that

292
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,480
Yeah, that's a really excellent point. Well, the dogs are with friends, too

293
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,040
And with dog friends or with people friends watching them it couldn't matter less their dog

294
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,760
It does matter if there were dog friends

295
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,360
They're gonna get up to shenanigans and chasing alley cats and knock over trash cans for treasure hunt clues

296
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,040
We've both humor and romance into the text such as

297
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,240
Find your next treat in the place where I take my evening seat a favorite bathroom

298
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
No a favorite a favorite sofa

299
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
That's a toilet for sure

300
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,880
And then leave a small clue with each piece of chocolate until the hunt culminates either in the bedroom or a cozy area of your home

301
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,500
Where you have arranged for a romantic dinner for two and then can't stress enough to and I can't believe they didn't include this the instructions

302
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,280
Turn the air conditioning way up because you do not want to like hide chocolate like in the couch on like a 90-degree day or some

303
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,840
Shit, yeah, I hope you fucking ruined the count. What had like and this is all goop in my head

304
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,040
What have you done?

305
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,920
The end of the chocolate treasure hunt could involve you smothered in chocolate or at least with chocolates

306
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,880
Waffle house hash brown, baby. What how did he die? Well

307
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
smothered and covered

308
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,680
So now we're looking at step two, which is make a playlist of music featuring chocolate

309
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,280
Term chocolate chocolate rain by Taze on day chocolate rain remix

310
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,840
chocolate rain radio edit chubby rain

311
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Just be gone from fucking

312
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,040
No, it was both finger both finger. Yeah, it's Christ

313
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,320
I mean what a gimme chocolate by babymetal is gonna be it's gonna really get the party started

314
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
a

315
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,600
Simple search using the term chocolate on music programs such as iTunes will reward you with numerous tracks based on chocolate or chocolate themes

316
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,040
Can I jump back a second to say that individually pre-wrapped chocolates to make a trail is a lot of work

317
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,840
I think a lot of litter. Yeah a much more I would say direct and easy to accomplish thing

318
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Just grab like a bottle of chocolate syrup

319
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,720
Start at one point and just like squeeze it into a line. Yeah create a trail

320
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,560
That's a much clearer slippery fun trail and then you just walk and you lick lick it off the ground

321
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,120
Yeah

322
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,040
Like like a dog like a sick dog take a bath in chocolate

323
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,800
Skip squeezing the Hershey's syrup in the tub and do a chocolate bath the right way

324
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,960
While the internet is loaded with plenty of chocolate bath recipes

325
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,560
You might try wiki house own chocolate bath recipe or a chocolate bubble bath

326
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Don't like the chalk don't eat that it says don't eat the chocolate because your stinky bodies in there

327
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,480
So wait, is it literally just first of all the amount of chocolate syrup one would have to buy to fill a

328
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Bathtub well, no

329
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,840
I think it's I think it's saying that you fill it with water and then you sort of like make it a hot cocoa

330
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,880
situation

331
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,800
Gross, I mean we've all seen that scene where Augustus gloop goes up the tube and you're like god

332
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I wish that was me getting school

333
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,800
big tube

334
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:05,240
Incorrect. That's the worst. Yeah, it's a weird white kind of weird milky looking chocolate gross

335
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,520
That was not he was not drunk that that large boy was not drowned in white chocolate, you know that no

336
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,960
It wasn't white chocolate, but it was like a pale tan. It was not like so it was it's rough

337
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,360
Yeah, they I don't think that they could figure out how to make it look right

338
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,960
and so yeah, I came up with some bullshit about like, oh, yeah, this is a

339
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
On

340
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:33,640
Unhomogenized chocolate or something. It's rad. It's crazy. Yeah, it looks like fucking muddy river water. It does not look like chocolate

341
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,680
Yeah

342
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:41,160
I mean of all the ways to drown that that child who made the mistake of wanting to eat chocolate during his tour of the chocolate

343
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,920
Factory we're in a room where everything was edible or my edible. Yeah, which he was condemned to death

344
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,740
Yeah, he was told to eat. He's

345
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,860
like he was and then he ate and then they were like now you get drought and

346
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,500
He was saying a whimsical song and he was the first one to go

347
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,900
Yeah, not not like the kid who like or the kid who like went into a room is like I want to test out this

348
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Cool technology. I'm a fucking child

349
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,880
Technology can put me on TV. Yeah, I want to do it

350
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,020
Anyway, have chocolate on the menu for breakfast lunch or dinner

351
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,940
You're gonna be pretty sick of it some examples beef stew with chocolate

352
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,380
Well, I guess not a white night teeny which I guess has white chocolate in it

353
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:30,860
I mean you could do like a mole which would be that would be nice. Chris Kohler's got a real nice recipe for

354
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,780
Japanese curry that has chocolate

355
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,940
It's actually really good try body painting with chocolate

356
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Yeah, I mean that sounds good to me too

357
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:49,780
I found a recipe by the way for chocolate milk bath. If you want to do that, you dust dump a cup of powdered milk

358
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:57,260
Tablespoons of cocoa powder and a tablespoon of cornstarch. Yeah a tub and then you just do that. Yeah

359
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,020
Can't be enough. I love taking a bath where I have to take another bath

360
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,980
Right after like I have to get directly the shower and clean on vomit

361
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,420
And then clean the shower because you've left a big a big brown mess everywhere in it

362
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
I'm the thing about

363
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
sticky-brow foam

364
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:23,080
Think about the the chocolate body painting is if you're the type of like partners that would be into chocolate body painting

365
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,980
You've already done it without wiki how having to tell you to do it

366
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,860
So if you're doing it off of wiki house thing, there's no way it's not weird. There's no way

367
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,700
There's not a moment. I was like and I guess I'm gonna put it on your nipple

368
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,260
I think I'll put it here on your butt. Is this doing it for you?

369
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,540
The recipe they provided is as follows 17 and a half ounces of dark chocolate

370
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:51,580
13 and a half ounces of cream a handful of chopped mint leaves one finely chopped chili pepper and a double shot of espresso

371
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:58,980
That's going to taste bad and feel bad on your body. Is that for the bath? I'm putting a chili pepper. No, this is body paint

372
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,780
This is body paint. No, thank you. A little bit of a tingle. Paint my balls with mint and pepper and espresso. I am

373
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:12,260
So awake, let me wait. Let me get real sweaty first and open up my pores. Go for it. Yeah, perfect

374
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,700
Perfect now put the chili pepper immediately on my glands. No

375
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,200
Give a gift of exclusive chocolates the fuck that mean wiki how?

376
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,980
Spoke chocolates by the most delectable box of chocolates possible or oh, yeah or

377
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,020
naughty

378
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,340
Anatomy chocolates. Oh like a dick

379
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,480
No, Travis, like a tibia

380
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,740
and an elbow

381
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,740
And present your beloved with it to help him or her recapture the evening of chocolate indulgence for a little longer yet

382
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,580
Please God no more you baked me in it and painted me and spiced in the spicy chocolate and have burned my nipples so badly

383
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:57,460
Yeah, eat this eat this extremely expensive French dick chocolate. Bring it back, please

384
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,900
No, it's called Richard see French seal the giving with a French kiss involving passing an exquisite

385
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,980
Chocolate between the two of you gross that that's you know, that's the most phonetically pleasing sentence

386
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,400
I think in the English language is seal the giving with a French kiss involving passing an exquisite chocolate between the two of you

387
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,100
Try so do you want to you want to trade gum?

388
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,220
We could do that too if you want to you can deal with any candy. It doesn't have to just be chocolate

389
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,780
and I also just

390
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Yeah

391
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:33,700
Not like rule number one like advice number one on this should be like before like the most important thing

392
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,680
Be so careful not to get into an argument when you have all this plans

393
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,540
because can you imagine

394
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:47,000
You made up all this body paint and like you filled the tub with chocolate and you like ordered dick-shaped French exclusive chocolate and then like

395
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,580
You get into a fight about like whose turn it was to like into the dishwasher or whatever and you're like, okay fine, whatever

396
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,620
Also, like I hate your I hate I hate your mom. Finally you said it

397
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,340
We're so still we can't do that. We're too sticky to do this right and I can't leave

398
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,780
I can't storm out of the apartment right now our showers covered in fucking chocolate. I have no way to be like

399
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,420
Wolves outside or something. I don't know man. We live in the woods in this scenario

400
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,260
The last one is visit a chocolate spa, which is certainly something everyone has

401
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,780
I just want to end this with the community QA it has

402
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,820
a one question and the question is why would you do this?

403
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,020
Community answer says if you both really like chocolate this could be a fun way to enjoy yourselves if it's not for you turn

404
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,020
The page Wow

405
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,380
That's

406
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:45,340
Anyway, that's how to enjoy chocolate with your lover or how to waste a bunch of chocolate with you're both really gross

407
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Yeah, I think so, too

408
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,560

Funkadelic slim trunks and I love the hell out of them. Thank you so much. I know

439
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,720
Oh god, I was just filled with the shuddering realization that I will have to see those at some point

440
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,920
Oh, yeah, you will baby because they're perfect to my style

441
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,120
Hey Justin, you know my style and every time you see me you're like Travis. I love your style

442

I say Travis that's perfect to your style a thing many people say

443
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,820
I noticed how that look that you're wearing perfectly fits your style. Do you know why Justin?

444
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,200
Why that's because I went on stitch fix and whatever your style is now more than ever is the time to rock it

Did your neighbor back into your car bring that case to judge Judy

473
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,160
Think the mailman might be the real father give that one to judge Mattis

474
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,280
But does your mom want you to flush her ashes down the toilet at Disney World when she passes away?

475
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,800
Now that's my jurisdiction. Welcome to the court of judge John Hodgman where the people are real

476
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,080
The disputes are real and the stakes are often unusual

477
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,120
If I got arrested for dumping your ashes in the jungle cruise, it would be an honor

478
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,680
I don't want to be part of somebody getting a super yacht

479
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,080
I don't know at what point you want to go into that business

480
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,880
But we've had a worm bin before available for you right now at Maximumfun.org

481
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,440
Judge John Hodgman the court of last resort when your wife won't stop pretending to be a cat and knocking the clean laundry over

482
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,800
How about another question I would want that I'm a 32 year old woman nice

483
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,600
And well, no, it's a question. Oh, I'm a 32 year old woman who's forgotten how to socialize in this new world

484
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:18,120
So I was letting my hairstylist whom I have never seen before work away and focus in silence

485
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,320
I was quite relaxed with her hands in my hair the white noise of the salon hair dryers the ASMR

486
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,120
Crinkling of foils in my hair. Yeah, suddenly I wake up to her asking me. Did you just fall asleep?

487
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,160
I said, yes, I'm so sorry. She acts like it was no big deal

488
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,480
But I'm obviously embarrassed that I'm a grown woman who just fell asleep in the middle of a busy public place

489
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,520
Like some kind of toddler. I don't know. I had my glasses on

490
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,000
I fell asleep in the middle of a busy public place like some kind of toddler. I don't know. I had my glasses off

491
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,680
Wait, how long? I don't think I understand that sentence. I don't know. I had my glasses off

492
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,160
Oh, you're not a glasses wearer Justin glasses

493
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,240
The removal glasses is often an indication to your body that it's sleep time. Yeah. Oh, okay

494
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,000
It's like a okay got it. I have my glasses off. I was comfy

495
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,680
She didn't mention it again, but continued to work in silence. I stayed very awake for the rest of the hair appointment

496
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,480
Can I show my face here again? She did a good job in my hair

497
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,560
I don't think a sign would help that you can't just cut us off with the knees like that

498
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,840
You don't know terribly tired in texas a sign would help of like a cute cherub going

499
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,160
I'm sweeping that would help I think

500
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Hey things are rough

501
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,640
Out there and basically nobody's getting enough sleep. Yeah. Yes, if

502
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,080
If somewhat obviously this is a different example

503
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,640
But if I know that people fall asleep to our podcast and that is a great honor because that is I would I loved the idea

504
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,760
of being

505
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,800
You know this podcast morpheus. That's why I try to be as boring as possible and not funny

506
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,480
I have a podcast for people to fall asleep to about cereal

507
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,160
It's called the empty bowl intentional like yeah, that one wants it too much. It's desperate for it. Yeah

508
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,960
Um and getting hey check this out getting your haircut feels good as fuck

509
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Like especially when they do the when they do the the rinsy stuff the rinsing

510
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,480
Um that feels really good and I can fully understand falling asleep during that

511
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,800
I don't think you have anything to feel apologetic for. I don't think this is a situation that

512
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,240
They were embarrassed or they should be embarrassed by it all

513
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,800
I also think there's two different ways for the hairstylist to ask the question. Did they say?

514
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:32,760
Did you just fall asleep or did they say? Yeah, did you just fall asleep? Yeah. Yeah. I bet it was the latter

515
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,160
there's a big difference like

516
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,080
honestly, like

517
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,720
Why did they ask I think it's weird for them to ask

518
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,680
They usually just like let it let it slide, right?

519
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,320
Like did you just fall asleep if I fall asleep while my wife is telling me something

520
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:53,080
She would never ask, you know if I just fell asleep, right, you know, which is accepts that i'm

521
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
Uh a bad person, you know, yeah

522
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,400
Absolutely, maybe the hairstylist asked because for them it's a point of pride

523
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,560
Like I did such a good job that like I the person felt very comfortable with me and they fell asleep

524
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,320
And that's like did you fall asleep? Yes, and they like reach over and they add a little tally mark to the wall

525
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,960
I did it. I did it plus the sooner like the faster you fall asleep that gives them

526
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,480
Like an early chance to eat the hair off the yeah off the floor

527
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:27,240
Like they don't even have to wait for you to leave like they can have a little sample of it right here

528
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,560
They can taste the hair

529
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,200
Early to see how much they want to cut off exactly

530
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,200
Well, you got to figure out if it's ripe or not

531
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,920
You know what I mean? Because some of the hair still needs time on the vine

532
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:43,800
Um, they might they might finish the shampooing and be like, hey, I actually usually don't do it this order

533
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,640
But I am going to cut some more of that of your yummy locks off. I mean

534
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Your long your gross long hair

535
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,080
That's a good question. Do you think it's is it better to eat the hair before the shampoo when it has all of its natural

536
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,680
oils and vitamins

537
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,720
Or after the shampoo when you can maybe flavor it and you know do some infusion asking me but like

538
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,480
I it depends on are we working with

539
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,640
You know on natural herbal essences shit that is going to make it taste like delicious, you know

540
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:22,200
Cucumber melon or are we talking about some pantene pro v that's going to taste like i'm eating up a lab

541
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,600
Chemicals I have noticed that a lot of times when I get shampooed there's like a mint

542
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,480
Quality to the the shampoo and now i'm thinking that maybe my hair was dessert

543
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,200
Oh, that's possible

544
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
um, okay, so

545
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,240
That's I mean we've talked a lot about eating here

546
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,640
Do we want to do another question or has somebody in fast food done something silly just

547
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,840
What?

548
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Oh, I want to munch oh boy

549
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
I want to munch

550
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,760
I don't I don't like you can do it. Can you please do the same? Oh squad

551
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,520
Thank you, you had to complete the ritual

552
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:18,920
Only by you saying squalled am I able to take control of your brother's body and send him temporarily to hell

553
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:25,800
I didn't know that that was complicated. Yeah, then you weren't paying attention. Yes griffin before I begin

554
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
It's me count donut

555
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,400
I wanted to quickly review my wikipedia page. Okay. Wait, what?

556
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,040
Well, not wikipedia. It's the fandom.com wiki for my brother my brother and me

557
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,840
Uh, I wanted to sort of reestablish countenance for myself

558
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,880
Uh, I was reading through the page just a quick reminder for everyone

559

Donut chula and count party baker. Yeah, that's true

561
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,820
I'm immune to all earthly pathogens, but still wear a mask. I have internal blood syndrome

562
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:13,660
I live in a castle in donutvania, but consider myself a citizen of nowhere. This is all good

563
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,700
I glisten in sunlight

564
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:22,700
Glisten I and someone named richard stink both live inside justin and when we emerge justin is sent to hell

565
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:30,220
Until they stop controlling his body. I knew that now this is what I forgot about count donut has a son count rick donut jr

566
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,220
Oh, that's sweet

567
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:38,560
I approach donuts aesthetically and could eat them but prefer not to because of my gluten intolerance

568
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:46,460
Great. I do need to drink blood to survive. However, I only steal the blood types. Nobody wants like the

569
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:53,260
D. Great. So I just wanted to briefly thank whoever updates my

570
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:58,860
Wiki page because I I don't need the reminder about my own life, of course. Yeah

571
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,140
But other people it helps me approximately. Yeah

572
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,760
But no more

573
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,700
self-congratulatory

574
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,140
Nonsense, i've come to talk to you about donuts with my favorite

575
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,780
name to intone

576
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,940
Crispy

577
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,580
What do they do this time? They released the lineup of honey inspired

578
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,660
honey inspired

579
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,620
I thought you said uneaten spider donuts

580
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,700
Oh

581
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,700
To be a treat now

582
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:37,260
My first question before I begin is what is honey? Oh, honey is like bee leavings

583
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,220
Well, yeah

584
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,700
No, I mean it's like bee milk

585
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,700
G

586
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
It's is it the

587
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,580
Yeah, that's a better way of thinking. Yeah, that's a good travis. Just go with it. Yeah, that's about it

588
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,980
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that's what they call it. That's my favorite joke. Have you seen the jerry seinfeld movie?

589
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,180
I come to watch movies what?

590
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:08,300
Like getting carsick just sitting in place and watching a movie in a movie theater you get carsick watching a movie

591
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,540
Are you doing like the xd?

592
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,060
Movie theater, where are you watching movies? Wait?

593
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,940
The only movies i've seen are in the back of justin's buick his big beautiful buick

594
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,340
right, he sometimes shows episode of loud house back there is that uh,

595
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,620
Movie sometimes justin just sound clear

596
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,220
Count on it

597
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,740
Sometimes justin puts on an episode of loud house and then goes back in the back of his own buick to watch it

598
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,940
While you are behind his back while he drives. How does that work? You're in his body

599
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,980
not all the time

600
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,540
It gets cramped, especially after he eats a lot of long john silvers

601
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,180
I can't stay you don't have to be in his body

602
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,060
You choose to go in his body and send him to hell the beats walking baby. It's a cool body

603
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
honey's beaches moving on

604
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:05,820
One crispy cream will have taste buds buzzing. Okay, and fans swarming

605
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,780
This month with its first ever sweet

606
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,260
and sensational

607
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:17,020
Honey donuts. I don't like the idea of donut fans swarming. There's something about that. It's horrifying

608
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,020
crispy creams

609
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,060
Oh

610
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,060
honey collection

611
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,900
It's available for a limited time beginning may 9th

612
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,460
There's three different ones. Okay

613
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:34,140
A honey pull apart donut, which is glazed light and airy

614
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,580
Whenever someone advertises something being airy

615
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,780
Remember that that is air that you have bought

616
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,880
advertising ripping you off

617
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,540
You want thick and chewy?

618
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,780
Honey donut clusters drizzled with salted honey icing, huh?

619
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:57,660
A honey bee donut, which is an original glaze dipped in yellow icing and decorated with black butter cream

620
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,220
And then finished. Wait, is there honey in that one?

621
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
Just looks like a big okay. Oh, okay

622
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:12,380
And then a honey cake donut a glazed sour cream cake donut drizzled with honey icing and finished with an oat crisp

623
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,620
That sounds okay. Hell actually countdown. Can I just say crispy cream?

624
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,900
I'm gonna say I see through the thin veneer here two of these were ideas

625
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,020
Yes

626
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:29,420
Airy veneer two of these were ideas you had and you didn't want to just put out a two donut collection

627
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,780
So you said okay. Yeah, we'll do the pull apart one. Oh and this one. Oh, yeah, the sound cream with that

628
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Oh, we need a third

629
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,980
Make one look like a bee like a fat bee

630
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,380
Um, he's adorable by the way, it looks nothing like a bee. It's amazing

631
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:50,300
I don't know why they've done this. What are they here? Look at this. Look at this donut. What are they trying to?

632
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,100
Oh count donut. This is a picture of justin bieber again

633
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,780
No, i've deleted that from slack. I don't want to go to jail

634
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:04,220
Uh, yeah, that's not a that's a circle with stripes and some circle with stripes and vanilla wafer wings

635
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,980
Uh anyway, where was I? Oh, yes, you love bees, right?

636
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,300
bee

637
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:17,660
Because crispy cream loves honey and the small but mighty workforce that produces it. This is bees

638
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,780
the honey lovers does and will come with

639
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:26,540
bee friendly wild flower and seed paper for fans to plant

640
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
while supplies last

641
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,260
thinking and feeding the bees

642
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:39,920
Yes, crispy cream will also plant flower gardens at select shops to create more bee friendly environments

643
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,980
Thank god that thank you

644
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,100
It is it does make you wonder though why

645
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,940
Crispy cream decided to leave their stores barren

646
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:58,940
Undecorated and it was only to delight the bees that they have festooned them in such a way. I also don't love

647
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:06,700
Of getting a chore with my donuts, you know, i'm not going to have an active day. I just bought 12 donuts

648
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,220

00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,060
Hey count donut. Are you eating a dozen donuts by yourself?

From working with corporations no, sorry

673
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:09,340
From working with corporations and companies like krispy kreme to students in schools. We're all responsible for the care of our environment

674
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,700
So that's what's going on with bees right now

675
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,700
Yeah, you can save them by eating donuts and then throwing paper on the ground

676
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:23,520
The solution was in front of us the entire time. Mm-hmm

Wow, i'm really hungry for donuts I really there's a krispy kreme 45 minutes from my house

00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,460
That's not too far. That's great. I'm seriously considering it guys. Well justin

679
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:45,340
You can balance out your carbon footprint by driving an hour and a half a round trip to get those donuts by then planting

00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:50,460
A few seeds for donuts that will make you stickier than james cromwell, which is
