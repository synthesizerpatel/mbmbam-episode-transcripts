1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:49,200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Calamites 2016 Super Duper Spectacular. My name is Justin Tyler McElroy, Christmas boy.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
My name is Travis Patrick McElroy, the Yule Man.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,680
Griffin Tyler McElroy. Boys, what's that coming? Boys, what's that coming down to the chimbly?

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Please turn your eyes towards the chimbly and see what's coming down. It's a reindeer.

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,760
No, not like this.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh, no, he's done. They should not be vertical like this and pinned in a chimbly. This is not

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,320
good. Oh, God. Should we call animal control or take care of it ourselves? I think we should

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,000
call Santa's fat A to get down here. Oh, it's getting much no cursing. Yeah, it's special,

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,680
very special. There's a whole platform on Hulu of those, I think it's called streaming Christmas,

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,640
and it's in the vein of those Yule log videos that just go and you pretend that,

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,680
oh, it's so funny, and you pretend to turn them on and think that it's funny and cool,

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,080
but really it's just a boring log that is on fire for a while. This streaming Christmas platform,

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,480
this production company has cracked into something new, and that is other long form explorations

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,160
of the genre. Me and Rachel and her folks and Henry last night, we watched one that is called

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,560
Stuck Santa that I'd like to talk to you about at length if you'll give me the stage for a little

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,880
bit. Yes, do we need to pass emotion? No, it's just going to be a little bit of a dive. It's a

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,360
48 minute long movie, and it says when you load it up, it says Stuck Santa, and then in parentheses,

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,280
full film, and film is gracious because all it is is it's like one of those fireplaces and you

24
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,920
think a Yule log's going to start crackling, but no, you just see two feet pop down, and then for

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:58,880
48 minutes, you hear a man just sort of vamp like, oh, no. Oh, what have I become? Oh,

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,840
that didn't help. I'm still very stuck. Oh, my diarrhea's acting up again.

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,800
And then just to get into spoiler territory, there's no hot snakes whatsoever, but at about the,

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,720
I want to say 39 minute mark, presents start falling down, so I'm not sure how the physics

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,720
of that work. How are you stuck and encompassing the full space of the chimney, but also your

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,560
presents are coming down. Do you have them up your booty, Santa Claus? No, I'm really glad you brought

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
this up, Griffin, because I do have one question. I have not seen it. Yeah, sure. Stylistically,

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,400
yeah. Attitudinally, yeah. Is it for children? Is it for adults? It is for perverts,

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,320
because I would like to tell you the ending of Stuck Santa, and that is all of these presents

34
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,760
have fallen down, and you still just see his stupid legs, and he says like, oh, no,

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,640
and then the words the end appear, and the video comes to a halt, so I guess he is dead,

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,400
and if he's not dead, then Christmas. How are you going to withhold that climax from us? If he's not

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,040
dead, how did he get out? How did he get out? But I think he doesn't. At the very least, Santa works

38
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,400
on a pretty tight schedule. If he does get out later, that's 48 minutes of primo delivery time.

39
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,040
That's like all of Eastern Europe just ain't getting it no more. No presents for you,

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
Eastern Europe. That was your 48 minute window. But at the worst case scenario, Christmas

41
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
is not happening this year, because Santa went and got himself stuck.

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,680
Griffin, did you wait until the post-credit scene when Nick Fury showed up?

43
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,880
Nick Fury showed up, and he's like, I want you to join me. Oh, you've been stuck in that chimbly

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,320
for 48 minutes? You can't even do your job tonight? You know what? I'm going to pass.

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,640
Thank you, Santa Claus. Thank you, Santa. He dies at the end. We were watching it,

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,960
and then his feet are going to pop out the top, and he's like, off I go, back on my magical-

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,720
No, he's just dead in there. He dies in there. Dead. They should call it dead Santa.

48
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,920
But is that the prequels of the Santa Claus? Did Tim Allen show up in the Stuck Santa movie?

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,320
The thing Griffin didn't mention is that for the entirety of the hour,

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,680
Tim Allen is in the bottom right hand corner, just like, oh no, I don't have time for this.

51
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,800
I mean, here's the thing. If he does pass away from Earth in the chimbly, then there is no

52
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:40,160
recipient of the Santa Claus-y with magic contract to pass to. And so what's it going to do? Where's

53
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,200
that good, good spirit go? Where's the mantle passed to?

54
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,960
Where's the mantle passed to? Now we've got these two skeletal legs.

55
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,880
He's stuck inside the mantle, and there's nowhere for the mantle to go to.

56
00:05:50,880 --> 00:06:00,400
Exactly. Can you imagine being one of the producers of the Santa Claus, and you show up

57
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,880
at Disney HQ, and they're like, listen, we love Tim Allen. We love Santa Claus. Can you give us

58
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,880
the sort of the big beats in the story? We don't need a whole, like a deep dive. Just give us the

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,880
big beats of the story. And these guys have to look them dead in the eye and say, well, first,

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,920
Santa dies, like of old age and happy in his bed. No, no, Tim Allen kills him.

61
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,960
Tim Allen does kill him to death from Earth. So the first thing we see is Santa dies

62
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,680
because of Tim Allen's negligence. As always, the Santa mantle passes via death.

63
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,640
And this is important. A boy does see it. A boy does see Santa's dead, dead body.

64
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,880
A boy watches Santa die. That's the first image of the movie.

65
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,720
Listen, it's going to get worse before it gets better.

66
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
He then does put on the dead man's clothes.

67
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,280
He puts on the dead man's clothes, still covered in his stink. It's like watching somebody just

68
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,280
break into a funeral home and just start taking things off that corpse.

69
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
I am glad, though, because in the original first draft of the Santa Claus,

70
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,320
the naked body of the dead Santa was just left in the snow. They leave the naked man's body.

71
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,760
They did make them change that. I'm like, OK, well, the body is going to need to

72
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,320
magically disappear or whatever. Like, oh, OK, sure, sure, sure. We do get to still kill him,

73
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,840
though. We do get that satisfaction. When this bit started, I thought you were going to say,

74
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,480
can you imagine being one of the producers of Stuck Santa and just kind of kicking it for 48

75
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,920
minutes while an actor vamps and probably vapes up there? Because you only see the legs.

76
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,920
Hey, I have a weird thing. I just wanted to mention to everybody that occurred to me. As

77
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,440
long as we're talking about holiday entertainment, this is a Kaila Nights episode, and we've got

78
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,280
questions and stuff that we'll answer. But honestly, we don't have any sponsors this

79
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,560
week for some reason, so we're doing this one for free. So listen, just calm down, OK?

80
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,960
The Home Alone franchise is a delight. I was playing Home Alone on iTunes, and then I noticed

81
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:19,600
something very unusual. Home Alone on the Rotten Tomatoes website has a 55% fresh rating. You ever

82
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,360
heard anything like that? That's wild. It's Home Alone. It is Home Alone. Now here, this gets much

83
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:35,280
more buck wild. Home Alone 2 has a 24% fresh rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, and that's

84
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,680
based on several critics. It's based on a lot of critics, and it's 24%. Wait, that's the critic

85
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,040
rating, not like people rating? That's the critics rating. The freshness of this film is less than

86
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,240
a quarter fresh, is over 75% rotten, according to the critics. Here's where it gets like,

87
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,240
like, you lose me. I mean, you already lost me, for sure. But like, I come back in, and I'm like,

88
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:07,680
how are things going? And then you lose me again. Because Home Alone 3 has a 27% freshness. In the

89
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,480
mind of America's, you can't trust critics, apparently. No. Because in the mind of this

90
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:21,440
planet's critics, Home Alone 3 was a better film than Home Alone 2. Like, get bent. Seriously.

91
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,400
I can explain 2. I can explain Home Alone 2. 25% around there was-

92
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,520
24%.

93
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,920
24%. Well, the math almost adds up, but that's actually based on only four reviews. One of them

94
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,440
was Village Voice, and they loved the dang picture. And the other three were by Joe Pesci and Daniel

95
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,520
Stern and Greg Pesci, Joe's dad. And they hated how they hated the treatment of these two crooks.

96
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:54,480
The only thing I can assume, Justin, is that the nation's critics desperately crave child murder

97
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,280
in movies.

98
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,600
I guess.

99
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,640
Oh, interesting.

100
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,840
And they thought that Home Alone 2 promised what they did not receive in Home Alone 1.

101
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,120
And maybe in Home Alone 3, which I have not seen, the kid dies. So it's slightly better.

102
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,840
It's a little bit better.

103
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,200
I haven't seen it. Cannot confirm. I actually just watched Ernest Hayes' Christmas for the

104
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
first time in a long time.

105
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

106
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
Believe it or not.

107
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,400
Do you know what the main conceit of Ernest Hayes' Christmas is? Santa's going senile and has to

108
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,760
pass the- he can't remember things anymore. He can't remember all the kids, and he can't remember

109
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,520
what they asked for, and he doesn't have the magic anymore. And he waited- he says numerous times

110
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:44,000
that he waited too long to pass the mantle on to the next person. So he has to find someone to be

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,160
Santa real quick before time runs out.

112
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
Hey kids, how's your movie?

113
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,720
How's your movie going?

114
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
How's your movie, kids?

115
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,000
He's getting real old, huh? Kind of like G-Paw and G-Ma are doing in real life.

116
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,560
I was going to antagonize Travis by having Tim Curry say cheese pizza in the headphones,

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,200
but I couldn't find the clip, so I searched YouTube Tim Curry cheese pizza, and I'm very proud to

118
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,560
announce that the first result is Tim Curry being unfamiliar with the concept of pizza,

119
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
but the second and third are both my brother and my brother.

120
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah, all right.

121
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,680
We did it.

122
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:23,920
We did it.

123
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,000
Should we-

124
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,280
Cheese pizza.

125
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,880
Cheese. Fresh cheese pizza. Can we do some questions, please?

126
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,560
Yes.

127
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,560
You're loading up the clip now, Justin. God, I can hear the Googling happen inside this podcast.

128
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm not loading up any clip. Okay. Here's the first question.

129
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,280
It's playing in my ears.

130
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,640
Yeah, I know it is.

131
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,480
Do you hear it? I don't hear it. Do you hear it? I don't hear anything.

132
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
It's in my ears.

133
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,320
I have a friend who carefully unwraps gifts rather than tearing into them.

134
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,160
When I asked why she did this-

135
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
You got to stop playing it. I know you're still doing it over and over again.

136
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm not doing any-

137
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,200
Cheese pizza.

138
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Cheese pizza.

139
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Why I asked- Okay, I'll actually start again.

140
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,280
Thank you. I can't hear the question.

141
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,360
Please stop it. It's still playing.

142
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,400
Now it's stopped.

143
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,640
Okay.

144
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,800
Hold on.

145
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,160
It started again inadvertently.

146
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
This is poison. This is audio poison.

147
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,920
No sponsors, baby.

148
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,400
I have a friend who carefully unwraps gifts rather than tearing into them.

149
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Travis is texting now.

150
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,960
No, I'm looking at the questions on my phone.

151
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,440
Okay.

152
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,800
When I asked why she did this, she told me it was so she could reuse the wrapping paper.

153
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,280
Unforgivable.

154
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,400
I guess it's her present to do with what she likes,

155
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,000
but I feel a little robbed of the joy of watching someone excitedly rip it up like a kid.

156
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,400
Is there a way I can wrap things she'll have no choice?

157
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,800
And that's from Gift Misgiving.

158
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,160
Let me first undo one foul that you have there.

159
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,680
It is not just her gift. You are right in the second part.

160
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,560
The opening of it is a gift to you.

161
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
Otherwise, you would just hand people unwrapped presents.

162
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,480
Correct.

163
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,520
Oh, yeah.

164
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,400
The reveal is part of what you get for getting someone that moment when they go,

165
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,560
and if they're slowly revealing it like Angels and Demons,

166
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,080
you know, Da Vinci code puzzle where they get one inch at a time,

167
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
that's not fun for you.

168
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
That's boring.

169
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,960
You want to reveal.

170
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,480
Unless they do like sexy burlesque music while they unwrap it.

171
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
Yes, and there's tassels on the blender.

172
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,680
I don't know if there's anything that I find sadder.

173
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
I know a few people that do this.

174
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,960
I don't know there's much I find sadder than thinking of someone on like December 24th

175
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,960
nestled around the tree,

176
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,440
just slowly thumbing through a sticky pile of dirty wrapping paper.

177
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,240
Just marking out the names on the sticky tags like now it's from me.

178
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,400
Oh, that one's got a little tear.

179
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,320
I guess back to the drawing board.

180
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,840
I got some old chewing gum here.

181
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,520
I could fix it a little bit.

182
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,720
Counterpoint to this.

183
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,080
If I got a present from somebody with some genuine elf paper,

184
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,680
I would lose my gourd.

185
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
My gourd would fly off into the fireplace.

186
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
It would be insane.

187
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
Has anyone seen Griffin's gourd?

188
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,400
It's stuck with say a bird.

189
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,280
It is gone.

190
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,200
He opened that dope elf wrapping paper from 1954 and he lost his mind.

191
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,400
The original elf run.

192
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,880
The original elf when he was just a racist comic character.

193
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
Sponsored by Colgate.

194
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,160
Listen, I think Griffin has created a false dichotomy.

195
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,960
We're not talking about collectible wrapping paper here.

196
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,400
It's not like, yeah, if my gift comes wrapped in the Magna Carta,

197
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,920
I'm going to be delicate with it.

198
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
That's not what we're talking about.

199
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
We're talking about preserving wrapping paper.

200
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,120
I guess if that's important to them, you should just stop wrapping it

201
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
and say you're just going to steal the paper anyway.

202
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,640
It's my paper and I decide what gets done with it.

203
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,760
I'm not going to give you more to use.

204
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,800
You can steal it from me.

205
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
This is this is this is wild.

206
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,680
We don't have this problem anymore and you guys want to have this problem with us

207
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,480
because I most of the gifts that Rachel and I got you all is from Amazon

208
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,280
and they just do those weird bags.

209
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,320
Here's your very nice.

210
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
Here's you in those bags.

211
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,760
They look so festive underneath the tree, actually.

212
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,280
They make it look like old timey and stuff and you can reuse them.

213
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,760
They're great.

214
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,040
Just give this person gifts and gift bags.

215
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,080
That's like inherently supposed to be reused, right?

216
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,760
Like, no, I don't want to because that's that takes a gift.

217
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,320
Here's the process of opening up a wrapped paper gift.

218
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,240
And this is an important thing for us to dive into

219
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,120
because it's like, oh, man, you put in some work getting this origami going right.

220
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
You tear, tear, tear, tear, tear, tear, unfold, tear, rip, rip, rip, rip, rip.

221
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,600
Good.

222
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,320
Oh, wow.

223
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
It's Jumanji.

224
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,400
If you are on DVD on blue.

225
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,840
Oh, I thought you meant the game.

226
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,480
Oh, okay.

227
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
We're going to spiral into a torture game.

228
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,800
It's a combo pack of the blue of the board game that had the weird red bubble on it

229
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,880
that you had to, like, slide the cards into.

230
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,320
And then it was like, just like the man, just like the movie magic.

231
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
It's not like the movie magic.

232
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,280
Like, it's just like a weird red pattern that gets decoded with like,

233
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,960
there's no elephants coming out.

234
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,400
The board game, Kyle.

235
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,920
But thank you for the gift anyway.

236
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,560
So that's the process of opening a wrap gift.

237
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
If it's in a gift bag, here's the process.

238
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,680
Ah, cool.

239
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,400
Jumanji.

240
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
Like, it's the magic.

241
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Just make it longer.

242
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,840
Make the magic last longer and wrap the thing up.

243
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,760
If you want the magic to last longer,

244
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,560
then you should be totally jized with their unwrapping approach.

245
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,920
Let me throw this at you.

246
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,960
So wrap, then another layer of wrap, and then a third layer of wrap.

247
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,520
And when they unwrap it all, you got them wrapping paper.

248
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,440
I got you a bundle, a year, a lifetime supply of wrapping paper.

249
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,080
That's good.

250
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,120
That's good.

251
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
I like this.

252
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,840
Then you have it, so they have no...

253
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,160
Oh, give them enough wrapping paper that the next year,

254
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,640
when they like, try to start saving it, I'm like, no.

255
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,720
You don't need any more.

256
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,840
Flood them with wrapping.

257
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,440
Ruin them with wrapping paper.

258
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
You don't want any more of this.

259
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,120
If you did just continue to wrap levels of wrapping paper,

260
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,240
it would really put them to the test.

261
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,560
Yeah.

262
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,600
Hey, tough guy, you think you like to slowly, meticulously unwrap?

263
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,440
Let's see how long this holds out.

264
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,400
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

265
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
Yeah, please.

266
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,840
Yahoo!

267
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,840
You know that one?

268
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,880
Yeah, nice.

269
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
Pets.com.

270
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,600
Here we go.

271
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,280
It's sent by Morgan Davey.

272
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,320
Keep it wavy, bud.

273
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

274
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
Chaz Van Blom.

275
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,560
I think we've read one of this user's.

276
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,520
Wow.

277
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,480
That sounds familiar.

278
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,440
And you know what that means.

279
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
We've officially, we can't use this platform anymore.

280
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,920
So Chaz Van Blom asks,

281
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,840
how should I prep as Santa Claus?

282
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm a returning Santa Claus to my local region.

283
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
My next door neighbor has already asked me to show up

284
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,560
to their family's Christmas party.

285
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,680
I think Christmas Eve.

286
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,920
You should definitely iron that out.

287
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Here he is.

288
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,920
Chaz, it's like December 28th.

289
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,520
Well, you didn't nail it down.

290
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,360
Bo, bo, bo.

291
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
Did you say bo, bo, bo?

292
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,800
Hey, everybody.

293
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,960
Happy Valentine's Day.

294
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay, it's March and you said valentines.

295
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm the good Friday rabbit.

296
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
What are you saying?

297
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,360
I already have a semi-Santa length beard starting.

298
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
How should I prep myself this year?

299
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,400
I had already showed up around my local region

300
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,960
to random family's Christmas parties earlier years.

301
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,440
That's breaking and entering.

302
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
Many of them already have me, Santa Claus,

303
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,440
in their plans this year.

304
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,920
Should I in any way change my appearance

305
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,320
to enhance a Santa Claus look?

306
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
I want to-

307
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
By their plans, does he mean like their defense strategy?

308
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,560
We have to keep Chaz Santa out.

309
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
I want to keep in vogue with any styles,

310
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,680
fashions that may change my accepted appearance.

311
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,560
P.S. Donner has not been very good this year.

312
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,640
I might have to place him behind Blitzen again.

313
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,800
Those two have been up to something.

314
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,600
Oopsie daisy.

315
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,080
You just took a very strange turn, my friend.

316
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
Oh no, you just like pivoted the sleigh.

317
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,360
Yeah, the sleigh went somewhere else.

318
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,320
Okay, wait.

319
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,960
First, step one.

320
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Yeah.

321
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,160
Ton of crunches.

322
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
Just, you're gonna do so many Santa crunches.

323
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,560
We have already done sexy Santa.

324
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,000
We can't talk about sexy ripped Santa.

325
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,960
Well no, this is different.

326
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,720
This is, what Travis is suggesting is like,

327
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,960
he still has that big bowl full of Jelly Belly,

328
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,720
but also there's really defined abs on it.

329
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
Can that happen?

330
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,600
What?

331
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,880
Poking through like an egg cart,

332
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,040
like a beautiful egg cart in Santa Belly.

333
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,160
What if you, oh, okay.

334
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,920
You want to keep up with modern fashions, right?

335
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,720
This is what I heard.

336
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,880
Hipster Santa Claus.

337
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
You're gonna need to wax that hair,

338
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
wax that mustache, put some glitter in it,

339
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,600
put some like ornaments hanging in your beard,

340
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,320
and maybe, I don't know, an ironic t-shirt.

341
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,800
Now, the good one benefit there,

342
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,000
his skinny fanny won't have any problems getting stuck

343
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,880
or won't get stuck.

344
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,440
Correct.

345
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,720
It will have problems getting stuck

346
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,920
because it won't get stuck.

347
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
So the survival rate of this Hipster Santa

348
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,560
is definitely good,

349
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,840
but I don't want this person approaching my children.

350
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
Man, I can say stuff like that now.

351
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,160
That's weird.

352
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,880
I need help.

353
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,560
I need help from Travis,

354
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,680
and I need help from Griffin.

355
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
And you at home can play along with this game, okay?

356
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
As a funny joke,

357
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,280
I just did a Google image search

358
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,520
for cool new Santa fashions, right?

359
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,240
Okay.

360
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,280
What I discovered,

361
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm gonna send you this link,

362
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,480
and Travis, I'll just go ahead and show you this.

363
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,440
What I found was the same, like.

364
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
Oh, wow.

365
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,080
Hundreds of pictures of a super fashionable cool Santa.

366
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,560
Huh.

367
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,880
That all happen to be the same man in different...

368
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,560
Who is this cool Santa?

369
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,680
This is a cool Santa,

370
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,720
and in a lot of these pictures,

371
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,040
he's wearing a cool red leather jacket,

372
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
a lot of red plaids and scarves.

373
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,600
He's from Yorkdale, I guess, a mall in Toronto.

374
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
He's like so cool.

375
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,920
He's very fashionable.

376
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,560
First of all, this is a definitely the Trivago guy,

377
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,800
and there's nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.

378
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,880
It's definitely the mysterious Trivago man.

379
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
Fashion Santa is the handsomest person

380
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,040
I've ever seen in my whole life,

381
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,960
and everything has changed in this moment.

382
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,040
Here's the thing.

383
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,520
Most of what we picture of Santa Claus

384
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,160
has been shaped by Pepsi, right?

385
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,280
Or Coca-Cola.

386
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,120
Those, you know, it's all that trademark.

387
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,560
No, Pepsi for me.

388
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,080
Pepsi, they're silly bears.

389
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,200
I think that was also Coca-Cola.

390
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
I think Pepsi stayed out of the Christmas game.

391
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,640
They're more of an Arbor Day company.

392
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,160
But, and so maybe it's time now that we reshape it.

393
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,440
It's 2016.

394
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
We let a new brand take over what Santa should look like.

395
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,200
You know what I mean?

396
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco Bell.

397
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,640
Taco Santa.

398
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Oh, I want to watch that so bad.

399
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,080
Taco sleigh bell, he says on his magic ride across the world.

400
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
How should I prep a Santa Claus?

401
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,840
I think a fun thing you can do to like,

402
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,640
if I was like a mall Santa, one thing I would do to prep,

403
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
it wouldn't even necessarily be physical

404
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,360
as much as it would be mental,

405
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
is I would memorize the names of every child on Earth.

406
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,520
Well, here's the thing.

407
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,640
How sick would that be?

408
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
It's like a little boy came and jumped up on my lap.

409
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
I was like, what's up, Tony?

410
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,080
And he's like, what?

411
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,440
And I'm like, yeah, I memorized the names of every child on Earth.

412
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,040
But see, the nice thing, Griffin,

413
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,360
is you only have to do that really for one kid,

414
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
but you could tell that kid

415
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,800
that you memorized the names of all the kids on Earth.

416
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,160
But like, you just have,

417
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
you've learned everything about Tony.

418
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
You know everything about Tony.

419
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,840
Just to chase that, Travis, for every other child

420
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,960
that jumps up on my lap, I'm like, hey, Tony.

421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,560
And they're like, no, my name is Roger.

422
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,080
And it's like, ah, okay, get out, go away.

423
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
It's not gonna work on you, is it?

424
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
Get out, go, it's ruined for you now.

425
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,560
Go ahead, it's done with you.

426
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,400
Oh, yeah, get really good at doing

427
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,120
like Jonathan Edwards style cold reads on people

428
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,800
and be like, I'm getting a T, a T name, is it Tony?

429
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,680
It's Tony?

430
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,520
All right, now, Tony, I'm feeling you want,

431
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,520
oh, you want something made with plastic.

432
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm getting plastic.

433
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,600
It has wheels on it.

434
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,360
No, I'm seeing someone behind you, Timmy.

435
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,720
He's an old man, and he's got,

436
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,080
it looks like some sort of hard candy peep-bap.

437
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,800
Yeah, it might be a, I'm getting several P's.

438
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,600
P letter?

439
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,400
A lot, like three P's in one sort of name.

440
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,440
He's got a hard candy,

441
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
the little strawberries wrapped up.

442
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes, that's it, that's it.

443
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,040
It is a peep-bap.

444
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,520
Yeah, and I get he left you a bunch of money.

445
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,600
What do you want to say to him?

446
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,960
What do you need him to hear right now?

447
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,480
I want a talker truck.

448
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,880
Okay, you gotta tell peep-bap all about it.

449
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
I guess your spectral peep-bap's

450
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
gonna make that happen for you.

451
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,520
You have some gross misunderstandings

452
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,600
of how the whole Christmas process breaks down.

453
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,240
Oh, my God, John Edwards psychic Santa is for free, everybody.

454
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,040
That's yours.

455
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,560
We need more Christmas specials.

456
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,080
I realized this year that the Christmas specials for the last 10 years

457
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,520
have been exclusively Hallmark Channel specials.

458
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,360
I want a date, I don't want a date with Santa,

459
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,800
my special Christmas kiss.

460
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,040
We need more that's like Santa and John Edwards solving crimes.

461
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
I mean, gang, that could just be a whole nother podcast

462
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,880
as we just take the titles of those films that Justin just said

463
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,360
and we put our own twisted spin on it.

464
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,480
My, what did you say, my special Christmas kiss?

465
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,240
That one I did invent,

466
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
but that is probably not that far off.

467
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,920
There's, I think 12 dates of Christmas is a real one.

468
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,240
My special Christmas kiss.

469
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
All right, so the pilot episode

470
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
of the McElroy Brothers Christmas special hour,

471
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
a holiday special hour, we'll extend it.

472
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
And so let's call, does anybody have the Skype contact info

473
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
for Melissa Joan Hart?

474
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,160
Because I think we need her now more than ever.

475
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,960
I think her and Tom Cavanaugh are in all of them.

476
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,760
Okay, yeah.

477
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,560
Tom and Cavanaugh, we could definitely get a line on.

478
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
The man is in the game.

479
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,280
He knows the score.

480
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,920
He knows what we need.

481
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,420
He is.

482
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,800
A Christmas visitor, a Carol Christmas,

483
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,200
a boyfriend for Christmas.

484
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,560
A boyfriend for Christmas.

485
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,640
Hello, that's the next one for us.

486
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,560
The Christmas card, the grandpa for Christmas.

487
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,080
Well, okay, now hold on.

488
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
Maybe the sequel?

489
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,080
No, no, no, you can get a boyfriend for Christmas.

490
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,520
To get a grandpa, that's not how time works.

491
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,760
A grandpa boyfriend for Christmas.

492
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,920
The Christmas choir, our first Christmas.

493
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,920
Now they're just like shooting the moon here.

494
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,360
Dog name Christmas.

495
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,040
Okay, so like, hi, Jeff Hallmark, president of Hallmark.

496
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,560
I was wondering if I could pitch you a movie.

497
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,080
Yeah, sure, how many words are in the title?

498
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,280
Four?

499
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
No, get out of here.

500
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,040
Gotta be three.

501
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,400
And it's gotta have Christmas in it

502
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,680
or else people get confused.

503
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,840
Our viewers are so dumb.

504
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,640
They're so dumb.

505
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,000
It has to be word Christmas word or else it's not happening.

506
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,760
Yeah, here's some other hits.

507
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,080
We've got the night before the night before Christmas.

508
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,480
Oh, boy.

509
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,040
Nice.

510
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,160
Just kinda not great.

511
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,400
Let's see here.

512
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,320
Christmas in Canaan, November Christmas.

513
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,440
Okay, come on, play it fast and loose.

514
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
That's called Thanksgiving is what you've said.

515
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,600
The town Christmas forgot an old fashioned Christmas.

516
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,280
Okay, and then in 2011, they just like flipped the switches

517
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,040
and pumped it into full, we're talking like three to two

518
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,280
to three Christmas films per Hallmark production season.

519
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,600
In 2011, they amped it up to 10 Christmas, sorry, 11.

520
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
Love's Christmas journey.

521
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,000
Lucky Christmas, cancel Christmas.

522
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,040
A Christmas wedding tale.

523
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,120
Cancel Christmas is actually what the executive said

524
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,400
when all these were pitched and they're like,

525
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,040
yeah, that's a good one.

526
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,920
He's like, no, no, please stop the machine.

527
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,440
No, a Christmas wish, trading Christmas,

528
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,640
a princess for Christmas, the Christmas pageant,

529
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,280
Christmas comes home to Canaan, Christmas magic.

530
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,760
Now, in Hallmark's defense, 2011 was the year

531
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,400
where Mario Lopez was cryogenically unfrozen.

532
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,000
And he was hungry.

533
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,080
He was hungry to do his deeds.

534
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,280
Yeah, so this production, this company needs to get it.

535
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,680
These people need to get it together.

536
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,480
I do want to watch a grandpa for Christmas though.

537
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,960
Yeah, I want to watch a grandpa and princess for Christmas.

538
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,040
A lot of films about just human beings being kind of

539
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,640
given a bride for Christmas.

540
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,240
Well, no, now hold on.

541
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,720
Tick tock.

542
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,760
This is, get on it.

543
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,640
This is Jeremy.

544
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,800
He's your Jeremy for Christmas.

545
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,680
This is your Jeremy.

546
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,040
He's your boyfriend now.

547
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,880
I don't want to do, I don't want to be somebody's boyfriend.

548
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,760
Too bad, Jeremy.

549
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
You're this person's boyfriend now because you're

550
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
Would you rather be their grandpa?

551
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah, that actually sounds better.

552
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,040
Okay, step over into this movie, please.

553
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,360
What's up?

554
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,240
My name is Mystery.

555
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,600
Welcome to Speed Seduction.

556
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,680
So you want a bride for Christmas?

557
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,040
You're going to have to get on it.

558
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,080
It is mid-November.

559
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,960
Also in the 2012 production season,

560
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,920
the Christmas heart, come dance with me.

561
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,480
AKA the Christmas dance.

562
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,200
Oh, okay.

563
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,680
Whoa, that was scary for a second.

564
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,800
Baby's first Christmas, AKA the Christmas baby.

565
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
A baby for Christmas.

566
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,200
They're just going 2013 Pete's Christmas.

567
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,680
The sequel to dog's Christmas.

568
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,480
Hey, I'm Pete.

569
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
This is my Christmas.

570
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,200
Come on in.

572
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Check it out.

573
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,960
Let me show you where the magic happens.

574
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,040
I've been working as a PA on these movies for a long time now.

575
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,320
And I said, it's Pete's turn.

576
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,280
And so they said, okay, so this is just sort of my special.

577
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,200
Oh, holy night.

578
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,640
Snow Bride, a very merry mix up.

579
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
The Christmas ornament.

580
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,200
Catch a Christmas star.

581
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,640
Window Wonderland, fur crazy.

582
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,400
Let it snow.

583
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,760
The Christmas spirit.

584
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,800
Santa switch.

585
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,000
Hats off to Christmas.

586
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,080
Hold on.

587
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,720
When did this turn into like a Tom meets the Marys cast?

588
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,400
That's not real.

589
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,280
Finding Christmas.

590
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,520
It was Christmas with Tucker.

591
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,120
Okay, Tucker, please.

592
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,560
Let's do another question, Tucker.

593
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,920
We don't know.

594
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,360
I just got to 2014.

595
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,240
This is the best year.

596
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,360
Everybody agrees.

597
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,480
One star at Christmas.

598
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,320
The nine lives of Christmas.

599
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,240
A cookie cutter Christmas.

600
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,360
Wait, now, hold on.

601
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,880
They just kind of went for it in that time.

602
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,280
Like we didn't come up with anything new for this one.

603
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
We know what's up.

604
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,320
That one was just a baby for Christmas, AKA Christmas baby.

605
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,240
They just put a new name on it and saw if anybody would notice.

606
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,240
The Christmas shepherd.

607
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,360
Christmas under wraps.

608
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,400
One Christmas Eve.

609
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,600
Christmas at Cartwrights.

610
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
Best Christmas party ever.

611
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,720
The Christmas parade.

612
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,560
Ice sculpture Christmas.

613
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,440
Charming Christmas.

614
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm not ready for Christmas.

615
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Released in July 11th.

616
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
Family for Christmas.

617
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,360
July 11th, 2015.

618
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
That was an odd programming choice.

619
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,720
A Christmas detour.

620
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,840
A crown for Christmas.

621
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,680
Angel of Christmas.

622
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,360
Just in time for Christmas.

623
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,800
On the 12th day of Christmas.

624
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,760
A Christmas melody.

625
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,120
The spirit of Christmas.

626
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,400
Christmas land.

627
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,160
Wow.

628
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,960
Okay.

629
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,520
Okay.

630
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,480
That's it.

631
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,960
That's it.

632
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,160
We did not make it 2016's Christmas.

633
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,720
No, I mean, it's the last year.

634
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,440
You should do it.

635
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,880
A wish for Christmas.

636
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,400
Every Christmas has a story.

637
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,000
Clearly.

638
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,280
Christmas cookies.

639
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,320
My Christmas dream.

640
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,280
Christmas cookies were getting so granular now.

641
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,320
Yeah.

642
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,480
Christmas panties.

643
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
I'm going to read these last literally.

644
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,280
I mean, in 2016, there was like 20 of them.

645
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,560
I want to read these last few.

646
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,800
But I want everybody to remember that when I read,

647
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,960
in the one second it takes me to read one of these names,

648
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,760
it is representative of a full feature length film

649
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,040
that people made with their hearts and hands.

650
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,440
Minimum 30-day shooting schedule.

651
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,240
Probably $3 million budget.

652
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,840
Like every single one.

653
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,520
Hollywood hotshot Travis McElroy.

654
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
Broadcasting Christmas.

655
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,680
A December bride.

656
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,480
Kind of non-secular take there.

657
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,160
Christmas in Homestead.

658
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,120
Christmas list.

659
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,240
A heavenly Christmas.

660
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,560
Journey back to Christmas.

661
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,520
We have to go back.

662
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,960
A dream of Christmas.

663
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,480
Looks like Christmas.

664
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,640
Wait, it's just cult.

665
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,520
Looks like Christmas.

666
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,480
Looks like Christmas.

667
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,320
A Nutcracker Christmas.

668
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,600
Love you like Christmas.

669
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,480
Okay, wait.

670
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:58,800
Whoa.

671
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,200
And My Christmas Loves Sleigh Bells Ring

672
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,920
and When Calls the Heart Christmas,

673
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,480
which was just released literally yesterday.

674
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,480
When Calls the Heart Christmas?

675
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,160
When Calls the Heart Christmas.

676
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,680
Okay.

677
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,760
Hey, we forgot a word in this tie-dub.

678
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
Does that matter?

679
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:16,880
Nah.

680
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,440
How about another question?

681
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,280
Cause we've done one.

682
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,720
Uh, yeah.

683
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,600
A few years ago,

684
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,160
I was celebrating Candle Nights with my in-laws

685
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,080
and it was time to open up our stockings.

686
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,160
So we were all chanting stocking,

687
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,480
stocking, stocking,

688
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,720
which naturally became Star King,

689
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
Star King, Star King.

690
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
We decided this was to be the new Christmas Lord.

691
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,040
Candle Nights Lord.

692
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,240
Candle Nights Lord, right.

693
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,320
Now, instead of Santa,

694
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,720
we give out gifts from the Star King.

695
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,880
The problem is I now have a son

696
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,800
and I'm worried that he'll end up an outcast

697
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,160
because of our tradition.

698
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,120
For perspective,

699
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,200
I have a friend who had a real tough time in school

700
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,160
because her parents told her

701
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,320
the Trash Man came on November 1,

702
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
took away her Halloween candy

703
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,800
and replaced it with a toy.

704
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,400
The Trash Man!

705
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,680
They couldn't come up with like a slightly more whimsical...

706
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,840
The Candy Fairy came.

707
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,280
The Candy Boy.

708
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,480
I'm the Candy Boy.

709
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,640
Come away with me, Whoppers.

710
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,840
You're mine now.

711
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm going to suckle you on my way home.

712
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
Here's an action toy.

713
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,840
No, instead it's,

714
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,000
hey, I'm out for the candy.

715
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,400
Hey, man, you gotta put the candy out by the curb.

716
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,600
I'm not gonna walk back.

717
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,040
I'm gonna walk in your room.

718
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,480
I'm not gonna walk back there and grab it.

719
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,560
You gonna give it to Hungry Child of the World?

720
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,480
No, I'm gonna throw it in the trash.

721
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,160
No, man, it goes right into the comeback here.

722
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,520
It's gonna go in the trash.

723
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,080
But where does it go?

724
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,600
Where does any of the trash go?

725
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,280
Into the river.

726
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,080
All your Twizzlers gonna end up in the river

727
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,840
because that's where the trash may not.

728
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,200
For the fishes.

729
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,000
For the fishes.

730
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,120
Here's a Polly Pocket.

731
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,920
And a Mad Max toy for you.

732
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,280
I took this away from another kid at the end of last Christmas season.

733
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,840
It's a real cyclical gig I got.

734
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,960
You should know somebody done threw away this Polly Pocket.

735
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,120
It's a circle of life.

736
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,040
I'm gonna throw it in the trash.

737
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
I'm gonna throw it in the trash.

738
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,720
Uh, am I good?

739
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,480
Or should I try to give my son a more mainstream candlelight?

740
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
That's from Star King's Humble Servant.

741
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,800
I mean, you've already adopted our weird holiday.

742
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,800
So like, your kid's gonna be unconventional with his holiday tradition.

743
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,000
But the good news is this.

744
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,720
In this modern age, the problem with the Halloween thing is

745
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,560
everybody knows what Halloween is.

746
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,440
So you can't just introduce like the trash man comes

747
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
and everyone's like, no, he doesn't.

748
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,760
No, that's nothing.

749
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,680
We also do Halloween.

750
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,880
But when you say we like the Star Lord brings,

751
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,840
the Star King brings presents on candlelight,

752
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,800
any teacher is gonna go, uh, okay.

753
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,760
What is that?

754
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,160
They're just not going to question this stuff they don't know.

755
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
There is something interesting about like,

756
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,280
because people are usually fairly insular on Christmas day,

757
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
there is a certain intimacy or like secrecy with like,

758
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,360
what is your, like, that's a common question.

759
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,440
Like, so what is your, what do you guys do?

760
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Because it's like, so it's not like, it hasn't been sort of,

761
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,560
the edges of it have not been sanded off through like socialization.

762
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,080
Like everybody's just doing whatever weird thing they've always done for Christmas.

763
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,000
But there is, there is a, there's a limit to that though, Juicer,

764
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,320
because it can't, what do you do on Christmas?

765
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,200
Well, my family, we open our stuff on Christmas Eve and it's really great.

766
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,760
What do you do?

767
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,360
Well, the Star King descends from the cosmos.

768
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,960
Here's what you gotta do, Griffin.

769
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,200
You need to give Star King a leg up over Santa.

770
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,880
So when your, your kid is talking to other kids and your kid's like,

771
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,600
yeah, Star King comes like, Star King doesn't come,

772
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,880
Santa comes and brings presents.

773
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,120
And he's like, oh, Star King comes and brings presents

774
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,880
and gives me a hundred dollar bill every year.

775
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,480
And the kid's like, oh, dang, I love Star King.

776
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,840
Star King sounds way better.

777
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,480
Also every year the Star King kills and eats Santa Claus

778
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,000
and there has to be a new Santa Claus each year.

779
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,600
Have you seen the Santa Claus movie?

780
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,200
Do you not remember at the end of the first one

781
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,840
when Tim Allen is killed and devoured by the Star King?

782
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,960
They have to do, Santa, Santa and the Star King have to do battle

783
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,000
every single Christmas Eve and our fate is decided by, by their struggle.

784
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,840
Star King always wins.

785
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,640
He's the king of the stars.

786
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,320
What do you want me to, what do you want me to say?

787
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,040
What do you want?

788
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,360
I don't know.

789
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,080
I don't know what to tell you.

790
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,280
I feel like we're at a crossroads right now, Boyos,

791
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,840
because this, we're having a lot of fun here,

792
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,000
but I do not want to send this, this, the small child into school

793
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
armed with our, our japes.

794
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,720
I do not want him going around and be like,

795
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,080
so what'd you guys get from the Star King?

796
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,520
Oh, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

797
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,160
Um, what is, hmm.

798
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,680
You gotta cloak it.

799
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
Yeah, that's what, that's what, that's the crossroads.

800
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Is candlelight's going to become the next big thing

801
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,960
or is it a super dope secret holiday society?

802
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,080
This is the decision point.

803
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,240
We are standing at it now because if it's the next big thing,

804
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,120
we need to get out the good word of Star King right now.

805
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,960
If not, then wait, we didn't come up with Star King.

806
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
No, but he's canonical, definitely.

807
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,920
I'm on board.

808
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
Yeah, I'm on board.

809
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
So the Star King is canonical.

810
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
Yes, but I don't want to make him the main focus.

811
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,440
He is in there.

812
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,200
He's in the mix, you know what I mean?

813
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,760
No kings.

814
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,000
No kings on the man.

815
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,200
Except for the Star King, um, who is the king of stars.

816
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,880
But I, I, here, okay.

817
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,600
Maybe tell your son, tell your child,

818
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,480
like the Star King comes for you.

819
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,080
Everyone else has been bad.

820
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,840
And like, no one else in your school

821
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,080
has deserved the love of the Star King.

822
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,760
And so like, you can't tell them

823
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
or you will be shunned because you are the chosen.

824
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,760
Santa Claus is for second rate kids.

825
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,680
Star King is for closers.

826
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,200
Star King is the one that comes for the real good kids.

827
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,000
You've reached our platinum level status, child.

828
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,280
Santa Claus is a participation medal

829
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,240
and you are getting the Oscar for best kid.

830
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Star King only comes to one kid a year and it's you.

831
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,240
But you can't tell the others or you'll be purged.

832
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,600
I had to pay a lot of money for this.

833
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,760
Don't go running your mouth about it.

834
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I don't want your friends to think we're Gigi.

835
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,080
A lot of star money printed,

836
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,880
printed from the plasma of, of those hot, hot babies.

837
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,560
Do you guys want a yahoo?

838
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,920
Uh, yeah.

839
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,400
Yeah, I do.

840
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,560
This one was sent in by level 9,000 Yajur Jujujampur.

841
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,960
Thank you, Drew.

842
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
It's Yajur answer's user.

843
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
They are anonymous.

844
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,120
It's the Star King asks,

845
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,480
why does Santa Claus spelled with an E,

846
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,120
that movie has just poisoned this thing, huh?

847
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,320
Yeah, it's miserable.

848
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,280
Why does Santa Claus allow Rudolph to get bullied by the other reindeer?

849
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,080
Santa has a duty to keep all his reindeer safe.

850
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,840
Let's talk, let's talk about, oh, okay.

851
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,160
Well, I, okay.

852
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,880
Here's what that meant.

853
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,440
Cause I just rewatched this and I realized the misconception is that

854
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,520
there are only eight reindeer and Rudolph.

855
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,720
Santa only wants the best.

856
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,840
There's a whole thing about them trying out and he's like,

857
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,360
maybe you'll be good enough.

858
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,800
Santa is very withholding of his love to all the reindeers.

859
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,600
This holiday special is taking a fun Ayn Rand turn.

860
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,320
It's true though, because they're all out there competing.

861
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,120
There's a coach who's judging their performance.

862
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,200
And if, maybe if they're good enough,

863
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,880
they'll make it up to the big show.

864
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,160
No, they don't though.

865
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,560
This is what kills me about the Rudolph show.

866
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,800
They're all training these like new reindeer.

867
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,280
And they're like, I hope I make it on Santa's team.

868
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,000
You won't.

869
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,280
Santa has eight and he always has those same eight.

870
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,640
And your dad, by the way, Rudolph knows this.

871
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:42,880
Yeah.

872
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,640
This is not new information to him.

873
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,960
Every year, a crop of young comers tries to make a run at the throne

874
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,760
and they get beat back down by the original eight

875
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,600
as it always shall be.

876
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,280
Now, once Rudolph gets his place on there

877
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,040
and kind of upsets the symmetry a little bit,

878
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,200
he's on there for good.

879
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,960
But why are we putting lies in the heads of these little reindeer?

880
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,480
They're like, I'm going to make the squat.

881
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,120
You're not.

882
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,680
You're not.

883
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,160
You're not.

884
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,920
It's the eight guys.

885
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,400
You need five years of experience just to be considered.

886
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,960
But how do I get the experience?

887
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,040
Let's set aside that cruel arithmetic though and talk about,

888
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,200
there is a part where Rudolph gets a smooch-a-roo

889
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,000
and he's flying through the sky, flying beautifully.

890
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,920
Most beautiful flight you've ever seen.

891
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
And Santa's like, oh, sick.

892
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,360
And then he lands.

893
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,080
Super tight, bro.

894
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,640
He's like, sick.

895
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,960
That was some dope Air Force stuff.

896
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,760
I'm losing my mind.

897
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,480
That was so great.

898
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,960
Way to go.

899
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,200
You're like a blue angel.

900
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,920
Yeah.

901
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,400
And then he lands and his dumb nose cap falls off

902
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,080
and he's got that red nose.

903
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,240
And then Santa Claus is like, ooh.

904
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,960
Santa Claus is like, your face is all, what's with your jacked up face?

905
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,760
No way.

906
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,080
Get up.

907
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,280
What's with your ugly nose?

908
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
Get out of here, ugly nose.

909
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,200
You fly super good, but you've got a weird ugly nose

910
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
and I just can't hang with that.

911
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,360
But why are we surprised by this, Griffin?

912
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,520
Because the whole Santa Claus thing is like,

913
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,640
you got to earn his love.

914
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,360
Santa Claus is not the most forgiving.

915
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,000
He's not like, I love you even when you do bad stuff.

916
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,400
If you do bad stuff, you're off the list.

917
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,960
I watched the special Twas the Night Before Christmas

918
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,280
with the mice and the clock and the singing.

919
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,320
And this one kid writes a letter like,

920
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,440
we don't believe in Santa Claus.

921
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,040
And Santa Claus is like, all right.

922
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,360
Well, your town's dead to me now.

923
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,320
And returns all of their letters marked like,

924
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,800
returned from recipient, addressee, returned.

925
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,440
And everyone in town is like, oh, cool.

926
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,120
Well, I guess we burned Santa and he burned us right back.

927
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,040
And all of those people are out.

928
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
You only get one with Santa.

929
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Santa does not forgive and forget.

930
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,360
And that's the good thing about Stark King.

931
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,600
He's only going to visit one child.

932
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,280
But that's an unwavering love.

933
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,280
Yeah, that's true.

934
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,520
Once you're in with Stark King, you're in.

935
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,280
Well, man, canonize rules.

936
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,480
Christmas is over.

937
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,400
Yeah, Christmas is yesterday.

938
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,360
Stark King wouldn't play favorites with reindeer.

939
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,840
I know.

940
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,400
I feel like this-

941
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,680
He would kill all of them.

942
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,240
I feel like this has been a very Christmas heavy

943
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,720
holiday special.

944
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,400
But I really just think it is just a really thorough

945
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,320
evaluation of this being called Christmas.

946
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,680
And I think we got to put it to,

947
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,480
I think we put it,

948
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,520
I think it's time to put it to bed and let the Stark King rain.

949
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
We actually, when we were filming the show,

950
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,480
we got to hang out with some pagans and talk to them

951
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,920
because we were looking for like,

952
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,160
other holidays to incorporate into canonize.

953
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,800
Not just like, you know, the super mainstream ones.

954
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,040
And we learned all about Yule and stuff.

955
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,440
And like what you do at Yule is you talk about awesome stuff

956
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,440
and you eat a bunch of food and you dance and you drink

957
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,680
and you just hang out and you have a good time.

958
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,960
And somehow that got knocked out for Christmas.

959
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,200
That's horse apples.

960
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,960
I want to reincorporate more of Yule into Candle Nights.

961
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
I want Yule Brenner to be Santa.

962
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,640
Kind of a cool, bold-

963
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,840
No, Santa's out.

964
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,480
Santa's out.

965
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,120
Stark King.

966
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,240
No, okay, hold on.

967
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,160
Wait, we should, I don't want to be exclusive.

968
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,960
I don't want to actually wage a war on Christmas.

969
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,480
Santa can stay, but only sexy Toronto fashion Santa.

970
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
He's the only one now.

971
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,280
And if you want presents, you need to get to Toronto.

972
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,080
That's what's up.

973
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,000
I would like Stark King to be Yule Brenner,

974
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,600
but Yule Brenner from Cool Runnings.

975
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:32,480
No.

976
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,400
Yule Brenner was not in Cool Runnings.

977
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
The name of the character is Yule Brenner.

978
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,280
Get bent.

979
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,480
I'm not making that up.

980
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
No, it's true.

981
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,440
I mean, if it's going to be the Stark King,

982
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,360
then we're talking about, wait, was he in Blade Runner?

983
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,240
I don't know anything.

984
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,400
Yule Brenner?

985
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I don't, I just don't know anything about anything.

986
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,320
Yeah, fashion Santa is the only Santa that we recognize here

987
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,920
at, in Candle Nights.

988
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
And I think he's sort of like a,

989
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,920
he doesn't have a position of authority.

990
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,360
He feels like a number two.

991
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,320
Like an emissary.

992
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,120
I would say emissary.

993
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,000
He can't make the decisions, but he can definitely hand them down.

994
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,120
Like if Stark King is like the Michael Eisner CEO,

995
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,280
Fashion Santa is like the Frank Wells president,

996
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,320
sort of the person that makes the train.

997
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,160
A reference everyone can understand.

998
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,280
Not just Justin, who's been reading a book about the inner workings at Disney.

999
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
So the person that makes the trains run, you know?

1000
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,040
That's, that's Fashion Santa.

1001
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,800
Fashion Santa is the up eye works to Stark King's Walt Disney.

1002
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,440
Do you guys think Yule Brenner and Rutger Hauer

1003
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,320
do like all kinds of like fun parent traps,

1004
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,880
sort of like switcheroos where they just switch lives

1005
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,960
and everybody's like, Rutger?

1006
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,480
And Yule's like, yes.

1007
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,440
And they're like, oh, okay.

1008
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,200
Your names, your names, your name.

1009
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,480
Hey, you've got a weird name, right?

1010
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,520
Yes, I do.

1011
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,560
That one's not even a lie.

1012
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,440
I was going to ask, it's not that they look alike,

1013
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,080
it's that their names are confusingly weird to you.

1014
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:07,760
Listen.

1015
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
And also it's another fun,

1016
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,840
another fun fact is one is dead and one is alive.

1017
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,160
But you'll never guess which.

1018
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,640
Now that makes things easier on the living one

1019
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,080
because he's sort of a day walker.

1020
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,720
Now he can switch between roles and it's not even a big thing.

1021
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,080
So we, are we done?

1022
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,840
I think, I think we're getting, I think we're getting pretty close.

1023
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,320
I don't, I don't have any more good yahoos

1024
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,240
unless we have like another tight question to bounce into real quick.

1025
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,640
Trav, is there any that you would especially like to...

1026
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,360
Yes, I do.

1027
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,200
Can I read it so I don't have to communicate it across the table to you?

1028
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,680
Yeah.

1029
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,720
I bought some presents for my friend's kids this candlelight.

1030
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,240
Her younger one is nine months old

1031
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,880
and I found these awesome stuffed dragons that make noise.

1032
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,080
The only problem, they're technically dog toys.

1033
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,360
This again, this again.

1034
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,040
This again, this again, huh?

1035
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,680
I already gave them to her but didn't mention the dog toy part.

1036
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,240
Honestly, I think the more annoying toy is the foam lightsaber

1037
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,200
I got her eight-year-old.

1038
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,560
Am I good?

1039
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,760
That's from Guilty Gifter.

1040
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,520
Is 2017 just gonna be the year where we all realize

1041
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,120
that the things that are good for humans

1042
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,600
are also things that are good for dogs and vice versa

1043
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,600
and we are just like an island of Dr. Moreau style just finally merged.

1044
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,920
The flesh becomes fur, the fur becomes flesh

1045
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,360
and we all just start yiffing each other's brains out 2017.

1046
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,840
Welcome to the yiffing year.

1047
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,040
It's time to begin.

1048
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,240
I think it is hysterical

1049
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,520
if you think about humans are supposed to be the more advanced species.

1050
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,560
Dogs do not make this distinction, have not, will not, ever.

1051
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,120
You give them something for them and they're like,

1052
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,480
hmm, cool, something for me.

1053
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,920
Here's other things for me.

1054
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,560
Everything in your home is a dog thing.

1055
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,640
They're not drawing those lines.

1056
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,360
No, and I've seen my dog attempt to eat stuff

1057
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,680
that will quite literally kill her.

1058
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,080
And like you would think that the animal,

1059
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,120
like I can look at poison and be like, hmm, no, no.

1060
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,640
No arsenic for me, thank you.

1061
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,680
But my dog sees grapes and she's like, well, why the heck not?

1062
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,680
No, well, I do wanna say, Travis,

1063
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,160
the reverse of that would be you see Beggar's strips

1064
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,040
and you think, hmm, for me, that would actually kill you.

1065
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,200
That would definitely kill you.

1066
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,760
Those are made out of-

1067
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,880
I don't think, wait, hold on, girl.

1068
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,800
I don't think Beggar's strips would kill me.

1069
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,560
Yeah, they're made out of red, smoky human poison.

1070
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,440
They are not good.

1071
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,120
They're not good for Trav tummy.

1072
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,000
Travis, it's important.

1073
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,760
This is now a PSA for you, my boy.

1074
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,520
Don't eat a Beggar's strip, my boy.

1075
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,720
I would never eat a Beggar's strip.

1076
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,120
Don't eat one of those poppin' things

1077
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,200
that shoot out of the little rubber pig nose thing

1078
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,760
that looks like a lot of fun to catch Cheetos in.

1079
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,680
But if it's one of the meatballs, then you'll die.

1080
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,400
There are actually a lot of snacks.

1081
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,200
Now that I've owned a dog with a slightly sensitive tummy,

1082
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,040
there are many dog snacks made for dogs

1083
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,880
that everybody just kind of accepts.

1084
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,480
Like, yeah, give this to your dog.

1085
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,720
They're definitely gonna puke it up.

1086
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,960
But like, what are you gonna do?

1087
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,400
It's like, wait, hold on.

1088
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,320
Have we all just accepted that 50% of dog treats are like,

1089
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,280
oh no, you give your dog this Pavaroni,

1090
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,360
you are going to diarrhea station.

1091
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,800
Have fun, your dog loves it.

1092
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,000
I think you can give the child these,

1093
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,200
and I don't think it's a thing.

1094
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,640
Obviously.

1095
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,120
Unless it-

1096
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,040
A tennis ball is a toy for everyone.

1097
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,240
A tennis ball is a toy for everyone.

1098
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,080
Unless.

1099
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,520
Unless.

1100
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,120
That sound.

1101
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,360
That sound that the dragons make.

1102
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,480
They make noise.

1103
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,960
Is that noise, squeaking?

1104
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,920
Because that's a dog toy.

1105
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,960
That's for dogs.

1106
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,080
Or is it like, thank you for biting me, Gerald, the dog.

1107
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,800
Now let me read you a story.

1108
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,320
Well, I don't know why that dog would get anything out of that.

1109
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,200
I don't know, it's like for the kid.

1110
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,040
You know, like that's what kids toys do.

1111
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,320
They read them stories.

1112
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,520
This is an excellent point, Gerald,

1113
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,440
because if that kid like grows up

1114
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,880
and that becomes their favorite toy,

1115
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,800
like you can't get that toy away from that kid,

1116
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,000
and they're like three years old

1117
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,120
and they take their favorite dragon to like the park,

1118
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,800
to the playground and they squeeze that

1119
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,640
and every single parent at the park goes, it's a dog toy.

1120
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,400
That is a dog, that's a toy for dogs.

1121
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,840
It's a dog toy.

1122
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,400
Do you know that?

1123
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,440
You know that, right?

1124
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,880
Like, do you know that's a dog toy?

1125
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,760
Okay.

1126
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,240
I say whatever makes your little one happy,

1127
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,000
it's not your little one.

1128
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,520
Oh, shoot.

1129
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,080
Teddy Ruxpin is back, by the way.

1130
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,000
Speaking of toys that tell stories,

1131
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Teddy Ruxpin's gonna be the hot toy in 2017.

1132
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,280
I'm calling it right now.

1133
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,800
Is it a fashion Teddy Ruxpin?

1134
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,520
No, it's regular.

1135
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,480
Well, I mean, he looks good.

1136
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,320
He looks good.

1137
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,200
He's kept in shape.

1138
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,200
He's kept, he's taking care of himself.

1139
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,440
I'm calling it right now just so you can get out in front of it.

1140
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,080
It's gonna be the hot toy of 2017.

1141
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,880
Okay.

1142
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
Coming in, like, the summer, I think.

1143
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,240
So, buy deep and buy hard.

1144
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,360
Teddy Ruxpin's back.

1145
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,680
Gross.

1146
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,240
It was, and I'm so glad that everybody got out to see Trolls this year.

1147
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,560
I'm so glad that, I saw all my friends at the theater,

1148
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,880
and I was like, you're seeing Trolls today too?

1149
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,920
And I was like, yeah, wouldn't miss it.

1150
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,320
And so we-

1151
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,880
Wait, did you go see Trolls?

1152
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,840
Trolls, baby.

1153
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,480
It's pretty good.

1154
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,000
I know, I've heard it's very good.

1155
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,160
I'm never gonna go see another movie again.

1156
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,120
Unfortunately.

1157
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,920
Had plans to see Rogue One.

1158
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,840
It was gonna be my one little sneak away mission,

1159
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,720
my one little Metal Gear Solid Snake sneak away mission

1160
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,520
away from the home just to see Rogue One real quick

1161
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,040
and then back forever.

1162
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,600
But everybody in the house got diarrhea all at the same time.

1163
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,760
So sorry, sorry, George Lucas.

1164
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,880
I'm gonna have to see your wonderful fable at a later date.

1165
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,120
Sorry, George Lucas.

1166
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,360
Gonna have to hear about the Death Star and Darth Vader

1167
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,560
and all his fun adventures on a later date.

1168
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,160
Maybe I'll catch it direct to DVD.

1169
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,920
Thank you, George, but no.

1170
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,600
More like Darth Later.

1171
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,840
Darth Later, sorry, the Death Star hit everyone

1172
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,640
in my house's tummies and gave all three of us diarrhea.

1173
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,240
And their diarrhea beam.

1174
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,320
We got hit by the diarrhea beam from the Death Star

1175
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,840
and the baby's very small,

1176
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,920
but maybe just as much, if not more diarrhea than me.

1177
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,200
And I'm not sure how that's possible.

1178
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,760
Great, thank you, George Lucas, but tomorrow.

1179
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,120
And I forget what I was talking about.

1180
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,560
Please don't spoil Rogue One for me.

1181
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,280
Please, just don't spoil Rogue One, okay?

1182
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,640
Okay, that's gonna do it for us.

1183
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,520
I wanna say this is a fun thing.

1184
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,040
We are, there's gonna be a little,

1185
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,600
a little holiday sneak peek, and I do mean very little,

1186
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,760
but a little teaser.

1187
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,840
A little teaser of our TV show.

1188
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,600
It's going to be, it's not gonna be,

1189
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,560
I wanna temper it, because it's.

1190
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,120
I wanna temper it, but it's funny.

1191
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,600
There's just a little bit of foot, here's the first,

1192
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,920
the first released footage from our television program

1193
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,040
will appear today.

1194
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,200
There will be a beefier boy coming out soon

1195
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,240
with more stuff in it.

1196
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,680
This is just an amused beach.

1197
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,720
I don't want you to get excited,

1198
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,920
but it's just a dumb ol' thing.

1199
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,360
You can find it on Twitter,

1200
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,360
or Twitter.com slash CISO TV,

1201
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,200
or Twitter.com slash MBAM.

1202
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,120
We will be putting it there, as well.

1203
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,960
So, it'll be up this afternoon.

1204
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,920
It's just a little thing.

1205
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,320
It's like a really, it's a really little thing.

1206
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,720
It's just fun and flirty and a little thing.

1207
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,080
It's not any big deal.

1208
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,840
We need to convene at some point, boys,

1209
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,520
and decide, because this is our last episode

1210
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,480
of this rotten garbage year,

1211
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,240
and I think we need to get together

1212
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,240
and really figure out how we can help

1213
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,760
the 2017 effort,

1214
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,800
because they're gonna need us now more than ever,

1215
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,640
and we need a good name for it.

1216
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,520
2017, I'm leaning towards just like,

1217
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,960
but it also has the connotations of,

1218
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,560
you know, we're all gonna die,

1219
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,720
and I'm not so obsessed about that.

1220
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,560
20-given-teen, is that too much of a stretch?

1221
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,280
That's not, yeah.

1222
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,440
2011-teen, just get into bread.

1223
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,800
Or into Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

1224
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,560
2011-teen.

1225
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,880
2011-teen is good.

1226
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,920
Just kind of, Joseph.

1227
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,000
Anyway, we'll figure it out.

1228
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,200
We'll piece it together.

1229
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,680
We won't.

1230
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,040
We'll forget, and then we'll have to do it

1231
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,840
in the middle of the next episode.

1232
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,960
Brevet-teen, where we all learn about, like, wit.

1233
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,480
Okay, that is actually the end of the program, right?

1234
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:08,720
Yeah.

1235
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,080
It is, right?

1236
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,000
We wanna say thank you to John Rogers and the Lawn Winners

1237
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,440
for using their theme song.

1238
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,800
It's a departure off the album,

1239
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,160
putting the days to bed.

1240
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,080
Hope you found that in your stockings this year.

1241
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,080
I do wanna, I do.

1242
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,600
Sorry, what were you gonna say, Travis?

1243
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,680
I was gonna say, go check out all the other amazing shows

1244
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,960
on MaximumFun.org.

1245
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,760
I wanna say, it has been a pretty stinky, stinky year.

1246
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,200
Lost George Michael yesterday.

1247
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,960
Thank you, excellent, great.

1248
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,000
Just wanna get in on the wire.

1249
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,040
Just wanna get one last one.

1250
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,640
Oh, not on Christmas, though.

1251
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,000
On Christmas, excellent, great.

1252
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,280
Cool and great and cool.

1253
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,200
It's been a rough one.

1254
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,640
We've gotten a lot of, especially in the last, like, month or so,

1255
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,960
like, messages from people saying that the podcast

1256
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,160
and the other stuff we do has helped bring some,

1257
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,000
Joseph Gordon-Levitty to the stinkier.

1258
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,240
And I just wanna say, like,

1259
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,360
because we've gotten a lot of those messages,

1260
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,760
like, I wanna say that you all have also helped us

1261
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,960
get through this stinkier.

1262
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,000
And thank you all very, very much.

1263
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,280
And we won't be, we will not be stopped.

1264

We're gonna come at you hard in 2017.

1265
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,240
We're gonna just, we're gonna flood you with this stuff.

1266
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,240
And yeah, thank you all for being there for us.

1267
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,720
And we'll see you next time.

1268
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,040

And a safe new year, yeah, we'll check you out later.

1272
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,080
Here's your final Yahoo, final holiday Yahoo.

1273
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,080
Canonized Yahoo, sent in by Nicholas Potter.

1274

Thank you, Nicholas Potter, it's Yahoo Answers user.

1275
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,560
Sasa Sasa Sa, who says,

1276
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,000
if I send a spear into space and it pierces the sun,

1277
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,680
will the sun explode?

1278
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,240

Happy Candle Nights, my name's Justin McElroy.

1284
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,680
Following the news is hard and it sucks.

1285
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,680
How do you know which stories are important?

1286
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,120
Which sources do you trust

1287
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,080

We debunk misleading clickbait headlines.

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,920
And we always try to throw in a little bit of good news.

1294
