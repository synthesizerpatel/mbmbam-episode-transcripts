1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,200
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Ladies and gentlemen, we got brave fever

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,880
here at my brother, my brother, and me. Every movie that comes out, every movie

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,480
that reaches a certain box office gross and rotten tomatoes rating.

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,480
Travis has seen the film. He won't stop talking about it. Travis, give us your review of Brave,

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,120
the new hit from Disney's McDonald's Pixar's. I'm glad you asked, Justin. Let me break it

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,880
down for you. So there's this red-haired girl, right? She's sick of being a girl because it sucks.

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,200
In the context of the movie, I don't think that's in real life, but she's living in 10th century

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,120
Scotland, so they want to burn her for being a woman. Good to be a dude back then. Yeah,

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,160
it's so great. Everybody loved dudes. So they're like, oh, you're a girl,

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,440
we're going to burn you, right? Because she's a witch, obviously. Because she's got red hair.

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,400
And so then she throws it back in their faces and she's like, fine, then I'll be a witch.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,840
And so she turns her brothers into bears and then she rides a horse for a while.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,640
And then she's at the Stonehenge and she does some magic. And all of a sudden, Wally is there.

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,120
And they're hanging out. Let me interrupt you.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,840
And they're trying to find Nemo, right? Can I interrupt you for a second, please?

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,200
Yes. That's exactly right.

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,160
I haven't seen the film, but I read the official review in the Christian Science Monitor,

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,520
and that is word for word, witchcraft and bears. I did read the original script leak

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,520
on coolnews.com and it was there. Isn't it kind of cool? This is the name of that website.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
This is perhaps cool. Hey, neato. neato.com.

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:38,480
Take this in. As you've probably guessed, this is an advice show primarily. Not just advising you on

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,520
which cinema that you should take in, although that's obviously an important role that we play

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,600
here. It's one of our facets. Predominantly, we give advice on life's little road bumps.

30
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,640
Life's little stumblers. Life's little polyps.

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,560
Life's stumblers, too. Still stumbling. Life's little fiddly farts.

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,600
Life's little sharting. People need advice after that kind of event.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,840
Hey, I'm a nail biter. Where's the closest door?

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm a nail biter. Along came Polly, everyone.

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,400
Classic. Next up, Travis talks about some Indian food he had and now it's upsetting.

36
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,680
Hey, you got a ferret? Fucking asshole. I'm a nail biter. I'm not proud of it,

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,800
but it's true. I never do the deed in public, but it can still be embarrassing when people

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,640
notice my nails. My girlfriend is also not so much a fan of this habit and is always

39
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,760
encouraging me to stop. I am meeting her family next month and I want to have it under control

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,520
before I meet them. How do I kill this habit that has had some 20 something years of reinforcement?

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,320
That's from Nom Nom Nom in Denver. Are you eating them?

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,440
Are you consuming your nails for power? Don't do that. It's a lot of empty calories.

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,200
You have to cut your nails so that you can use them to clean your teeth.

44
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Didn't Gwen Stefani have to get her stomach pumped because she had like

45
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,080
30 pounds of nails? Don't just fucking spread lies around.

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,560
It was either nails or semen. She had 30 pounds of semen nails?

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,040
She had 30 pounds of something in her stomach. It might have been semen or maybe nails,

48
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
but maybe heroin. No doubt.

49
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,160
What I've always heard that people do is like put like Tabasco sauce or like red pepper or

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,920
something on your nails to stop them biting them. Can you imagine forgetting and going to like

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,040
scratch an itch on your eye or something? Or jerk off your penis.

52
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
And all of a sudden you have to kill yourself because your penis is on fire.

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,760
I'm not a good, I'm perhaps not the best person to be advising this because I still occasionally do.

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,440
I think the grand scope of habits, it's not that bad.

55
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,960
As long as you keep your nails clean.

56
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,880
You physically can't do that. That's physically impossible.

57
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,320
I am actually constantly scraping from under my nails,

58
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,880
usually with a pocket knife, which is horrifying for people.

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,320
You're filing and picking habits are awful because I know that that pocket knife isn't cauterized.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
It's so much germs up in there. You know it's so much germs.

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,560
And you're just getting those in your mouth and you're eating them and swallowing them.

63
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
And you're going to get polyps.

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,040
That's a question. How do you stop?

65
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,880
I have I have a counter suggestion. Okay. Rather than stopping, if your fear is people noticing

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,400
them, come up with a story for why your nails look like that and tell them you're really into

67
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,040
power sanding. Okay. Okay.

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,000
Then you keep getting your nails too close to the belt sander.

69
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,200
It happens to me all the time, guys. Sure.

70
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,200
And then people think you're a noble carpenter.

71
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,400
Are you saying the problem is not that he bites his nails in front of people?

72
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,200
It's that he has unsightly nails. It's an image problem.

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,960
So just go to the manicurist. Get them that could be okay.

74
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,360
Let me hit you with this. Why don't you go to a manicurist?

75
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,600
Go every week and have them just like get a great look.

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
And then you'll think to yourself, like, I can't bite these nails.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,640
I paid so much for these. It has to be a really expensive manicure, by the way.

78
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you think that they make like edible press on nails?

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Like just nails? Like the hit SNL sketch corn chip nail tips?

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
Is that what you're talking about right now? No, I wasn't.

81
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,920
Oh, start putting some bugles on your fingers. Okay.

82
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,600
If you put bugles on your fingers. How is that not a temporary fucking fix?

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
Bugles ain't permanent. You gotta have a lot of fucking bugles.

84
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,920
I wish bugles were permanent. I wish that instead of cartilage,

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,840
I had bugle bone. I wish I had bugle bone.

86
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,200
That's actually one of the curses that the red haired witch does in Brave.

87
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,920
She gives somebody permanent bugles. The old boogie boogie bugle boots.

88
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,440
From company B. I think that the main problem with bugle nails

89
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,120
is that at the end of it, you will just have perfectly seasoned nails.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,920
Delightful and playful even in their piquant tastes.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
They have a Southwest flavor that you're sure to enjoy.

92
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,960
You're going to have to fight the rest of the family off to get to these nails.

93
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
Let me throw this out as a way to stop doing it.

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
Here's my suggestion. Stop doing it.

95
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,000
There's like cold turkey. Just don't do it anymore.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
That's good. Is this hypnosis? I've heard about this.

97
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
What I'm saying like, what is there other like you could put super glue on your nails

98
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
and make them taste really nasty, but like anything you do,

99
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
it's going to be so remarkably unpleasant. This is just stop doing it.

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
Being on a show with Dr. Drew, it's great.

101
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,400
Dr. Drew, all of his shows about self-help. Put down the fucking sandwich.

102
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,120
What if I wanted to quit heroin, Travis? What would you suggest?

103
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,600
Just fucking stop it. Right. Just not doing it.

104
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,280
You're better than that. Sure.

105
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
Aren't you? Could have fooled me.

106
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,840
Oh man. It's kind of like your tone of voice is a little more Hulk Hogan though.

107
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
It's like having Hulk Hogan as my mentor.

108
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,960
It swings from like tough love to like, I hate you love.

109
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,840
Yeah. All right.

110
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
They only have two settings. It's just a good thing that Travis doesn't

111
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,440
have any bad habits because who would be around to remedy them if not himself?

112
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,840
Sometimes I just like stare in the mirror and I'm just like, stop it.

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
Yeah. But you're not-

114
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,280
And I start crying. And you're not addressing anything because

115
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,960
you're a perfect man. Yeah.

116
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,440
You're trying to- Honestly, I'm worried I'm being too perfect.

117
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,560
Like I fear that it alienates others. It does.

118
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,080
If you're just worried about, if it's hurting your self-esteem that you can't

119
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,920
quit this habit, think of all of the habits that you are simultaneously quitting.

120
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,840
Like think of all the things that you're not doing in that moment that other people with

121
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,960
addictions are definitely doing. Like you might be biting your nails,

122
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,040
but at that exact moment you're not smoking. You're not whoring.

123
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
30 pounds of nails in the tummy. That's-

124
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,680
You're talking- That's, how is that? That's the worst.

125
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,160
You know, that's what don't, you know, that's what don't speaks about.

126
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,680
Don't speak, I'm busy eating fingernails.

127
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
You know the sweet maraca solo in that song?

128
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
It's not a maraca. It's not a maraca.

129
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,560
It's a tummy.

130
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
Her tummy has become hardened and gored like from all the nails.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
There's just little points poking out from the edges. Like, oh, don't mind that.

132
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
Is it possible that you could start doing like an even worse habit?

133
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,960
And then when your girlfriend's like, you need to stop firing your gun in the house.

134
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,440
You can be like, well, I guess I could go back to biting my fingernails.

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,320
Yeah.

136
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,840
Yeah, do that.

137
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,280
I like that. Make her be happy about this bad habit you have.

138
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,120
Gwen Stefani had a baby. Can you imagine being in a stomach

139
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,840
that also is adjacent to 30 pounds? It's like living with a giant pine cone in your house.

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,360
She was eating fingernails for two.

141
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,360
Sorry.

142
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
You came out with a taste.

143
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
That kid came out with fucking antlers.

144
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,840
Poor Gwen.

145
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
Poor, poor Gwen Stefani.

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
Alternate suggestion, dip your nails in poison.

147
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
That's like the pain box from Dune.

148
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,880
Like you got to keep it ever present in your mind because poisonous nails are the mind killer.

149
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
It's like a zero strike policy.

150
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,680
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:27,920
Right.

152
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
Well, I guess you get the one strike.

153
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
One strike, you're out.

154
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,280
But then that's it. Yeah.

155
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,800
Best beds are honestly just to cut them, cut them with nail clippers and then-

156
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
Real funny, Justin.

157
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,440
Sorry.

158
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,080
Oh, bring in some more chuggles. Back up the chuggles.

159
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Boop, boop, boop.

160
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,320
Just dump that load of chuggles right over here.

161
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
What if you just cut them? Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. You didn't let me finish.

162
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
You didn't let me finish. The scissors are pickles.

163
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Damn it.

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
You really pulled out of that nosedive at the last second.

165
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,560
Good work, Baloo the bear.

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
He's the only trick pilot I could think of, you guys.

167
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,360
How about a Yahoo?

168
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,720
Yeah.

169
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,200
Hold on.

170
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
No, yeah, he is. Sully Sullenberg.

171
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
Nah, fuck it. He is the only trick pilot.

172
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Yaz Cruz sent this one in. Thanks, Yaz.

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,800
It's about Yahoo Answers user.

174
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,680
An American asshole who asks,

175
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,520
I don't know, Yahoo Answers needs to tighten up their naming policy.

176
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,800
I don't want my kids seeing that.

177
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
An American asshole asks,

178
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Are fat people easier to hunt?

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Like fat criminals when they do wrong and the cops are after them.

180
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,880
But there's no context for why he needs to know this?

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
Maybe he's trying to get his life in order,

182
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,920
and he's trying to find like a bunch of good reasons to get real fit and healthy.

183
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
He's like, I need to pick a scapegoat.

184
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
Should I pick someone fat?

185
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,480
And the answer is yes.

186
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
You're saying that he should have fatter friends in case they get shipwrecked.

187
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
No, fatter accomplices.

188
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,960
Okay.

189
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,880
Or it could also be like a General Zharov situation.

190
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
We could be dealing with a most dangerous game,

191
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,640
and then you do want fatty shipmates.

192
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,840
You should always have fatty shipmates.

193
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,400
They're good luck.

194
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,920
That is to eat them?

195
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,160
Um, well, I mean, there's a lot of different ways in which having a fatty shipmate could help.

196
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Right.

197
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Off the top of my head, eating them.

198
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay.

199
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
If they die, flotation devices.

200
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,720
Yeah.

201
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,280
They're just, you know, usually they're in better spirits.

202
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,240
Super fuckable.

203
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,760
Oh, yeah.

204
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,400
When the sea madness sets in.

205
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,880
You're not going to run out of places.

206
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,840
Let's just put it that way.

207
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,880
Uh-huh.

208
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,760
To put.

209
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, to qualify.

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
He means like the rolls and folds and what.

211
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Yeah, you're not going to run short on places to get ready.

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,040
You'll find places they didn't know they had.

213
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,540
No.

214
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Now, Griffin, when you picked this question, is this where you saw it going?

215
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,080
I thought we might be able to make an argument.

216
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,520
That they are.

217
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,280
For why February will be harder than-

218
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,080
You see in like fucking movies all the time when shit goes rough.

219
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,840
Who's the first ones against the wall and or floor?

220
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,640
The fats.

221
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,560
And it's I feel like movies portray them and like they're so they can't run as fast as a skinny,

222
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,840
which I don't even know if that's true because they got so much inertia, right?

223
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,080
Yeah, they'll run into a mountainside and just go 10 or 12 feet deep.

224
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,720
You're saying if you cut through all the Hollywood bullshit in Jurassic Park,

225
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,080
Jeff Goldblum dead, Wayne Knight out of there.

226
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,880
He's safe.

227
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,480
Wayne Knight escapes.

228
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,280
Wayne Knight floats away on a river of mud into freedom.

229
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,000
While Jeff Goldblum walks in the breeze.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,880
A breeze catches him, pulls him into the Velociraptor.

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,920
You know that he actually, Wayne Knight's character in Jurassic Park left the island,

232
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:11,040
floated all the way to Manhattan, started a life as a living next to Jerry Seinfeld.

233
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,960
Now they say to him the first day, they go and they knock on the door and he says,

234
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
hello, last name for the person living here.

235
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,560
And he says, well, I'm a new man.

236
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,920
Newman.

237
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
That's how he picked the name.

238
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,480
It's a prequel.

239
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,760
It's a prequel.

240
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
Jurassic Park is a prequel.

241
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Can you explain to me how Space Jam fits in the Wayne-iverse?

242
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,840
Where in Wayne-canon does Space Jam fit in?

243
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,200
I don't want to give Wayne Knight a big head in telling him that there is an entire verse

244
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,160
based around-

245
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,200
Because if you did that, then his head would be in proportion to his body,

246
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,080
which would just be-

247
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,640
His sickening fucking body, Wayne Knight.

248
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,000
Get it, lose some pounds.

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
It's gross to look at you.

250
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,840
In Wayne-

252
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm sorry, a professional listener of our show, Wayne Knight.

253
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:09,440
In Space Jam, Wayne Knight schools Michael Jordan, MJ, I call him, in How to Dunk.

254
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,240
I was just Googling for more information about this, and the only YouTube clip I found that

255
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
popped up is labeled this.

256
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,040
I show you not.

257
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,240
Michelle Jordan is having a Space Jam, dot WMV.

258
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,080
Michelle Jordan is having a Space Jam.

259
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,120
I'm not sure that-

260
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
Yeah, guys, I was having a Space Jam last night.

261
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,040
Oh, man.

262
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,160
Do you buy into the split timeline, Wayne Knight-iverse theory, or-

263
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,440
Well, there's the different canons.

264
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
Because there's one in one reality, and there's another in another reality.

265
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,160
Because there's one in one reality, he travels back in time after he dies at the end of Space Jam.

266
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,800
And then there's-

267
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,400
Oh, canon, that's the original canon.

268
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,880
Uh-huh.

269
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,280
And then there's the one where he goes on living his life as a-

270
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,120
That's the-

271
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,280
Whatever his profession was in Space Jam.

272
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,640
That's the teacher canon.

273
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
Professional jamologist.

274
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,160
Professional jamology.

275
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,440
I think fat people would not be easier to hunt.

276
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,560
I think that if I had to-

277
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,640
I think if I was a bloodthirsty jungle hunter, or maybe I was on the desert plains,

278
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,720
and I was hunting a man, and I had to choose between a slim, good body and a fatty arbuckle,

279
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
I think I would go slim, good body every time.

280
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,680
There's no pride in it, you know?

281
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,680
It's not a matter of-

282
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm thinking about the difficulty, kill or be killed rating,

283
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,560
not how am I gonna feel after I skin and wear Wayne Knight, you know?

284
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,320
You're gonna feel great.

285
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,680
You're gonna have a loose, breathable fabric.

286
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
Well, yeah, because his skin really breathes, you know?

287
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,960
Yeah, it's gonna be-

288
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,640
It's gonna be airy, light on your skin.

289
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,280
It'll be nice.

290
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,800
It'll be really nice to wear Wayne Knight.

291
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
The other thing that aids fat people when they're being hunted

292
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,120
is that you might see him at the beginning and think-

293
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,160
It's like Hunger Games.

294
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
You'll see him at the beginning of the hunt and think,

295
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
oh, I'll come back for him.

296
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,560
I'll fight him later.

297
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,440
No danger there.

298
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
So I think you might forget where you left him.

299
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,560
I guess is what I'm saying.

300
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
I think we should just not hunt.

301
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm gonna go out on a bold stance here and say we should not hunt people.

302
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,960
That's a pretty-

303
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,720
That's not a bad policy.

304
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,720
I mean, it took me a lot of trial and error to come to you.

305
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,040
I didn't just like wake up one morning and know it.

306
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,240
So I'm just passing on to you guys my wealth of experience and say,

307
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
listen, it's a mistake.

308
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,960
Don't hunt people.

309
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,040
Don't hunt people, except for Wayne Knight.

310
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,480
Cause like, I have tried to get that dude on a health track to wellness.

311
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,360
It's Griffin Macro.

312
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,560
It's Griffin Macro's health track to wellness, the program.

313
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,760
Travis, you were on that for a while.

314
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,080
I was, I lost 163 pounds.

315
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,520
Yeah, and I've been pursuing Wayne Knight to really get off his duff

316
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,200
and do something for him, make himself feel good.

317
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,560
Nothing is, just nothing is working.

318
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,160
So I'm gonna need-

319
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
If anyone knows Wayne Knight,

320
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
could you put him in contact with Griffin, please?

321
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
Or just fucking start hunting him down.

322
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,920
Hard target, soft target, start with Wayne Knight.

323
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,280
Speaking of the art of film, let's talk about Independent Film Channel.

324
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,040
It's got a new show called Comedy Bang Bang.

325
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,920
Comes on every Friday at 10 PM on the East Coast, 9 Central.

326
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,520
It's an absurd half hour comedy show, but it only looks like a talk show.

327
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,400
Don't be confused.

328
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
It's comedy so nice, they banged it twice.

329
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,680
They got amazing guests, biggest names in comedy.

330
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,480
They got Reggie Watts, hosted by Scott Aukerman.

331
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,120
It's based on the hit podcast,

332
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,000
but it's a good version of something on the internet.

333
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,080
Not like the TV show they made about stuff my dad said

334
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
or things my dad tweeted.

335
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,240
Thank you.

336
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,720
It's a good version of that.

337
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,680
My kids listen to this show, so if we can cut down on the cursing.

338
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,440
So tune into that Friday, every Friday, 10 PM on YFC, Comedy Bang Bang.

339
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,240
Hey, over the past few years, I've picked up quite a few stickers

340
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,000
slash decals at various concerts, restaurants, bars, etc.

341
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,520
My problem is I can't seem to find a perfect place to display my collection.

342
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,520
I feel like I've outgrown putting them on my car, but I do like having them around.

343
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,040
Where could I put them that won't seem too immature or douchebaggish?

344
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
That's from Decal Dilemma in Florida.

345
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,920
I have a good answer for this.

346
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,420
Okay.

347
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:39,140
So my boss and your boss, Chris Grant, he puts his stickers on his vacuum cleaner.

348
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,580
It turns it into like a, it turns cleaning time into rock and roll time.

349
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,540
Makes it fun for everybody.

350
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,580
Got lots of pizzazz and you're excited about cleaning because it's got,

351
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,500
like you got a fun vacuum cleaner.

352
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
It's got lots of fun stickers on it.

353
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,180
And it's not like it's a decoration.

354
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,020
Nobody expects it to look cool.

355
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,660
You just put stickers all over your vacuum cleaner.

356
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,500
I have such a problem with this.

357
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,340
I have a bunch of cool stickers.

358
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:15,700
And like, I just don't, I think I'm just constantly thinking about an item that I own.

359
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,900
It's resale value.

360
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:25,380
Like anything, anything like a computer or a vacuum cleaner or an iPad or an automobile.

361
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,340
I would never put a bumper sticker on a car.

362
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,460
Would never do it.

363
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,380
Because I feel like if I put it on there, that's like 15 to 2K.

364
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,780
Can I tell you guys a little story?

365
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,500
Yeah.

366
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,900
I own a green foot locker, a green chest that I've had since I was 18.

367
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,340
So I've had it for 10 years.

368
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,460
Used to be a lot of porn and incense in that thing.

369
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,100
All the porn.

370
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,220
And because of the length of time I've had it and the permanence of stickers,

371
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,140
that chest still proclaims my love for Jason Mraz.

372
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,640
Yeah.

373
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,140
Oh, nice.

374
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,640
Yeah.

375
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:08,100
So that's my main problem with stickers is because 19 year old Travis doesn't know jack shit about anything that's cool.

376
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,900
And I don't want 28 year old Travis to have to deal with the repercussions.

377
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,180
To be fair though, to be fair, he didn't have the beard back then.

378
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,500
He was not nearly as crunchy as he is now.

379
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,660
He's hyper crunchy.

380
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,740
He's become just the crunchiest dude.

381
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,980
You know there's a, you can throw that trunk in the river.

382
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,940
You know that, right?

383
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,900
No, it's still a good trunk and now it's a hair loom.

384
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,860
I'm gonna give it to my kids.

385
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,100
I don't think your kids are gonna want to inherit-

386
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,420
Dad, Jason Mraz fucking sucks.

387
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,140
We all, you've got an in excess-

388
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,020
I'm 10 and I know he's jack shit bullshit.

389
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,940
You've got an in excess sticker on here.

390
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,020
You're 28, you're not 66.

391
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,860
That I will say is the other sad thing.

392
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,740
There's only one sticker on the chest.

393
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,780
You are fucking kidding me.

394
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,860
It's not like there's a huge collection of stickers.

395
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,980
You put on a Jason Mraz sticker and we're like, done.

396
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,860
No, I was like, oh, this will begin an art installation.

397
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,420
This trunk is ready, ready to go.

398
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,780
With all the artists I ever really love, I'm gonna add him to this trunk.

399
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,860
And it turned out he did do exactly just that.

400
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,180
I mean, he just never found anybody else he liked.

401
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,980
There's no one ever as good as old JM.

402
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,300
Mr. MRA, that's what I call him.

403
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,260
I did like his first CD for whatever it's worth.

404
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,660
I thought he had-

405
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,460
Oh, his live at Java Joe stuff was brilliant.

406
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,020
But then like, what the fuck was the rest of that shit?

407
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,580
I like that one-

408
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,140
Jason.

409
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,020
I like that one song.

410
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,500
It's like-

411
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,580
You know the song I'm talking about?

412
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,380
I do actually.

413
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,700
The Dream Life of Mr. Rand McNally is the name of that song.

414
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,660
I was a huge fan.

415
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:50,260
Do you guys want to know the sad truth?

416
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
With both him and Dave Matthews.

417
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,660
I'd still hang out with him in a heart seat if I got the opportunity.

418
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,460
Yeah, you guys could compare like fisherman's hats.

419
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Hey, those are some really nice Sanux.

420
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,980
Where did you get those?

421
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,980
Oh, on the internet.

422
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,900
With your light gingham shirt, how many buttons down do you go?

423
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,380
Because we're basically the trendsetters in this department.

424
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,100
I did like his live CD.

425
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
You fucking assholes.

426
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
That was like mind control.

427
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,900
They played it at the borders all the time.

428
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,020
It was so fucking good.

429
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
When I was working there, I played it 24 hours a day.

430
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,780
I could probably do all the lyrics.

431
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,500
Could you do like a scrapbook of stickers?

432
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,740
I mean, that's sort of what scrapbooks are from what I understand.

433
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,060
So that way like you can display your cool stickers.

434
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,900
But that feels disingenuous, doesn't it?

435
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,980
Like I have a sweet Max Fun sticker.

436
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,620
I got Max Fun Con and I'm a huge Max Fun supporter.

437
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,060
But I don't want to put it on my car because what if I want to sell my car?

438
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,380
But I don't want to just put it in a book because then it's like,

439
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
here's a book of stickers I'm ashamed of.

440
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,940
That is worse because it's like I didn't want anything to happen to these stickers I have.

441
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,900
Yeah, they're going to be worth something someday.

442
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,820
Please tell me the conversation you're having.

443
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,020
We're like, actually, did you want to check out a book of stickers?

444
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,660
You know, I actually have a quick and convenient way to convey to you

445
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,100
everything you need to know about me.

446
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,900
If you want to know everything I'm into, we could talk about it.

447
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,420
But that'd be too exasperating.

448
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:26,980
God damn.

449
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,180
You know what I'm thinking, though?

450
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,900
Like, honestly, that's all Facebook is.

451
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,100
It's just a digital version of like, do you want to sit down for a few hours

452
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
and look at all the stickers I have?

453
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,500
These are all my stickers, some pictures of me and my friends,

454
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,300
and just some things I've written under a list that says things I like.

455
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,860
Yeah, I'm pretty sure if you have a sticker collection,

456
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,580
you're going to die alone.

457
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,220
Travis, if you don't change your Facebook banner image

458
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,900
to like some Jason Mraz album art before this episode gets published,

459
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,180
I'll never forgive you.

460
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,460
I'm going to send everybody your Facebook and make them look.

461
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,580
Okay, could you do like, okay, let me throw this out.

462
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,700
Because if your worry is like looking mature and adult,

463
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,340
do a collage like you would on anything else,

464
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,500
but like frame it under glass.

465
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,940
See, that's what's fucked.

466
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,460
I have so many posters.

467
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,580
And I really like my posters.

468
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:21,540
And they're just basically huge, rectangular, unsticky stickers, right?

469
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,940
That are more expensive than stickers are usually.

470
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,180
And you can't put them in a car because it would-

471
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,220
Whoa, whoa, slow down, Brainstorm.

472
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,580
Put the stickers on the posters on the back.

473
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,660
And then it's like a hidden map.

474
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,020
And you flip it over and someone goes,

475
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,620
oh, he really liked Jason Mraz.

476
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,540
Yeah, it's a map to your life.

477
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,140
What am I going to do with these pogs though?

478
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,780
That's the question.

479
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,020
I've got all these Flintstones jelly jars.

480
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,980
Where am I supposed to put these?

481
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,300
I have two to three thousand snap bracelets.

482
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,860
Got a whole room.

483
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,260
Keep them.

484
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,860
It used to be my sneaker snapper room,

485
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,140
but I ate bait all them.

486
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,780
Oh, you ate bait in your sneaker snappers?

487
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,660
I ate bait in my sneaks.

488
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,060
Nice thing about Beanie Babies,

489
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,340
that value is never going to go down.

490
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,660
I've got all of these pizza shaped discs left over

491
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,140
from my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sewer boat.

492
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,860
Just the discs, I got rid of the boat.

493
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,420
But I probably got 150 of them.

494
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,300
Right, different years.

495
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,580
The ones with like-

496
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,660
If you come over to Travis's house,

497
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,500
he's like coming to the pizza disc room

498
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,660
and he's showing you the ones with small factory imperfections

499
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,540
and that kind of thing.

500
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,380
Basically, all I did was I just stabled them

501
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,980
to the wall directly.

502
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,220
Yeah, there's no furniture in the room.

503
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,500
There's a body, but I don't ask about it.

504
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,220
There are five people right now

505
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,900
who just threw down their iPod

506
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,260
and like ran into their attic.

507
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,860
Like, where's my fucking pizza launcher?

508
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm going to go-

509
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,740
Dad!

510
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,240
Dad!

511
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,520
Dad!

512
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,100
You promised!

513
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,020
You said that if I kept up my GPA

514
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,820
that you wouldn't throw away my pizza launcher!

515
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,820
What do you mean I'm 32?

516
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,820
What do you mean you died seven years ago?

517
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
Dad, how long have I been asleep?

518
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,840
Dad!

519
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,040
I think-

520
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,540
Dad!

521
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,540
I think that old man was a genie!

522
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Dad, I think I got a genie curse!

523
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,360
Dad!

524
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,180
I heard Schwartz and I was on TV

525
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,700
and he says he's governor!

526
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,980
What's going on?

527
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,480
Dad!

528
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
I used to be Zac Efron and now I'm a genie!

529
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Zac Efron and now I'm Steve Buscemi!

530
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,780
Help me!

531
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,240
Dad!

532
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,860
I've got adult balls and no pizza launcher!

533
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,580
What gives?

534
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,860
Dad, I wanted my suit to fit over the counter!

535
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,380
What's going on?

536
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,580
They said I couldn't at the store!

537
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,980
Is that a problem you would like to-

538
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,220
I can't find Jost on the shelves!

539
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,720
Dad!

540
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,040
Do you want a Yahoo-

541
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,540
Hit me!

542
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,040
Yeah?

543
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,540
Yeah, hit me!

544
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,260
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Emily Wall.

545
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,820
Thank you, Emily.

546
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nagini Potter who asks,

547
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,740
Could I use a water gun instead of a neti pot?

548
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,540
This is an awkward question,

549
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,900
but I've broken my neti pot

550
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,660
and I'd like to clear out my nasal passages

551
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,700
before I leave in a little while or I'll be uncomfortably congested for the rest of the day.

552
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,740
I've got at my disposal a little toy water gun

553
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,540
and I've seen people use a squeeze bottle version of the neti pot.

554
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,580
Would it be an efficient temporary replacement for my neti pot?

555
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:41,060
Only if it is a Super Soaker brand square gun and it blows your mind out of your ear.

556
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,620
I think it's got to be a certain caliber of Super Soaker too.

557
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,540
I think a 50 is not going to get you there.

558
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,740
Oh, you're going to need the 120.

559
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,980
I think 120 to 150 at the minimum.

560
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,940
You think 150?

561
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,740
That might be a little pushy.

562
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,900
I think you fucking get the one with the backpack in it and just like, never.

563
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,940
Griffin, you crazy bitch.

564
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,380
I know, I know.

565
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,540
I, Griffin, I know that you're going to, you're going to, uh, you're going to rebuke me here.

566
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,020
Okay.

567
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,460
Because the neti pot's dangerous.

568
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,340
It's not, two people-

569
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,940
It is, it's full of bacteria.

570
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,660
It's not full of bacteria, two people have died from using it.

571
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,700
How many people have to die before people stop pouring water in their face?

572
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,740
Some people need it.

573
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,820
Don't put that, the hole is not for that.

574
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,020
God is looking down at you and saying like, that's not the hole, Griffin.

575
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,580
I told you where the hole was.

576
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,140
It's your mouth.

577
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,260
It's your singing hole.

578
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,420
I just want to be there when some scientists say,

579
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,580
hey guys, you know what always makes me feel better?

580
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,540
Drowning.

581
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,060
Let's see if we can't put that in some kind of home version

582
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,620
that people can feel like they're drowning all the time.

583
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,460
Please just boil the water before you use it.

584
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
Of course I boil, what do you think?

585
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,700
I actually, I make a homeless man gargle it and then spit it into my nose.

586
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,140
Now, Griffin, you did have your first neti experience, right?

587
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,860
I did.

588
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,580
This week?

589
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,300
What did you think?

590
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,180
I'll tell you what's rough.

591
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,860
What?

592
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,820
I don't know how the flaps and flanges in there work.

593
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,100
I don't know-

594
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,420
Right?

595
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,980
I don't know how the valves, I don't know how to operate those particular waterworks.

596
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,340
It's a real wake up call when you realize those two things are connected.

597
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,100
Let's talk about my flange control.

598
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,380
Here's the things I can do.

599
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,660
I can open up my wiener to pee when it's time to go do that.

600
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,260
When I put water in my mouth, I know how to use my tongue to push the water down my throat.

601
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:25,380
What I do not know how to do yet is to open my nose to connect the two nostrils

602
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,300
and to somehow seal that tunnel so that things go in one side and out the other side

603
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,780
without ending up in my eyes or something.

604
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,220
So wait, so did you pour the neti pot in your nose and it came out your wiener?

605
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,020
Is that what you're saying?

606
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,140
Where'd it come out?

607
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,820
It came out like my mouth and stuff.

608
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,780
It was, it was-

609
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,180
What?

610
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,780
You didn't get the flow going?

611
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,020
Huh?

612
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,140
That's when I-

613
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,780
You didn't get it working?

614
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,900
I got it working eventually, but it takes some, it takes some doing.

615
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,620
It's not as effortless as they make it look like on TV.

616
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,180
But once you get it going, it's pretty pleasurable, right?

617
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,060
Once you get it going, oh my God, you guys.

618
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,220
It's not pleasurable at all.

619
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
But afterwards, but afterwards-

620
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,260
Is it like drowning?

621
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,900
No, it's, I mean, if you do it wrong, I guess, but if you do anything wrong, it's like drowning

622
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,460
because you could slip in a pool and drown.

623
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,420
Trav, have you neti'd?

624
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,740
Have you done neti pot?

625
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,340
No, I would never do that.

626
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Don't let your fear control you because it-

627
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,460
No, it's not fear.

628
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,260
I don't want to.

629
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,740
Why not?

630
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,940
I have no desire.

631
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,180
You don't have fear.

632
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,500
You probably haven't had these kinds of, these kinds of sinus problems that-

633
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,220
Yeah.

634
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,820
I'm on steroids right now for allergies.

635
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:35,380
I have to take things to make my body and muscles stronger to fight the allergies.

636
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,260
The allergies in Austin, the mold, it's like visible.

637
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,380
You can see it.

638
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,980
It comes and knocks on your door in the morning.

639
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,940
It's like, hey, stop.

640
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,140
Can I shove myself in you?

641
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,020
Hey, do you mind if I cram?

642
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,220
I say, oh no, get the pot, sweetie.

643
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,740
Baby, get the hose.

644
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,580
Do you feel better?

645
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,140
I don't know that I'll ever feel better again.

646
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,820
Thanks, Mold.

647
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,540
Thanks, Mold.

648
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,340
Thanks for nothing.

649
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,580
I know it always makes me feel better.

650
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,300
Um, money.

651
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,700
That's very shallow, Justin.

652
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,380
Do you think when the person who invented neti pot invented neti pot,

653
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,940
they like for, I would say-

654
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,060
They were trying to kill themselves?

655
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:34,020
For 18 months or so when they were workshopping it, they tried to pitch it as nose douche.

656
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,460
I can't get much traction with this.

657
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,620
I've been in so many businesses trying to sell them the nose douche and no one will take it.

658
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,340
They seem on board till we get to the name and then it's just like slam door.

659
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,060
Slam door.

660
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,540
What about, hey, if I change it to face cinema, is that better?

661
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:57,060
Um, hey, big news.

662
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,660
You guys remember, uh, uh, Stack Soap, right?

663
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,700
Talked about, um, Griffin wrote a great song for them.

664
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,580
Um, but you can now, I got mine this week.

665
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,380
I know a lot of other NBNBA listeners have gotten theirs recently, but now you can buy it.

666
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,700
If you missed out on the Kickstarter, you can go to, uh, Amazon and look up Stack Soap,

667
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,060
uh, and get it with free shipping.

668
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,100
That's fucking-

669
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,300
You can just search for Stack Soap.

670
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,060
That's so great.

671
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,500
Or you just go to stacksoap.com.

672
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,580
That's going to take you directly to Amazon.

673
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,260
Um, but it's great.

674
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,940
It's like 12 bucks for six bars.

675
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,980
Uh, free shipping.

676
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,580
Like that's, you can't beat that.

677
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,060
It's soap that stacks in itself.

678
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:38,260
So when you get down to just a sliver, then you put it up, uh, you put it in the new bar

679
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,460
because it's got to divot.

680
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,820
It's an endless cycle of soap.

681
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,540
It's amazing.

682
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,820
So go buy it, stacksoap.com.

683
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:48,100
I, um, I got my stack soap in actually last week and it's, I don't know if it's sad or

684
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,460
awesome that I haven't used it yet because I'm waiting for my current bar of soap to

685
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,980
get down to the stupid sliver.

686
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,540
And I, once I, once I make the exchange, it's going to be the best.

687
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,340
It's going to be so-

688
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,980
It really is.

689
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,860
I get so excited.

690
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,580
I am excited.

691
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,620
Like when I shower-

692
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,940
Once you go stack, you never go back.

693
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,420
I have been lathering like a, like a fucking crazy person lately.

694
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,220
Because I want to get this stupid shitty bar down to a point where I can, where I can stack

695
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,100
it up, you know?

696
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,060
My brother, My Brother Me is supported in part by Bing.

697
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,460
It's got a new social search that will bring together all your favorite people from social

698
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,620
networks like Facebook, Twitter, and into one place where you can exchange ideas.

699
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:30,740
You can discover new things and it'll help you to do things together.

700
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,540
Check it out at bing.com because Bing is for doing.

701
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,260
It'll bring you together.

702
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,660
You can come together and talk about My Brother, My Brother and Me.

703
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,500
Say, hey, I heard this new podcast.

704
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,500
I heard this old ass podcast, this old beat up podcast, but they talked about Bing and

705
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,700
I knew it was fresh.

706
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,900
It sounded fresh to me.

707
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,860
It brought it all home.

708
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,420
What if there was a site called Bong?

709
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,380
You check out Bong?

710
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,580
No, Bong is a weak shit.

711
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,860
No, it's still a search engine, but it finds you exactly what you do not want.

712
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,300
This is terrible.

713
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,300
I heard it's for Jim Varney.

714
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,660
It's just a picture of his casket.

715
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,220
Like what?

716
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,420
Bong.

717
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,180
Bong is such a downer.

718
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,300
It's not even that it's wrong.

719
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,340
It's like morally wrong.

720
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,620
Bong is for uh oh.

721
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,460
Guys, it's Friday on the Independent Film Channel.

722
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,180
It's Comedy Bang Bang airing at 10, 9 central.

723
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,020
The guest this week is Michael Cera.

724
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,220
Who?

725
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,260
Michael Cera.

726
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,460
It's America's America's Heartthrob.

727
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,700
Did you not know who he was or was I just not loud enough?

728
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,860
No, it's both.

729
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:35,380
Michael Cera and Paul F. Tompkins is there.

730
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,660
It sounds like you're yelling to your old wife in the other room.

731
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,980
Honey, honey, come in.

732
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,180
Honey, come in.

733
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,620
Honey, come in.

734
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,940
Comedy Bang Bang's on.

735
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,540
Michael Cera's on TV.

736
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,900
You love that Michael Cera.

737
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,660
He was on Arrested Development.

738
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,420
He's that little sliver of a boy from Arrested Development.

739
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,540
He's a man.

740
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,260
You loved him.

741
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,060
He was in that show where he fought all the evil ex-guys.

742
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,740
He's a fraction of a boy.

743
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,820
You like him.

744
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,100
He's non-threatening.

745
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,740
He looks like a normal boy who's been whittled down.

746
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,300
They need to find a larger boy.

747
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,940
He looks like he would fit into another boy

748
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,660
and then combine and be an infinite loop of boys.

749
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,100
So what else is going on in the show?

750
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,900
Well, in this week's episode, Reggie, the musical host,

751
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,820
worries that product placement is taking over the show

752
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,020
and Scott Ockerman gets warned about his future by the Cake Boss.

753
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,540
Cake Boss.

754
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,500
Cake Boss, everybody.

755
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,060
That's this week's episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

756
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,460
Check it out.

757
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,740
IFC 10-9 Central.

758
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,460
Lock it in.

759
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,260
Hey, brothers.

760
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,900
Hey, brothers.

761
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,220
So I have a name that is somewhat gender neutral.

762
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,140
It is used as a girl's name more frequently now,

763
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,300
but was originally only a boy's name.

764
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,460
My problem is that while I like my name,

765
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,860
people often assume I am male before we meet.

766
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,460
I also receive mail addressed to Mr.

767
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,300
Perhaps I'm overreacting,

768
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,060
but I'd like to avoid future gender mixups.

769
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,780
Advice?

770
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,700
That's from Secret Girl in Virginia.

771
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,740
And that's from Mark.

772
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,700
That's true.

773
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,500
Well, Steven.

774
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,220
Well, let's ask Griffin.

775
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,140
Since you've got a girl's name,

776
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,980
so what is it like to often be assumed that you're a girl?

777
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,220
Go fuck yourself in the throat.

778
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,940
No, but I'm just saying like every other Griffin is a girl, right?

779
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,460
Like you're the only male Griffin.

780
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,580
You're the only male Griffin.

781
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,420
You're living your life as the only male Griffin.

782
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,420
Looking for one other Griffin

783
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,500
that you can help repopulate your species with.

784
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,340
I think that's a great thing because I'm always excited

785
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,140
when I think, like if it's a work situation, for example,

786
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,060
and I think the person is a man,

787
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,260
and then it turns out it's a woman,

788
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,300
I get excited because it's like,

789
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,580
oh, good, they'll be competent.

790
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,660
They'll actually be able to do this thing.

791
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,180
And they'll actually-

792
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,100
I was worried that they would be dumb, but they're-

793
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,540
I thought it would be dumb,

794
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,060
but it turns out that they are a woman.

795
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,420
So that is quite a relief for me.

796
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,940
I think it's kind of a little bit of that secret power.

797
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,180
Like when you know something, the other person doesn't, right?

798
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,460
And you roll up and they had like addressed yourself as like Mr.

799
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,340
And you instantly have a leg up on this person

800
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,260
because it's like, oh no, actually I'm a girl.

801
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,380
So now you're embarrassed.

802
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,980
So now I'm running the meeting.

803
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,620
Well, I don't think that

804
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,220
just because the person assumed you're a man

805
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,580
and it turns out you're a woman,

806
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,700
that you automatically get to run the meetings.

807
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,980
But I know that you haven't worked in a traditional business.

808
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,260
No, this is, if you can weave a thick enough mystery,

809
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,220
then you win the game of Clue.

810
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,140
Oh, fuck, I was thinking about the game of Clue,

811
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,180
not professional, not professional business settings.

812
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,300
I do that all the time.

813
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,380
Yeah, that's a big mix up.

814
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,480
Stupid.

815
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,580
Could you start addressing yourself as like Miss,

816
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,460
whatever your name is?

817
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,380
Why should, no.

818
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,500
All the time, no?

819
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,900
That's, you don't need a horse and pony shit.

820
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Why do you, why give a fuck, man?

821
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,780
Yeah, wait a minute.

822
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,620
Now I think about it, this isn't your concern.

823
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,580
No, it's not.

824
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,300
It's their problem.

825
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,660
Yeah, you don't have to do jack shit.

826
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,060
They're the ones that come out looking like, you know,

827
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,260
they assumed and they made axes of themselves and me.

828
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,900
That is a power.

829
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,820
Now, I hated Travis's idea, but like with the Miss,

830
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,020
but what about Lady?

831
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,180
If somebody's like, a guy's name was Gaga Peterson.

832
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,660
I don't know, I don't know much about him,

833
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,180
but he's supposed to come in here for an interview.

834
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,380
That's confusing.

835
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,340
If it turns out it's Lady Gaga, oh my.

836
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,420
Oh, I know, there's no question there.

837
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,420
What about Duchess?

838
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,580
Duchess, Duchess, Duchess Ralph.

839
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,100
What about, I'm totally, and you guys know this about me,

840
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,220
I'm totally gender blind.

841
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,220
Like, it doesn't, it doesn't matter to me.

842
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,780
So what if-

843
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,820
He actually can't distinguish.

844
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,140
What if your prefix was just hmm, well.

845
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,280
Well.

846
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,380
Your move, hotshot.

847
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,220
That's not a good prefix.

848
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,340
That's not like legally recognized.

849
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,940
You think that's like too many words?

850
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,300
Too many words, definitely.

851
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,700
I think it's gotta be just a series of letters.

852
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,460
I don't think you can make a sentence out of it.

853
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
Your sentence, like your prefix can't be like,

854
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,300
guess what gender I am?

855
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,820
Cause you're probably wrong.

856
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,540
What if it was just mm-hmm, Griffin McElroy.

857
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,860
The one that always confuses me is, uh,

858
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,860
Mr. MSSR, what's that mean?

859
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,700
You don't really give me Mr. Mr.

860
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,500
I love that band.

861
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,540
And I think that that's two wrongs don't make a right though.

862
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,740
And that means feminine.

863
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,820
What if, what if your name is DR Hughley

864
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,340
and you become a doctor, right guys?

865
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,580
Did you also mean DL?

866
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,220
No, he's brother.

867
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,260
He's lesser known medical brother, DR.

868
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,180
Oh, of course he's a brother, Travis.

869
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,140
God damn it.

870
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,460
Can you get through one show without being a wicked racist?

871
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,460
What if your name is Jr Jr?

872
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,740
I made myself laugh at that.

873
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,700
I'm Jr Jr Jr.

874
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,660
What if your name is Carl's Jr

875
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,780
and get a job at Carl's Jr?

876
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,140
What if you're in the band Jr Sr

877
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,460
and you're somebody's dad and son with the same name.

878
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,300
Simultaneously.

879
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,260
And you're also a medical doctor and a lawyer

880
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,220
and a senior in high school.

881
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,340
Fuck.

882
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,540
So wait, hold on.

883
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,020
Now, Justin, what prefix do you get for being a lawyer?

884
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,180
You get a suffix, Esquire.

885
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,380
Oh, okay.

886
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,580
So I'm, I'm, I'm high school, high school senior.

887
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:36,580
Jr Jr Jr for the band Jr Sr and my dad shares the same name,

888
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,220
PhD, but I'm not a doctor.

889
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,580
That's just a part of my name.

890
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,940
It's a dangling modifier.

891
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,100
It's pronounced Jr Jr Jr senior.

892
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,100
Shake your coconuts.

893
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,780
Oh, golly.

894
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,300
I am taking my first vacation in a year in early July.

895
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,540
My new job is in upstate New York.

896
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,780
I'll be spending three weeks visiting family and friends

897
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,860
in Galveston and Austin, Texas, respectively.

898
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,300
Before this year, I always took the existence of evenings

899
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,540
and weekends to myself to be for granted.

900
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,700
Always spent my vacation just lounging around,

901
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,060
eating my parents' food.

902
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,220
But now that I don't just have a job,

903
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,140
but actually live on the job,

904
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,620
I'm afraid of wasting my precious,

905
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,780
precious vacation time in front of the tube.

906
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,700
How can I get the most out of my vacation

907
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,100
and return to the relatively real world?

908
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,620
Refreshed.

909
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,220
That's from overworked in New York.

910
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,300
Bunch of drugs.

911
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,900
No, no, no, no.

912
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,420
You really want that lost week.

913
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Just drug it out.

914
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,620
Like a Jimmy Buffett song on a drunk.

915
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,980
Like if you were Jimmy Buffett in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

916
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,540
Right.

917
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,620
Just trying to kill yourself on daiquiris.

918
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:53,060
I think, honestly, the best thing you can do for vacation is...

919
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,580
A lot of people like a busy vacation.

920
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,940
Maybe if their day-to-day lives are pretty slow-paced.

921
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,500
I think they like something with a lot of activity.

922
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,300
I personally think that you should just try to counter-program.

923
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,220
Like whatever you get an influx of in the workplace,

924
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,660
then you should try to avoid that at all costs.

925
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,460
It really helps to bring balance to your life.

926
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,820
It's technology for me.

927
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,020
I got to try to steer clear of it to have it relaxing.

928
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:25,940
I'm usually fairly successful at that, but that's a key for me.

929
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,540
I remember being a kid and we'd go on big family vacations and everything.

930
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,020
At like nine and ten, all I wanted to do was everything all the time.

931
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,620
So we'd get there and be like,

932
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,740
let's go mini golfing.

933
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,860
Let's go do laser tag.

934
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,740
Let's go to the beach.

935
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,860
Let's go see a movie.

936
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,660
Let's go to the mall.

937
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,500
And mom and dad would be like,

938
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,780
can we just like not?

939
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,540
Can we just like sit here on the porch and not do anything?

940
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
Just go make a turkey sandwich for yourself.

941
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,500
Get out of our sight.

942
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,700
And I couldn't understand it.

943
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,580
I was sitting there like,

944
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,820
you're on vacation and we're not doing anything.

945
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,340
And only now as an adult do I kind of sit there and go,

946
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,380
man, there's nothing like knowing you've got nothing to do.

947
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,780
I was the shittiest kid ever.

948
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,860
I was just such a dickhead.

949
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,780
Such a piece of shit.

950
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,140
I'm glad mom and dad didn't just leave me at the beach.

951
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,180
That's why I like going on vacations with my sister-in-law Riley.

952
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,300
She's 11 years old.

953
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,740
And if I get that, that little tickle in the back of my throat,

954
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,940
that, you know, that, that youth,

955
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,580
that, that young, that young spirit I still have,

956
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,100
my, my wild oats, I think,

957
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,860
hey, I'll make this kid do something with me.

958
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,180
Hey kid, let's go play a game or something.

959
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,420
But if the kid is like wanting to do something

960
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,580
and I don't want to, I just put her in a closet.

961
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,300
Yep.

962
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,860
You're going to be the-

963
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,660
Because they're compact.

964
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,380
They're very small.

965
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,580
They don't need a lot of room.

966
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,060
Yeah, I'll put her in there with my rock and roll vacuum.

967
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,460
You are going to be a superb father one day.

968
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:41,860
Thank you.

969
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,580
You are going to make one child very, very, very happy

970
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,180
for like a few minutes at a time.

971
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,300
Whenever is convenient for you, you will make that child so happy.

972
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,700
I'm going to be the Cliff Huxtable of my state.

973
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,420
Okay.

974
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,180
I'm not, I don't get the reference.

975
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,100
He's a Cosby, Cosby.

976
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,620
He is a, he is a Cosby.

977
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,820
He's one of those Cosby cosplayers.

978
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,220
He's one of the permutations of Cosby.

979
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,900
After Cosby's fourth regeneration, he was Cliff Huxtable.

980
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:18,820
After he, after Littered Part 6 died, Cosby regenerated as Cliff Huxtable.

981
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,780
Why did they call the show the Cosby Show, but he was not,

982
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,860
the character was not named Cosby?

983
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,900
I just had a problem with that.

984
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,300
Like who are they trying to fool by changing his name, Cliff Huxtable?

985
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:27,940
Well, in case they-

986
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,900
Just make it Bill Cosby.

987
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,780
Everybody knew what was up.

988
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,140
They didn't know how many Cosby regenerations they were going to get through.

989
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,780
Oh, I see.

990
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:40,020
So they, the people were very, were crazy about the Cliff Huxtable regeneration

991
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,660
and they were originally going to go ahead and do the Cosby regeneration

992
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,300
from the Cosby Mysteries during that series.

993
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,780
But people were so crazy about it that they couldn't ever, you know, switch over.

994
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,820
And people were really confused at that time that Cosby regenerated

995
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,940
and he was British and he had a bow tie.

996
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:03,540
Do you remember when Theo died and they recast him as a robot dog?

997
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,100
That was pretty weird.

998
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,140
Yeah, that one was weird.

999
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:06,900
Fuck.

1000
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,420
Do you guys, can anybody on this call tell me what the Cosby regeneration name was

1001
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,380
in the Cosby Mysteries?

1002
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,220
What the name of that regeneration was?

1003
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,900
Schmiff Schmuckstable.

1004
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,820
No, it's not Schmiff Schmuckstable.

1005
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,460
Very close.

1006
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,660
Ghost, Ghost Dad.

1007
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,180
Is actually Guy Hanks.

1008
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,420
Okay.

1009
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,220
It's not a good name.

1010
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,700
Not at all.

1011
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,340
I don't know what to, I haven't been on a, I'm going to, I think we want to,

1012
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,500
I'm going on vacation, going on a beach vacation this summer.

1013
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:36,980
And I feel like-

1014
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,700
Now where are you going?

1015
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,620
I made a pitch for Tybee Island.

1016
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,100
I'm going to hit up South Kikilati, baby.

1017
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,780
Now what is that?

1018
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,740
That is, that's what the people in South Carolina call it, South Carolina.

1019
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,260
I don't think any of them call it that.

1020
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:48,820
Okay.

1021
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,460
I think I saw that.

1022
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,340
You going to Savannah?

1023
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,700
Are you going to Savannah?

1024
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,340
Go fang yourself, drink some mint juleps.

1025
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:59,380
I actually can't say where I'm going because I don't want to be, uh, hunted down.

1026
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,020
Sure.

1027
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,740
By paparazzi.

1028
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,660
Trying to get the topless pics of you.

1029
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,060
Um, but yeah, I don't know.

1030
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,980
Like I haven't been on vacation.

1031
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,420
I don't know what my body is going to do.

1032
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,500
I don't know if it's going to be like, let's just lamp or is it going to be like,

1033
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,940
I want to see all the sites because you'll never get a chance to see these sites for a while.

1034
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,740
That's a good question.

1035
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,500
You gotta go someplace that's not very exciting.

1036
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,060
That's key.

1037
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,740
I'm going to take a week long vacation and just lay on my couch.

1038
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,140
Okay.

1039
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,020
That's a staycation.

1040
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,340
No, I don't want to call it that.

1041
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,060
I'm an adult.

1042
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,580
It's just called unemployment.

1043
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,220
Yeah.

1044
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,780
It's just called, Travis hasn't been at work this week.

1045
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,140
Has anyone noticed that?

1046
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,300
There's a strange smell coming from his bedroom.

1047
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,900
Travis is dead.

1048
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,100
I'm worried about that.

1049
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,780
You guys want a Yahoo answer?

1050
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,220
Yeah, I was trying to stall one out of you.

1051
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,500
Um, here comes a fresh Yahoo answer for you.

1052
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,140
Um, can you deliver that again with a bit more pizzazz?

1053
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,540
Here's a hot and ready Yahoo answer.

1054
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,660
Oh guys, there's some real, this one was sent by Secret Person.

1055
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,300
It's by Yahoo Answers user Desira who asks,

1056
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,740
I'm a peanut butter lava lamp with pretty little unicorns on it.

1057
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,780
What are you?

1058
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,380
Don't be afraid to be crazy.

1059
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,180
What the fuck?

1060
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm dying.

1061
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,860
I need to get out of my skin.

1062
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,020
This is terrible in here all of a sudden.

1063
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,820
I'm puke.

1064
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,020
It's being boiled over and it's burned on the burner a little bit.

1065
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,500
Ali Capalzi says, I'm Arthur the aardvark with no horns and pink spots

1066
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,420
and a black and white stripey headband and an allergy to peanut butter lava lamps

1067
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,940
with pretty little unicorns on it.

1068
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,460
Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile.

1069
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,820
Stop it.

1070
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,320
What?

1071
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,940
I love you says, I'm a nerdy purple tiger with three tattoos.

1072
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,260
I just made that up cause I'm smart, my favorite color,

1073
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,260
my favorite animal, and I like trees.

1074
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,820
Oh God bless it.

1075
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,580
I'm spiraling into madness.

1076
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:52,820
So many people can't-

1077
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,180
The real podcast has continued on and this is just all I can hear.

1078
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,940
I'm a colorful dino that has superpowers, XPPPPP.

1079
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,820
No, no, you're not.

1080
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,740
You're a sad, sad person.

1081
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,740
I can just cut loose and be silly.

1082
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,300
A shoe being thrown at you.

1083
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,940
This is the yellow answers that Bong brings up.

1084
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,860
I'm a purple cheese ball.

1085
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,740
My face is a greeter that has a card on it.

1086
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,940
Come on, stupid lamp.

1087
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,780
I'm the swirling pit of sadness that stares you down in the face every day.

1088
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,580
I'm the unavoidable truth that your life is finite.

1089
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,740
Come climb in the tear pool, bitch shit.

1090
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:41,780
I'm the slow march of death dragging you ever onwards towards the grave.

1091
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,740
I'm the drugs your dad used when you were a little kid

1092
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,580
that made you the way that you are today.

1093
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:52,340
I don't know where you have to put a Cosby riff at the end of each one.

1094
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,860
Fuck that.

1095
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,980
Fuck that whole-

1096
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,340
That's not like a goof.

1097
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,980
That's not a fucking zinger.

1098
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,300
That's just-

1099
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,500
There's not even a setup.

1100
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,060
It's not even like pick your favorite color.

1101
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,380
It's just like string together a big long mishmash of nonsense where-

1102
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,740
I'm a bacon abortion.

1103
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,620
Now, are there any others?

1104
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,180
Because I do-

1105
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,180
My interest is beef.

1106
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,380
No, that's all.

1107
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,020
No, I mean, there's more, but I'm not gonna read anymore.

1108
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,780
I'm a mildly successful accountant with kids that don't respect him.

1109
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,860
Come on, Griffin.

1110
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,500
Give me more.

1111
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,540
I know there's more in there.

1112
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,780
I'm a reckless individual with four eyes, green hair, two left feet,

1113
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,860
an extra toe, and a severely big head.

1114
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,780
Okay, now he didn't get it.

1115
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,620
He didn't get the-

1116
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,540
He didn't get the purpose of this experiment.

1117
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:45,220
I'm Charles Manson's love child.

1118
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:45,780
Maybe this-

1119
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,340
Oh, guys.

1120
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:55,140
What if this is a brilliant government, like a sting operation,

1121
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,300
and all of these answers psychologically can be broken down

1122
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,380
to figure out who's a terrorist and who's not.

1123
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,580
Oh my God.

1124
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:02,980
Can I see-

1125
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,660
Uncle Sam's become so crafty.

1126
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,700
He can't tell-

1127
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,140
Like, he can't tell if I got bombs in my shoes, so I gotta take them off,

1128
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:14,260
but he can tell if these fuck heads are gonna try to attack a beloved American landmark.

1129
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,740
I'm a plaid triceratops with bubble gum coming out of my ears.

1130
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,380
Oh my God.

1131
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,940
Take him.

1132
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,580
Oh my God.

1133
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:26,420
This sounds like a fucking character creation sheet for Dungeons and Dragons in Fuck You.

1134
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,900
Um, here's a good Yahoo answer.

1135
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,020
Well, I suppose that's subjective.

1136
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,060
It's sent by Steven Lewis.

1137
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,540
Thank you, Steven.

1138
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,260
It's by Yahoo Answers user LilRedHead, who asks,

1139
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,660
I want my tattoo covered up with another tattoo.

1140
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,340
Okay, so I have a tat on the small of my back.

1141
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,980
It's one of my daughter's names, but I would like to cover it with another tat.

1142
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,660
The name is Jade.

1143
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,300
Any ideas of anything big to cover it?

1144
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,420
You don't have to be specific.

1145
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,900
Just a general idea of some things that may work.

1146
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,820
Thanks much, and a happy Friday, y'all.

1147
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,740
Additional details.

1148
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,340
I'm covering up my daughter's name,

1149
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,100
because I have gotten another tattoo with both of my daughter's names in it.

1150
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,660
So I don't see a point as to having her name twice,

1151
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,500
but my other girl only has one spot.

1152
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,780
I'm not a bad mother, Lil.

1153
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,820
Yeah, well, what about not Jade?

1154
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,100
That's pretty good.

1155
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:20,660
Okay.

1156
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,780
Fuck you, Jade.

1157
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,340
Check that out.

1158
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,180
You think you get two placements?

1159
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,980
Nah, nah.

1160
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,380
Look at this.

1161
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,220
It's still your name, but I just drew a grave around it.

1162
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,140
Now it looks like Jade is buried here.

1163
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,140
Now, what about with very little altering?

1164
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,620
Yeah.

1165
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,500
Jada Pinkett Smith.

1166
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,780
Or just Jaden.

1167
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,500
Jaden Smith.

1168
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,540
Jaden would be easier, because you could just add the N instead of having to-

1169
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,820
Yeah, but if you're not a fan of Jaden, then you're just a friend of Jada.

1170
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,100
I don't really like...

1171
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,780
I like the source material.

1172
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,140
Do not like the byproduct.

1173
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,340
No.

1174
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,060
No, thanks.

1175
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,140
You mix a little Will Smith in there.

1176
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,820
It's very distasteful for me.

1177
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,420
Pardon me, Jaden, but I saw the new karate kid,

1178
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,580
and I'm having a stroke.

1179
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,300
All my wutes are wrong.

1180
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,700
Strokes are funny.

1181
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,820
Could you write dragon at the end of it?

1182
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,700
And then it's like Jade dragon, and then it's like a mysterious,

1183
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,980
like a mysterious source of power in your chakra.

1184
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,260
Chakram.

1185
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,980
What about giant butterfly?

1186
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,220
But it would still say...

1187
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:26,660
We would still say Jade.

1188
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,860
Where's the joke?

1189
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:28,740
There's no joke.

1190
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,780
I like butterflies.

1191
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,900
Cool.

1192
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,380
Don't judge.

1193
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,340
Is that how tattoos work?

1194
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,940
Can you just put a thing over it or...

1195
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,220
Do you remember the game upwards?

1196
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,460
Yeah.

1197
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,180
It's a lot like that.

1198
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,900
Is it?

1199
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,860
If somebody gets tattoos over and over again on the same spot,

1200
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,940
they'll just have like a dorsal fin by the end of it.

1201
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,340
What's wrong with your back?

1202
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,060
It says Jaden mystery, and then there's a butterfly.

1203
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,540
I was a big fan of Jason Mraz back in the day,

1204
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,980
and I needed to get that covered up.

1205
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:57,140
And then he just kept dragging me back in with his siren call.

1206
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,660
Change your tattoo so it says Jades and Mraz.

1207
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,500
Just so people know.

1208
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,660
JDR diet pills?

1209
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,660
There you can get an ad.

1210
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,220
Can you...

1211
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:07,780
Sponsorship.

1212
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,260
Here's what you...

1213
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,060
I got it.

1214
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,020
You get an eraser.

1215
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,020
A tattoo eraser.

1216
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,460
Erase the E.

1217
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,260
Have another kid.

1218
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:14,980
Name him Jad.

1219
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,300
Or...

1220
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,740
Or...

1221
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,100
Erase the D and the E, and then it's just...

1222
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,600
Ja!

1223
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:23,800
Or...

1224
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,020
Erase the D and the E,

1225
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,500
and then put an I and then a space and an HL,

1226
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,380
and then it's Jai Ho like in the Slumdog Millionaire movie.

1227
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,180
You guys...

1228
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:32,740
That's...

1229
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,860
That's timely.

1230
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,980
I'm not a bad mother.

1231
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,500
I'm just a big fan of Slumdog Millionaire.

1232
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,020
I love Jai Ho.

1233
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,820
That's how that song goes.

1234
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,340
The Jason Mraz cover of Jai Ho.

1235
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:42,820
Did you hear it?

1236
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,460
So crunchy.

1237
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,100
Jai Ho.

1238
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,020
Bong.

1239
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,140
Fuck.

1240
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,660
So once the show has been reduced to just clicks and noises,

1241
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,900
we don't have to do it anymore.

1242
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,620
Is that the rule?

1243
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,420
That's usually...

1244
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,060
That's usually the rule.

1245
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,620
Once we've convinced everyone else to turn it off,

1246
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,420
we can stop doing it.

1247
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,500
Erase the J, replace it with an S,

1248
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,860
and then it's a Sade tattoo.

1249
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,220
You're welcome.

1250
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,780
Erase the A, turn it into a U.

1251
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,580
Jude Law.

1252
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,020
There's so many opportunities here.

1253
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,860
Get rid of the J, add a D at the end.

1254
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,980
Put an F at the beginning.

1255
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,700
It's faded.

1256
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,020
Come on, brah.

1257
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,420
E.

1258
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,820
Lose the E, put a D in.

1259
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,220
Judd.

1260
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,260
Ashley Judd.

1261
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:28,740
No, wait.

1262
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,860
You got to get a U in there.

1263
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,420
Fuck.

1264
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:30,980
Hold up.

1265
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,860
Let me try it again.

1266
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,940
Lose the J, add a B and an L,

1267
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,260
and then you're celebrating Wesley Snipes' movie.

1268
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,260
Get rid of the D, E, put IL.

1269
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:38,580
Jail.

1270
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,220
Jail tattoo.

1271
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,980
Here's the solution for all of this.

1272
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:49,940
Just get a tattoo of somebody else around it that has that tattoo.

1273
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,020
So it's not you that has a tattoo of Jade.

1274
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,260
Your tattoo has it.

1275
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,380
Your tattoo has a tattoo of Jade.

1276
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,820
I don't know where he got it.

1277
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,700
He wandered off for five minutes and came back with it.

1278
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,980
Baby, it's not that I love Jade more.

1279
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,620
It's that that guy from Pawn Stars loves Jade more,

1280
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,300
and I have a tattoo of him.

1281
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:09,780
So you see it.

1282
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,380
Vic Haas loves it more.

1283
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,300
It is actually his tattoo from that, what's that, Fat Beats?

1284
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,700
His name is, his name is Jade.

1285
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:21,780
Perfect.

1286
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,940
Ideal scenario.

1287
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,380
I'm so glad that that worked out and was true.

1288
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:32,260
How much work would it take to get that Jade changed to just Cray Sean?

1289
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,700
How many letters is that different?

1290
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,980
Just get a big black bar over it.

1291
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,860
People say, I thought you had a tattoo of your daughter's name there.

1292
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,900
Actually, fuck her.

1293
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,300
I hate that kid.

1294
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,020
I'm over it.

1295
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,140
She had a good run, but it's done.

1296
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:56,260
How did you not realize that you got the same word tattooed on your body twice, you dumb?

1297
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,060
Oh, shit.

1298
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,460
Damn it.

1299
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,180
Oh, fuck.

1300
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,460
I already had a Jade.

1301
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,020
Fuck.

1302
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,420
It's not like when you go to the supermarket,

1303
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,860
you go to Target and you buy season five of Top Chef and you get home and you're like,

1304
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,420
oh, fuck, I thought I had season four, but now I have two seasons.

1305
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,860
It's a word on your body.

1306
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,180
I don't have any of those.

1307
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,620
If I had one, I would know it.

1308
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,780
Stupid fuck.

1309
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,540
Fuck.

1310
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,060
This has been my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

1311
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,580
Thank you so much for listening yet again to our program.

1312
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,820
I know that that sounded just there like a rough edit,

1313
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,780
but in actuality, that is the pace.

1314
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,300
We just ran out of steam.

1315
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,180
We just ran out of steam and knew it when it happened.

1316
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,380
It's these summertime months.

1317
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,820
We all have to turn our ACs off.

1318
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,860
I'm like delirious.

1319
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,820
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues.

1320
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,320
Right.

1321
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:49,620

It's bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam.

1331
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,220
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1332
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,940
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

It's a it's a it's a fantastic little album.

Excuse me.

It's got earworms and ditties.

1337
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:56,020
Also, if you want to have your personal message promoted on my brother,

We all got back from Max Fun Con West earlier this month.

1358
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,660
And I think we can all agree it was the fucking best time ever.

This Yahoo Answer was sent in by question mark.

1365
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,540
Thank you, question mark.

It's by Yahoo Answers user Frankie who asks,

1367
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,460
can I get my dad arrested for watching the news?

1368
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,180
I'm Justin McElroy.

1369
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,380
I'm Travis McElroy.

1370
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,420
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1371
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,140
Kiss your dad.

1372
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,660
Square on the lips.

1373
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,660
Keep your heart.

1374
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:39,540
Three stacks.

1375
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,500
Keep your heart.

1376
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,780
Hey, keep your heart.

1377
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,660
Three stacks.

1378
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,700
Keep your heart.

1379
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,980
Man, these girls are smart.

1380
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,700
Three stacks.

1381
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,820
These girls are smart.

1382
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:56,420
Play your part, play your part.
