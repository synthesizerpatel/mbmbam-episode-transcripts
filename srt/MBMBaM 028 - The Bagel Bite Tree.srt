1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Open your minds. Open your hearts. Open your spirits.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,280
Open. Open your doors. Open your doors. Open your hands. Open your wallets. Open your wallets.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,960
Open your itunes and your zooms and your eyes and your eyes your ears and your win amps.

8
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,520
Listening is not a two-way street. It's time now for you to relax,

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,640
breathe, and learn with my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,400
I am Justin McElroy. I am Travis McElroy. I am Griffin McElroy. I don't like that idea that

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,360
listening isn't a two-way street. You're saying that we shouldn't be having a dialogue with our

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,920
fans right now? A dialogue is a two-way street, but listening is not. If listening were a two-way

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,480
street, there'd just be a lot of quiet. Sure, but I just want people to feel like they can come to

14
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,720
us and talk to us. They do, but they've already had their part of the conversation goes on for

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,800
literally the entire week except for an hour. I like to imagine this for this whole week,

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,400
we've been sort of sagely like nodding and stroking our chins. As the world just moans and wails.

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:15,200
The clouds part. Just give that wisdom down. So if you're driving, stop. Go park. If you're

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,680
sweeping, finish sweeping and then stop. Give yourselves to us entirely for 40 minutes.

19
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,920
As we convert your questions into wisdom. You can call this period you listen to the show,

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:37,760
The Calm. Welcome to The Calm. That's our new name, The Calm. This one comes from SuperSara77,

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,960
which I like for the alliteration. How do I deal with my suite mate's ruckus,

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,320
arrhythmic lovemaking? Her squeaking the bed is getting to me. Her squeaking bed is getting to me.

23
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,120
Hi, reading. I've suggested the bean bag, but to no avail. I'd pop in my headphones and listen

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
to my brother, my brother and me, but you don't put out enough episodes. Wow.

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
I personally like that one of the complaints is that it's arrhythmic.

26
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:14,000
She can just find that sweet beat. If it was just like a constant regular beat,

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,200
she could just find some Tiesto song. Just throw down speed rail and just lose it.

28
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,080
That's the answer. Whenever your suite mate starts her arrhythmic lovemaking,

29
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
start pounding on the wall in rhythm and see if she falls in line with it.

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,200
That would be a fun experiment. If I may suggest, don't listen to us when you're listening to your

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
roommate's lovemaking, because that's not a Freudian mental connection that you want your

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,960
subconscious to make. Maybe it would be nice every time you listen to us to think of suite

33
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,200
arrhythmic lovemaking, but every time you hear lovemaking or participate in lovemaking,

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,680
the last thing you want to be thinking about is our voices. Yeah, I disagree.

35
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
Excuse me, Philip. I'm enjoying our lovemaking, arrhythmic though it may be,

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,640
but I believe in order to climax, I'm going to need to turn on my brother, my brother and me.

37
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,440
It's a podcast. You'll enjoy it. Maybe you won't. I don't care.

38
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,400
See, now we're getting meta.

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,640
If at the end of the video, I'm ready for Griffin's last question, then...

40
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Um, you should talk to your, your roommate and talk about how gross this whole,

41
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,400
this whole scenario is because you have to see her the next morning.

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:35,200
Uh, I, there is a reason why we make this show the perfect, uh, length for a lovemaking session.

43
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
40 minutes?

44
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Well, I, I am of course, including a 35 minute get pumped nap for afterwards

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,960
where you get pumped again.

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,560
Oh, thank God. I was about to ask a really embarrassing question.

47
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,200
My brother, my brother and me, uh, my brother said on a show that we do together,

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,200
the ideal length for a lovemaking.

49
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,440
I love it when people do stuff like that, just to mess with you. Like,

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,400
oh, you mean it, it takes you less than an hour to climax? That's so, that's so bizarre.

51
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,640
Uh, you don't have a 13 inch penis soft? That's, that's this, well, that must be terrible for you.

52
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Uh, penis soft was my favorite software developer in the, in the eighties, by the way.

53
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
They made a lot of really great racing games.

54
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,200
They totally did.

55
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,000
Um, let's, how about we kick off a Yahoo?

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,560
Oh, wow.

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,120
Let's do it.

58
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,480
It's early, but, um, I feel like, uh, it might be a good way to get the show started.

59
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,560
Um, this Yahoo answer was sent in by, uh, Austin.

60
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,400
Yeah, baby.

61
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,440
Uh,

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,160
The man, baby.

63
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,660
Oh, God.

64
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,480
It's from Yahoo Answers user, JustMe, who asks, why does my cat have huge boobs?

65
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,680
Only to back to, and I'm positive she is not, nor has she ever been pregnant.

66
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,040
I got her when she was tiny and got her spade ASAP.

67
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,160
That is when I noticed her boobs getting bigger and bigger.

68
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
Is that at all normal?

69
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,560
She's a calico.

70
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,280
If that matters.

71
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,640
Oh, it matters.

72
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,920
Fuck yeah.

73
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,560
It matters.

74
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,720
You know what they say about those Cali's Cali's big, big front me on this.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,080
Well, I guess on a cat, it would be like under me under me.

76
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,800
Cod.

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Have you seen that Cali's under me?

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,640
It is weird.

79
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:23,840
Okay.

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,000
Cat has some sweet tits, like really just bonds or stuff.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah.

82
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
It's weird because it's just the back two.

83
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Yeah.

84
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
I don't really like her.

85
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,960
The her other eight possible that your cat is a boy and that's its balls.

86
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,480
Cat have giant balls at maybe your cats.

87
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,120
Okay.

88
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
Think about this for a second.

89
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,200
You've assumed treated your cat like you've named it Mrs Snuggle baby.

90
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,720
And it's been your cat, your girl cat for years, right?

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,320
But it's been a boy this whole time.

92
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,760
And now it's like biologically reasserting that by increasing its ball size fourfold.

93
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,240
And so you like see him finally be like, yes.

94
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,320
And now it's super frustrating because it thinks it you now believe that it has a giant boobs.

95
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,800
I hate to.

96
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,400
I hate to do another Yahoo answer.

97
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,720
I wasn't going to read this one initially, but the segue now it just set itself up so perfectly.

98
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
And I can't remember who sent it in.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
So I apologize to whoever it was.

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
But it's why Yahoo answers user at the cold train who asks,

101
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
why are cats testicles furry and humans not?

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
I would like furry testicles.

103
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
Thank you.

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,040
Furry cat testicles looks so cool.

105
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,840
Don't you think so?

106
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,920
I've had I've actually had that thought as well.

107
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,080
I've just just look at not on an actual cat, but on a like a furry.

108
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,280
Like a furry like a human being dressed up like a cat.

109
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,320
Yeah.

110
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,080
I'm just saying that that's kind of a cool look.

111
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,320
I was actually thinking of naming my new garage band that furry cat testes.

112
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,400
What is the what's the story with with cat balls?

113
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,680
Are people looking at these things more than I knew that they were?

114
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,840
Is that it's true when in the same week I get sent two questions

115
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,760
that have to do with cat genitalia.

116
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,680
I didn't know.

117
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,960
Maybe it's some sort of some sort of looks like bird watching.

118
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
Maybe looking at cat balls is the new watching paint dry.

119
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
It's watching the cat's balls.

120
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
I don't think that you should.

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,680
I think it's one of the mortal sins to cover the balls of another animal.

122
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,760
Isn't that in the Bible or something?

123
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,680
Well, no, because cats are an exception because you're supposed to worship them

124
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
and they're sweet tits and they're huge, awesome balls.

125
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,400
Yes, God, God, you're what if?

126
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,120
Oh, my God.

127
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,480
What if there was a cat that had huge, huge tits and big furry balls?

128
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
Do you know how hard I would jerk?

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,640
Oh, Jesus.

130
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,440
You know, forget.

131
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,440
This would be me.

132
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,160
This would be me.

133
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,600
Hey, sweetheart.

134
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:20,800
I can't hear our arrhythmic lovemaking over the sound of Justin furiously masturbating.

135
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Why did why did you send him that YouTube clip?

136
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
I thought it was funny.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,800
Well, it's not funny.

138
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
He has to stop jerking off.

139
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm growing concerned about him.

140
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
He has he has lesions now.

141
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
Listen, just toss in a bottle of Gatorade and hope for the best.

142
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,160
What's Jay from Gmail asks us, what's the sign that I'm being a bit too touchy feely

143
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
with my girlfriend in public?

144
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,240
She's an incredibly attractive lady.

145
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,600
And sometimes I just like to wrap my arms around her, Griffin, and pull her close to me.

146
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
You know, you said my name in there.

147
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, because I feel like he was showing off.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,800
That's what I feel like.

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,160
No, well, Jay, as I mean, I'm not a dictionary author, but it sounds like you're describing

150
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,480
a hug, which I think I think hugs are still kind of cool.

151
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,360
Yeah.

152
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,080
Hugs are all right.

153
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,960
The thing is, here's what I think.

154
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:23,200
If they could use your picture in a catalog to sell sweaters, you're not overstepping

155
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,680
the bounds.

156
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
This is actually a pretty good rule for PDA.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
If someone could take your picture and someone else could think, oh, I'd like to buy that

158
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
shirt, then it is OK.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,760
If someone would look at the picture and be like, what are these two creepers doing?

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
Then it's gone too far.

161
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,400
My rule of thumb is always, would I do this in front of my grandmother?

162
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,360
That's a bad rule.

163
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,320
Well, it depends.

164
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,280
There's a lot of awesome shit in life that you can't do in front of your grandma.

165
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,880
Or Jesus.

166
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,600
Or Jesus.

167
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,080
Or Jesus.

168
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,800
Or my grandmother, Jesus.

169
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,440
Jesus.

170
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
Maybe it's a family name.

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,040
Don't be a jerk.

172
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
Sometimes you just can't help it, though.

173
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,600
Sometimes you've got this super attractive girlfriend.

174
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,320
Like, there's literally nothing you can do about it.

175
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
It's a foregone conclusion.

176
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,480
You're going to just grope a little bit.

177
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,200
Griff, can you tack if memory serves into that last paragraph when you're editing?

178
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Uh-huh.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,520
If memory serves, from what I remember about the female form...

180
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
I read in a book once.

181
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
If I learned anything from watching Titanic, it's...

182
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, as long as you're stealth about it, you just, I mean, you've got to understand.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,160
We got this question last week about the guy who has a friend who's too touchy feely with

184
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,800
his girlfriend.

185
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,520
Maybe there's a connection here.

186
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,360
Just be polite and be conscientious.

187
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,080
Don't do it at, like, you know, a funeral, you know.

188
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,560
Yeah.

189
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,240
Or look around you and see if, like, anybody else is being a weirdo with the hugs and stuff.

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
If you're in a hug-friendly environment, you'll usually get a pretty good sense of it.

191
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,640
And again, this is one of those, if you have to wonder about it, then it's probably already

192
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,360
too late.

193
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,840
Yeah.

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,320
Like, if that thought crosses your mind, you're a conscientious person.

195
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,520
You're a conscientious enough person that, you know, you're just going to have to put

196
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,080
the kibosh on.

197
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,240
I tell you what I cannot stand, what I can't stand for, and this was big when I went to

198
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,160
high school, is boyfriends and girlfriends who would walk side by side with their hands

199
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
in each other's back pockets.

200
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,360
First of all, when you do that, you become a fucking tie fighter.

201
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,720
Like, nobody can get past you.

202
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,440
Like, you are twice, taking up twice as much space as normal.

203
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,080
And it's hard to navigate those tight high school hallways.

204
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,840
But also, your hands are just straight up on each other's butts.

205
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,720
Like, there's no apologizing for that.

206
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,760
You know what I can't stand?

207
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Creepy tiny kisses.

208
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,160
Like, when all your friends stand behind another one.

209
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,960
But like, multiple.

210
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
Like, I love you.

211
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,840
Yeah, I don't like it when the girl stands on the guy's feet and then grabs his wrist

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,320
and then walks with him like he's a big exoskeleton.

213
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,040
I mean, we get it.

214
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,000
You're in love, right?

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
You don't need to form Voltron.

216
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,400
I hate that.

217
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680
How does one gain swagger when entering a club?

218
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,760
I want to become a ladies man when I go to clubs slash parties.

219
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,640
Any tips from swagless form spring?

220
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm just going to put some 50 cent over this question while you guys answer it.

221
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,440
That would be awesome.

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,240
I have a seven tiered plan for you to help you get your swagger in a club or party.

223
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,160
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots.

224
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,400
Well, I mean, physical inebriation will certainly grant you swagger.

225
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, why do you think people have been doing it?

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,520
This is why people pre-drink.

227
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,320
This is why people go to like have a drink before they go to the club so they can get

228
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,440
that swagger going.

229
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
Pre-gaming is important.

230
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
I would say maybe don't do shots.

231
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,960
You got to slow build up to it with a, you know, maybe a Casey Keystone with your boys.

232
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,560
Shots should be reserved for when you're drunk enough to not

233
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,280
remember how shots will make you feel the next day.

234
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,760
Right.

235
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,560
You can't you can't go from zero to shots, regardless of what LMFAO and Lil Jon tell you.

236
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,320
You really get the impression from that song that they walk into the club

237
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,840
and just start pounding shots, which isn't a healthy art.

238
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,440
No, because you'll be at that fucking club for 25 minutes and then you'll be

239
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,920
untenable.

240
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,640
You'll be asleep or you'll be kicked out of that club.

241
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,920
Why is Lil Jon asleep?

242
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,720
Lil Jon, you just got here.

243
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,920
He's had a long day.

244
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,200
Hey, shot, shot, shot, it's seven thirty.

245
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,560
What are you doing?

246
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,640
This is a chill.

247
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,280
Drinking is good.

248
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
There are other things you can do, though, to gain swagger.

249
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,520
Okay.

250
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,120
Aside from aside from, like, like a mental swagger, you know, where, like, you know that

251
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,160
you maybe you get a nice haircut and you buy some new shoes.

252
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,440
GTL.

253
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,400
That will you GTL it and then you'll be able to swagger.

254
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,080
Um, you could also, um, I don't know if it's possible.

255
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,840
Can you give yourself a club foot?

256
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,520
See, I was going to say pimp cane and tiny shoes.

257
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh, well, that would do it.

258
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,440
I think that would give you a club foot, right?

259
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,800
You want like what?

260
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Now, what is a club foot?

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,040
A club foot is like from if memory serves a club foot.

262
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
Is it like a foot that just kind of like stops like halfway?

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,120
It's like a like a nubbin.

264
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,480
It's like a peg leg.

265
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,920
A peg leg.

266
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,480
It's not a peg leg because there is something there.

267
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,520
Um, but you don't have a whole lot of control over it.

268
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,320
But I think that would be like the ultimate swagger.

269
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
So like a foot you would wear to a club?

270
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
It's that's precisely the point.

271
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,560
I just Google image search club foot and just got a bunch of pictures of Dylan McDermott.

272
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,760
So I don't know.

273
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,160
I don't know what the deal is with that.

274
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,680
Uh, I, uh, yeah, I think club foot would be great.

275
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
A peg leg as Travis suggested would also be great.

276
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
Um, the drinking is good.

277
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,400
It's a mental game.

278
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,520
Basically is what you're playing.

279
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,840
And you need to do whatever you need to do to get your sexy right.

280
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,800
Get your sexy right.

281
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,320
Get your money right.

282
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
Everything else will just fall right into place.

283
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,040
If you get your money right and then you get your sexy right.

284
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,760
Get it.

285
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,120
Like I said, haircut.

286
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Get yourself.

287
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,640
Get your hair right.

288
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,080
Get your shirt right.

289
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,000
Get your watch right.

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,960
And your shoes right.

291
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,640
Maybe a little makeup.

292
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,880
Maybe a little man makeup.

293
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
By, and by makeup, he means makeup.

294
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,040
Like seriously.

295
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,160
Get your makeup right.

296
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,120
Get some blush right.

297
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
Some eyeliner right.

298
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah.

299
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,440
Get all those things.

300
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,280
And, uh, and by get your watch right.

301
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,960
He means don't wear a watch cause it's 2010 and you've got a cell phone.

302
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,440
You are just getting yourself right.

303
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
I like Travis's idea of getting your soul right too.

304
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah.

305
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,520
Whoa.

306
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,320
You gotta get clean.

307
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,280
Just find out what's going on in there.

308
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,320
Yeah, you think he's got like a swagger road bump that's keeping him from swagger.

309
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:21,360
I'm saying he's got a metaphysical meteorological road bump that he needs to get right before

310
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,880
he can get that swagger.

311
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,440
Is, is road bump a real thing or is that a word we just invented?

312
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm pretty sure.

313
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm pretty sure three of the words I used in my last sentence were made up words.

314
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,480
Uh, what is keeping you from swagger?

315
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,600
What is keeping you from getting your sexy right?

316
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,040
I think this is a job for a licensed therapist.

317
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
Yeah, Travis has makes a great point.

318
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,800
We don't want to be in up in a protracted legal battle.

319
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
Um, go to a therapist, say, Hey, I need your help.

320
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,040
Get your therapy figured out.

321
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,280
Yeah.

322
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,560
Get your therapist to help you.

323
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,120
We can't help.

324
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,240
This is too much for us.

325
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,920
We can't tell you about your swagger.

326
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,240
And without we, they would need videos.

327
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,800
We would need, we would need a lengthy interview, um, to figure out at a sleep study.

328
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,320
I have swagger in my sleep now, like involuntary swag.

329
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,800
It makes it, it makes you very hard to sleep in a bed with.

330
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Yeah.

331
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,800
I'll wake up, I'll wake up sometimes and my wife will be kissing me and I'll be like,

332
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,360
what are you doing?

333
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,680
She said, your hair just looks so baller while you're sleeping.

334
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,680
I think you got your sexy right.

335
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Your swagger down.

336
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,880
Like, yeah, sometimes I wake up with an empty bottle of Jägermeister next to me,

337
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
but that has nothing to do with anything.

338
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,760
That has that's neither here nor there.

339
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,640
That's really, those two are more connected than you think.

340
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,360
Hey, can we introduce a phrase into the consciousness of America right now?

341
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,560
If whenever you see an unattractive person, instead of like commenting at all on their

342
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,360
unattractiveness, can we just say that they have their sexy wrong?

343
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,840
Yeah, I think so.

344
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
So their sexy is, is, is wrong.

345
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
You're, you're, you're sexy.

346
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,280
You're, you're sexy.

347
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,560
It's incorrect.

348
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,280
It's incorrect.

349
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,760
You've done it wrong.

350
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
It's fallacious.

351
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,720
Take another shot at your sexy.

352
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,480
All my friends and everyone in my class are so immature.

353
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,480
Anytime my teacher says the word ball or anything sounds like penis, they laugh.

354
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,680
Should I suck it up and pretend?

355
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,520
Sorry, tell them to shut up.

356
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,880
Benjamin from Gmail, um, Benji, you're young.

357
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,120
If you can't laugh about balls and words that sound like penis, what words are those?

358
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,480
By the way, I, uh, maybe if you say the word jeans, weird.

359
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,920
Pencil.

360
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,240
Pencil.

361
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
Maybe peen.

362
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,320
Yeah, maybe.

363
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,880
Pinnacle.

364
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,400
Pinnacle.

365
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,960
Definitely.

366
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,400
But if you're, if you're, you're 12 years old and you're talking about Pinnacle, you have much,

367
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,080
much bigger problems to worry about.

368
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,400
Panics.

369
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,000
Mincies.

370
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,040
I think that this is the time in your life when you've got to give yourself permission to laugh

371
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,280
at balls and words that sound like penis.

372
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,440
I know that I actually found that kind of stuff funnier as I got older and just let,

373
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,960
let myself go and let myself enjoy it.

374
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,720
If memory serves, uh, we spent about five minutes on this show earlier laughing about cat balls

375
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,080
and penises, so.

376
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,680
I do not recall that.

377
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm going to have to go back and listen.

378
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm going to have to look at the transcript.

379
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,640
Let's consult a stenographer and we'll, uh.

380
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,680
Yeah.

381
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,160
Doris.

382
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,720
I will have to.

383
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,160
Doris, did we talk about cat balls?

384
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,720
Run it back.

385
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,280
I, uh.

386
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,520
We did.

387
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,640
We did for a long time.

388
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,360
I mean, we don't know how old Benjamin is.

389
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,480
Benjamin might be, he might be 35.

390
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,400
This may be like an adult learning program.

391
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
And if that's the case, this is entirely unacceptable.

392
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,880
If, if, if this is an adult learning program and people are laughing about balls and penises,

393
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,920
I have bad news for you.

394
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,960
You are in a Bill Murray movie and you need to get out.

395
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
You need to extricate yourself from that.

396
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
Unless it's Groundhog Day.

397
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,280
Here's some real advice.

398
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,320
Here's what you need to do.

399
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,520
You need to parlay this with the ladies.

400
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,320
So then all the dudes laugh at balls and penises.

401
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,560
You look at the ladies and go, how immature.

402
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,760
Am I right, ladies?

403
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,120
I laugh at Proust.

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,880
Who can laugh at anything with this cholera situation in Haiti?

405
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,040
Um, no, don't be that guy.

406
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,000
No, be that guy.

407
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Don't be that guy.

408
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Don't be specifically that guy, but you can be the guy who doesn't get on their reindeer games

409
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,120
and you will seem like the smartest kid in the room.

410
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,440
Mm hmm.

411
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
And that ain't, that ain't worth nothing.

412
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,220
Yep.

413
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,340
Yep.

414
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,300
Yep.

415
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,680
Talk about a joke you heard on NPR.

416
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,160
Will Shortz had the funniest puzzle last week.

417
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,560
Did you hear the latest Prairie Home Companion?

418
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
Guy Noir's up to his old tricks.

419
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,400
This Yahoo Answer question that I'm reading apropos of nothing,

420
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,760
it was sent in by Jonathan Bartram, close friend of the show.

421
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,160
Um, which, by the way, to earn that designation, you actually have to be a close friend of the show.

422
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,520
We don't just throw that around.

423
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,000
Uh, but it's from Yahoo Answer user Keith Urban F, who is also a close fan of this show,

424
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,500
who asks,

425
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
Wait, Keith Urban himself?

426
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,160
The country music?

427
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
It's Keith Urban F.

428
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
You're thinking of Keith Urban A.

429
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,680
Well, we've perfected the Keith Urban series.

430
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,680
It took us seven iterations, but may I introduce you to Keith Urban F?

431
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,280
Keith Urban F.

432
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,440
She thinks my track is sexy.

433
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,760
You silly bitch.

434
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,320
So crisp.

435
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,800
No.

436
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,080
Um, Keith Ur-

437
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
That's not Keith Urban.

438
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
That's Denny McClusky.

439
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
Get your country music facts straight.

440
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,760
You broke my heart.

441
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
Keith Urban F needs to know

442
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
Where can I find oil?

443
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
Country oil.

444
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,720
I would need Budweiser oil.

445
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,520
See, now this riffing is going to be funnier than the question is.

446
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,080
No, say it.

447
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,840
Keith Urban F wants to know, does sausage have seeds?

448
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,080
Of course it does.

449
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,480
I told my friends-

450
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
Where do you think more sausage comes from?

451
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,240
I told my friends at school today that I thought sausage had seeds in it, and they all thought I

452
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,840
was crazy, but I've always thought that sausage has seeds in it, does it?

453
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,920
Well, if sausage doesn't have seeds, what kind of treat did I fall out of when I was eight and

454
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,640
break my arm?

455
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,200
Exactly.

456
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,320
I like-

457
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,960
Think about it.

458
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,240
Sausage tree sounds like something it's- it's not.

459
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,120
Sausage tree is actually a new club for discerning gentlemen that I'm opening up

460
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,640
in 2011.

461
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:54,960
Very-

462
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,360
Get there.

463
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,440
A very private club.

464
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,320
Select sausage tree.

465
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Gentlemen can come and be gentlemen.

466
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,600
And be gentlemen together as gentlemen.

467
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,240
On each other.

468
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,360
Yes.

469
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,680
Your membership cards from shamanigans will be accepted.

470
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,000
At-

471
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,280
So just come on right in.

472
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,360
That- it's anise, right?

473
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
There are pellets in sausage.

474
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,240
They're pellets.

475
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,800
Right.

476
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,680
It's gristle.

477
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,760
No, it's not gristle.

478
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,560
It's like-

479
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,280
Grisham.

480
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,880
Like flavor- it's- it's Lawrence Fishburne.

481
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,600
It's like seasonings, right?

482
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
Like pepper and stuff.

483
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,000
Coriander.

484
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,880
Like peppercorn.

485
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,360
Paprika.

486
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,000
Coriander.

487
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Paprika.

488
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,720
Um, but I totally support the idea of planting things

489
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
just to see if a tree will grow out of them.

490
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,600
So-

491
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,680
So just go sausage crazy.

492
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,440
Maybe tuck a few microwavable pizzas down in the loam

493
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
and see if- if a pizza tree springs up.

494
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,760
You- you don't know until you try.

495
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,240
Guys, if I- if I plant a bagel bite and it grows a bagel bite tree,

496
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
I'm quitting my job, I'm divorcing my wife,

497
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,600
and- because I will have everything that I will ever need.

498
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,960
If you get that bagel bite tree and a shemale kitten,

499
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,920
you are fucking set for at least 15 years

500
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,080
or however long the cat stays alive.

501
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,960
As long as people keep bringing me Mountain Dew code red,

502
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
I will- I will live and thrive.

503
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,760
What you have to do is you have to cut a Mountain Dew in half

504
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,680
and then suspend it in a jar of water

505
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,840
and it sprouts off new Mountain Dews

506
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,600
and then you can cash in on that.

507
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
Oh, like a little baby Mountain Dew arboreum.

508
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,120
Um, exactly.

509
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,400
I thought- I thought we weren't gonna turn this into a gardening podcast

510
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
and give away all our secrets.

511
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,080
You guys promised me when we- when we started.

512
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,920
If you want- if you want gardening tips,

513
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,640
turn into our other podcast, My Garden, My Garden and Me.

514
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,640
How do you-

515
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,920
It's actually- it's actually a show-

516
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,280
It's actually a show about gardens that I do with InaGarden,

517
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,240
the barefoot contestant.

518
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
It's not- it's not very popular.

519
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,520
How many episodes?

520
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,160
It's actually-

521
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,720
How many episodes?

522
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
It's actively just like a half.

523
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,440
We finished one and she had to go make some scones for Jeff.

524
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,680
My friend recently sent me a picture of his new tattoos

525
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,320
and I do not like them at all.

526
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
We are very good friends and he respects my opinion.

527
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,160
I don't want to lie,

528
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,000
but I also would rather not tell him the truth.

529
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
Okay, how should I respond?

530
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,560
What a conundrum.

531
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,160
Yeah, you've really drawn yourself into a logical corner here.

532
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,520
Well, first of all, we need to address the fact-

533
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,120
this question was sent in by our website,

534
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,720
our fresh new website, which if you haven't been to it,

535
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
it's mabimbam.com.

536
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,720
Go to it.

537
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,520
More on that later.

538
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
But there's a- there's an input there

539
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,040
where you can put in your own questions

540
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,200
and make sure you put your name on it

541
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
because this guy didn't put a name on it,

542
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,720
so how is he going to know that this wisdom is for him?

543
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,920
Just a cautionary tale.

544
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,120
We know that- we know that he's not a friend

545
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,440
of one very special gentleman

546
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,640
who I think you- you guys all know who I'm referring to.

547
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
I believe his Twitter username is LNM.

548
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,980
Mm-hmm.

549
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,960
LMM.

550
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,360
Forgive him.

551
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,840
Elnum.

552
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,320
That's a-

553
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,800
Elnumar.

554
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,300
El-

555
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,500
Elm.

556
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,700
Elm.

557
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,240
Pinnacle.

558
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,740
Elmum?

559
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,860
Elmumum?

560
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,360
Aluminum.

561
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,560
Al-u-min-ium.

562
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,120
This gentleman who we will refer to by his-

563
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,920
because this is a Christian podcast,

564
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,640
we'll refer to him by his Christian name.

565
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,640
That's Eric Smith from Rochester, New York.

566
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,040
He's a reviews editor at E-bomb Nation,

567
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,320
and he made the ultimate-

568
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,360
Sacrifice, I would say.

569
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,480
I don't want to call it a sacrifice.

570
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,000
I would call it very much a skin sacrifice.

571
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,440
It's like he's in a Saw movie,

572
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,680
and in order to get out of some trap,

573
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,200
he had to get this thing on his skin,

574
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,120
which he can't use for anything else.

575
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,200
I think it's more of a skin contract.

576
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,120
Yeah, it's a skin contract,

577
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,880
so you have to do this show forever.

578
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Thanks, Eric.

579
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,520
Thanks, Eric.

580
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
We're getting ready to wrap up season one

581
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
and take a three-month hiatus.

582
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,080
He got an awesome MB&B AM tattoo

583
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
with our new little pack your bags guy,

584
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,320
and you can get his tattoo on a t-shirt

585
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,360
coming up soon.

586
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
You can rip the skin off of his forearm,

587
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,680
put it on a t-shirt, and you can just wear it.

588
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,960
That's the kind of service that we provide here at MyBimBam.

589
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
Yeah, you've earned that right.

590
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,120
To rip his arm off.

591
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Now, to our question, you have to lie.

592
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,920
You have to.

593
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,680
This isn't up for debate.

594
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
You have to lie.

595
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
Maybe we should have connected these two points

596
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,080
of this guy hating his friend's tattoo

597
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840
and Eric getting a totally sweet tattoo.

598
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,360
We're not lying, Eric.

599
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,880
We totally love your sweet tattoo,

600
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
but this guy, it sounds like he's talking

601
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,160
about something completely different.

602
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
Your sweet tattoo and your sweet cat tits.

603
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,960
We love them both.

604
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
Here's the thing.

605
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,840
It's one of the things that I love about this show

606
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
is the thing, it's one of two problems.

607
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,760
Either it is the quality of the tattoo is not good

608
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,280
or the tattoo itself is bad.

609
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,720
Now, if it's the quality of the tattoo,

610
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,160
he can get that redone.

611
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
He can go and get something over it,

612
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,880
anything like that.

613
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,120
But if it's just that the tattoo is stupid,

614
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,520
like he got like Simpsons Forever.

615
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,880
Maybe he got Brett Michael's face on his face.

616
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,520
There's no second draft for that.

617
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,240
That's it.

618
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,680
That's what you're wearing forever.

619
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,200
Wait a minute, why are we ignoring the third

620
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,440
pretty obvious option?

621
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
You have to stop being his friend.

622
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,200
Oh, yeah.

623
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,080
You don't want to be hanging out

624
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
with a guy who has Brett Michael's face on his face.

625
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,000
The only solution is to not be his friend anymore.

626
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,680
Side note, unless it is actually Brett Michael's,

627
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,880
then it's awesome.

628
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,960
If it's Brett Michael's getting a tattoo

629
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,920
of his face on his face,

630
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,040
you've got like the most meta friend ever.

631
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,960
What if it's a guy named Brett Michael's

632
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,440
but not that Brett Michael's

633
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,120
who got tired of all the jokes

634
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,000
and had real Brett Michael's face tattooed on his face?

635
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,760
Is that a cool friend?

636
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,120
Is that somebody you want to spend time with?

637
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,600
I don't know.

638
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
I mean, I wouldn't say cool.

639
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,680
I wouldn't say cool in the traditional sense of the word.

640
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,440
I would say fucking insane.

641
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
And you should still surround yourself

642
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,640
with a person like that.

643
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
And by surround yourself with a person like that,

644
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
I mean get all of Brett Michael's,

645
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,400
not Brett Michael's body tattooed on your body.

646
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,360
You've got to up the ante.

647
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,840
You've got to get a worse tattoo than your friend.

648
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
So they're the ones that's uncomfortable, not you.

649
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
Get a tattoo that says,

650
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,720
my friend's tattoo is stupid.

651
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,480
And they'll be like,

652
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,040
you're there now.

653
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,920
You can't get mad at me.

654
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,600
I feel like-

655
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,640
It's on my body forever.

656
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,280
Maybe we need to come up with some sort of

657
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,040
mabim bam identikit.

658
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,280
Where like a tattoo,

659
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,840
like a standard issue tattoo that fans can get.

660
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,040
And it wouldn't be quite as large as Eric's.

661
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,240
Because I don't know that any fan is as diehard as Eric.

662
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
So I don't think that any other fan would be willing

663
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,200
to dedicate so much of their body space to that.

664
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,880
So I'm saying like maybe like a tiny-

665
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
Like Griffin face.

666
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,240
No, no, not even that.

667
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,480
Although if you want to get my face on you, go crazy.

668
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,040
I'm saying like a tiny little,

669
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,880
maybe just like the size of like a pea.

670
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,640
Like a maybe like a little one that you get

671
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
in like the webbing between your right thumb and forefinger.

672
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,000
Just so that like a secret handshake people know.

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600
You're building a new society here.

674
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,120
I'm trying to and you guys aren't-

675
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,520
This is kind of creeping me out actually.

676
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,840
You took a weird turn where suddenly you want to have a,

677
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
you want to like Illuminati style controlling the world.

678
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,960
That's exactly what,

679
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
but it wouldn't be Illuminati in the sense that we would like

680
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,080
plot to assassinate the Pope.

681
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,800
Or even have regular meetings really.

682
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,400
If by episode 300 we have to come up with some sort

683
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,480
of conspiracy to assassinate some sort

684
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,640
of leading political figure or religious figure.

685
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,080
I don't know.

686
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,720
That would actually be-

687
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,880
I hope that our show-

688
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,600
All right.

689
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
It's time to let you guys in on something.

690
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,760
Go back through our archive.

691
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,560
Every third word, write them down.

692
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,560
Then rearrange them.

693
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,840
You'll get it.

694
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,520
Yeah, ask Tom Hanks.

695
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,080
He'll help you.

696
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Mr. Hanks, do you have the codex?

697
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,720
I need the codex to decode the show's the Illuminati plan.

698
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,480
This is taking kind of a weird turn.

699
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,920
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo question that will like dig us out of this odd-

700
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,200
Yeah, I'm gonna read a Yahoo-

701
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,080
Pope assassination path we seem to be wandering down.

702
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
I'll read a Yahoo answer question.

703
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,080
And not wandering so much as sprinting towards the assassination of a public figure.

704
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,840
Yeah, I'm saying we're not there yet.

705
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm saying in like 270 episodes-

706
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,680
We haven't earned that street cred to order the death of someone.

707
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,400
That's fucking-

708
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,000
That's like six years down the road.

709
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,160
Like, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

710
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm just saying I want to be part of a community.

711
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,320
And by be part of, I mean lead.

712
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
And by community, you mean angry cult.

713
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,080
Pope killing mob.

714
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,120
Okay, okay.

715
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,560
Max Jackman sent this one in.

716
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,480
Can we just take a moment to soak that in?

717
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,480
Thanks, Max Jackman.

718
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Yahoo Answers user sideways smiley face asks, is the human centipede real?

719
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,280
That was the sound of Justin taking off his headphones and walking away.

720
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,400
Is the human?

721
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,200
We're done, guys.

722
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,400
Like, our-

723
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,120
You don't mean to show.

724
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,040
You mean fucking humanity.

725
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,760
People, America.

726
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,280
I don't-

727
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,120
I'm not gonna answer this question.

728
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,880
I need to talk about the fact that as a society, we're done.

729
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,320
Dog, there are people wandering around on this earth that were like,

730
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,600
they were sitting in their den, not reading,

731
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,240
and they suddenly realized like,

732
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,760
this question is gnawing me too much.

733
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,400
I've got to go ask the internet if the human centipede is real.

734
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,520
Have you guys seen that new documentary, The Human Centipede?

735
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,280
Have you seen that docudrama, The Human Centipede,

736
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,480
where a mad scientist sews a person's mouth to another person's butt hole?

737
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:12,720
Twice.

738
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,160
Twice.

739
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Have you seen that movie?

740
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,240
Because it's a true story.

741
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,400
It was a hard-hitting introspective.

742
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,080
It was on Nat Geo the other day, so it must be real.

743
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,400
I was watching Planet Earth,

744
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,720
and they were doing a special about the human centipede.

745
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,760
You'll know if the human centipede's ever real,

746
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,800
because you'll see me about six feet away jerking it so right.

747
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,800
You have got to get your human centipede right.

748
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,240
You want swagger?

749
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
There's one way to have swagger,

750
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,840
is to walk on all fours with two human beings suspended by your mouth and butthole.

751
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:59,840
If you walk into a club with anything less than six legs, your sexy is not right.

752
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,920
You've got to get your leg count right.

753
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,640
It's so important to have your human centipede fresh.

754
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
And then ask the DJ to turn on Jitterbug.

755
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,920
People will never see that coming.

756
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,760
I have a regimen I call GTL-NCS,

757
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,320
and it's a gym-tan laundry new centipede segment where I cut off my back corners,

758
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,280
and I find a new person to sew to my butthole.

759
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,600
Right.

760
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,440
Well, I refer to that as pruning.

761
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,760
Rinse and repeat.

762
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,360
You've just got to get a new person to sew to your butthole

763
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,640
every night before you go to the club.

764
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,160
That's what Craigslist is for.

765
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,080
We laugh and joke, but I'm really sad.

766
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,280
Yeah, this culture is, I'm really worried about people.

767
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,440
Like these, we make light of these people, and this isn't a crazy person.

768
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,320
This person is just like way stupid, like way, way stupid.

769
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,280
That's why we do this show, because if we had to deal with this shit,

770
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,600
if I had to deal with this shit by myself, like knowing that these people existed,

771
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,440
and I just had to eat that knowledge and digest it myself, I would be driven crazy.

772
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,000
Here's a scary proposal.

773
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,640
One is that someone saw that movie and thought, oh, this is probably real.

774
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,440
But scarier than that is that someone else said to this person,

775
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,040
you know, that's real, and they couldn't determine on their own whether that was true or not.

776
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,880
What we need, what I've just realized that's very important,

777
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,120
is that we need listeners to, after they've listened to a show,

778
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,960
track down these questions on Yahoo and then post a show link in there.

779
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,400
So people, like, because I need the truth to get to them.

780
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,640
What answers did people have for that Griffin?

781
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,400
What answers did people have about is the human centipede real?

782
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,920
Uh, I closed the window because it was bumming me out.

783
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,400
Hold on.

784
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,960
I can see how that could be a little depressing to have to stare at that kind of-

785
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Quentin Jeremiah replies, yes, I seen it in the park, and it's real.

786
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
The film's based on that.

787
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,240
Wait, wait, wait.

788
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,560
What?

789
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,840
Wait, wait, wait, he saw a centipede in the park and he got confused?

790
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,880
Or he saw a human centipede like-

791
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,600
He may have seen a human holding a centipede and it freaked him out.

792
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,200
Maybe he saw a human holding a baby and he got confused.

793
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,120
Maybe it was one of those Chinese dragons.

794
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,840
I always get those confused.

795
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,120
You take off the top and it's just butthole mouth, butthole mouth.

796
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,320
Awful. Miss replies, it would be cool if it did.

797
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,480
Uh, no, it fucking wouldn't.

798
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:42,880
Would it?

799
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,720
Would it be cool?

800
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,120
Hey, that's cool how you have your mouth sewn to another human's butthole.

801
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,880
That's a pretty cool thing you got going on.

802
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,440
Awesome.

803
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,520
I'm glad that's happening.

804
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,840
You know, you've really got your centipede right.

805
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,560
You can tell you've really got all your legs.

806
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,440
Your leg count is right where it needs to be.

807
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,560
So nice.

808
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,760
Nothing like showing up to your high school reunion with your mouth

809
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,600
sewed to someone's butthole to really show them how you've got your shit together.

810
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,520
Yeah, I've only been in a human centipede for like three years,

811
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,800
but I'm hoping to be the front segment in like four or five.

812
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
But it's really going to get my-

813
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,920
Gotta get my sex you right, gotta-

814
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,520
It's all about the politics, man.

815
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,720
Politics, man.

816
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,280
If you want to be the front segment in a centipede, you gotta-

817
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,440
You gotta eat some dookies from a man's butthole.

818
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,640
A lot of these dookies that come up out of college with their

819
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,120
master's degrees in buttholes and they think that they're just gonna be the front segment.

820
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,040
It's like, hey, get in line.

821
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,600
I mean, literally get in line behind me and sew your mouth to my butthole

822
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,480
and we'll see what we can work out for you in a few years.

823
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,680
But not right now, okay?

824
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,800
Because right now he's got a second segment and it's me.

825
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,640
I'm waiting for Daryl to die and then I'll be the front segment

826
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,200
and I'll have a bunch of kids behind me eat my butthole.

827
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,240
As we all know, if you're not the front segment, the view never changes.

828
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,160
It's so true.

829
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
You're just looking at the top of a person's butt your whole life.

830
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,320
Second place is first loser and also you eat a whole bunch of poop.

831
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,760
Yeah.

832
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,120
That's how that phrase goes.

833
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,880
I've never seen a human centipede.

834
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
Does that front segment person, are they just like-

835
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,840
They got a sweet deal.

836
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,480
Wow.

837
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,520
That's convenience.

838
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,880
They just mostly-

839
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,760
How pleasant.

840
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,440
They just kick it mostly.

841
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:29,680
Yeah.

842
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,640
They just like kick it.

843
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,560
Well, they don't kick because that could be dangerous,

844
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,360
but they don't want to dislodge the person

845
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,400
because they got a pretty good deal.

846
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,120
Right.

847
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,620
Right?

848
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,840
I'm totally yucked out.

849
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,040
This is like the second week in a row where when we end the show it's like-

850
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,520
I have a serious question for you.

851
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,000
If you're in the human centipede and you got to get out of it,

852
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,240
would you rather cut off a person's mouth

853
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,560
and have a mouth stuck to your butthole forever

854
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,480
or cut off a little sliver of your butthole-

855
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,200
Of your own butthole.

856
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,760
And then make them have a butthole mouth forever?

857
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
I think I'd rather just kill myself.

858
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,080
You would rather kill yourself?

859
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah.

860
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,440
That's the coward's way out.

861
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
That's why you'll never be front segment pussy.

862
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,680
I still say that I would wrap myself in a chrysalis

863
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
and become a human butterfly.

864
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,400
Now I know that's caterpillars, but-

865
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,040
Oh god.

866
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:30,240
What? Mommy, what's up with that giant butterfly?

867
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,400
It's beautiful and crying.

868
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Its thorax has three torsos.

869
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,360
Why is that giant butterfly's middle segment wearing fubu gear, Mommy?

870
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,320
I don't understand.

871
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,240
I mean you would still be pooping into mouths,

872
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,360
but you would have the great big beautiful wingspan of a monarch.

873
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,320
And I think that that would more than make up for it.

874
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,520
That's what happened to Lindsay Lohan.

875
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,600
We have to end the show.

876
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,840
I thought we already-

877
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,720
Did we not end 10 minutes ago?

878
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,600
I thought the show basically ended when everybody turned it off,

879
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,360
which is a few minutes ago.

880
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,600
So, housekeeping before we hear Griffin's last question.

881
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,960
NBNBAM.com is brand new.

882
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,640
It is so full of games, activities for kids, forums.

883
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,720
You like Penguin Town?

884
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
We got Penguin Town.

885
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,920
It's like the Penguin Town of websites.

886
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,000
There is a instant advice eight ball.

887
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,400
Don't stop clicking until you get the special musical answer.

888
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,360
You'll know when you get it.

889
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:48,960
We'll have new pre-orders for new gear going up in the NBNBAM clothing wear store.

890
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,560
Can we talk about some of that gear?

891
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,960
Yeah, talk about the gear.

893
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,000
I feel pretty comfortable about it.

894
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,360
We're gonna have a new shirt.

895
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,080
It's gonna be a deep heather chocolate brown,

896
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:04,160
just a really smooth mellow brown of the new Justin Russo joint,

897
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,080
the Pack Your Bags logo,

898
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,400
which I'm pretty sure is gonna be on the Facebook page.

899
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,840
Pretty sure it's gonna be on the Facebook group.

900
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,800
Also, we're gonna have the logo shirt reprinted,

901
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,560
but it's gonna be a cardinal red color this time around.

902
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,480
So maybe you already have one,

903
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,120
but maybe you want a red shirt maybe to go along with all.

904
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,960
So any outfit you wear,

905
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,120
you can either wear a red or blue shirt with it.

906
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,240
I remember reading that in Vogue.

907
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,480
And we're also gonna do a mug, I believe, a coffee mug.

908
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,960
Yes.

909
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,640
Which is a great way to spread the word about the show

910
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
if you just leave it laying around the office.

911
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,760
Also a great way to drink hot beverages.

912
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,480
Also hot beverages, but I'm not thinking about your pleasure.

913
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,440
I'm thinking about mine.

914
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,240
And lady shirts.

915
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,600
Lady shirts.

916
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,120
There's gonna be a dark purple lady cut of the t-shirt.

917
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,400
Also, we've got forums now.

918
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,880
That Facebook group is the old, old mess.

919
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,920
I'm not going there anymore.

920
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,240
If you want to get down to that fresh stuff, everybody.

921
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,440
See, now everybody's on Facebook

922
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,800
and everybody can participate in the forums.

923
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,560
I think that both worlds can survive.

924
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,160
It's just, I think that, I don't think it's too much to ask

925
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,520
that people give their time to both outlets, you know?

926
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,480
Because that Facebook group,

927
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,080
it's a good way for people to meet people

928
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,560
and just like, just sync up on Facebook

929
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,760
and just match up and just hook up.

930
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,720
And look for Craigums, our boy Craig is over there

931
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,520
in the forums.

932
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,760
We've titled him the cruise director.

933
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,600
So he's there just to make sure you're having fun.

934
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,880
If you're not, if you're not there enjoying yourself,

935
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,120
then let Craig know and he will, he will take care of it.

936
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,000
We got a fun thread right now full of people's costume pictures

937
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,040
that they, they, it is fun.

938
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,920
You guys should get up in there.

939
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,960
I'm already, I'm already down.

940
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,720
I got to put my Adama pictures in there,

941
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,560
but that's, that's blowing my mind.

942
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,600
That's, that's blowing up.

943
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,880
That thread's doing well.

944
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
And, and it's just really fun site.

945
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,880
And if you want to talk about the show,

946
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,640
there's lots of people there who are talking,

947
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,480
talking about stuff and it's, it's a fun community of people.

948
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,760
And the pre-orders for the new stuff will be up this week.

949
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,680
Just look on the website.

950
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,240
We'll have threads in the forum and on Facebook and everything.

951
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,280
As always, if you want to send in a question,

952
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,560
there's a form on the website, right on the front page.

953
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,920
Just make sure you put in your name.

954
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,720
That's probably the fastest, newest, hottest way to do it.

955
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,920
But there's always email,

956
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,960
which you can reach us at mbmbam at gmail.com.

957
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,200
You can call us, leave a message on our voicemail at 203-mbmbam1

958
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
or you can tweet at us.

959
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,960
They'll be probably, I don't know.

960
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
It's hard to get answers from Twitter.

961
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
You know, it's hard to get questions

962
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
because it, those, those don't last forever.

963
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,800
Email, that's forever.

964
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,200
Yeah, email's permanent.

965
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,040
Oh, and if there's something you'd like the website to do

966
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,640
that it's not doing right now, anything, just let us know.

967
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,960
We can, we got a guy now.

968
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,520
Got our guy, Michael DeMauro.

969
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,760
And he will, he will set it up.

970
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,600
He also runs thriftynerd.com.

971
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,240
He made the site.

972
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,080
Killer website at thriftynerd.com.

973
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,920
Yeah, and, and he made our new website

974
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,800
and he did a really, a really great job with it.

975
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,960
Thank you, Michael.

976
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,680
Thank you, Michael.

977
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,320
We love you very much.

978
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,120
Thank you, Mike.

979
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,880
Thank you, Mike.

980
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
I, so we want to hear, we want to hear the new,

981
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,920
the new question here from, what do you-

982
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,640
Well, first off-

983
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,760
Hold on, hold on one second.

984
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,520
AppSperience owners, you have a special treat waiting for you.

985
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,480
Oh yeah, special, special.

986
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,640
It's really rad.

987
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,320
It's a bonus.

988
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,160
You can get it through the episode bonuses

989
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,840
if you're listening to this on the AppSperience.

990
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,320
Yeah, I'll just say it's a wrap,

991
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,440
perhaps from a personality we invented last week.

992
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,040
Yeah.

993
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,680
And it was, it's a wrap created by Liana Winternitz.

994
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,680
Thank you, Liana.

995
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,640
That's all you guys get though.

996
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,360
You gotta, you gotta-

997
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,680
That's all you, you gotta go get the AppSperience, check it out.

998
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,480
So that's it, right?

999
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,440
Yeah, I think that's it.

1000
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,360
Out of the junk?

1001
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,280
I've just, I've been sitting here for 10 minutes.

1002
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,760
There are two fucking great questions, and it's like Sophie's Choice.

1003
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,120
It's worse than Sophie's Choice.

1004
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,360
Because the stakes are real.

1005
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,520
The stakes are real high this time.

1006
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,080
All right, this question was sent in by Jacob Locker.

1007
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,520
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Billy Reynolds, who asks,

1008
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,960
why do Chinese people eat food?

1009
00:46:46,960 --> 00:47:04,960
I'm Griffin McElroy, and this has been My Brother, My Brother.

1010
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,120
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1011
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:17,120
You will never know me.

1012
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,640
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.
