1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,960
Travis has prepared today's introductions himself, which I will permit him to do now.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,640
Hello, weary travelers. Take respite upon yon stump by the fire.

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,800
Enjoy a bowl of stew as we recount some wisdom.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
I just hate this so much.

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
I just finished my creative writing course at the Adult Learning Annex.

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,800
You are listening to the number one EverQuest podcast on the net. Who's your favorite?

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,720
What's your favorite race? I like Kunark. Who can pick? I like Elfson, Elfton.

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
Listen, you did your best. I want to take a moment, of course,

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,520
to congratulate Miss Jennifer Hudson, who is now a size zero, if you can believe that.

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,520
She's invisible? Yeah, that's what I want to- she's just shrunk out of existence.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
She has winked out of existence. If you look at her directly,

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,680
you can you can no longer see her. She has engine a two-dimensional plane.

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,240
She has gone from a size 16 to a size zero. She lives in flat land now.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,680
She's like flat Stanley. She's basically the flat Stanley of humans.

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
That's Jennifer Hudson in a nutshell, but congratulations to her. Looking great.

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,320
Size zero, something for all of us to strive for, I think.

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,000
It's going to be hard for me to choose which of those two introductions to edit out.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Well, we like to give Griffin a lot of options here. He never, you never know.

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Hey, GOP race, Bachman, Bachman, Huntsman. It's Ron Paul.

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,200
Sorry? Sorry?

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,680
Ron Paul, the GOP. Are you just saying words that you could

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,920
add together just for the funny? Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,600
The Republican elephant. Ron Paul, Republican Party.

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:52,400
Tim Pawlenty. Tim Pawlenty, delicious. Tim Pawlenty is out. Tim Pawlenty is savory.

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Oh, man. So many good options. So Griffin, you just picked-

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,480
Where's Tim Placenta? They buried him in the backyard.

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,760
He dropped out after about nine months. Hey, listen, bazing. This is my brother,

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
my brother, meeting my shift for the modern era. I'm your oldest-

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:18,320
Smurfs! Have you seen that Smurfs movie? NPH is in the mix. Making it rain. Jokes.

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Travis, please introduce yourself. No, you don't get to this week.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
Griffin, you go. Travis lost his chance.

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,280
I'm Griffin. I'm Griffin McElroy, the fire starter of intros.

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,160
Twisted fire starter. I am the master mage known as Travis McElroy.

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,920
We need a new Travis for next week, so that's just something to keep on the to-do list.

40
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,400
Something for my honey-do list is to replace Travis.

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,640
Quick story. While driving down the streets of Austin, one of my friends saw a burn CD

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,120
laying on the street, and he jumped out and grabbed the burn CD, and we threw it in the CD player.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,200
It said SPIN on it, and it was nothing but fucking the most righteous pump-up jams you

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,200
had ever- Crystal Method and Prodigy and Fire Starter was on there. Smack My Bitch Up is also

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,880
on there. It was a fucking- it was like music to have a very moody bank heist to. It was fucking

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,800
fresh. SPIN. That's the only thing on it. SPIN. No other hints or anything?

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,920
Just put it in there. Let it go. Let it go. Feel yourself.

48
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm really proud of you for putting that into a CD player.

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,280
Yeah, a little scratched, but yeah, it could have been bad, man.

50
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
Could have been in, like, The Ring. Or it could have been Fart Touch.

51
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,800
SPIN this. SPIN this up. Hey, let's get to some advice. I've been told that I look like Jack Black.

52
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
It's been happening to me for years, and most everyone seems to see it. I've even been stopped

53
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
by the street by some random lady to be told that I look like Jack Black. So my question to you,

54
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,640
brothers, is it a good thing to look like Jack Black? Gmail.

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,480
Is it a good thing to look like anyone these days?

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,080
As someone who has been told, uh, for ever and ever and ever that I look like Chris Catan,

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,440
it's not good to look like anybody ever.

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,160
The problem is-

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Because you get told once and you go, huh, that's interesting. Maybe a little bit flattered.

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,040
Maybe a little bit skeptic. You get told a million times. I don't care who it is you look like.

61
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,520
You start to, like, lose your sense of self.

62
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,800
Well, Travis, to that effect, you seem to have embraced your Catan- Catanism.

63
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Catanity.

64
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Because you're Catanity because you used- you went as Mango for Halloween.

65
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,200
I did. Well, what happened was I came full circle. I went full circle from

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,680
do I to fuck you to I do. It was a big circle.

67
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,320
You can't do much worse than Jack Black, I don't think, though.

68
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
Because a lot of people look like Jack Black. Like, Jack Black looks like a lot of people.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
Not a lot of famous people.

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,880
Cool. Not a lot of- not a lot of people that people like out there doing it look like Jack Black.

71
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Um, a lot of roadies look like Jack Black, I guess.

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Uh, a lot of guys who run the go-karts look like Jack Black.

73
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,840
Not a lot of, like, famous popular people look like Jack Black.

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,040
A lot of go-kart technicians look like Jack Black.

75
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,560
I myself have been told by a guy who worked at Heritage Station that I look like Jack Black.

76
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
That's horse apples.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,160
How do you feel about- how do you feel about it when it happens?

78
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,200
Well, maybe this Gmailer, maybe he is- maybe he looks like Justin McElroy more than anything.

79
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
Maybe I need to take it back my face.

80
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,960
Do you think it's just because, um, in the chubby famous people game,

81
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,840
you've basically got Jack Black and Kevin James just sort of living on the edge?

82
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,240
Right.

83
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,760
I wonder if anyone's ever been told, like, you look like a skinny Jack Black.

84
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, that's the problem, right?

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,440
Like, how fat you are, like, be glad that people are telling you you look like Jack Black

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,040
and not, like, you- you kind of look like Louie Anderson.

87
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,640
Or, like, you look like- who's that fat guy who's so fucking fat that that's the whole joke,

88
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,480
but he was on Last Comic Standing?

89
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, it was, uh, Louie Anderson.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
No, no, like, this guy's so fat that, like, he doesn't need punchlines.

91
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,560
He just points to himself.

92
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,160
Oh, Gordo.

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
Gordo?

94
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,080
You know.

95
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,560
Yeah.

96
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
I think he wears, like, garggy wrap clothing, and-

97
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
I think it was El Gordo.

98
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,760
It was Gordo.

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,360
El Gordo.

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,040
He was- he was enormous.

101
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,800
Gordo the Enormous Man was the- was his full name.

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,760
His stage name.

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,120
Tender-hearted.

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Tender-hearted, obviously.

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,400
Yeah.

106
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,160
Can you say, on the opposite end of the celebrity weight spectrum, can you say, like,

107
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,760
um, you look like Greg Kinnear, but, like, fat- like a fat-

108
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,520
You look like a fat Greg Kinnear.

109
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,560
You know how Greg Kinnear, like, you know what his body- like, his face, but then with

110
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,920
a Louie Anderson body.

111
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
You look like an ugly Brad Pitt.

112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,160
You look like a skinny, fat-

113
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,040
Jennifer Hudson.

114
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,120
You look like a fluctuating Jennifer Hudson.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
After she got her weight right- well, that's the thing, though.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Like, if- 10 years ago, if someone told you you look like Jonah Hill, he'd be like,

117
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,560
hey, fuck you, man.

118
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Well, 10 years ago, you probably wouldn't know who that was.

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
We'll say five.

120
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,720
Fuck you, I don't look like Jonah Hill.

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,320
Now it's- it's trimmed down.

122
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,400
Now it's kind of a nice- now it's kind of a nice thing.

123
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
Yeah, but nobody means that.

124
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
Nobody means that, like, him and his prime.

125
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,760
Nobody means like-

126
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
You look like- you look like Jonah Hill.

127
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,400
No, no, no, no, no.

128
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,640
Post- post weight loss.

129
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,520
Yeah, no one thinks like you look like- you look like Green Hornet era Seth Rogen, who

130
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
looks like he could actually, like, throw a punch.

131
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,280
You look like- you look like, uh, Seth Rogen from 40 Year Old Virgin, probably, or maybe

132
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,720
even one of his fatter movies.

133
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,160
I think that there are two ways to capitalize on this, and one is we had a friend

134
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,360
named Josh who looked like, uh, Owen Wilson.

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,400
And so he went to, uh, one of the big acting audition conferences, and they convinced all

136
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,680
these ladies that he was, uh, Luke and Owen Wilson's brother, Josh Wilson.

137
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
That sounds like a real jerk.

138
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,080
No, it was- it was funny.

139
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,000
Problem is, uh, he was actually the only guy I know from college that has gone on to work

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,960
in TV and film.

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,800
You can actually find him in a Nickelback video.

142
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,080
Oh, bummer.

143
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah.

144
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
So Karma- Karma took care of that guy.

145
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,200
Yes.

146
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
Are we talking about photograph or-

147
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,320
Yeah, who can keep track?

148
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
I- I can't.

149
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,040
But I'm pretty sure it is.

150
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,600
No, not photograph, because I would remember that.

151
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
It's one of those other ones.

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
It's one of their bad ones.

153
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,120
Oh, okay.

154
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,000
And I think the second way to capitalize on it is, uh, with this sentence.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,640
Hi, I'm Jack Black, and I'm robbing this bank.

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Okay, well, hold on.

157
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,440
You're talking about ways to make this work for you.

158
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
You're talking about identity theft.

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
Yes, but, like, literal identity.

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,240
Not just, like, I'm using his credit card, but, like, you become Jack Black, and then

161
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,120
you run amok.

162
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

163
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,360
Did you see that?

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
Jack Black just stabbed that dude.

165
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:55,920
Yeah.

166
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,520
I just saw- I saw Jack Black sneaking out of your bedroom window.

167
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
What's going on?

168
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,760
And then he yelled, I am Jack Black, which-

169
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,280
I'm definitely Jack Black!

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,000
More convincing.

171
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
Except no substitute.

172
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Dude, tell him Jack Black looks like you.

173
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Say you've had this face for a long time.

174
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
He needs to- he needs to get over it.

175
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
Although, he's been around a while, at this point.

176
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,600
You could shave your head.

177
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,400
People never say that again.

178
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,560
Um, I- just real quick, in this email, they have- there's a typo, and he says Jack Back,

179
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
which I actually kind of like a little bit better.

180
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,800
Like, it sounds like- that sounds like, uh, some sort of, like, dystopian future techno

181
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,360
hacker name.

182
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,640
I'm Jack- I'm Jack Back.

183
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,280
Over there in the corner is Psycho.

184
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
Up there is Lil Doogie.

185
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
There's Jack Back.

186
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,840
Dutch, Dutch.

187
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,640
We got Jack Back.

188
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,240
We got wheels.

189
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,160
We've got Vid Kid.

190
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

191
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
You've just skewed into the Burger King, uh, kids club.

192
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,360
Got Hamburglar, Fry Guy, Mary McCheese.

193
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
Don't fuck with Grimace.

194
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
Don't fuck with Grimace.

195
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,320
He's a hacker.

196
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Here, imagine Grimace wearing, like, hacker glasses.

197
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,600
Imagine Grimace hacking this big, stupid, purple oven mitt- hands, just smash like it's

198
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,320
a keyboard.

199
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,520
See, now I'm imagining-

200
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,520
He pushes his hands together, and there is forso- inexplicably knuckle cracking.

201
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,440
See, you're telling me all this, and I'm thinking of, uh, of Grimace in the movie Swordfish,

202
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
and then I'm thinking of Grimace in the role of Halle Berry in the movie Swordfish,

203
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,760
and then I'm thinking about Grimace's tits.

204
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,560
Not again.

205
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,040
That's where-

206
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,600
Not again.

207
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
That's for the third time today.

208
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,400
But conveniently, they are filled with grape jam, which is great with McDonald brand biscuits.

209
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
Oh no, that's gotta be jelly.

210
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
Jam don't shake like that.

211
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,440
Thank you, Grimace.

212
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
I do love Grimace.

213
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Hey, is it ever appropriate or a good idea to hit on a member of a band after her set?

214
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,280
That's from Nicky, who has informed us he is a male, which he's coming on a little strong.

215
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,160
I don't know, but I believe him.

216
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,640
That I think Nicky's a male, and he wants to know if he can hit on, uh, a female.

217
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Just go up to her and say, hey, killer set, rough night, everybody's kung fu fighting.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
That should be pretty good.

219
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,120
Do you speak Cantonese?

220
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,480
Yeah, do you speak Cantonese?

221
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,640
This, these are Wayne's World references, yeah?

222
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,120
Yeah.

223
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
Um, I mean, I just, I thought we might help this guy out for once.

224
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, for once.

225
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,460
Okay.

226
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,400
I, it depends on the band, doesn't it?

227
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, how big is this band?

228
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
Yeah, if it's like fucking Fleetwood Mac and you're trying to get raw with Stevie Nicks,

229
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,120
then you're probably going to have a hard time with that.

230
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,240
But if this is like jam band at your local bar and they just finished doing a cover of

231
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,720
a Fleetwood Mac song, you're probably cool.

232
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,680
Again, it depends on the quality of the Fleetwood Mac cover.

233
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,180
Yeah.

234
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,680
I would say normal, uh, good band is equal to shitty Fleetwood Mac cover band, just by

235
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
the quality of the songs that they're playing.

236
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,280
How do you figure, how do you figure?

237
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,600
Uh, have you heard Go Your Own Way?

238
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,980
What?

239
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,120
I'm saying that you, there is no bad cover of Go Your Own Way.

240
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
That's fair. He's right.

241
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,320
Here are some, uh, Fleetwood Mac tribute bands.

242
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,400
Belladonna, Enchanted, Mirage, Rumors.

243
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,440
This is getting worse.

244
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,940
Wild Heart.

245
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Oh, Fleetwood, Fleetwood Macs.

246
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
Is it M-A-X?

247
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,200
Yeah, it is. All caps.

248
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,840
Yeah, that's good.

249
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,340
Bitches.

250
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,840
Fleetwood back.

251
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,040
Fleetwood back.

252
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,000
I think that, um, Juice Newton actually started out as a Fleetwood Mac cover person, human

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,500
being.

254
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:52,800
Oh yeah?

255
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,080
Just a cover artist, yeah.

256
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,040
Cover human being?

257
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,320
That's, well, we do have cover human beings though, don't we?

258
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
I mean, isn't that something that pops up from time to time?

259
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,320
I just saw, I just saw in an episode of Tyler's and GR's where one of the dads, uh, makes

260
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,640
a living as a Sean Paul impersonator.

261
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,240
Oh my Christ, yes.

262
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,520
Yeah, right?

263
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,720
My name is Ron Paul.

264
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
I'm a Sean Paul.

265
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Shake that thing.

266
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,760
I literally, like, got up and walked out of the room when I saw that because all I could

267
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,720
think was, what is the market for that?

268
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,360
Oh, it's a human.

269
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,280
And Teresa explained it like this.

270
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,640
The only option she could think of was, maybe someone's throwing out, like, a party and

271
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,360
they want people to think that maybe Sean Paul was there.

272
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,320
Or, or, like, more, more likely, I'm robbing this bank and my name is Sean Paul.

273
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
My name is Sean Paul.

274
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
It's a booming market, Travis.

275
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,560
A lot of, a lot of our stocks are taking dips, but my investment's in the Sean Paul and shaggy

276
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,760
impersonation business.

277
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,000
Sean Paul is just a, Sean Paul is just a shaggy tribute person.

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm just going to throw this out as just kind of a, a wide, broad piece of advice.

279
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,080
If you decide that you want to become a celebrity impersonator and you look in the mirror and

280
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,440
the best you can come up with is Sean Paul, maybe you should go work at your dad's bank.

281
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
I thought that nobody had seen Sean Paul before.

282
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,480
I thought that was, he was like, he was like, he was like Flicky or who's that guy?

283
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
The spray painter?

284
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Oh, Flicky, Flicky, it was Flicky.

285
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,920
Flicky the, no, you're thinking of, you're thinking of Daft Punk.

286
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,680
Daft Punk, uh, his, his spray paint skills.

287
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,320
Hey, yeah, nobody's seen his face before.

288
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
They've only seen his art.

289
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,560
And that's, so as far as anyone knows, I could be a Sean Paul impersonator.

290
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,120
You'd be Sean Paul.

291
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,600
You'd be Flicky.

292
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
They could be the same person.

293
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,480
Big news, big news, everybody.

294
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,720
I didn't want this to be the venue in which I let it come out, but I am Flicky.

295
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,240
Oh my God.

296
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,800
I know.

297
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
No, no, I am Flicky.

298
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,240
I am Juice Newton.

299
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,920
And I could never arrest Flicky because we've all claimed to be Flicky.

300
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,720
So now to answer your question.

301
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
Don't, don't do that.

302
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,000
If you have the fucking, if you have the balls to like go up actually to a, a musician that

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,960
you've just seen and say like, hey, I agree with your style.

304
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,880
Like actually, I'm going to say more power to you.

305
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,040
Cause I, I think step one, take a long hard look in the mirror.

306
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,640
Can you pull it off?

307
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,760
Are you attractive?

308
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,120
If the answer is yes, fuck yeah, do it.

309
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
What does it matter?

310
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,600
What kind of face, if you had to grade your face and body, what are we talking about?

311
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,160
Rate your face.

312
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,320
You're saying if you got a B face and an A body, yeah dog.

313
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,960
Like you are wasting everyone's time by not doing it.

314
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,760
And make sure that you don't, that you approach it like any other circumstance.

315
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,040
You start a conversation first, then get to flirting.

316
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,120
Plus like, but, but do keep in mind that as far as like that natural chemistry or what

317
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,760
have you, part of being a performer is being alluring or at the very least charismatic.

318
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,200
So like, yeah, if you thought, hey, I'm into that, like they're doing their job.

319
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,680
Like that's what they're, that's what they're supposed to do.

320
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,600
There's probably a lot of stage door Johnny's lining up is all I'm saying.

321
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,040
So, you know, I think that you should just ignore, like ignore the fact that you just

322
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,400
saw that person in concert.

323
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
I think you should act like you didn't know.

324
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,320
Don't even mention like the music or anything.

325
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,960
Yeah.

326
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,920
And then you'd be like, oh, I didn't know that you were doing anything.

327
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,840
And they'll be like, hey dude, I'm Lady Gaga.

328
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,760
Like, yeah, you know, you know this.

329
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
I got here late.

330
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,800
I didn't see your concert.

331
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
Why are you wearing a meat mask?

332
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,480
This is a weird look.

333
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,680
Are those pizza panties?

334
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,040
That is my favorite pizza chain.

335
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:55,760
It's very popular in Japan with the, in the capsule hotels you order from pizza panties.

336
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,960
That is so not surprising.

337
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,080
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

338
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,400
Yeah.

339
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,040
Okay.

340
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,080
I'd like us to explore.

341
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
This one was sent in by Terry Dutton.

342
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,760
Thanks, Terry.

343
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,080
It's by a Yahoo answer user.

344
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Jake that thing for Terry Dutton.

345
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,640
Terry Dutton.

346
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
Terry Dutton sent this in.

347
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,680
Thank you.

348
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,760
It's by a Yahoo answer user, Morgan Grutman, who asks.

349
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,040
Jake that thing.

350
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,920
It's Morgan Grutman.

351
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,480
Morgan Grutman.

352
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,520
Uh, picking the perfect quote opinions needed.

353
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,480
Getting a tattoo at the end of the month.

354
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,000
And I thought, I thought I had the perfect saying picked out,

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
but I've come across a few more that I just love.

356
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,600
Uh, if I could have all of them put on, I would.

357
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,680
Just need opinions on which one sounds slash would look best.

358
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,800
I am getting a horse tattoo on my back.

359
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Uh huh.

360
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,000
Not sure if it will be a rearing horse or a galloping horse,

361
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
but here are the quotes I can't pick from.

362
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

363
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,800
Okay.

364
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,440
So that's the first one.

365
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,400
Not a quote.

366
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,680
Not a quote at all.

367
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,120
Two hearts, one passion.

368
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,240
Nope.

369
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,880
Okay.

370
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,680
Hoof prints never fade.

371
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,640
What?

372
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,360
They not.

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,560
They don't.

374
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,280
Together.

375
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
Scientifically proven.

376
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,280
Wait, wait, wait.

377
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,520
Okay.

378
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,160
Go ahead, Griffin.

379
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,160
Together as one.

380
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,000
Wait, I was going to put this in the tattoo section,

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
but who would know better than horse lovers themselves?

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,920
I don't want any big long quotes or anything.

383
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,840
Something small and simple, but gets to the point.

384
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,040
It gets to the point of how I'm a crazy person is.

385
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,960
Wait, hold on.

386
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
Two hoof prints, one passion.

387
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,280
Two hearts, one passion, which I love.

388
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,920
Like what's the, is the passion going?

389
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,480
Like just moving, moving forward quickly.

390
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,760
Like that's my thing.

391
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,400
Also, what about the horse's second heart?

392
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,120
Huh?

393
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,280
Yeah.

394
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,920
Didn't think about that.

395
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,560
What do you want to bet this person does not in any way own a horse?

396
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,440
No, no horse.

397
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,080
Really, they want to remind themselves to save up for it.

398
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,560
And they think that this is sort of throwing their hat over the fence.

399
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,080
Like if you get this, you got to have a horse.

400
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
People are going to think you're an asshole.

401
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,000
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

402
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,160
Hey, the way that you ride a horse is really bad if fire's involved in the equation.

403
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,840
Maybe you leap through fire as you're going to rescue.

404
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,960
Oh, I ride a-

405
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,800
What shitty quotes did they have before that they heard these and went,

406
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,000
oh no, that's way better.

407
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
Now I'm up in the air.

408
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
Do, uh, did anybody make any suggestions or anything?

409
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
Uh, a lot of people are down with elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

410
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, it's very elegant.

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
A rearing horse would be better.

412
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,200
Um, I really like hoof prints never fade, but here are some you may like.

413
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,440
Oh Christ.

414
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,080
In riding a horse, we borrow freedom.

415
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
Do we know what?

416
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,200
Excuse me horse.

417
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,840
Can I get a cup of freedom?

418
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
Can I just for a second?

419
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Let me, that freedom looks pretty neat.

420
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,200
Can I just check it?

421
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
Pardon me neighbor.

422
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
Can I get a cup of freedom?

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
And the horse just looks back and says, you look with your eyes, not with your hand.

424
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
Hey, I am bone dry on freedom.

425
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Can I just mount you for a second?

426
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,560
Just a little, to ride a, to ride a, or can I finish?

427
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,720
To ride a horse is to ride the sky.

428
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,600
No, the problem I have with these quotes is that they're objectively untrue.

429
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,360
To ride a horse is to ride a horse.

430
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,840
That's all you're doing.

431
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,200
It's a galloping bundle of bones and meat and you're riding it and that's it.

432
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,800
Her friends do in fact fade pretty quickly. They barely even think, like, what are you doing?

433
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,320
My horse is made of clouds and fire and it sucks to be on it.

434
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,680
It sucks to touch this horse.

435
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
Horses, horses lend us the wings we lack.

436
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,800
What?

437
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
You're making these up by yourself now.

438
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm not making these up because I'm not a fucking crazy person.

439
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,320
Hey everyone, quit borrowing shit from horses.

440
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,360
Like, they're not good lenders.

441
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,280
There are neither a borrower or a lender or a horse me.

442
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
That's my, for poor Richard.

443
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,640
To see what man has made, one must get in a car.

444
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
To see what God has made, one must get on a horse.

445
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,160
No, to see what God has made, one must get in a horse.

446
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,920
Nice work, Big G.

447
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
You really grossed me out with all these horse parts.

448
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
Big G, this is some sticky stuff.

449
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
To be fair, I did think I was gonna freeze to death out here.

450
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, thank you.

451
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,040
Hey, Big G, I thought these smelled bad on the outside.

452
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,040
Hey, horse, can I borrow your, well, your life?

453
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,520
You may not get this one back.

454
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
Hey, horse, can I borrow your heat guts so I don't die?

455
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,600
I need your guts heat to keep my bones warm.

456
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
You're so good inside.

457
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,760
Thank you.

458
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,160
How about this quote?

459
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm gonna build a chair from your bones.

460
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,200
How about this quote?

461
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,800
To ride a horse is to borrow the entire Billy Joel discography.

462
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
How did they figure?

463
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,360
Because it makes as much sense as anything else.

464
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,680
If your horse was-

465
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,840
If this is moving out, then I'm moving out.

466
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,160
To fly a horse up in the sky is you are high.

467
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,320
You are having a reaction to drugs.

468
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,680
This is a different answer.

469
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,960
If your horse is a racehorse,

470
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,120
you were a great champion when you ran the ground shook.

471
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,640
The sky opened and mere mortals parted, parted the way to victory.

472
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
Where I'll meet you in the winner's circle,

473
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,440
where I'll put a blanket of flowers on your back.

474
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,680
Okay.

475
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,440
So like a head to toe tattoo.

476
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Why were the mortals on the track?

477
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,160
Get out of the way!

478
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,600
Get out of the way, there's horses!

479
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,680
I feel like horses are kind of like,

480
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
kind of like you were talking about with like cats and other house pets.

481
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,800
Can we just leave horses alone?

482
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,920
Can we just let them run free and beautiful?

483
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,640
And not try to capture their essence with your back meat?

484
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,840
It's got to be rough because anyone can become a cat person just by buying a cat.

485
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,320
You can buy a cat nowadays and take care of it for its entire lifespan for like 15 bucks.

486
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,200
Like NBD.

487
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,200
Horses, you really got to go for that crazy.

488
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,840
You really got to, that's a lifestyle change.

489
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,920
A crazy, crazy lifestyle change.

490
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,520
You can't just casually-

491
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,880
You can't take off for the weekend.

492
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,360
To be fair, have you ever watched Animal Cops Houston?

493
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,480
Yes.

494
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,960
It doesn't always require a life kit.

495
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
Sometimes you're just like, I brought this horse, it's in my apartment now.

496
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Oh shit, I forgot I had that horse.

497
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,440
What?

498
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,240
There's a horse behind your barn, you haven't fed it in three weeks.

499
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
Oh shit!

500
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,840
Ah fuck, I haven't gone in that guest room in a long time.

501
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,920
Honey.

502
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,600
This has been our sponsored segment where we riff,

503
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,280
and the humor is predicated on having seen Animal Cops Houston.

504
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,040
It's a great show.

505
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,720
Yeah, real class act.

506
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Yeah, real class act. Hey listen.

507
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,240
My friend and I have been planning to take a cross-country road trip

508
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,160
on the cheap for a few weeks now.

509
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,280
Before you finish reading this, I want you both to take a deep breath.

510
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,640
Okay.

511
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,680
Go on.

512
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,760
My friend said he had the sleep accommodations taken care of,

513
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,480
but when I learned his plans for us, I was horrified.

514
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,960
He wants us to spend each night on the couches of random strangers

515
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,800
found via couchsurfing.org.

516
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,840
Apparently, this website lets people invite strangers to crash for the night.

517
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,520
Third place, and in my mind,

518
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,920
die a grisly death at the hands of a serial killer.

519
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,080
Try to dissuade my friend, but he insists it'll be fine,

520
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,000
and there's no other cheap alternative.

521
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,480
How could I convince my friend he's leading us into certain death?

522
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
And that's from Stranger Danger.

523
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,920
Why do you-

524
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,440
My-

525
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,240
Why do you need-

526
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,760
Okay, before we get into this too,

527
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,160
my sister-in-law couchsurfed a lot in Europe and Japan,

528
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,600
and it worked out fine for her.

529
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,400
Mm-hmm.

530
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,760
She had no problems.

531
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,160
And I think if you're-

532
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,360
But she knows Crabbe McGraw.

533
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,400
Like, she's fine.

534
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,760
Yeah, she knows Crabbe McGraw, though.

535
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,720
She can handle herself.

536
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,240
My friend Jacqueline, who now lives in New York,

537
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,920
but used to live in Cincinnati with me,

538
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,680
was part of this, like, underground couchsurfing railroad,

539
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,720
and people would, like-

540
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,440
Hold on.

541
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
She couchsurfed her way to freedom from oppression?

542
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,200
No, no, no.

543
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,400
She was one of the stops.

544
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,240
Come ride this wave of freedom.

545
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,280
I borrowed it from a horse.

546
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,400
Woo!

547
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,360
Hang ten!

548
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,040
But nothing bad ever happened. People came and slept on her couch,

549
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,440
and, like, you know, would stay a night or two.

550
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
I hung out with one dude.

551
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,240
The three of us went to a Zen church together,

552
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,680
and he was awesome. He was great.

553
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,400
Okay, but you're gonna have maybe 99 of those,

554
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,280
and then you're gonna have one, you wake up,

555
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,680
and fucking Kathy Bates is looming over you,

556
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,920
like, hey, you are-

557
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
No, it's not worth it.

558
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
It's not worth the risk.

559
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,600
I organized your spices for you because I thought they were disorganized.

560
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,960
Like, even little things.

561
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
That's gonna be annoying. Why'd you do that?

562
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,840
Wait, it is worth the risk, though, because it's, like, free.

563
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,040
Yeah.

564
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,560
Like, it's free to get killed, is what you're saying.

565
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:42,880
Yeah.

566
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,840
Like, it doesn't cost anything either.

567
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,520
Well, yeah, but it's just like going to a hostel in, like, in Europe is-

568
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,960
Yeah, it's a cheaper alternative because the security is at a minimum.

569
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,600
Uh-huh.

570
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,160
Yeah, it's just like the-

571
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,960
Like, what are you saying?

572
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,440
It is- You're right, Chaps, it's just like the movie Hostel.

573
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,440
Like, what are you saying?

574
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,320
What are you saying?

575
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,360
Yeah, what I'm saying is-

576
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,560
You're saying it's free, so there's a likelihood that you'll die.

577
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,440
Is that what you mean?

578
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,320
That's part- I think it's factored into the cost.

579
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,120
Travis, there's no-

580
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's the biggest corner you can cut.

581
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,880
Once you have cut that corner, and you get cut-

582
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,040
How do you mitigate that risk exactly?

583
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,680
Well, my argument comes from the line,

584
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,440
there's no other cheap alternative, so clearly you're trying to save money.

585
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,600
I can get on fucking Kayak and find a Motel 8 for fucking $40.

586
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,320
Which is $40 more than a free couch.

587
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,240
My life is worth so much more than $40.

588
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,280
And also-

589
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,240
Maybe yours is, that doesn't mean the question askers is.

590
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,440
Hey, if you, uh, have been planning to take a cross-country road trip,

591
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,040
how the fuck are we going to pay for this is a pretty high up bullet point.

592
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah, that's never-

593
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,720
Okay, that's fair.

594
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,640
That's the thing you do before you do anything else.

595
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay, can we afford to take a cross-country road trip?

596
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
Well, do you mind risking death?

597
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,800
Yeah, I do mind that.

598
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,240
Well, no, we can't afford that right now.

599
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,000
We can't afford it, unless, is it cool if we sleep on 12 couches,

600
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,760
and on one of them, you don't know which one,

601
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,480
but on one of them, you'll wake up with some balls in your mouth.

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm also gonna throw out that maybe your mistake was letting you

603
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
skeezy hippie friend take care of accommodations.

604
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,920
Oh man, don't worry.

605
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,720
Hey, bro, we just need a little gas to get us across the border.

606
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
What do you mean you got this?

607
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,360
It's like a seven day trip, where are we staying?

608
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,640
I got it, it'll be fine.

609
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,320
Hey, this dude says if I suck his dick, he'll take us as far as Las Cruces.

610
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,240
It's gonna be real cool.

611
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,080
Hey, we're going to the rainbow gathering.

612
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,200
Can you spare some gas, bro?

613
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,680
Hey, bro, can I siphon out?

614
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,400
I'll siphon some gas, then I'll siphon some other stuff.

615
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,520
Need a ride, going to rainbow gathering in the forest.

616
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,240
Actually, I gave, in Cincinnati, I gave some hippies gas

617
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,280
to go to the rainbow gathering.

618
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,920
That's a good use of money.

619
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,720
I felt pretty good about it.

620
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,920
I gave him like a 15.

621
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Anything that gets hippies to go away from you

622
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
is a pretty good use of money.

623
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,280
Yeah, I said drive fast.

624
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,080
Drive fast, don't look back.

625
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,360
Drive fast and far, hippie.

626
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,160
I called him a slur, which I will not repeat on the show.

627
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,520
That's good.

628
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,440
Sure, why not?

629
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,480
Like, maybe your life isn't worth a whole lot, though.

630
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
I don't know this guy personally.

631
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,520
He's using a code name.

632
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,480
Like, maybe he's not one of the Wonders, as Natalie Marchant would say.

633
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,080
You know, maybe it wouldn't be no great loss.

634
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,580
I don't know.

635
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Hold on, I'm going to check something out here real quick.

636
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
You guys keep talking.

637
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,200
Okay, cool.

638
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,480
Thanks for the alert.

639
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,800
Yeah, I'm just, I'm so uncomfortable.

640
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,360
I don't like sleeping on the couches of people that I know.

641
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,400
Like, yeah, I certainly don't think of it as surfing

642
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
or any other kind of extreme sport.

643
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Here's, okay, here's what I have confirmed because I thought.

644
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,400
What the difference here is that the couchsurfing.org that they talk about

645
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,880
is like a forum kind of thing where people go and will sleep somewhere

646
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
and then get on and say,

647
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,920
I stayed at this house and it was perfectly fine.

648
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,320
Oh yeah, I mean, there's no quality assurance in this thing.

649
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,600
Like, there's not like a,

650
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,520
oh yeah, he's a definite, he's a confirmed non-rapist member.

651
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,920
So let's.

652
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,160
No, that's what couchsurfing.org is.

653
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,280
The collection is saying,

654
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,520
but this one is safe, go to this and everybody.

655
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,920
So they didn't kill me this time, so you're cool.

656
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,240
Cause you know what serial killers aren't is patient.

657
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,560
Yeah, they'll wait.

658
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm not going to kill this one,

659
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,280
but I'm going to kill the next one.

660
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,360
I'm going to see if I can get two.

661
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,440
This is one of those few times I'm going to stick to my guns

662
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,760
because all of my friends that use this,

663
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,000
if I on this podcast go, yeah, they'll probably kill you.

664
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm going to catch shit for the next two weeks.

665
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,160
Because after those two weeks,

666
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
all your friends will be fucking murdered

667
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,760
because they slept on some strange couch in Arkansas.

668
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,840
Go to the store right now.

669
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,360
I'm going to say it'll probably be like a, how many days?

670
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,240
Let's say a two week journey, cross country.

671
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,360
If you really put pedal to the metal,

672
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,680
let's say you just stay with 12 strangers,

673
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,960
maybe 20 if you have to go back.

674
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
But anyway, let's say you stay with 12 strangers the whole time.

675
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
Get in line at the gas station with 12 people.

676
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,400
And as you're looking at that line,

677
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,600
really imagine all of them one by one turning around and saying,

678
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
do you want to sleep with me tonight?

679
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,160
Do you want to sleep at my house?

680
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,600
How many of them would you agree to?

681
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,800
Like none.

682
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,320
What if the rest of that sentence was, I'm making biscuits?

683
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,360
Like three, a three out of 12 tops, tops would be biscuit worthy.

684
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,560
Can I suggest what might be the funniest new thing

685
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,440
probably on the internet is, and I haven't checked this.

686
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,560
I haven't looked or anything,

687
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,200
but I would like to read the profiles of new,

688
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,080
entirely new members on couchsurfing.org.

689
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Okay.

690
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,680
I think that this is going to be a rough and tumble crew of maybe rapists

691
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,520
that you can find on the internet.

692
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,560
God, this is a tough one.

693
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,040
I know people do it and they're fine,

694
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,560
but here's what you have to accept.

695
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,920
You have to accept that when they tell your story on 60 minutes

696
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,520
and the guy says everything started to go bad

697
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,240
when the boys decided they would stay with strangers

698
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
they met on the internet.

699
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
Like that's the point where everybody's going to be like,

700
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,800
well, what did they expect?

701
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,920
Of course you're going to get killed.

702
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,000
I bet Chris Hansen visits this website and just cries.

703
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,280
He's like, it's all for nothing.

704
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,680
They didn't listen.

705
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,360
They didn't listen to the things I said.

706
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,000
Now this is the one thing I will say.

707
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,160
It sounds like of the two of these people,

708
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,320
the question asker is not comfortable with it.

709
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,560
The person they're traveling with is.

710
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,600
If you're not comfortable with it, don't.

711
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,560
You aren't going to get,

712
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
you're not going to get more comfortable with it.

713
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,760
Right.

714
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,640
Especially not if you listen to a podcast where three people are like,

715
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
oh yeah, they're just going to touch your butthole

716
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,520
while you're unconscious.

717
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Because I know I wouldn't do it.

718
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,400
Yeah, I wouldn't either.

719
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,720
And I know that people who actually do this,

720
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,360
if you talk to them,

721
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,520
I bet they would probably get kind of offended.

722
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,320
Like, no, that's not our culture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

723
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,600
I'm sorry, there's just no,

724
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,720
there's not enough QA on this to be able to safely do this.

725
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,920
Yeah, I need moderators.

726
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,520
Yeah, like a review, like a Zagats.

727
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,880
If it goes down.

728
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,720
Can we do a Couchsurfing Zagats?

729
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,400
I need accountability.

730
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,480
If shit goes down, I need a manager.

731
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,440
Can I speak to your manager, couchsurfing.org?

732
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,080
Because I got mouth fucked while I was unconscious.

733
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,920
No stars.

734
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,640
No stars.

735
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,680
I give this house no stars out of five

736
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,560
because my mouth got fucked while I was asleep in it.

737
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,600
Boo, couchsurfing.

738
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm never doing this again.

739
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,760
Hang ten nuts in your mouth while you're unconscious.

740
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,280
Couchsurfing.org.

741
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,480
Get a half pipe.

742
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,760
Have you been the other side of the country?

743
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,480
There's nothing worth getting mouth fucked over there.

744
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,720
No.

745
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,400
It's basically just they call,

746
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,800
they call a Hardee's Carl's Jr.

747
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,600
That's it.

748
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,720
Like that's the whole bit.

749
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
So I can't leave Texas.

750
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,840
It's just 10 hours in any direction

751
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,600
of people who want my sweet mouth.

752
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,560
Nothing I can do about it.

753
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,520
There's only one thing worth traveling to,

754
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,640
in my opinion.

755
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,600
What's that Justin?

756
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:05,040
Well, that's the Money Zone.

757
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,480
This week's take us to the Money Zone is Nicole.

758
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,240
A dear friend, Nicole.

759
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,680
She's wishing her boyfriend Steve Marincons.

760
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,760
Marincons, I believe.

761
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,160
It's M-A-R-I-N-C-O-N-Z.

762
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,320
A very happy 24th birthday.

763
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,400
If you're sending in a Money Zone request

764
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,720
and you don't include phonetic pronunciations,

765
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,120
you're wasting everyone's time.

766
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,600
It's okay.

767
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,800
He's a big nerd.

768
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,720
And that's her words, not ours.

769
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,360
And she says,

770
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,800
Steve, I adore you.

771
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,440
And I hope you enjoy your minor moment of fame

772
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,280
on this M-A-V-M-B-A-M.

773
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,160
Happy birthday.

774
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
Happy birthday, Monkey Butt.

775
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,560
Monkey Butt.

776
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,000
Thank you, Travis, for saying that.

777
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,800
Happy birthday to you, Monkey Butt.

778
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,560
From your-

779
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,120
And a happy birthday, Monkey Butt, to all.

780
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Are we-

781
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,680
Greetings, traveler.

782
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,640
Welcome, weary Monkey Butt.

783
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
Your birthday journeys have led you here.

784
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
Can I do a jingle?

785
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:03,840
Yeah.

786
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,400
Yes.

787
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,800
I know I said I wouldn't.

788
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
I thought you weren't doing it for humans anymore.

789
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,280
Well, we've only got the one,

790
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,240
and I feel like if people go a week without-

791
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,280
I'll make it short.

792
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,520
Okay.

793
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,120
I like the idea of a minor moment of fame.

794
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,080
Enjoy your five fucking moments of fame.

795
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,000
It's all you're getting, Steve.

796
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
That's what you can do for people from now on.

797
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,920
They'll love that.

798
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,200
So if you want to get on our Jumbotron,

799
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
as we say, just go to maximumfun.org

800
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,840
forward slash Jumbotron, appropriately enough,

801
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,560
and we'll wish your Monkey Butt a happy something or other.

802
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
Please don't make us say that kind of stuff.

803
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,880
We can either do personal messages

804
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
or business messages.

805
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,760
So if you want to talk about your website

806
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
or your podcast or your web comic or something,

807
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,400
you can also get that hooked up as well.

808
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,200
Have we talked about-

809
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,760
Did you say-

810
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,400
Did you just mention like a dating ad?

811
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,240
They brought that idea up a long time ago.

812
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,880
We've never done it.

813
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,320
Nobody's ever had the balls to do it.

814
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,000
But if you want us to sell you as a sexual competitor-

815
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,800
Oh my God.

816
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,520
We will do that.

817
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
We will fucking do that.

818
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,320
I will give you 100% sexual partner guarantee.

819
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,280
Guarantee.

820
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,880
We will get your dick wet.

821
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,240
Or your lady dick wet.

822
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,680
Hey, have you used getyourladydickwet.com surfing.org?

823
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,520
It's this crazy website where you can travel across the country

824
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,440
and stay in beds with people and you will have sex with them.

825
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,880
It's like being a gigolo or a juggalo.

826
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,120
Hey, you know-

827
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,360
Have you been to juggalosurfing.org?

828
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,360
That was crazy.

829
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,680
I was saying I was in Vegas and I actually stayed with Shaggy2dope.

830
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,240
Yeah, JVicious and Cloudnasty will get up on the board.

831
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,280
Cloudnasty made me peanut butter and banana french toast in the morning.

832
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,560
It was the best.

833
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,360
It was the best.

834
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,240
Later on, Lady Death Mask came over and we had sex.

835
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,880
It was great.

836
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,560
What a fun weekend.

837
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,360
Can I open up with a Yahoo?

838
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,080
Yeah, please do.

839
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,240
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker.

840
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,360
Jacob Blocker.

841
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,880
Jacob Blocker, the prodigal son.

842
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Haven't gotten one from JL in a little while, but he's coming back to the fold

843
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,680
and I welcome him with arms that are also welcome.

844
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user William T who asks,

845
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,800
how do I make a homemade belly shirt neatly?

846
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,400
Also, is it okay for guys to wear them?

847
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,240
You should ask question two first.

848
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,240
I'm a straight guy who loves to wear belly shirts.

849
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,760
I've worn them since I was eight.

850
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
It feels good to show off my abs.

851
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,360
I even run the neighborhood wearing them.

852
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,120
My belly is a nice tan.

853
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,320
I've made my first belly shirt recently with only scissors.

854
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
It's nice, but it looks ripped up.

855
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,200
How can I cut them more neatly?

856
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,360
First of all, if you're trying to, if you have abs,

857
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,120
like a sweet tan rippling ocean of ab meat,

858
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,600
you can't call it your belly anymore.

859
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,520
Like check out my sexy tum tum.

860
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,680
Like what you see?

861
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,880
Look at this gut.

862
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,920
Yeah, exactly.

863
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,040
It's not a gut anymore.

864
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,080
It's not a belly.

865
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,840
I got some Bradley Cooper fucking ripped, chiseled, blasted guts bag.

866
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,000
You can't call it your guts bag anymore.

867
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,680
Once you're chiseled, it's your abs or your old abadabas.

868
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah, your abadabas.

869
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,160
I like that.

870
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,680
Your abadabadoos.

871
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah.

872
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,440
Abadabarinos.

873
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,480
There's a lot of different things.

874
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,240
Now, as far as making, okay,

875
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,120
is it appropriate for a man to wear a belly shirt?

876
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,280
No, no, no.

877
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,000
Well, I don't know if you're fucking, if you're so blasted,

878
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
if you have like a butt on your torso,

879
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,960
if that's like, that's what it is when you have good enough abs

880
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,120
is basically a butt on your torso.

881
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,480
Like it's a sexy good butt.

882
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
Then like, I think you've earned it.

883
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,400
Like, okay, but let's turn it around.

884
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,160
I have the sexiest back.

885
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,320
Is it all right for a dude to wear a backless shirt?

886
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,880
Like is it like a low cut backless shirt?

887
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,800
Or crotchless pizza panties?

888
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,520
Yeah.

889
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,320
Oh, man.

890
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,080
Listen, listen, listen.

891
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,400
If the worry is, I think by appropriate,

892
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,880
he means are people gonna think he's gay?

893
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,640
Because he makes a point of saying the thing.

894
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,600
Oh, okay, well, yes.

895
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
I'm straight.

896
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
But like, if you're that chiseled,

897
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,440
people, I assume if I see a fit person, they're a homosexual.

898
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,200
Is that biased of me?

899
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,440
No, no, no.

900
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,560
I think it's a positive image of the homosexual community.

901
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,640
I feel like they're the only ones taking care of themselves.

902
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:32,800
Yeah.

903
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,480
That's how they're gonna breed us out of existence.

904
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,080
Listen, you can't be upset by that

905
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,320
because of the show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

906
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,360
That show existed to be like, hey, we're taking care of ourselves.

907
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,480
Get on it, straight people.

908
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,680
I mean, it makes sense.

909
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,760
They have so much skin in the game.

910
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,120
Like they're more heterosexuals than there are of them,

911
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,280
so they have to be like on fucking point.

912
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,720
They have to be at the top of their game.

913
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,080
I think that makes sense.

914
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,360
I don't think that's mean to say.

915
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,360
Well, it's very nice to say.

916
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,840
I just don't know if it's fair or unfair to their community.

917
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,040
I think it's totally fair.

918
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,120
I mean, I'm blasted and ripped and chiseled,

919
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,560
and my core is, my delts, my delta burps are fucking blasted.

920
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,200
But I also love the ladies.

921
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,080
Now, I'm pizza blasted, but I'm married,

922
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,800
so it doesn't matter anymore for me.

923
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,080
What if you're a real flavor blasted

924
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,360
and you wear a belly shirt that just says, I'm straight.

925
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,640
But it says, but the straight has been torn off.

926
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,560
Here's the problem.

927
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,200
If you're a great, cool, gay person

928
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,560
with a really funny sense of humor,

929
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,560
a belly shirt that says I'm straight

930
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
would probably be the funniest thing you've ever seen.

931
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,760
Probably the funniest thing I've ever seen.

932
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,120
Like they would just run past you, get it?

933
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,400
You got me.

934
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,880
Do you see?

935
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,360
Do you see?

936
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,520
That would be funny.

937
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
Gay people of America, start getting a little crazy.

938
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,600
We're ready.

939
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,960
I'm ready for it.

940
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,560
I'm ready to embrace you.

941
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,320
Listen, it's gotten to a point now where you won gay marriage

942
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,880
in New York.

943
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,200
You've proven to everyone that you can be polite,

944
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
wonderful members of society.

945
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,400
Now fucking flip it.

946
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Now fucking flip that script.

947
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,640
Yeah.

948
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,800
I want you back to like 1992, 1993 gay.

949
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,640
Those were the gays when you could just,

950
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,720
oh, you just defiled our expectations.

951
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,800
Those were the gays.

952
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,640
Oh man, I want like, I want like Jeffrey too, okay?

953
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,360
I want, I want like-

954
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,840
Those were the gays.

955
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,040
I miss, they're too mainstream now.

956
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah.

957
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,560
The correct answer, by the way, is you can't cut a belly shirt neatly.

958
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,520
You have to just have it made half a shirt

959
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,720
and then they stop halfway down the torso.

960
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,560
It's really the loss of craftsmanship.

961
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,880
I learned that from Jesse Thorne on the belly shirt,

962
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,840
put this on episode.

963
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,760
That was a great one.

964
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,560
Did you catch that one?

965
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,760
I thought that, I thought Alyssa Gore did a great editing job on those.

966
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
Got really some nice tight shots on people's guts.

967
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,120
I thought the belly jumpsuit he wore was a bit much, but-

968
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,120
Yeah, I didn't know that you could have a tweed belly shirt either,

969
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,040
but it doesn't seem comfortable.

970
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,040
Yeah, it's making it work though.

971
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah, it sure was.

972
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,320
Hey, listen, do you think there will ever be a time again

973
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,200
when there aren't weird negative stigmas attached with having a mustache

974
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,440
or is this just my burden to bear as a dude with a stash in the 21st century?

975
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,080
And that is from where of all the good mustaches gone.

976
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,760
What weird-

977
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:38,960
There is.

978
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,560
You know there is.

979
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,200
You know there is.

980
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,160
He means mustache only, I'm assuming, and not mustache and beard.

981
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,080
Okay, because as a bearded gentleman, I run into only positive stereotypes.

982
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah, sure.

983
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,520
Yeah, I think, here's the thing though, here's the problem with this whole,

984
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,120
the question, this is one of those situations where the answer is within the question.

985
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,200
If, as soon as cool people like yourself retreat and stop wearing the mustache,

986
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,120
the mustache becomes solely pedo territory.

987
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,560
Mm-hmm. You know, it's like you see that ground to weird beards,

988
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,760
and then all of a sudden it's like, oops, we're mustaches.

989
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,200
Only bad people have mustaches.

990
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,360
They came for the mustaches of the cool people, I said nothing.

991
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,400
Then the weird people had mustaches and there was no one left for me to mustache for.

992
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,120
Exactly.

993
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,480
That was really good, Justin.

994
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,040
Thank you.

995
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,080
That was beautiful.

996
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,320
That was Langston Hughes, wasn't it?

997
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,480
I read it off my Starbucks cup just now.

998
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,200
I actually have flipped it.

999
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,680
I have just flipped it from the beginning of this question where I was like,

1000
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,400
fuck yeah, mustaches, and now I'm like, maybe don't.

1001
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,320
I think that a mustache can be like a red carnation on a blind date

1002
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,360
where you can tell who the creepsters are if normies don't wear them anymore.

1003
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,720
Like if I get on couchsurfing.org and I do a mustache check,

1004
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,480
then I can be like, oh, maybe don't sleep on the couch.

1005
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,440
So like if a place has like three out of five mustaches.

1006
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,840
No, if a face has one out of a possible one mustache,

1007
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,080
then that's a sign that maybe I shouldn't stay there.

1008
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,000
What if it has more than one?

1009
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,360
Oh, God.

1010
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,320
Holy shit.

1011
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Well, eyebrows are basically mustaches for your eyes, for your eye mouths.

1012
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,240
I'm gonna go a more active approach and say that as a cool mustache wearer,

1013
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:39,840
it is now your job to travel the world and point out people that should shave their mustaches.

1014
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,600
There's the problem.

1015
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,760
You're like, I've earned this, you shave it.

1016
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,680
Oh, that definitely exists.

1017
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,040
There's a hierarchy of mustache.

1018
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,200
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1019
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,480
I think that if you have a glorious full-bodied mustache

1020
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,000
and you see somebody with that sketchy stender stash that's not quite filled out.

1021
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,080
Stender stash, I would say, is the bottom of the barrel.

1022
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,760
I would say the top of the barrel is like a John Hodgeman, like a John Hodgeman.

1023
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,800
Like a like a like a glorious stash.

1024
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,080
He's making that work.

1025
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,320
Yeah.

1026
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,040
Or Sam Elliott.

1027
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,480
I've kind of like Sam Elliott.

1028
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,440
God, yes.

1029
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,240
The prototype.

1030
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,640
People say like, why don't you guys have more guests on?

1031
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,560
If I could get Sam Elliott's mustache on as a guest, I'd be in a heartbeat.

1032
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,360
How about just print up a bunch of business cards, right?

1033
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,360
That just have Sam Elliott's picture with a little quote underneath

1034
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,680
that says you need to shave your stash from Sam Elliott and you hand them out.

1035
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,120
Yeah, like demerits.

1036
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,920
Like, hey, yeah.

1037
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,320
You guys are acting weird.

1038
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,200
You did a bad job.

1039
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,000
You guys are acting weirder.

1040
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,120
Lose it!

1041
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,920
You're gonna shave it.

1042
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,160
I thought, very briefly, I was at the pool yesterday

1043
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,160
and I didn't like the feeling of the hair on my face and chin being so moist.

1044
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,720
And I thought about maybe if a mustache would work for me.

1045
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,880
I think about it all the time.

1046
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,440
I'm actually thinking about it right now.

1047
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm thinking about-

1048
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,840
I'm stroking my upper lip hair right now.

1049
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,680
I was gonna ask you a question.

1050
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,800
Do you think it would be possible with your recording set up,

1051
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,240
could you shave down to a mustache as we're finishing the show?

1052
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,080
Would that be possible?

1053
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,320
Probably not.

1054
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,680
Because my girlfriend would instantly leave me.

1055
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,720
Yeah, we would need it.

1056
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,320
Plus, we'd also have to turn it into a full blown multimedia,

1057
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,160
social media online experience.

1058
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,360
Maybe next time we do a live show, you can go to just a mustache.

1059
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,720
Yeah, I think live show mustache, I think I could definitely do that.

1060
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,080
All right, you've heard it here, all mustaches.

1061
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,240
I can do one, Travis can do one, Justin can borrow one from a horse.

1062
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,440
I can draw it on.

1063
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,720
Justin can draw it on.

1064
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,480
With mascara and a stipple brush.

1065
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,320
This is gonna be great.

1066
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,280
It's gonna be a good show.

1067
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,000
Hey, my boyfriend and I have been dating for around three months,

1068
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
but we don't have a specific anniversary.

1069
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,680
That never struck me as odd,

1070
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,560
but some of my girlfriends insisted that it was weird

1071
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,640
and that he and I needed to have one.

1072
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,920
Is not having an anniversary a slight to romantic traditions,

1073
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,040
or should we just make up an arbitrary date to appease my friends?

1074
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
And that is from Michelle Mittens.

1075
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,240
Oh, Michelle Mittens.

1076
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,560
Michelle, can you not ballpark it for me?

1077
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,200
Like you don't remember if it was hot or cold outside?

1078
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,920
She did.

1079
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,880
It was three months.

1080
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Three months ago, so that would be May?

1081
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,500
April?

1082
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,840
No, maybe May.

1083
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,160
I think we just have to pick one.

1084
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,640
Yeah, well, is there not an instigating event?

1085
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,680
Can you not remember, like,

1086
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,200
I remember we had that like four hour talk

1087
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
after the Dave Matthews Band concert.

1088
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,400
Yeah, what's yours?

1089
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,400
What's your favorite?

1090
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,440
Mine is Ants Marching.

1091
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,760
Oh, mine too.

1092
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,320
Dreaming.

1093
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,480
Yeah, he said American Baby and he laughed.

1094
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,040
He was like, no, nobody's favorite song is American Baby.

1095
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,540
Wow.

1096
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,400
I don't think it's that big of a deal when you're dating, personally.

1097
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,960
I think that, but no, no, no, no, no.

1098
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,640
You're wrong and here's why.

1099
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,040
Okay.

1100
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,560
It's like when you have a learner's permit.

1101
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,840
If you can't observe the rules of the road with a learner's permit,

1102
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,440
you don't deserve a driver's license.

1103
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,080
Travis, that was unusually astute.

1104
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,760
Are you on PCP?

1105
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,960
I'm unlimited.

1106
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,200
Have you been taking the Bradley Cooper pills?

1107
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,560
I am.

1108
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,840
I'm on the Bradley Cooper pills.

1109
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,960
Travis brought some insight from a horse today, I think.

1110
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,200
I think that we need to pick one for her.

1111
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,040
What's a good date?

1112
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,360
What is it?

1113
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,320
Go with the first.

1114
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,080
Go with like June 1st.

1115
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,720
No, fuck that.

1116
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,360
We have an opportunity right now, Travis, to create love.

1117
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,240
Okay.

1118
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,840
What is a good day for love to be on?

1119
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,000
She said around three months, right?

1120
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,920
So we're going May, right?

1121
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,240
May.

1122
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,040
Okay, if you're going memorable, what about May 8th?

1123
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,640
And then you can remember Mayth.

1124
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,680
Mayth.

1125
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:54,880
Mayth.

1126
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,840
That's not bad.

1127
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,880
What about Cinco de Mayo?

1128
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,840
What about Cinco de Mayo?

1129
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,040
That's what I was thinking, fucking-

1130
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,000
I love it.

1131
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,480
Five-five, easy to remember Cinco de Mayo.

1132
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,200
It's perfect.

1133
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,960
Let's get tequila drunk together and spend some time.

1134
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,400
Eat some chimmy burritos.

1135
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,360
Watch Love, actually.

1136
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,520
That's what you do.

1137
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,160
I like this.

1138
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,360
Cinco de Mayo.

1139
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,480
Yeah, Cinco de Mayo.

1140
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,720
And then you can Cinco de Love make.

1141
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,320
Ooh.

1142
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,560
Yeah.

1143
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,360
Yeah, we synced up on Cinco de Mayo.

1144
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,920
That's what you tell people and they'll retch a little bit in their mouths.

1145
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,280
That's what they'll say.

1146
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,240
No, I think you just tell the honest story when people are like,

1147
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,280
Oh, what's your anniversary?

1148
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,640
Say it's Cinco de Mayo because three random dudes chose it for us.

1149
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,320
Three random dudes chose our anniversary.

1150
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,680
Yeah, we have a special kind of love.

1151
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,680
Three guys spread throughout the country decided when we were in love.

1152
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,120
My favorite oral novel.

1153
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,760
I wish more people gave us that kind of, I think of us as sort of the global justicars of love.

1154
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,760
Like, I wish that people would write us and be like, what day was my baby born?

1155
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,160
Yeah.

1156
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,440
Hey, I need a new birthday.

1157
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,320
What's up?

1158
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,680
Who is my real dad?

1159
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,120
Hey, Christmas sucks.

1160
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,840
Can you move it?

1161
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:03,920
Sure can.

1162
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,360
I sure can.

1163
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,720
March 12th.

1164
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,480
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1165
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,560
St. Patrick's Day is coming up soon.

1166
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,080
Oh, my advent calendar is wrong.

1167
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,760
I need a new one.

1168
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,360
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

1169
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,720
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Cal.

1170
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,280
Thank you, Cal.

1171
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Helen of Troy, who asks,

1172
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,000
How do people dress?

1173
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,800
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1174
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,960
It says, how do people dress at spanking parties?

1175
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,200
I'm not planning on going to one.

1176
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,680
But I am curious as to what they're all about.

1177
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,160
Do people-

1178
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1179
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,960
Do people dress in role-playing costumes?

1180
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,000
Can you just sit there and observe all the spanking around

1181
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,200
and you not have to participate?

1182
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,640
Good one, Dave.

1183
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,440
You really got her.

1184
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,840
Not for me to spank you.

1185
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,360
Do you have to pay to enter the party?

1186
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,200
Are the parties usually at a private residence?

1187
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,400
Any answers would be appreciated.

1188
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,240
I'm willing to bet that if you go to a spanking party,

1189
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,080
you're paying in one way or another.

1190
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,240
Yeah, no one rides for free.

1191
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,680
Oh, man, what do you-

1192
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,480
Ass, ass, or ass, no one rides for free.

1193
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,360
Which one?

1194
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,360
What is a spanking party?

1195
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,320
Yeah, I'm already upset by just the assumption

1196
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,120
that this is a real thing that people do

1197
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,240
and not something this person has made up.

1198
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,480
Yeah, because there's not a five paragraph answer

1199
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,360
that somebody's provided.

1200
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh, fuck.

1201
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,440
Oh, oops.

1202
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,480
Everybody, I want complete silence.

1203
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,280
Griffin, you have to read the whole thing.

1204
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,400
Let's see how long we can go.

1205
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,160
Oh, man.

1206
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,480
This is Baka Otaku 30.

1207
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,920
Good start.

1208
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,120
Is there some music you can underlay here later

1209
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,160
when you're editing together?

1210
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,200
Something kind of nice and easy?

1211
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,800
Yeah, I'll throw down some Norah Jones.

1212
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,120
Yeah, that would be great, actually.

1213
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,960
Having been to my fair share of spanking parties,

1214
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,920
I'll happily answer this.

1215
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,400
Though more information can be found in an essay

1216
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,160
that I posted on my spanking blog months ago.

1217
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,480
The link to my blog can be found on my profile,

1218
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,640
though it'll take some digging to find the correct entry.

1219
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,080
Unless a party has a specific theme like teacher-student,

1220
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,680
most people will simply wear clothes

1221
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,120
that are comfortable and casual.

1222
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,040
Spankers may tend to wear clothes

1223
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,120
that are more formal or authoritative.

1224
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,080
And spankies...

1225
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:39,120
And spankies leans towards clothes

1226
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,720
that are loose-fitting or easily removed,

1227
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,120
allowing faster access to bare their bottom.

1228
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,320
Skirts are common among female spankies,

1229
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,800
with pleated schoolgirl skirts being the most common.

1230
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
Some people will dress in roleplay, though,

1231
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,360
and there are some parties devoted entirely to roleplay.

1232
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,000
Yes, you may sit and observe if you don't feel like playing.

1233
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,720
No one is forced to play,

1234
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,040
and many parties have the attendees wear stickers

1235
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,160
that show the orientation for their night,

1236
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,600
top, bottom, or switch.

1237
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,640
I just threw a can across the room because I was so like,

1238
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,160
yes, I gave blood today.

1239
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,320
That's a crazy sticker.

1240
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,800
And include a designation for observer or newbie.

1241
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,080
Oh, as Phil pointed out,

1242
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,080
you may be encouraged to play, but most people won't be pushy.

1243
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,680
If you're new, the best parties will give a new person

1244
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,520
a chance to feel comfortable before they start playing.

1245
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,640
Most parties do have an entrance fee,

1246
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,480
or at least ask for a donation to cover costs,

1247
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,160
or that the attendees bring a...

1248
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,960
What costs?

1249
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,320
Or that the attendees bring a...

1250
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,680
The aloe vera?

1251
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,480
Or that the attendees bring a covered dish to share.

1252
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,040
Who brought the fried kale?

1253
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,600
This is...

1254
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,000
Ow!

1255
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,480
Fuck!

1256
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:44,800
Ow!

1257
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,720
Not yet, Steve!

1258
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,680
Jesus fuck!

1259
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,800
Look at my sticker!

1260
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,560
I'm an observer!

1261
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,680
Check my sticker!

1262
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,240
Jesus!

1263
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,760
I'm the caterer to this spank party!

1264
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,080
God damn!

1265
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,120
I'm clearly dressed in a more authoritative manner.

1266
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,640
I am the swanger!

1267
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,400
I like to wear a trench coat to the parties

1268
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,000
and tell them that I'm the covered dish.

1269
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,360
The best parties also offer the most

1270
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,400
for the least amount of cash.

1271
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,520
From what I've heard,

1272
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,160
Shadow Lane costs far too much for what is available.

1273
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,000
And I went to a Crimson Moon party

1274
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,160
and can say that the same is true for all of them.

1275
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,760
Crimson Moon, fuck you!

1276
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,960
Fuck you, that's made up.

1277
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,400
The most bang for the buck-

1278
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,200
Oh, this is promising.

1279
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
The most bang for the buck, from my experience,

1280
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,600
is the Texas All-State Spanking Party,

1281
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,200
as their entrance fees are always low,

1282
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,240
yet the party is huge,

1283
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,640
particularly the years that it takes place in Dallas.

1284
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,680
Road trip.

1285
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,840
Griffin must go.

1286
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,760
I'm gonna shave down to a mustache.

1287
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,520
I'm gonna fucking show up to that.

1288
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,760
Oh, God.

1289
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,440
Uh, larger parties take place in hotels and resorts.

1290
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,120
Smaller parties usually at private residences.

1291
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,200
I enjoy the seclusion of a cabin party.

1292
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,400
There's something alluring to me at the public nature of a hotel party.

1293
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,240
No shit, you fucking-

1294
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,840
Okay, straight up.

1295
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,280
You guys gave shit to the people on couchsurfing.org.

1296
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,000
This is the new terrifying.

1297
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,880
Hey, uh, listen.

1298
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,320
As long as you're staying with me tonight,

1299
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,080
uh, you'll feel your win in Rome, you know?

1300
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,160
Uh, I got some friends coming overnight.

1301
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,760
Uh, uh, choose your sticker.

1302
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,840
Stand into the- get in the spankatorium.

1303
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,040
Choose wisely.

1304
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,560
Stand in the spank tank with your sticker.

1305
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,080
Welcome to the spankatorium.

1306
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,320
You can sleep on the couch if you'd like,

1307
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,600
but we might be keeping you up.

1308
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,000
We might keep you up if you sleep too close to the spank dome.

1309
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,000
Uh, last thing.

1310
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,720
Team mate enter.

1311
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,400
One man leaves.

1312
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,920
One more thing, and this is the most upsetting part.

1313
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,520
There are also icebreaker games to get everyone comfortable when a party starts,

1314
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,040
so spanking can begin.

1315
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,360
Uh, demos, vendors, contests, and special events.

1316
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,360
Hey, guys.

1317
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:37,600
Hey.

1318
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,640
Just really quick.

1319
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,880
Um, I mean, I get, um, like, what's the- what's the-

1320
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,800
does it go trust falls, then low ropes activities,

1321
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,880
and then you fucking punish someone?

1322
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,080
Just punish that ass.

1323
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,760
What's the core- what is the- explain to me.

1324
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,040
You played the minister's cat.

1325
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,560
It's- no, it's name game, keep the balls in the air,

1326
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,960
and then paddle till bloody chunks.

1327
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,800
Just fucking wail on that ass.

1328
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,240
Punish that student, and then you go back to low ropes.

1329
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,800
Is it light as a feather, stiff as a board,

1330
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,640
and then cat of nine tails?

1331
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:14,880
Yeah.

1332
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
I can never remember.

1333
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,720
See, I like to use spanking to break the ice

1334
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,920
before I do something uncomfortable.

1335
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,960
Like, hey, I'm Justin.

1336
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,240
Low ropes are this way.

1337
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,440
Ask to borrow money or something.

1338
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,320
You want some Sprite?

1339
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,920
My favorite thing, and it goes all the way back

1340
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,720
to the beginning of the explanation, is the line, um,

1341
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,080
because of, uh, I've gone to a bunch of spanking parties,

1342
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,840
I'll handle this one.

1343
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,560
Like, everybody was rushing to answer, and they're like,

1344
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,600
I got this, I got this.

1345
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,480
I got this.

1346
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,880
Don't worry.

1347
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,360
I got it.

1348
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:41,920
Allow me.

1349
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,240
I consider myself-

1350
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,840
You come to the right place.

1351
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,200
We're cool. We're cool.

1352
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,520
I have a master sticker, so, you know,

1353
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,760
you know that I know what I'm talking about.

1354
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,800
Oh, you brought casserole.

1355
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,360
That's nice.

1356
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,040
How excited must this guy have been

1357
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,480
to be combing the weird party section of Yahoo Answers,

1358
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,040
and fucking finally, someone is ready to tap into his expertise?

1359
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,640
The punishment part, no.

1360
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,080
Master student, no, no, no.

1361
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,000
Poop eating, have to, no, no, no.

1362
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,840
Ah, here we go.

1363
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,880
A spanking question.

1364
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,800
This question, by the way,

1365
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,040
I just realized was from four years ago,

1366
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,080
so if we're lucky-

1367
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,920
This person's dead.

1368
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,120
That everyone is dead.

1369
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,920
Spank to death.

1370
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,600
Spank to- Oh, you spanked my guts out!

1371
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,100
No!

1372
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,440
You know, you guys understand how this little short story ends, right?

1373
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
It ends with, sometime this week,

1374
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,960
we get an email from someone whose butt hurt for giving an expression.

1375
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,160
Hey, listen.

1376
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,560
Me and my spouse-

1377
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,000
Me and my fellow cheek blasters,

1378
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,360
we didn't like those things you said.

1379
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,840
Listen, me and the other rump wrestlers were talking.

1380
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,200
It's, listen, tough shit, okay?

1381
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,400
Everybody does weird things.

1382
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,160
Keep it secret, keep it safe.

1383
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,080
Part of it, part of it, part of the weird shit

1384
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,400
is not getting uppity when other people call you on it,

1385
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,280
because it's a secret, so you're not supposed to admit to it.

1386
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,240
That's what secrets are.

1387
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,960
And listen, no one can possibly use the phrase,

1388
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,480
no, no, I do this all the time.

1389
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,320
There's nothing weird about it.

1390
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,680
Fuck you.

1391
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,640
By the way, scoop for you,

1392
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,920
if there was nothing weird about it,

1393
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,120
you wouldn't prefer cabin parties, you weirdo.

1394
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,760
I like Tupperware parties in the middle of fucking nowhere

1395
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,600
where I know the sheriff's not gonna come

1396
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,240
putting his big nose into my business.

1397
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,920
Unless he's into that.

1398
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,040
Unless he's into that.

1399
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,800
He's more than welcome, obviously.

1400
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,480
All are welcome.

1401
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,080
All are welcome at the spank party.

1402
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,280
I will say that if the rest of the world

1403
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,160
could take on the open-mindedness of a spank party,

1404
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,000
maybe we'd be a little bit of a better place.

1405
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,080
Yeah, or the worst place ever.

1406
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,120
Or the worst place ever, and no one could sit down.

1407
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,040
Just a chairless wasteland.

1408
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,040
Let's see.

1409
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,800
Listen, I wanna hear Griffin's last question.

1410
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,600
But first, just a few housekeeping things.

1411
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:14,800
Next week, we are gonna have a special back-to-school episode.

1412
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,320
All our questions, everything's gonna be about

1413
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,440
headed back to school.

1414
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,120
About the movie Back to School.

1415
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,400
Yeah, about the movie Back to School,

1416
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,040
about actually physically going,

1417
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,840
what's cool for kids, what styles are cool this year.

1418
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,600
But that's gonna be up to you.

1419
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,080
You need to send us all your back-to-school questions,

1420
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,320
you know, from college to kindergarten.

1421
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,360
Here's the sneak preview.

1422
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,760
Five star, out.

1423
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,560
Mead, in.

1424
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah.

1425
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,800
Trapper keeper.

1426
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:41,920
Donezo.

1427
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,040
Please, if you get a chance this week,

1428
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,320
can you just tell a friend, say,

1429
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,720
hey, I made you a CD, it's got the show on it.

1430
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,840
Or, and hey, this is a super-duper please.

1431
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,760
I see a lot of people ask people on Twitter,

1432
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,720
like, hey, what's with Bim Bam?

1433
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,840
Because you just talked about it.

1434
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,720
Will you answer them?

1435
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,040
Can you please send them a link to our sampler,

1436
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,400
so that way they listen to it?

1437
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,080
It's bit.ly forward slash it's Bim Bam.

1438
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,360
And if they hear that, they think,

1439
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,320
oh, this is funny.

1440
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,520
It's an easy way to get people into it.

1441
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,840
Or just search YouTube for Bim Bam.

1442
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,440
It's like the first thing that comes up.

1443
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,880
Yeah, and also, while they're on there,

1444
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,240
make sure that they check out the rinse and repeat.

1445
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,840
The Saturday morning concert?

1446
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,440
Yeah, they're gonna love that.

1447
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,320
Yeah, it's good stuff.

1448
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,360
Thank you to John Roderick in the long winters

1449
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,880
for the use of our theme song, Into Departure,

1450
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,800
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which is-

1451
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,160
Speaking of spanking parties.

1452
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,000
Oh, man, just turn that one on, and your next-

1453
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,840
What I love is, somebody tweeted,

1454
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,600
thanks, NBNBAM, and long winters, the album is great.

1455
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,680
John Roderick retreated it.

1456
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,480
He was super happy that it was up there.

1457
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,920
And he retreated it.

1458
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,400
He capitulated.

1459
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,360
He did retreat it.

1460
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,160
Hey, you know.

1461
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,600
Travis had a big spanking last night.

1462
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,120
I think that we should stop advising people

1463
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,280
to just buy Putting the Days to Bed.

1464
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,800
I think you should buy every long winters album.

1465
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,200
Oh, yeah.

1466
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:55,600
They're all-

1467
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,160
Want to pretend to fall?

1468
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:56,720
They're literally all great.

1469
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,680
God damn, it's so good.

1470
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,280
We've got a forum.

1471
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,080
It's maximumfun.org forward slash something, something, something.

1472
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,440
But if you go to maximumfun.org, there's a forums button there.

1473
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,720
And we're there.

1474
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,400
We talk with people.

1475
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,920
Talk about the episode.

1476
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,440
Talk about what you liked, what you didn't like.

1477
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,280
Feedback, you know.

1478
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,160
Real dialogue.

1479
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,400
And of course, you can do that on Twitter, too.

1480
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,920
Just use the NBNBAM hashtag when you talk about something related to the show,

1481
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,440
be it a quote or something like that.

1482
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,480
Not only the best place to ask us questions for the show,

1483
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,560
for that, you want to go with NBNBAM at maximumfun.org.

1484
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,880
But we're happy to answer them there.

1485
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,720
And yeah.

1486
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,240
Thank you, everybody.

1487
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,760
Thanks, everybody.

1488
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,240
I love you.

1489
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,960
Griffin is going to give us one more question,

1490
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,640
something to sort of think about over the oncoming week.

1491
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,920
So Griffin, take it away.

1492
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,440
This one was sent in by Greg Jaxes.

1493
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,320
Thanks, Greg.

1494
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, LordHaveMercy, who asks,

1495
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,000
Why would a six-foot-three man who looks like Jay-Z

1496
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,520
be a lot more depressed than a five-foot-six guy who looks like Jay-Z?

1497
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,600
I'm Justin McElroy.

1498
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,720
I'm Travis McElroy.

1499
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1500
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,680
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

1501
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,640
This is my dad.

1502
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,920
This is what we wear on the lips.

1503
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,600
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1504
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,120
Keep your heart, ay.

1505
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,720
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1506
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,240
Keep your heart, man.

1507
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,840
These girls are smart, three stacks.

1508
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,240
These girls are smart.

1509
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:52,720
Play your part.
