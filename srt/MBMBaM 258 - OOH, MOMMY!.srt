1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Uh, we were talking about worldwide gay marriage, right?

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,560
I don't know, because it's Friday now. It'll be Monday by the time this...

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,000
That's all right. I'm excited now. Travis!

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,240
What? The gay marriage is legal across

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,560
the country. What are you doing?

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,440
I've only been up for like 10 minutes. Have you been on Facebook or social media

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,280
or anything? No.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
All right, this will be us breaking the news to Travis.

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,520
Well, can we just use this? Yes.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,800
Yeah, okay. Okay.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,440
Welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm Griffin McElroy. Travis, I can't imagine what a pleasant

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,720
surprise is. TGIF, gay marriage, is now mandatory worldwide.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,960
We did it. Okay, that's not accurate.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
On trends like these, I called it. I said that this would happen and it

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
would be the most successful Pride month ever.

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,200
I would say I made gay marriage legal. Well, I'm not sure that's accurate.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
You and the five cool members of the Supreme Court...

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
Who know how to hang. Who know exactly how to hang.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
The other four, I don't think they've ever even...

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't think they know the definition of the word to hang.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
It's two words. We can all agree they are L7 weenies.

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
But now they got to be cool because guess what?

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,120
They got to all get gay married to each other. Luckily, there's four of them.

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,080
And so there's a nice pairing off there, two and two.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Considering according... As far as I can tell, this show is also,

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
in addition to a bad advice show, is the Travis McElroy News Minute.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,120
Maybe we shouldn't goof about what is actually happening on Earth

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
because I think Travis might walk away.

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,840
We may never get another chance to update him on this situation.

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
Listen, if it's not on BuzzFeed, I don't know about it.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,320
It's got to be on BuzzFeed. God damn to you, it's on BuzzFeed.

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
It's all of BuzzFeed. Guaranteed.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
BuzzFeed.geocities.

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,080
Kids react to gay marriage becoming the law of the land.

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,600
Uh, so gay marriage...

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,520
Hot button issue.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,880
It's not even a hot button issue anymore. It's just like, yes.

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,800
It's just like, yeah, of course. It's like, of course.

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
That's what this... Did you guys read the majority declaration?

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,440
That's what they call it in the court cases that the five of them wrote.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
It's just like, yeah. And the dissenting opinion was all like,

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,960
I don't know, it should be left up to the state

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,640
because the way I interpret the 14th...

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,080
And the majority is just like, dudes, yes.

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Travis?

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes?

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,000
I just went to BuzzFeed on a whim.

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
The front page of BuzzFeed is the gayest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,800
Oh, okay. Yeah, there it all is.

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,640
Okay, good.

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,480
I'm so happy. This is great news to wake up to.

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
Yeah, I can imagine. God, if only every morning we could wake up

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
and it's like, well, now I'm going to say a thing.

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,040
This is the Griffin McElroy false equivalence hour.

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Do you guys feel like because you are...

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
Well, Griffin, you're two hours ahead.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
And Justin, you're three hours ahead of me.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
That it's a little bit like early edition.

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,840
And you walked out to your front door-

66
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
The Kyle Chandler psychic cat show?

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah, the cat's sitting on the newspaper.

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
He shoots the cat away in the front page story.

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,200
He's like, gay marriage is totally illegal.

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,520
And you're like, I have to kill Travis in the past.

71
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,160
I am, by the way, my hot new thing, I am deeply into people

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
saying they're moving to Canada.

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,200
One slight issue.

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,920
One slight issue, which you may have heard about

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,080
in the past decade, literally, literally decade.

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,840
Listen, we've said a lot.

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,800
We don't have a lot of jokes.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
No, we're just shooting for the hip.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
It's literally, it's breaking news.

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
It's Friday, we're recording this.

81
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm like stoked.

82
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,680
And we're just so excited to get to break the news

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
to Travis that he has to marry a guy.

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm so excited.

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,720
Teresa will be devastated, but she'll get to marry a woman.

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,400
So like, good for everybody.

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
It's the easy out she's been waiting for.

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,240
Thanks, Uncle Sam.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600
So that's excellent.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,120
I don't know, I'm pretty happy about that.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
Let's do like a, let's do like our advice show.

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
Hey, let's do an earnest ass episode this week.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,560
What do you say?

94
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Earnest from the hip, you know what I mean?

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
That's where I keep my earnestness, in my earnestness gun.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
Well, good, because I think the first question is somebody

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
will really be able to help with our earnestness and our answers

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
and our emotions.

99
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
The other night, I got quite intoxicated

100
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
during my ride home in an Uber.

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
No drinking and driving for me.

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,440
What do you want to meddle?

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,160
Yeah, great.

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Cool, cool job, Law Follower.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,640
Excellent.

106
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,600
So we gotta do two parades today.

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,360
One for gay people getting married

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,000
and one for you not fucking careening into a telephone pole.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
Okay, I ordered pizza from a prominent chain.

110
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,320
The only one open till 3 a.m., Dominio's.

111
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,000
Now I passed out when I got home in my drunken stupor.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,040
The driver tried to call me, but I was not waking up.

113
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,240
Now here's the problem.

114
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,880
I elected to pay cash online when I ordered,

115
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,040
so they couldn't charge me for either the pizza

116
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
or being an asshole feed.

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
What's my next move?

118
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,960
And how long do I have to wait

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
before drunkenly ordering from Domino's again?

120
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,200
It's from pizza perpetrator in Pittsburgh.

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,560
I like the phrase, what's my next move?

122
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,760
Checkmate, Dominio's.

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,760
The day is mine.

124
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,480
Why does Domino's let you choose the cash option

125
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
after midnight?

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
That's a good point.

127
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,040
That's actually a really good point, Travis.

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,680
They should be like, $11.59.

129
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
Okay, now it's credit cards only.

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
You should have to pay a security deposit.

131
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,480
Yeah, you should only be able to obtain contractual pizza

132
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,520
after midnight.

133
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,800
There should definitely be some sort of mortgage put in place,

134
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,840
scan your photo ID.

135
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,320
You gotta be careful because the Domino's app

136
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,200
is a sign of the coming future world

137
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
that we're all gonna live in, whether you like it or not.

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
The snow crash-esque world we're all gonna live in,

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
where pizza is the only food,

140
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,600
and the only way you can get it is through applications

141
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,600
that you access through your virtual reality biopod, right?

142
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
And if you get blacklisted,

143
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
you get blackballed by Dominio's,

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,160
guess what?

145
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
You don't eat anymore because that's it.

146
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,280
That's the only thing.

147
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,920
What are you gonna do?

148
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,600
Go outside and fight the cyber dogs?

149
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,080
No way.

150
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
Here's the horrifying thing no one tells you about those apps.

151
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,200
Pizza tracking works both ways.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,800
That's true.

153
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
It's now moving through your bowels.

154
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
Well, I'm saying they're tracking you like Steve failed to pay Domino's.

155
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,280
Spread the word.

156
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
I imagine you probably,

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,760
I would think everybody gets one of these, right?

158
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,400
Everybody gets one of these like crank calls,

159
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
whoa, wait a minute.

160
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,040
That's what you tell them.

161
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm sure they're still stewing about this in every Dominos in America.

162
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,240
So call any Dominos and say,

163
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
listen, I just wanted to apologize.

164
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,000
I heard on the deep web,

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I heard some rumors that I had been,

166
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
that I was being spoofed,

167
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,480
and someone tried to send a pizza to my house,

168
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
and I'm sorry, as you can tell, it was very late.

169
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,880
I had church in the morning.

170
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
I was already asleep,

171
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,960
and I am very sorry that you were pranked by that.

172
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,280
On a side related note,

173
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,880
do you still have that pizza somewhere?

174
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Because I feel like for my pain and suffering,

175
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,640
it's the least that you could do to set this right.

176
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you know whose fault this really is?

177
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,120
Obama's?

178
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,720
The Uber driver.

179
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
Oh yeah.

180
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
You wouldn't have gotten away with this shit in Lyft.

181
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
Lyft driver's your buddy.

182
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,400
Lyft driver would have been like,

183
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
hey, maybe just put the phone down.

184
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,160
Hey, this isn't a good idea right now.

185
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,680
It's 2.59.

186
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
They don't want to, oh, please don't.

187
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,760
It's a good thing you didn't bail on your Uber,

188
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,680
because those dudes will go ham.

189
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,960
Last time I was in New York,

190
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,400
I tried to hail an Uber,

191
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,680
and they were supposed to pull up at the hotel I was staying at,

192
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,520
and then I got a call from them,

193
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,520
and it was basically like the Riddler was calling me like,

194
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,680
fiddle dee dee, come find me.

195
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm in a parking garage that's green.

196
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,040
And I failed, and I got an angry call from him,

197
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
and that was the worst day of my life.

198
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
That has happened to me a couple of times with Uber.

199
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,160
Like, come get me.

200
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
You have GPS.

201
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
I've given you tracking abilities.

202
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,480
Like, come get me.

203
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,520
The game is on.

204
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
The most dangerous game.

205
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,560
Can you find my black sedan?

206
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,720
It's a Nissan Altima.

207
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,080
Or is it?

208
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,160
It's my wife's.

209
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
Find, in this word jumble,

210
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
you will find the make and model of my car.

211
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,640
But you'll never find me.

212
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
You'll never find me. I'm in a plane.

213
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,320
Would, could you, I mean,

214
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
the thing about Domino's is it's a machine.

215
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
You, it's a, it's a machine,

216
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
and any effort you make to try to rectify the situation,

217
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,600
like, is only gonna come up the works more.

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
You cannot expect to be able to call and say,

219
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
hey, listen, can you get me on the phone

220
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
with whoever was working at 2 a.m. last Friday?

221
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,280
I need to, I need to set something right.

222
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,960
They're gonna, they're gonna think you're a creep.

223
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,680
I mean, life is all about giving yourself little gifts, right?

224
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
That's that Twin Peaks style of living, right?

225
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
You do something nice for yourself every day.

226
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,440
Just one little nice thing for yourself every day.

227
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
And this was your nice thing to yourself every day,

228
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
and this particular night that you didn't give yourself diarrhea.

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,840
And to waste someone else's 20 minutes.

230
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,360
So that was pretty nice of you.

231
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
Well, I'm trying to run the math on this.

232
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,400
Like, who is hurting?

233
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,080
I don't care about hurting Domino's.

234
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,360
They're, they're, they're a multi-billion dollar corporation.

235
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
They can handle that.

236
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,200
They can handle it.

237
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm, I'm a little worried about the driver.

238
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
He's getting paid an hourly rate.

239
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,440
He was obviously cheated out of his tip.

240
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
But like, realistically, he was probably doing a lot of deliveries.

241
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,120
Yeah.

242
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
So you couldn't have cost him more than like 10 minutes

243
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,400
driving out of his way and ran out the door and finding.

244
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,720
But also, Justin, delivery drivers usually pay for their own gas.

245
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,240
That's what like delivery charge and tips cover.

246
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm not saying it's a victimless crime, Travis.

247
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm just trying to mitigate how guilty he should feel.

248
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
Well, well, I'll say this.

249
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,840
Domino's actually, I've got some insider.

250
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,800
My dad's on the board of directors of Domino's.

251
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
My dad, my secret dad that you two don't have.

252
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,560
And they're actually in a perpetual state of being one pizza away from bankruptcy.

253
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,920
Just one.

254
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,000
If one pizza situation does not go down as intended, that's it for them.

255
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,280
Maybe he'll come in tomorrow and pay for it.

256
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,640
That'll never happen, sir.

257
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,400
Gentlemen, it's been an honor.

258
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,800
The band starts playing like the fiddlers, like I'm going down with the Domino's.

259
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,120
Hello, is this Papa John?

260
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,520
You have fought a good fright, old friend.

261
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,400
And I fear this is where we part ways.

262
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,360
If you'd like to buy, well, you can just send over some of your boxes

263
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
and we'll put them in your boxes.

264
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,840
We've got a few in the oven right now.

265
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,920
Well, I'm not sure if you want those two.

266
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

267
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,840
Sure, yeah.

268
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,680
This Yahoo was sent in by level 9000.

269
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,520
Yahoo Drew, Drew Davenport.

270
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,000
Thank you, Drew.

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marlene who asks,

272
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,680
why do big beautiful men love putting so much seasonings on their food?

273
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
Big beautiful men.

274
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,920
Why do big beautiful men love putting so much seasonings on their food?

275
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
Why do BBMs put the season, okay, got it.

276
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,280
Speaking as a BBM, I can say that a lot of time the zest has,

277
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,000
it takes it a while to permeate my various layers.

278
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,640
What do you mean?

279
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,680
Describe it.

280
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,240
A zest enough for a regular sized person.

281
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
There's enough zest on here for a regular sized person to keep them,

282
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,240
keep their motor running.

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,840
I have not gotten to be a big beautiful man by eating bland, flavorless food, right?

284
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,480
I've eaten a lot of different food with a lot of different flavors.

285
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,040
So as a BBM, I need that next level.

286
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
And a lot of times the other thing about it,

287
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
this is one of the big facets of it.

288
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
Really pulling the curtain back, Justin.

289
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,280
Yeah, I'm part in the kimono today.

290
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,880
One of the other things about it,

291
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,520
which is my least favorite idiom on the planet.

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
One of the other things about it is that a lot of times as a BBM,

293
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
you have to eat when you're not hungry.

294
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
Because maybe you're bored or sad.

295
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,720
So how do you spice that up literally

296
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,600
and help get all the calorie junk down your gullet space?

297
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,880
Well, good news.

298
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,840
There's zest.

299
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,240
If something's a little salty or spicy,

300
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,800
sometimes it can help you forget that you don't need it.

301
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
I remember one time you cooked me up a ham hock

302
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,560
and I tried to eat it and it burned my mouth.

303
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
Not from the temperature of it,

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,440
but there was just so much like Parmesan and oregano on it

305
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
and my mouth couldn't even comprehend the flavors.

306
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
I hadn't developed the brain mass needed

307
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,960
to take those flavors, separate them out mentally,

308
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,600
and experience them all in these individual compartments.

309
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,080
Justin, if I may ask, when we talk about BBM zest,

311
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,240
are we talking like a Lowry seasoning salt

312
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,480
or like an Italian seasoning

313
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,640
or some kind of just like a dry rub sprinkled onto a food

314
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,000
after it's finished cooking?

315
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,960
That's kind of for commoners.

316
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,480
Usually what I'll do is just use a grater on a salt lick

317
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
or maybe just throw some gunpowder on there.

318
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
That's some next level flavor technology.

319
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
Yeah, it really, yeah.

320
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,360
You do what you have to keep yourself

321
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,640
in the heavyweight class, you know?

322
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,440
So what's next?

323
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,920
What's next?

324
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,280
Like pencil shavings?

325
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,360
Yeah, pencil shavings are great because free fiber, right?

326
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,080
Yeah.

327
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,000
And that's what a lot of people are gonna go to that first.

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,800
You know what scares me, what keeps me up at night,

329
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
that I'm worried the only flavor that's extreme enough for me

330
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,160
that like I will be able to really get something out of

331
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,240
is one, meteorite dust, two, ground up dodo bones.

332
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,240
And that second one is problematic.

333
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,480
Sure.

334
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,360
That's obviously gonna be a big part of my day.

335
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,200
So I've got to lean towards meteorite dust.

336
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,720
Let me ask you a question.

337
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,600
Does umami even do anything for you anymore?

338
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
When was the last time you experienced

339
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
a good true umami flavor?

340
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
The last time I experienced umami

341
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,080
was before the idea of umami was invented.

342
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
So I didn't even know what I was just like.

343
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
Right now in my 34 year old mind,

344
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,720
savory is like a dream I invented.

345
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
You can't put enough savory on something

346
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
for me to taste it anymore.

347
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,400
I feel that.

348
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,720
Justin, could we use modern day technology

349
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,080
to like 3D print some kind of zest

350
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,480
that would really do it for you?

351
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
Some kind of new zest?

352
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,560
Yeah.

353
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
That like cutting edge Jurassic World shit

354
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
where we mix in a bunch of different zest

355
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
and also some cuttlefish.

356
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,120
We end up with like the zest of the zest, right?

357
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,520
Like this is the zest you put on zest

358
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,040
to make zest more flavorful.

359
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,000
And here's what we'll call it.

360
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,720
You guys ready for this?

361
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
This is a new flavor variant, right?

362
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,720
You got your bitter, you got your sweet,

363
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,080
your sour, this is a new thing altogether.

364
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,040
And this hyper powerful zest taste

365
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,480
is gonna be called umami.

366
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,080
Oh no, wait, I said it wrong.

367
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,360
Umami.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
And that's what you'll say every time

369
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,800
you put it on like a pizza crust.

370
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
The sixth flavor.

371
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,840
The seventh, it's the seventh flavor.

372
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,240
Oh, umami.

373
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,600
Umami.

374
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,160
Yeah.

375
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,040
That's what they're creating

376
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,400
with the Large Hadron Collider.

377
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,640
As soon as that thing shuts off,

378
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
they're gonna go over there

379
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,680
with a Hoover and a salt shaker

380
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,800
and they're just gonna suck it up

381
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
and be like, okay, we got enough here

382
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,920
to make one dinner taste good for the J-Man.

383
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,080
Gotta shit this FedEx Double Express.

384
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,920
They're firing a fun-sized packet

385
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,520
of sour Skittles at a BW3's Inferno level Buffalo wing.

386
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,800
And when they collide in the middle,

387
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,160
oh, umami.

388
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
That's what the scientists will say.

389
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
Do you mean eureka?

390
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,960
No, I'm doing a thing.

391
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,520
Leave me alone.

392
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,720
Leave me alone.

393
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I'm trying to get this thing.

394
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,280
My name is Daniel

395
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,960
and I'm the guy running the Large Hadron Collider

396
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,920
and I invent a new part of the flavor spectrum

397
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,400
that has not been discovered before.

398
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
That only Hummingbirds and BBMs can taste?

399
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,320
Yeah, only Hummingbirds and BBMs can taste

400
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,520
my new part of the flavor spectrum

401
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,000
that I discovered.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,800
There's no way I'm not trying to name it after myself.

403
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,240
There's no way I'm not gonna call like,

404
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,960
oh, this?

405
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,000
This is Daniel taste.

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,120
I'm getting a little bit of, is that black pepper?

407
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,600
Is that Daniel taste?

408
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
That is Daniel taste.

409
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,560
That'll be the subtitle of the flavor.

410
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,600
It's umami.

411
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,560
The Daniel taste.

412
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,200
And it'll be as bitter as Swiss chard

413
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,040
and a trillion Scoville units.

414
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,960
Ah, my mouth burns, but it's so sweet.

415
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm dead now from Daniel taste.

416
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,040
Oh, my mouth is puckering, but it's on fire.

417
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,000
What the hell?

418
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,120
What is going on?

419
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
Daniel's the only one who can taste it

420
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
without going immediately completely insane.

421
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,600
But you know what?

422
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
It's on a nice ham hock, it's worth it.

423
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,400
Oh, for sure.

424
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
What do you do about a friend who won't

425
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,600
stop recommending TV shows to you?

426
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
It's not a situation where she suggests things

427
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
she thinks are good and leaves it up to me.

428
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
She's constantly checking in to make sure

429
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,800
I've watched a particular show she thinks I'd like

430
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,760
because it has a character of my race or sexuality.

431
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Woof.

432
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,560
Her current favorite is My Mad Fat Diary,

433
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,640
which quote reminds her of me.

434
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,800
How do I tell her that I'm just not interested

435
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,280
and her pestering is getting annoying?

436
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
That's from your mad fat friend.

437
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,920
Are you throwing friend around liberally here?

438
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,320
Yeah, that's a loose use of the word friend.

439
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,040
Oh, it's a real show.

440
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,400
What happens on this?

441
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
Give me a little context.

442
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,600
What happens on My Mad Fat Diary?

443
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,880
Set in Stamford, Lincolnshire in the mid 1990s,

444
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,920
My Mad Fat Diary follows the story of a 16 year old,

445
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,240
16 stone girl, Ray Earl.

446
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,400
She's made out of 16 stones?

447
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,800
She's like a rock monster?

448
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,520
Griffin, that's how people weigh themselves in the UK.

449
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah, it's 224 pounds, Griffin.

450
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,120
Because that's how much all stones weigh there.

451
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
They've got the most uniform stones.

452
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,360
So the math on that 16 times 14 is this woman weighs 1200 pounds.

453
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,000
No, that's not accurate.

454
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
What a weird metric to recommend.

455
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,800
I guess I'm not really getting the full experience of this

456
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,080
because I'm a white straight dude.

457
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
And so people are like, dude, you got to see the shows.

458
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,680
24 friends, like all of them, man.

459
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
All the shows, you're going to love them.

460
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,200
Watch basically any show besides The L Word.

461
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
Just watch any show.

462
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,520
Dude, have you seen Castle?

463
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,720
He has a great joke about that,

464
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,400
where he talks about people talking to him

465
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
about Slumdog Millionaire.

466
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,960
And he's like, what's it like to be white?

467
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
He was like, Mad Men, that's us.

468
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,240
It must be so great.

469
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,400
I feel like I'm watching all the TV shows already.

470
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
I got my Master Chef.

471
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,960
I've got my Dancing with the Stars,

472
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
or not my Dancing with the Stars,

473
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
my So You Think You Can Dance with the Stars.

474
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,000
You Think You're Hot Shit.

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,080
Hey, I've got You Think You're Hot Shit, huh?

476
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,360
Dance with These Stars.

477
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,240
Hey, tough guy.

478
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,080
You think you can dance?

479
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,960
Go fuck yourself.

480
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
Hey, you clumsy piece of shit.

481
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,160
Get on that dance floor and humiliate yourself.

482
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200
You think you can dance?

483
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,800
I never said that.

484
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,520
Oh yeah?

485
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
Well, get out there and do it.

486
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,800
No, I never claimed I could dance.

487
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,080
That's the show I want to be on.

488
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,680
I never claimed I could dance.

489
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,280
Why are you making me do this?

490
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
Please, God, just let me sit down.

491
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,680
Can you just say to her, like when she's like,

492
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,640
you got to check out this show, be like, nah, you know, no.

493
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
Well, I already watched enough shows.

494
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
I have another thing, Travis.

495
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
It's basically like that, but the opposite.

496
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,320
Okay.

497
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Just say you did and then see how long-

498
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
What if she quizzes you?

499
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,240
So what?

500
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,680
Tell me what happened in minute 15 of episode four.

501
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,560
I think it would be a fun game for yourself to keep things fresh

502
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,720
to just see how long you could feign that you had watched this show.

503
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
And then never admit that you're lying.

504
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,840
Yeah, right.

505
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,680
Never, ever admit to-

506
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,360
Just say you must've seen a different edit

507
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,800
or like you watched some deleted features on the web.

508
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,640
Extended scenes.

509
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,880
Are you sure we're talking about the same show

510
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
and let your friend continuously try to be like,

511
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,400
yeah, the one with the girl, she weighs like 16 stone.

512
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,240
Yeah, no, I know.

513
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
And then like she has the invisible friend.

514
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,360
No, no.

515
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,120
She lives in a small town.

516
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,400
Yeah, no, I know.

517
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
And she rides like the big pink motor scooter

518
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
that's like bigger than any other scooter in town, right?

519
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,000
Like, no.

520
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
Okay, I see what happened here.

521
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,240
I see, I used some codes I found inside

522
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,200
some specially marked containers of Snapple

523
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
to get some exclusive scenes and some exclusive wallpapers

524
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,160
that I downloaded for true fans.

525
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,520
For my Motorola Razr.

526
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
They're Razr wallpapers.

527
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
So maybe you were like,

528
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,360
are you exchanging the Snapple points to get all the bonuses?

529
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,200
Oh, I thought you said you liked the show.

530
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, yeah, I thought you were really into it.

531
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,320
You should not only do this,

532
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,360
you should then lie about your experience

533
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
watching My Big Fat So-Called Life

534
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:13,840
and then make a fan site based on your take on the show.

535
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
So you have some like evidence to direct you to,

536
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,600
like this is where the true fans hang

537
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
and see how long you can keep that delusion going.

538
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
That's your own show.

539
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
You just catfished.

540
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
Then if they want you to watch Catfish,

541
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
now you got another problem.

542
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
Oh, I just have a little box at the bottom

543
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
where she can submit her Snapple points.

544
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
But instead of having a counter

545
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
of how many more Snapple points she needs,

546
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,480
just have it every time say almost there

547
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
and then see if you can get your friend

548
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,200
to blow all of her money on Snapple.

549
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,520
Which is funny because it's good for you,

550
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
but it's also good for Snapple

551
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
because I think they need it.

552
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,120
Yeah, and good for them

553
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
because that shit's just basically a vitamin slurry.

554
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,200
I need you to go out and get on the internet

555
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,520
and memorize the names of like 10 super obscure

556
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,680
anime television series.

557
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,720
And then every time she's like,

558
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,520
let me hit you with this,

559
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
my big fat Greek TV show.

560
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
You say, that's interesting.

561
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,840
Now, as is part of our arrangement,

562
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,280
I have a deep web anime recommendation for you.

563
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,600
You could suggest to her that she watch movies

564
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,080
that are impossible to be,

565
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,600
that you can't find.

566
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Like Home Alone 6?

567
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,320
Like lost films.

568
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm talking like, yeah, I would love to watch that.

569
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Will you hit me back once you've watched

570
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,560
the Jitterbug scene from Wizard of Oz

571
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,640
and they'll never find it.

572
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,600
And that way you like,

573
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
then you have something to hold over their head.

574
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,480
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

575
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,840
Please.

576
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,560
Here's the Yahoo.

577
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm gonna drop on all y'all.

578
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,960
And it's by, it was sent in by,

579
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,720
recognize the game of Rachel Sperling.

580
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,080
Take a moment.

581
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user Drew.

582
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,960
So I don't know if maybe

583
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,200
there's some crossover effort happening here.

584
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,360
Drew asks, is it bad to eat only five Cheetos a day?

585
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,560
I've been eating extremely healthy for a while

586
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,000
and my body is starting to look pretty damn good.

587
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,360
So would eating only five hot Cheetos a day

588
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
affect anything that much?

589
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,960
Or is the quantity so low,

590
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,640
it would barely do anything at all?

591
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,360
Now, I am assuming this person means

592
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,160
they are not eating more than five Cheetos a day

593
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,760
and not that their entire,

594
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,280
they are subsisting completely on a quintet of Cheetos.

595
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,840
Gotcha.

596
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,080
That's how I read the title at first.

597
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
You just have two Cheetos for breakfast,

598
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,400
two for lunch,

599
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
and then a sensible dinner of one Cheeto.

600
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
Well, you don't wanna have bad dreams.

601
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
How many calories you guys think are in a Cheeto?

602
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,000
I mean, it depends, right?

603
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,480
Like they're not pressed.

604
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,160
You know, they're not stamped out.

605
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,440
There's variation.

606
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
If you had to guess.

607
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,640
I would say about 80 calories per Cheeto.

608
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
Yeah, that sounds right.

609
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,640
I would say like half a stone of calories.

610
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,000
Half a stone of calories.

611
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
Is it bad to eat only five though?

612
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,360
I mean, God, God, the restraint on this person,

613
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,120
the self-control on this person.

614
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,080
Do you think they have a special doctor

615
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,360
that comes to their house

616
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
and like gives them their prescription every day?

617
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,880
Because if you have a bag there,

618
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,520
five Cheetos is gonna turn into five score Cheetos.

619
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,000
Five Cheetos.

620
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,720
Nobody's ever,

621
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,520
did you guys know that nobody's ever closed a bag of Cheetos?

622
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,480
This is actually true.

623
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,000
People either empty the bag and then tilt it up

624
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,080
and get all that good, good stuff.

625
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,320
Or they leave it open.

626
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
They're like, oh, never again.

627
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,920
They're just gonna get crunchier.

628
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,040
Yeah, I think that the problem becomes

629
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,400
eventually your routine will grow so ingrained

630
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
that if you ever only eat four Cheetos

631
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,040
or accidentally eat six, you'll die.

632
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,960
Oh no.

633
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
Because you'll achieve a perfect balance

634
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
in this human machine.

635
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,760
And then eventually if your body's like,

636
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,280
wait, there was only four Cheetos,

637
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,120
it'll go into basically like septic shock and you'll die.

638
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,760
Yeah.

639
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,680
Now I'm not a doctor, mind you,

640
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,320
but I have had a lot of experience with Cheetos.

641
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,160
I mean, they warn you right up front

642
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,440
that they're dangerously cheesy.

643
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,080
Dangerous.

644
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,800
Dangerously cheesy.

645
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,000
It also says in the package

646
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,240
that if you eat exactly five of them every day,

647
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,160
it's the equivalent of the limitless pill.

648
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,000
And you'll be able to think super good

649
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,080
and you'll be able to get a big bank job.

650
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,960
But the government's gonna come after you.

651
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
I have not seen the movie Limitless.

652
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,920
That's basically what happens.

653
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,120
He eats some Cheetos and it makes him really efficient.

654
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
And that's why it's a fantasy movie.

655
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,960
It would make you efficient, wouldn't it?

656
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,680
These beautiful waypoints throughout your day,

657
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,800
these beautiful check markers, these checkpoints.

658
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,160
Ooh boy, almost time for my 10 a.m. Cheeto.

659
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,240
I better get some work done so I can really earn it.

660
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,200
You've just turned this whole thing around for me, Griffin.

661
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Cause I assumed it was like handful five Cheetos,

662
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,920
flip them in and like, oh, that was my like midday snack.

663
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,200
You're saying parse it out throughout the day

664
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,920
or maybe reward yourselves for little achievements.

665
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,000
Like took the garbage out, Cheeto.

666
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,120
Like finished that term paper I was working on, Cheeto.

667
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,920
Like to set them up as goalposts throughout the day.

668
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,040
Now we're onto something.

669
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,240
I can get behind this.

670
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,880
But then some days you just have shithead days

671
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,040
where you just sit around and play Destiny all day

672
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,720
and you realize that, oh, it's 9 p.m.

673
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
I didn't do anything.

674
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,400
Better just slam these five Cheetos.

675
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,680
Pomp, pomp, pomp, pomp, pomp.

676
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,720
But then that's awesome

677
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,240
cause you just ate a bunch of Cheetos.

678
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,960
What am I talking about?

679
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,360
And then you reward yourself with more Cheetos.

680
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,200
No, God, no, no.

681
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,920
Oh, you'll die.

682
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,400
That's right.

683
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,920
Did you guys know that in Japan

684
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,680
there are Mountain Dew flavored Cheetos?

685
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,180
Yeah.

686
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,880
Why is Japan allowed to out America, America?

687
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,120
Like, aren't they worried about infringing

688
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,840
on our national copyright of being the worst?

689
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,720
That's kind of her thing.

690
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,120
Yeah.

691
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,800
I mean, it's less than being the worst

692
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,880
and more about like, I mean, the true Japanese style

693
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,960
is like recognizes the possibility of food mashups.

694
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,000
Like them pumpkin pie Kit Kats I ate all of.

695
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,280
I was gonna bring them home for folks

696
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,880
but then I was on the plane and I didn't just eat five.

697
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
I ate maybe 30.

698
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,520
The website, I went to find a picture of these

699
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
cause I wanted to make sure I wasn't talking out of my ass

700
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,240
before I said I was pretty sure existed.

701
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,800
But there's a paragraph in the story I'm reading.

702
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,080
It says, the move is probably not a huge surprise

703
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
as Frito-Lay is the same company

704
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,720
that introduced Pepsi flavored Cheetos last year.

705
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:38,960
What?

706
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,320
Do you know how fucked your world you have?

707
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,080
Do you know how like, how like numb to the wonder

708
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,400
of God's creation you have to be

709
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,800
for you to see Mountain Dew flavored Cheetos

710
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,200
and think, well, you know, it was bound to happen eventually.

711
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,760
What?

712
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,240
Oh, honey.

713
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,120
Are you sure?

714
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,000
Right here in the times, they done did it again.

715
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,360
Law of large numbers.

716
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,440
You get infinity monkeys on infinity typewriters.

717
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,880
One was going to type out the whole works

718
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
of William Shakespeare.

719
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,240
We are the monkeys and the Shakespeare

720
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,280
is a Mountain Dew Cheeto.

721
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,640
Eventually we were going to do it.

722
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, of course, somewhere in the universe

723
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,320
someone's making Mountain Dew Cheetos.

724
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,840
Of course, why not here?

725
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,720
Why not us?

726
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,400
I want Cheeto flavored Mountain Dew.

727
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,360
Ooh, I mean, there is some kind of Cheeto beverage.

728
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,880
Listen, listen, we've all said a lot of shit

729
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,520
in the past few minutes, but Justin,

730
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,720
how good would those Mountain Dew Cheetos be crumbled up

731
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,800
and put on like some tilapia or something like that?

732
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,320
That's an umami flavor I bet you can get into.

733
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,760
Umami, a Daniel taste.

734
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,640
It's sour, it's sweet, it's mud like.

735
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
What is mud's flavor?

736
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Because it has it.

737
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,280
Umami, a Daniel taste brand taste.

738
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,680
See, he founded the Daniel taste corporation

739
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,600
thinking that he would invent other tastes.

740
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah.

741
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
He flew too close to the sun though.

742
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,960
Oh, it's lightning in a bottle.

743
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,400
He's a one zest wonder.

744
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,600
I just had a great idea

745
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,400
and I'm going to throw out this money making idea.

746
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
You guys tell me if you want to invest.

747
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,560
You know, Lichamade?

748
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,160
Yeah.

749
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,120
Instead of sugar dust, it's just Cheeto dust in a bag.

750
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,920
And then you have like maybe a pretzel stick

751
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,280
or something that you dip in.

752
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,480
I have something that might also work for that, Travis.

753
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,800
What's that?

754
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,520
Pretzel sticks.

755
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Um, Cheetos?

756
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,560
Well, yes, Justin.

757
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,200
But like, if you don't dare to dream,

758
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
then like why even wake up in the morning

759
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,400
and reward yourself with five Cheetos?

760
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,560
Um, I have something else that you could dunk into it.

761
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:30,880
Uh-huh.

762
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,720
It's a key to a prison cell

763
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,640
that you would be locked inside if you did this thing.

764
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
Either created it or consumed it.

765
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,280
There's a prison cell and it's deep in a mountain

766
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,360
and no one's ever going to hear from you ever again.

767
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,200
And that's where we will put you.

768
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,880
I will say though that if you did do the original Travis plan

769
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,280
of dipping pretzels with Cheeto dust,

770
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,560
uh, the, the, uh, pretzel post snack

771
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,800
after you've eaten all the Cheeto dust,

772
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,720
the, the sloppy, slimy Wetzel, if you will,

773
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,760
uh, would become the world's new number one leader,

774
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,120
uh, uh, for thing that no,

775
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,240
like the worst thing you could possibly eat.

776
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,120
Mm-hmm.

777
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,960
Narrowly edging out previous champion, a live sparrow.

778
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Oh man, this is going to be the episode

779
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,080
that makes me stop eating food.

780
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,000
I don't have it eventually.

781
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,720
Let's go to the money zone.

782
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,800
Me undies is dedicated to offering

783
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,200
the most comfortable underwear on the planet.

784
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm wearing them right now and they are changing my butt life.

785
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,720
And they're not just for guys.

786
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Even though I'm a guy, they're not just for guys.

787
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,960
They got a new collection, uh, called all of me.

788
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,280
It's a women's collection and it's a four piece line of undies

789
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,600
designed specifically for the, uh, confusing angles

790
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,440
and curves of the female form.

791
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,720
Uh, uh, and the MC Escher like angles of a woman's body,

792
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,680
the imperceptible warping of gone on in the contouring

793
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,040
of the female form, the grain of the female form.

794
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I've been doing a lot of whittling.

795
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
I, you can get 20% off of me undies,

796
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,240
which really are fantastic.

797
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,200
Uh, you can get a hundred percent off of me undies.

798
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
You, you would pay twice as much for

799
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,800
comfortable underwear of this quality,

800
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,680
but you're not going to do that.

801
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,640
Cause you know us, you can get 20% off of the already

802
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,160
very reasonable me undies price by going to me undies.com

803
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:51,280
slash my brother that's M E undies.com slash my brother.

804
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,600
I wish I could take 20% off of my me undies

805
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,680
and make a little window for my nuts.

806
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,720
Wait, not your dick.

807
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,680
Just your nuts.

808
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,240
Don't, can we not, it's funny if you say nuts one time,

809
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,400
if you say it a lot, then we'd start to sound like a,

810
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,200
like Limp Bizkit.

811
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,280
Good jerky boys CD.

812
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,320
We have another sponsor speaking of nuts.

813
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,600
And jerky.

814
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,560
And Belgian waffles.

815
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,160
Uh, this next sponsor is Nature Box.

816
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,120
You know them, you love them.

817
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,520
You eat them, you snack on them and you chew on them

818
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,800
and you swallow them and they make you strong

819
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,080
with all the nutrients in there.

820
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,840
They're made from all art, all artificial flavors.

821
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,880
Like ooh mommy.

822
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,640
They're made with zero artificial flavors.

823
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,480
The ooh mommy is, is totally all natural.

824
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,280
Found deep, deep in the Mariana trench,

825
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,080
buried in an alien pod, but it's real.

826
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,520
They don't have any colors or sweeteners,

827
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,480
zero grams trans fats and no high fructose corn syrup.

828
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
You can get snacks like mini Belgian waffles,

829
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,760
strawberry lemonade, fruit stars,

830
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
and sweet and salty nut medley.

831
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,120
All really, really tasty.

832
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,360
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother,

833
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,000
you can get a free trial box of their favorite snacks.

834
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,960
Again, that is naturebox.com slash my brother.

835
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,720
Get yourself a free box of snacks.

836
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,920
I got a message for Tori, who's the best big sister ever.

837
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,920
And it's from Bess, who's the totally kick ass little sister.

838
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,720
The message is this, message follows.

839
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,280
To the bestest, most smartest,

840
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,200
most beautiful as big sister ever.

841
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
This is me publicly apologizing for that time

842
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,560
I hit you in the face with a lightsaber.

843
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,520
Happy birthday.

844
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,960
I love you.

845
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,400
PS, I still think you should have blocked it.

846
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,040
That's it, yeah.

847
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,360
Yeah, I mean, Tori, I don't want to throw shade

848
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,880
because that's not our show

849
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,960
and we'll get into legal hot water,

850
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,360
but you probably should have blocked it.

851
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,200
Like when you saw it coming.

852
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,160
When the shit hits the fan and every day-

853
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,600
Or when the lightsaber hits the face.

854
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Every day in this country is basically gonna be like the purge,

855
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,000
except everyone's got lightsabers.

856
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,480
You're gonna need to know some skills.

857
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,480
You're gonna need to know how to riposte, how to parry, how to face dodge.

858
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,320
All of these techniques are very important

859
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,680
if you want to become a true Jedi Knight, young padawan.

860
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,040
It's me, it's me, Yoda.

861
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,480
I'm going to train you.

862
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,240
It's me, Yoda.

863
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,120
Train you, I will in the ways of my Jedi skills

864
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,040
in the corner of the grand.

865
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,640
Come to the grand ballroom and we shall dance

866
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,800
for that is the first lesson in Jedi sword battles.

867
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,320
Take up your life.

868
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
Is that Jared?

869
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,320
He's like a combination of Jared from Labyrinth,

870
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,080
Yoda and Emperor Palpatine.

871
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,000
You remind me of the Jedi, babe.

872
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,120
Young Luke Skywalker in his bassinet and with his sister.

873
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,480
I mean, you don't know about her yet, shit.

874
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,000
Anyway, take up thine sword as I blast you with my space magic.

875
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,640
Are we to assume, by the way, that when Beth says

876
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,520
that Tori is the most beautiful big sister ever,

877
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,000
she means other than the horrific instantly cauterized laser burn

878
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
across her face, right?

879
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,240
Other than that, of course.

880
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,440
Well, maybe it's dashing.

881
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,720
Oh, kind of like a roguish charm.

882
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,320
She got that roguish lightsaber.

883
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,280
A roguish third degree laser burn.

884
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
I have another message here for Bob Peterson

885
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,760
and it's from AJ Johnson who says, watch your fucking back.

886
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,800
Money well spent, AJ.

887
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,160
Well, maybe this is like AJ.

888
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,920
This is the new black spot.

889
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,840
Imagine my excitement that we finally have a my brother,

890
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,240
my brother and me bit that will be entered into evidence

891
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,360
in a court of law.

892
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,800
That's exciting for me.

893
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,520
There is no way on earth that there that hasn't existed yet.

894
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,640
We've told so many.

895
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,960
I mean, we've been sued hundreds of times,

896
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,240
despite our disclaimer at the beginning

897
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,280
of the television program.

898
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,320
Did I say television?

899
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
Cause it's not that it's a podcast.

900
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,320
We got that disclaimer there and we still get sued on the reg.

901
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
It's happening every day.

902
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,680
People, it started in episode one.

903
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,960
People were using too much shampoo

904
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,080
and burning their scalp off.

905
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,480
It's just people don't listen.

906
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,320
They don't listen.

907
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
They don't listen or they listen too much.

908
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,360
They listen too good.

909
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,400
Or they listen too much.

910
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,960
Yeah.

911
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,840
It's a real problem.

912
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,720
Hey, you like t-shirts, right?

913
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,320

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,200

919
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,480
I recently dodged some layoffs at the small town local newspaper.

920
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,800
Now I write and edit articles for a company

921
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,720
that organizes conferences for video games.

922
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,720
Wait, did you dodge them?

923
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,960
Did you dodge them or did you not dodge them?

924
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,520
I dodged them by quitting before they could fire me.

925
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,800
I think that's what they mean.

926
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,300
Yeah.

927
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,360
Okay, so either that or they were the only person not fired

928
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,760
and then went like, oh, cool, cool.

929
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,640
You can't fire me.

930
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,280
I quit.

931
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,600
We weren't like, we weren't going to fire you.

932
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
We fired Todd because he was being a dick.

933
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,520
This is not a wave of layoffs.

934
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,160
It's a bullet.

935
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,800
It's a ray.

936
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,400
It's a straight line of layoffs and it pierced through Jerry.

937
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,520
Because he's a dick.

938
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,200
This is clearly a Todd off.

939
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,560
This is not a layoff.

940
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
We got a Todd off, folks.

941
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,600
Let's go to the parking lot.

942
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,920
We're going to lay one Todd in the office.

943
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
We're going to sell this shit to dance.

944
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,440
So Todd, you just weren't Todd enough.

945
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,920
You just went out Todded.

946
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,040
Out Todd, out Todd, out Todd, survivor.

947
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,960
Todd, you've been voted off.

948
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,840
Wait, which Todd?

949
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,560
Wait, which one?

950
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,960
Sorry, Todd glasses.

951
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,200
Todd, T-A-W-D.

952
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,560
Todd, you're gone.

953
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,680
I out Todded and I out Todded, but I guess I just didn't out Todd.

954
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,120
And that's the one that really matters.

955
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,240
That's the one that you got to know.

956
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,880
Listen, if you're going to win the $600, you got to do the whole trifecta.

957
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,520
You're all, you are the sole Todd Viver.

958
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,480
I recently, okay.

959
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,640
So now I write and edit articles for a company that organizes conferences for video games.

960
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,880
Many of the people in the industry I email use emoticons and emoji liberally.

961
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,880
As a former newsprint copy editor, these confuse and frighten me.

962
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,040
Picture of poopy.

963
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,960
There's this could be a beehive.

964
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,960
What could be a beehive?

965
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Maybe it is a beehive on the floor.

966
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,000
Bees flying around it or might be flies.

967
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,520
Well, you guys use Macs.

968
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,560
I use the PC.

969
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't know what your resolution is.

970
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
It could be a beehive from where I'm sitting.

971
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:38,960
Okay.

972
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,000
I think it's poop though.

973
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,640
When should I use emojis and or emoticons in professional emails?

974
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,520
And this is from a picture of a cat in a picture of the American flag or cat in America.

975
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Ah, man, I really want to say never, but I don't feel like that's helpful.

976
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,520
I think it's all just comes down to like using the right emojis.

977
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,200
I feel like you get this more than you let on because in this email you said,

978
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,960
I'm a former newsprint copy editor.

979
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
These confuse and frighten me.

980
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,160
And then you took a break from writing the email to go take a huge shit.

981
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,880
And that's why you put in this beehive emoji.

982
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,600
Let me ask you, is this a matter of like level familiarity

983
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,680
or is there a like hierarchy of like if you are someone's boss, you can use emojis.

984
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,000
But if you're if you're like writing to your boss, you can't use emojis.

985
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,120
I don't think you should.

986
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,800
I've never used emojis.

987
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,240
Question.

988
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,320
Do you know how to use emojis?

989
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,200
Do you know how to inject them into your missives?

990
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,920
I don't.

991
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,000
If I'm on the computer, I don't know how to do that.

992
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,360
I know the teens love it on phones.

993
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,720
There's a whole keyboard for them.

994
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,600
I know that because my stupid fat thumb sometimes just brings up like ambulances,

995
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,800
just pictures of ambulances, I guess is why I got to communicate with now.

996
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,840
But you got to look through them.

997
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,920
That's always fra- I wish I could just say like Siri,

998
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
ambulance and just put an ambulance there.

999
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,080
I've been stabbed.

1000
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,640
Ambulance.

1001
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:13,040
I'm got the command Siri ambulance is probably most effective as a way to make an ambulance emoji.

1002
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,040
That is some that is some great prioritization on the Siri AI.

1003
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
I just like the written word a little too much.

1004
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,840
You know, if Dickens can't get the message across, Dickens, Dickens didn't use emojis.

1005
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,240
Hemingway didn't actually Hemingway loved emojis.

1006
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,600
I don't know if you guys knew that.

1007
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,960
Lot a lot of wine bottle emojis going around that lot of bulls then dead bulls.

1008
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,560
Yeah, a lot of flaccid penises.

1009
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,720
I was trying to think of a more artful way of saying it.

1010
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,320
But yes, Travis, flaccid penises.

1011
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,200
I mean, there's gaps in the English language that we have to correct sometimes.

1012
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,600
Like people from the South get a lot of static for using the word y'all.

1013
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,800
But what they're really trying to correct for is a lack of a differentiator in the

1014
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,240
plural form of you in the English language.

1015
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,760
So y'all was created and then it's a useful word to have.

1016
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,040
So I don't I think that emojis can sometimes help to fill a gap.

1017
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,840
But what are you communicating with them?

1018
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:13,280
I guess what I'm saying in 2015, what does using an emoji say about you?

1019
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,800
I tell you what else it's good for is it's kind of the international language, isn't it?

1020
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,400
Like it'll you can use this to speak with anybody anywhere in the world.

1021
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,560
And it's good for like the sort of concepts and terminology

1022
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,440
that like doesn't exist between two different cultures, right?

1023
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,840
Like if there's probably an emoji to sort of express the Japanese idea of being very,

1024
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,720
very hungry, but also you've just seen a ghost.

1025
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,080
And they have a they have a word for that.

1026
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,240
I'm having trouble recalling it.

1027
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,840
But we don't we don't have a word for you're very hungry, but you've just seen a ghost.

1028
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,880
But then you use the I think the word for is boo mommy.

1029
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,440
Jesus, please us.

1030
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,400
You made me so angry sometime.

1031
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,280
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

1032
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,360
Yes, sure.

1033
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,560
Let's try this one.

1034
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,160
It was sent in by Evan Jones Thorn.

1035
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,640
Thank you, Evan.

1036
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1037
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,360
No name.

1038
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,080
Something went wrong.

1039
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,620
Gar.

1040
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,520
Man, I almost said Garfield.

1041
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
I feel like I've used that one before for an anonymous one.

1042
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,360
Chelsea.

1043
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,360
Chelsea asks.

1044
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,040
Where is Wizard Hut?

1045
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,440
Where is Wizard Hut?

1046
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,680
I can't find it and I'm trying to find it on Fantage and I need to find it.

1047
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,160
Please.

1048
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,880
Where is?

1049
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,160
I can't find it.

1050
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,240
I can't find it and I'm trying to find it.

1051
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,960
Help me, please.

1052
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,160
I'm trapped in some kind of hellscape dimension.

1053
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,200
Please help.

1054
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,320
Where am I?

1055
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,240
Oh God, I miss my family.

1056
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,880
Where is Wizard Hut?

1057
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,400
Where is Wizard Hut?

1058
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,840
Wizard Hut.

1059
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,440
Is this a thing?

1060
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,960
Don't dodge the question.

1061
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,920
Where's the Wizard Hut?

1062
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,320
Read me the whole question one more time, Griffin.

1063
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,600
Where is Wizard Hut?

1064
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,440
There's four words.

1065
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,880
Uh-huh, but I feel like-

1066
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,680
And it's four words.

1067
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,760
Here's the core subject.

1068
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,800
Where is Wizard Hut?

1069
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,240
And then there's like 30 words of a person having a panic attack on the internet.

1070
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,000
Where is Wizard Hut?

1071
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,600
I feel like Chelsea said some kind of context in the sentence following,

1072
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,560
where is Wizard Hut?

1073
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,040
They're trying to find it on Fantage, which I don't like that.

1074
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,540
Fantage.

1075
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,200
Or Fantagé.

1076
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,840
Where is the Wizard Hut?

1077
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,200
Justin, you're being awfully quiet.

1078
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,480
Where are you keeping the Wizard Hut?

1079
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,080
Where's the Wizard Hut?

1080
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,000
Where's the Wizard Hut, Justin?

1081
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,640
Are you now or have you ever been a Wizard Hut?

1082
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,960
Anytime you see a Pizza Hut that's not a Pizza Hut anymore,

1083
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,080
it has become a Wizard Hut.

1084
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,480
They have an arrangement where when a Pizza Hut shuts down,

1085
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,680
which I don't think that has ever happened because man, do we love our pizza.

1086
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,280
But when one shuts down, they have to sell it to a wizard.

1087
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,560
They have actually had a sad string of Pizza Hut shutdowns

1088
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,840
in here in Huntington, where your big expansive Pizza Huts,

1089
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,200
where you can really go in and stretch your legs and soak in the fucking ambiance

1090
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,440
and maybe treat yourself to a lunch buffet if you want to eat to kill.

1091
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,880
You can't do that anymore.

1092
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,040
They shut down the one on Route 60 and they shut down the one on Fifth Avenue

1093
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,760
and they've conglomerated on one that is, I will be honest,

1094
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,280
brilliantly located a mere stone's throw,

1095
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:32,000
a mere 30 paces from the Fine Arts Department of Marshall University.

1096
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,160
So it's like they are definitely servicing their core demo.

1097
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,200
Yeah, I guess so.

1098
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,800
So the thing in this way, you guys have a surplus of wizards now.

1099
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,720
Don't think of it as every time God closes a Pizza Hut, he opens a Wizard Hut.

1100
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,200
That's the way you got to think of it.

1101
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,400
What is it about the Pizza Hut sort of building

1102
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,560
that makes it so ideal for wizard residents?

1103
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,920
It's the tall, pointy hat.

1104
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,120
I guess that's a good point.

1105
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,040
Yeah, the tall, pointy hat reminds me of their hats.

1106
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,880
Also, lots of space for owls.

1107
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,640
Also, sometimes they still have a Pac-Man.

1108
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,640
Specific to wizards, it's just...

1109
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,760
It's nice.

1110
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,320
Every Pizza Hut is built on the opening to another dimension.

1111
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,800
That's where the flavor comes from.

1112
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,360
Yeah, sure.

1113
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,560
That's where they summon.

1114
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,560
Ooh, Mommy 2, the Daniel sequel experience.

1115
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,160
Daniel's next hot jam.

1116
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,520
Ooh, Mommy 2.

1117
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,480
Ooh, Mommy 2.

1118
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,080
I would love to see a sequel to the hit film, Camp Nowhere,

1119
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,440
where the kids took over the summer camp

1120
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
because they lied to all their parents and guardians.

1121
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,600
Tell them Christopher Lloyd, they paid to be an adult.

1122
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,200
Christopher Lloyd, they paid to be an adult

1123
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,280
because that's who you would go to.

1124
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,200
We need an adult, but we can't find one just like walking around the street.

1125
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,160
Walking around the street, let's hire Christopher Lloyd, professional adult.

1126
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,800
Yes, they did hire Christopher Lloyd.

1127
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,760
I want that.

1128
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,360
But instead of kids taking over summer camp,

1129
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,400
they can go over to Pizza Hut and they can do all kinds of...

1130
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,240
Well, they would have to snatch it up pretty quickly

1131
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,120
to get in there before the wizard starts squatting.

1132
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,040
Wizard shows up and goes, I'm pretty sure this is mine now.

1133
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,560
No, we got Christopher Lloyd.

1134
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,200
Oh, sorry to have bothered you guys.

1135
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,960
This is still a Pizza Hut.

1136
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,360
Oh, yeah?

1137
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,600
Well, it looks like you've turned the Z's backwards

1138
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,840
and there's a lot of teen skateboarding in here.

1139
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,120
I would like a sequel to the film Heavyweights

1140
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,480
where they take over a Pizza Hut

1141
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,880
and the opening scene is just like, well, fuck.

1142
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,520
Not a closed Pizza Hut.

1143
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,560
Right, by takeover you mean they occupy militantly a Pizza Hut.

1144
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,200
Form their own sovereign nation.

1145
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,720
Just falling through the plate glass window.

1146
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,160
No, is it possible that there is a sequel to Camp Nowhere

1147
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,360
and it's called Accepted?

1148
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
Yeah, I mean, that is basically what that is.

1149
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,720
It's College Nowhere, Nowhere University.

1150
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,160
But listen, that was when we were all caught in Justin Long fever.

1151
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,320
We had to get him in as many pictures as we can.

1152
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,280
And I'm not complaining, that was a super great time for our nation.

1153
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,520
Yeah.

1154
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,960
I loved the complete works of Justin Long.

1155
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,600
The metanarrative of the Justin Long canon.

1156
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,040
It all happens in the same universe.

1157
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,320
Not a lot of people know that.

1158
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,560
But you can draw a direct line between all of his movies,

1159
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,760
starting at Galaxy Quest and ending at Accepted.

1160
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,600
Well, starting at Galaxy Quest

1161
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,320
and actually ending at Galaxy Quest too, it's a cycle.

1162
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,080
It's a circular narrative.

1163
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,240
It's weird that after his girlfriend got dragged to hell,

1164
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,400
he would feel like getting back on a spaceship, but-

1165
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,600
But Jeepers Creepers,

1166
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,520
he just wants to get out in the air to space, you know what I mean?

1167
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,000
All right, we've completely lost the plot.

1168
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,440
Guys, guys, guys, the two of you, listen to me.

1169
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,680
Listen, listen to me.

1170
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,480
Where is Wizard Hut?

1171
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
Well, I've just joined Fantage.

1172
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,560
I've created my own avatar and let me explore.

1173
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,680
Okay.

1174
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,680
Live, it's our first Let's Play.

1175
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,080
Okay.

1176
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,320
It's our new Let's Play series called Let's Dote,

1177
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,120
where Travis plays Fantage while we listen.

1178
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,240
Oh, they want money.

1179
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,840
Okay, I gotta get out of here.

1180
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,040
Pull the ripcord, get me out of here.

1181
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,360
Travis, I need you to pull the chat channel.

1182
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,640
Where is this Wizard Hut?

1183
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,080
We gotta, this is a-

1184
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,240
Good, but I'm trying, but everything's money.

1185
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:10,960
It's all money.

1186
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,280
It's all money all the way down.

1187
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,760
Oh God, I can't get out.

1188
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,320
I'm stuck in it like the slime in Ghostbusters 2.

1189
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,760
Leave me behind, cut the cord.

1190
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,280
I don't want to drag you guys in with me.

1191
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,880
Goodbye, Travis.

1192
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,760
I'll miss Travis.

1193
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,880
It's too bad we lost him in the Matrix, the Fantage Matrix.

1194
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:34,080
I am right now, I'm sending a Twitter message to Fantage fans,

1195
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,400
the official Twitter channel of Fantage,

1196
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,000
to see if I can get a resolution to this.

1197
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,920
Where is Wizard Hut, question mark, Huttgate?

1198
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,440
President Obama, President Obama,

1199
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,200
why aren't you answering the tough question?

1200
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,640
I'm now asking POTUS.

1201
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,200
When you're not with POTUS, Pat, go to SCOTUS.

1202
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,320
Where is Wizard Hut?

1203
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,160
SCOTUS, I think you just chill for a bit

1204
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,400
because they just changed the whole game.

1205
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,160
They're all just playing Fantage.

1206
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,960
They're all playing Fantage.

1207
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,560
SCOTUS blog, where is Wizard Hut?

1208
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,000
Okay, is there anybody else I should ask?

1209
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,640
Justin Long.

1210
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:13,520
Yep.

1211
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
Maybe he knows.

1212
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,960
I don't know his Twitter.

1213
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,840
Oh, it's Justin Long.

1214
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,960
Where is Wizard Hut?

1215
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,880
Is there anybody else I could ask?

1216
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,200
Do you know, do you guys have anybody who would know

1217
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,160
where the Wizard Hut is?

1218
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,240
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1219
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,040
Don't even worry about it.

1220
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,280
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

1221
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,520
I'll let you guys know if I get any responses.

1222
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,360
I'm also gonna look for people asking me

1223
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,440
if my account was hacked by the Fantage militia.

1224
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,800
Nothing yet, nothing right yet,

1225
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,160
but I will keep you guys updated.

1226
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,280
And we will stay on the line until we find the answer.

1227
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,240
Yes, the first one of those six people to respond to me,

1228
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,240
they will, I'll pass that along to you all.

1229
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,440
I'm not, I don't think it'll be POTUS first,

1230
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,280
but it might be.

1231
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,480
I feel like you may have wasted your time

1232
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,720
because DippinDots123 responded.

1233
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,920
Do you mean Wizard's Domain?

1234
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,200
Because if it's Wizard's Domain,

1235
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,640
it's in the forest over the bridge.

1236
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:16,800
Really?

1237
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,680
Yeah, so.

1238
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,160
Who respond, like what tweet did they, to me?

1239
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,040
Did they respond to me?

1240
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,800
No, no, in the Yahoo answer, this is like the best.

1241
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,920
Oh, I was gonna say,

1242
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,680
God, I don't wanna get on the fucking radar

1243
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,760
of the Fantage legions.

1244
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,440
In the forest over the bridge.

1245
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,560
God, we could have saved a lot of time

1246
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,760
if we just said that right up front.

1247
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,920
Man, I wish I just read down a little bit.

1248
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,400
Well, this has been another grand waste of time

1249
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,280
and we're sorry about it,

1250
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,480
but we're not sorry that you chose to spend this hour with us.

1251
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,760
It honestly means a lot to us.

1252
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,520
So thank you so much for that.

1253
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,720
And thank you to MeUndies,

00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,280

We have some big news, people.

1263
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,280
Speaking of great tasting healthy snacks.

1264
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,560
Some happy news.

1265
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,680
We are having, Jesus, you wanna take it?

1266
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,240
You go.

1267
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,440
No, well, I don't.

1268
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,080
You negotiated the contract fiercely.

1269
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,880
I guess I did.

1270
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,560
We're doing our first ever sponsored episode

1271
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,160
of my brother, my brother and me.

1272
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,000
You say sponsored episode,

1273
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,960
and people interpret that immediately,

1274
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,840
negatively, I feel like.

1275
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,520
This is gonna, it's a celebration.

1276
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,800
A celebration of cross promotional content.

1277
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
The synergy is palpable.

1278
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,240
Synergy of us connecting with the Totino's brand.

1279
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,200
So we're gonna do a bonus episode

1280
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,560
of my brother, my brother and me.

1281
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,040
You'll get it right here on this fine RSS channel,

1282
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,720
wherever fine podcasts are sold,

1283
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,120
where we're just gonna talk about Totino's.

1284
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,680
Do you need advice?

1285
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,720
Do you need Totino's advice?

1286
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,480
Either in terms of preparation,

1287
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
maybe somebody stole your Totino's.

1288
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,040
Maybe what's the proper Totino's dish

1289
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,200
to be served at various fancy events?

1290
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,160
That's a good thing.

1291
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,760
Maybe you're sitting Shiva.

1292
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,160
What do you prepare for that?

1293
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,640
I don't know.

1294
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,920
Have you had a great experience

1295
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,240
with the Totino's brand that you just wanna share?

1296
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,080
You let us know.

1297
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,680
It's as much your episode as it is ours.

1298
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,520
But it is 100, which is to say zero,

1299
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,440
because it's completely owned by Totino's.

1300
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,360
It is a Totino's episode.

1301
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,000
And do not send us any questions

1302
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,800
that are in the region of pizza

1303
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,880
without living exclusively in the country of Totino's.

1304
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,960
We are only talking about Totino's branded family of products.

1305
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,200
Live on the air, I'm gonna take every Totino's product

1306
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,000
and combine it into one cannonball of flavor,

1307
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,520
and I'm gonna consume all of that

1308
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,680
and give it a live review.

1309
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
It's gonna be a nonstop thrill ride.

1310
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,960
So if you send us an email

1311
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,440
about making your own pizza from scratch at home,

1312
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,280
I will delete your email account remotely.

1313
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,040
You're dead.

1314
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,360
You're dead to us, pizza-ly speaking.

1315
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,320
We want you to tweet,

1316
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,960
hashtag MBMBAM Totino's.

1317
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,240
You can email us with Totino's in the subject line.

1318
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,160
And whatever you do, please follow and tweet at Totino's.

1319
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,680
We're also doing some live shows,

1320
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,920
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle,

1321
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,800
bit.ly forward slash van MBMBAM.

1322
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,040
It's gonna be the last weekend in August.

1323
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,480
We're coming to the Pacific Northwest,

1324
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,960
and we would love, love, love to see you.

1325
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,320
Please come out to those shows

1326
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,600
because when you come out to any show,

1327
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,760
you're helping us to do more stuff and more shows

1328
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,600
and we really appreciate it.

1329
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,360
So please go to those two links,

1330
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,720
buy tickets to all those shows,

1331
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,400
come or don't come.

1332
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,440
At that point, I don't care.

1333
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,240
No, but please do.

1334
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,640
I mean, go ahead and come if you want,

1335
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
but just the main thing is to definitely buy it.

1336
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,140
Oh yeah.

1337
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,160
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1338
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,960
for the use of our theme song

1339
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,840
and it's a departure off the album,

1340
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,640
Putting the Days to Bed.

1341
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,120
Everyone owns that album at this point, right?

1342
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,240
Like everybody has it

1343
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,000
and it's like the best selling number one album

1344
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,560
in America and the UK, right?

1345
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,800
They distribute it like samples of tide.

1346
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,080
Right, like it's gotta be.

1347
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,440
Anyway, go get that album, it's great.

1348
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,720
I also wanna say I'm so glad it's back.

1349
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,480
Justin, been loving the new episodes,

1350
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,920
things I bought at Sheets,

1351
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,080
the hit video series on YouTube

1352
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,080
starring Justin and Dwight Slappy.

1353
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,600
So good, so good.

1354
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,040
At Sheets with a Z, by the way,

1355
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,400
if you're having trouble finding it.

1356
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,680
You got some merch now too, right?

1357
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,400
I bought a shirt.

1358
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,920
It's on its way, I'm very excited about.

1359
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,640
Did you really?

1360
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,280
Hell yeah, dude.

1361
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,400
Thank you.

1362
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,360
I really appreciate the support.

1363
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,360
I wasn't to support you, I was to support my body.

1364
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,640
I'm trying to look good out there.

1365
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,960
Yeah, well I appreciate it either way.

1366
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,080
Do you wanna plug Travis' show since he just did yours?

1367
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,200
Yeah, Trends Like These is a hot new show

1368
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,400
about internet trends from Travis McElroy,

1369
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,280
my brother, and Brentel Floss, who isn't my brother,

1370
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,480
but is a very funny person.

1371
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,400
And it's a great show that you will very much enjoy

1372
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,640
if you go subscribe to it on iTunes or anywhere else.

1373
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,800
And along with all of that other content,

1374
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,760
what you really need to do is go to-

1375
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,120
Please don't call it content.

1376
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,200
You make it sound like a couple brand wizards.

1377
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,880
Listen, along with all those brand magics,

1378
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,480
you should go listen to all the other shows

1379
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,040
on Maximum Fun, they're all great.

1380
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,240
I guarantee there is not a show on the network

1381
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,560
that I do not listen to that I do not love.

1382
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,960
So go listen, go to MaximumFun.org

1383
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,320
and check out all the other shows.

1384
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,000
Also go check out Brian and Lindsay Will Totally Eat That,

1385
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Maximum Fun's video series, it's excellent.

1386
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,080
We've got a bunch of new Max Fun merch,

1387
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,520
including Sawbone shirts.

1388
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,680
The show that Justin and Sydney do.

1389
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,720
It's maxfunstore.com.

1390
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,960
There's also tons of My Brother, My Brother,

1391
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,640
and Me merch there, so go check that out.

1392
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,480
All right, that's gonna do it for us, Griffin.

1393
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,960
Last Yahoo.

1394
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,440
