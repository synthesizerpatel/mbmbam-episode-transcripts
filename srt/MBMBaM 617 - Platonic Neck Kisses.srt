1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better with you

8
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,060

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,180
I

16
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,420
might even say hyping up and

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,900
Extolling the virtues of maybe I don't remember doing that Griffin. I don't remember

18
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,080
It being overwhelmingly positive our discussions, but I but but we have gotten lots of messages

19
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,580
from our good friends who have relied on us for

20
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,740
12 years now for

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,180
culture

22
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,180

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,440
Spiritual guidance spiritual guidance just like last life style tips. It's live

It's live MVB these boys at NB NBA M more letters

25
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,060
wouldn't tell us all about this show if it wasn't gonna be a

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,980
knockout and I

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,540
Can we stop I?

28
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,740
Don't like it man. You're talking about man versus be right now. Yeah

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,420
I'm gonna rely pretty heavily on you two to talk about it because I haven't watched it

30
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,220
You didn't watch it. Nah, it just doesn't seem interesting to me. It are you fuck?

31
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,340
Well, you know, I watched the trailer and like I went I went and I saw it on Netflix

32
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,580
I was like, yeah, it doesn't seem like my thing. How dare you you're kidding, right? No, I haven't watched it. Okay, so we'll just sit here

33
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,620
for 25 minutes while you

34
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,860
35 minutes. Well, I figured you guys could just like walk me through it

35
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,740
I was just busy like spending time with my family and taking care of things around the house

36
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,740
Hey, you're busy as a bee. Oh, yeah, I would say that is that connect? Is there a bee in the show?

37
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,140
Can this can this I just there's a lot of other things on most hostile energy

38
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,060
I feel like you've ever brought to an episode. I hate it. It's really that's saying a lot

39
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,060
It is hate saying a fucking lot trap. Yeah, I know. So why don't you guys kind of walk me through the first episode?

40
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,740
Well, I guess the last is this the last episode we talked about me

41
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,340
Can we can we establish that before we begin so I can prepare myself spiritual

42
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,700
I need to know how much to leave out on the court if this is the last time we ever discuss

43
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,460
This program then I'm I'm you're gonna get beast mode Griffin, which you have not gotten in a long time

44
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,860
I would love that if we have more in the tank more in the future

45
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,540
I will set something aside for that. I will say one problem here and Travis that didn't watch it, which I hate

46
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:07,060
Uh-huh. I didn't I think he did he's being I didn't I really did I did watch it the first episode

47
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,020
Are you that's that's it. I

48
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,740
Watched one you watched one of this incredibly short television show. How long are the episodes?

49
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,820
You're like 18. There's like it's like seven minutes. There's skits and sketches

50
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,680
First one is like fucking quibbles Justin. You couldn't watch one Quibi. Yeah, Justin. Come on

51
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,300
The problem is I watched them also

52
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,040
Pretty high. Yeah, I will say the one I watched I was pretty high

53
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,980
Did you love it just to evidence that real quick? I'm gonna play the video

54
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,260
I sent you guys so people can kind of hear where my head was at. Sure

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
part the part with the

56
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,260
The hairdryer that was good. The hairdryer part was good

57
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,740
That's sort of where I was for the

58
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,940
For this episode of television, uh-huh

59
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
You'd set thumbs up on this

60
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,820
The hairdryer part Justin's referencing is he knocked the head off a statue chasing B

61
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,660
B and knock a head off a statue and tries to glue it on actually make a point. That wasn't B

62
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
That was man. The statue

63
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,580
Statue was he was on the phone. Yeah, and he just wasn't paying attention and he was knocked it over

64
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,180
Yeah, the B was not in involved at that about and I just say guys as someone who didn't watch it

65
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,220
Which I hope is the majority of our audience right now. You haven't mentioned anything that wasn't also in the trailer

66
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,660
Yeah

67
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
Yeah, I will say this

68
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,820
good trailer in terms of

69
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,700
representative cross-section of the experience that you're gonna be in for which is to say flimsy man make a

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,420
Accident then the trailer did a great great job of selling that

71
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,780
Hey Griffin, go be someone and tell me all about the first episode of man VB. I

72
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,360
Watched more than one episode. Oh, then tell me as much as you want to tell me

73
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,700
It have you ever watched the television program or films? Mr. Bean? Yes

74
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,660
I have okay, it's it's that and you know how mr. Bean is is

75
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,060
flimsy man make an accident over and over and over again and talk talk a little oh

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,140
This time he talks kind of normal still of a very sort of like obsequious

77
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,900
little wretch

78
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,860
Whose family fucking hates him? Yeah, and everyone hates him. He's a he's a house sitter

79
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:43,780
He shows up to this house and the owners of the house are like open the door. We hate you. We hate you. We don't know you

80
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,340
You're not a normal guy. Whose name is Trevor, I think or no his name is trap unless there's a second Trevor

81
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,660
We are we are meant to revile these rich out of touch

82
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,420
douchebags because their house is so nice and their car is so nice and

83
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,620
They're but here's but the market has placed a value on the work that they do clearly

84
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,220
That has allowed them to accomplish this lifestyle

85
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,620
everything they say

86
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,120
About the flimsy bean man is a hundred percent, right? Yeah

87
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,700
You're gonna fucking kill our dog. It's gonna shit all over the house. It's gonna destroy our our Gutenberg Bible

88
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
It's gonna fucking wreck our Jaguar

89
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,940
It's gonna destroy our lives that we've worked so hard in the market has allowed us the beautiful free market has allowed

90
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,260
To achieve and you're gonna destroy that and we the viewers are supposed to be like

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,940
Fuck him up bean. I'm about to like

92
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,140
No, he's a bad. He's a bad man. And he makes so many accidents and

93
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,100
He sucks and the show sucks and I had a shitty time watching now

94
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,260
The problem with it is that he bean is a narcissist bean is a bad person who only care now

95
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,580
Are you talking about Rowan bean or Trevor? I'm talking about bean

96
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,580
Trevor is

97
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,060
Painted as like a nice guy. So these terrible things happen to him. Wait, hold on jump back in your mind

98
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:15,340
Mr. Bean is a narcissist clearly hundred percent. Whoa. Terrible person. Yeah. Whoa. He's a really bad person

99
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,460
Watch the Christmas episode. I mean you you have his girlfriend comes over

100
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,100
He gives her a picture of two other people

101
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,740
He as soon as she gives him his gift he immediately takes it and starts opening it

102
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,240
Like he only cares about himself the test episode. Okay, he's copping off the other person. He's you know, he's

103
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:45,540
Even the my flexible friend Sam making a sandwich on a park bench. He is clearly making that other gentleman deeply in every episode

104
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,500
Mr. Bean makes a different gentleman deeply uncomfortable

105
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,660
He doesn't give a shit sucks Trevor is is supposed that we're supposed to be on his side

106
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:01,420
But the problem is when calamity occurs and my friends it does mostly be be related

107
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
It makes you

108
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
It makes you not feel good

109
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,460
Like I feel this is sad old

110
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,940
This how okay the first episode of this show is so what we joke in

111
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
but the Paul Blart

112
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,740
Podcast till death was part about Chekhov's gun show where he literally like goes to a gun show and he's like

113
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Here's all the different guns

114
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,620
That you will you will be using later in this movie. This movie is maybe more

115
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,940
ostentatious than that with it's like what up where they go step by step to this house and it's like

116
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,020
Here's this thing. Here's this other thing. You won't remember. Here's how the locks work

117
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,460
Here's this special book that's worth a million dollars. Here's this special painting that's worth a million dollars

118
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,740
Don't stand on that trapdoor the dog

119
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:01,020
Yeah, exactly like the dog only eats this special beef or whatever and it's like so this is just you're just I can't remember

120
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,820
All this stuff. I know being camp, but then they're like, it's all in the manual. It's all in the house manual

121
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,780
It's all in the manual. It's all in the manual fucking five minutes in you know, this guy has the manual on the stove

122
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,620
I just like lighting it on fire and we've all been there

123
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,460
It's not on purpose, but it might as well be for how easily it could have been avoided and I will say this

124
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,680
There's a lot of nude being in this film. Oh my god, we keep saying film. This is a 10 episode

125
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
maxi series

126
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,700
But I assume it's like a serial where you could watch all of them together. They could put it into a

127
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,420
film eventually if they wanted to show it at Sundance

128
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,300
Absolutely, they could show this at Sundance for sure

129
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,940
Bit in in this show go off where he he tears it

130
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,540
So there's a soundproof room

131
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,020
White dog gets in there and starts tearing up a book

132
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,340
He hits a window with a hammer to smash in through the window to keep the book from being more destroyed

133
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,620
The hammer bounces off the window flies into a painting that's like modern art

134
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,940
You know to me like color blocks that kind of thing. Yeah rips a big chunk out of the painting. Okay. Yeah

135
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,500
so

136
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,460
He they're gonna be gone for a week. He's been there for like 10 minutes, right and this happened

137
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,620
He the man cuts a section of the couch

138
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,660
The bottom of the couch where there's like fabric. Yeah cuts it out

139
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,500
Then the color block that was torn is just like a big red square

140
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,540
So cuts it out paints it red with ketchup

141
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Yeah, huh and

142
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,340
then

143
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,100
duct tapes it on to the back of the paint like

144
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,420
That's why being you had time to go to the paint you could go to a paint store

145
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,100
You could take it to an art restorer and they would actually

146
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,300
Somebody to more importantly in the 1997 film beam

147
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,500
Uh-huh destroys a very famous painting the Mona Lisa. Yes. It's not the Mona Lisa. It is the Mona Lisa

148
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,980
I don't think it's the Mona Lisa. I'm pretty sure it is because I think he erases the face

149
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,940
He does erase the face, but I'm pretty sure it's not the Mona Lisa the screen. It's Whistler's mother. Oh

150
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,820
Yes, he restores it using like toothpaste in a clever

151
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:33,220
Clever series and then he gets a poster and like lacquers over it to make it look like so we've done this

152
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,060
Accident before with you. We've done this

153
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Job being did a better job

154
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,420
Job, and can I also just say pretty challenging stuff? I mean, it's pretty the victim here

155
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,420
offended as

156
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,260
Like fuck and then it was and then I remember what he said about that. That's a good thing. Yeah

157
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,460
That's what it's supposed to be difference here is you don't have Peter McNichol being

158
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,240
Holding it down. Look looking like bean. I'm flipping out right now his reactions to bean flipping

159
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,940
That's the issue with man versus be they don't give nobody Rowan Atkinson to work with except a CGI be Peter McNichol is over here

160
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,340
like

161
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,760
I love fucking Peter McNichol. I don't know his performances. I love his performances

162
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,120
Wild to think to use the thing of like oh in that comedy film Peter McNichol plays

163
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,080
The straight man is a wild like that's how that's how silly we're all straight men. That's right

164
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,880
Well, hey, mr. Bean doesn't believe in homosexuality

165
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,320
Challenging man, you're right Justin. He's challenging but it's true. I will say this he was right about one thing

166
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,640
This show is a weapon and Netflix is holding it in its hand and it's sitting in the now trending charts

167
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,500
Fucking cocked and loaded and if you see you honey, we finished stranger things. What next? Well next in the

168
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,600
Hot section is a show called man versus be that might be a good way to kind of decompress a little bit

169
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
We're all really stressed out about hopper over here

170
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,120
And then you watch man versus be and you've been killed by the this psychic weapon

171
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,600
I feel like it seems like Netflix was like hey you guys like stranger things, right?

172
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,180
Yeah, you'd like the final two episodes of the season. Well first you're gonna have to watch

173
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,360
Fucking vegetables. It's like up. It's like

174
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,280
What was um, what was the Mullen use thing?

175
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
goddess

176
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,760
Yeah, the what's in the box where you everyone had to tap curiosity

177
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:44,640
Everyone had to tap this box a bajillion times and never tapped at the bajillionth time. We get an incredible that's

178
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,640
Like everyone has so if you want the rest of stranger things

179
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,680
Everyone has to watch the rest of man versus be a million times. I don't want to talk about this anymore

180
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,880
I mean, I don't want to talk about man versus be ever again confront you with the reality

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,600
No, here's it. Here's what sucks shit though is we are gonna have to talk about it again cuz Travis has to watch it

182
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,160
Oh Travis, I will never us. Yeah, our audience will never forgive you for this

183
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm saying I was busy. I had things to do I cut my finger with a head trimmer

184
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I just didn't have you do that

185
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,680
Did you do that like a fucking Vietnam War deferment so that you did not have to watch?

186
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,720
I just finished reading a prayer for own meaning and I was like, you know what? I know how to get out of great idea

187
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,360
Yeah, okay. I would can I say this I would gladly shear my finger off to not watch another I didn't shear it off

188
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's be clear. She had into it. All right, that's man versus be that's our segment

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,920
I would love to hear your thoughts about it in the comments. I'm gonna go ahead and say this

190
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,600
I will continue to talk about it in every episode until Travis's watches

191
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,840
Entirely, hey Justin. Hey Justin, which one of us has more of a stomach for a long unfunny bit

192
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,840
But one of us craves the love and adoration of the the the listeners most I

193
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,980
Think you'll be the villain. You're the you are the villain Travis. Okay, you are a villain

194
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,820
So am I the man or the bee in this scenario? You're the man who is the villain? Oh boy is good

195
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,180
So just there's a scene in the second episode

196
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,220
There's a scene in the second episode where he devises a trap where he puts some bread with peanut butter on it in a microwave

197
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,000
Beast floats in there gets stuck in the peanut butter and he shuts the microwave and is ready to turn it on and cook it

198
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,860
And he doesn't what's your fucking how is that not the end of the show? How is that? Not the end of the show?

199
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,400
Does he chicken out?

200
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,540
He doesn't want to kill the bee and it's like why would I continue to watch this show?

201
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,060
If you don't even have the strengths of your conviction, I can't believe but also the bee stuck on the bear

202
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,620
Just put it outside. He does and the bee flies back into that. Well, okay, okay

203
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,180
This is an advice show as you've certainly guessed by this this this moment

204
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,180
So, thank you for joining us yet again for this for this program or maybe you didn't it's quite possible you're not here

205
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,460
Yeah, well think about it. My wife's friend was hosting a can I stand?

206
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,740
my wife's man

207
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,060
My wife's friend was hosting a Canadian Thanksgiving party. It was gay, which is usually like October

208
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:17,020
This is no one knows there. No, I'm sorry. I'm telling you. I once had it's a 44th Thursday of every year

209
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,220
Mm-hmm. I once had Canadian Thanksgiving in Honduras because there are some Canadians there was great. Guess what they eat

210
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:29,420
Turkey. Oh, it was getting a bit late and I wanted to get our six-month-old son down for bed

211
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,420
Been there. Everyone wanted to get some photos with the kiddo before we took off

212
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,660
He started to get a little agitated at the commotion. So I tried to bounce him a bit and kissed his fuzzy little head

213
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,500
He was having none of it

214
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,340
So we got as many pics as we could I shuffled him off home as I was putting him in his crib

215
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,380
I came to the realization that instead of gently kissing my sweet baby boy on the head

216
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,700
I may have kissed my Canadian bro-y friend's neck as

217
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,860
He was standing next to us in the photo

218
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,660
I

219
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:05,700
Haven't spoken to him much since then but I'm haunted by the idea of my softly kiss the peach fuzz on my buddy's neck and not

220
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Immediately recognize this is not my baby

221
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,500
Do I ask him if he felt anything strange during the photos or do I continue to act like nothing?

222
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,580
Happened and this is a guess la la lips la lips

223
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,760
It's hard to say if every question that was sent to us

224
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
That was sort of a toss-up like this

225
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,180
Included

226
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,680
photographic evidence

227
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,160
Then this show would be so much easier to to yeah, but then anyone would do a Griffin if it was easy

228
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:41,420
Anyone would do it. I'm just saying look at the look at this photograph. I'm kissing my buddy Derek's neck

229
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:49,100
I thought it was a baby's head. How do you confuse a baby's head with a grown adult looks like baby's head

230
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:56,320
I guess so because maybe Derek moisturizes a lot and he had six months of beard growth and it was equal to

231
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,960
Six months of baby hair growth. Let let's just would it be safe to assume because if you didn't kiss Derek's neck

232
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,820
Then we don't need to proceed any further, right? So if we're assuming you can't we must assume

233
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,240
So let me say this Derek in the moment also didn't say anything

234
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,440
Sure, right. So maybe maybe there's not as pro as you think maybe it was just a nice note between friends. It was intimate

235
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,640
You know, it's just like oh, this is not you know, what we never show each other affection like this. This is very nice

236
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,680
Thank you. I love it. I love it. Let's bring back platonic intimacy, please

237
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:39,760
Yes, thank you. Thank you. I mean sorry not for me. Thanks. Oh, yeah doesn't care for any intimacy

238
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,240
What's over? Oh, that's not true. I'm a real sex monster

239
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:50,480
But I don't want it I but what but that's in a very specific place, which is to say my my Christian bed

240
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,320
uh-huh outside of that I'm

241
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,480
No, none for me. Thanks. So you guys you guys kissing each other's necks. I'm I'm fine over here, but keep it up

242
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,540
You look happy. I'm happy. So if Justin or I if we had like a really great live show

243
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,400
Yeah came backstage and everyone was like a great live show and Justin and I wanted to share a round of like brother kisses

244
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,820
On the neck. Yeah, you would abstain. I wouldn't be there

245
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,800
There would be good you well when I I would know the vibe

246
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,080
Was leading in the direction of platonic intimacy and I would probably just like squirrel myself

247
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,480
So wait as we walked to the dressing room holding hands like we always do at the end of live shows you would break off

248
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,160
No, I told you that's not that's that's just brother stuff. Okay, and this is not like it's not like a homophobic thing

249
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,340
It's just a I'm good on platonic intimacy over here. Yeah, if some of any gender

250
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:49,660
Of any sort of gender spectrum, you're not loving the platonic intimacy. I'm just not really ba-da-ba-ba-ba. No, thanks

251
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,620
Yep, yeah, you know what now that you said it and I think yeah, that's yeah, that's Griffin

252
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:05,100
That sounds about right. It's a topic that that I feel like we've glanced off of before but I do feel like merits exploration

253
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,380
is that oh

254
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,980
Justin we're recording video for the first time and I can see Justin tinting his fingers. It's very

255
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Solve this the Frasier

256
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,820
Also got video look at these little Frasier pop. I got a Frasier pop

257
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,220
Okay, okay, and then I got a Martin and Eddie pop still

258
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Niles is the chase

259
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
There is a these things

260
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:39,620
Uh-huh. They go they go rotten when you leave them in the fridge of

261
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,940
Of not

262
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,300
Confronting them they go they go rotten and then this this this topic

263
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:55,420
Has it has gone it has gone fallow now. It is it you can't do this anymore

264
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,580
You can't return to it. You bring things to us. You have to start getting the habit of

265
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,540
of anticipating these situations and emailing us before you are I'm going to a Thanksgiving a

266
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,000
Canadian Thanksgiving party and I feel there might be a chance. I might get my

267
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,700
Friend on the neck. My friend has a patch of hair on his neck

268
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,860
That and there's also a sort of weird

269
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,120
Soft bone plate in there. Anyway, it really looks like a baby's head. Yeah, and I want to kiss it

270
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,940
I just can't help myself. I think here's like this is

271
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:37,340
There's a good chance that you could ask your bro friend. Like did I kiss you on the neck while we're taking photos?

272
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,140
I was so tired. I've got six months old. You can't now this is what I'm saying. Oh, yeah

273
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,300
No

274
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,460
It's long past you have to do it the instant it happens because it's going to seed

275
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:54,500
Like it from the moment you don't discuss it. It is like one of those time-lapse videos of a Fox decomposing

276
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,900
Like yeah, you have to address it in that exact moment. Don't hold back. You'll figure it out

277
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,180
Once again, not because if you had accidentally to kiss them on the neck, they'll be the weirdest thing

278
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,180
But I would say anything like this the longer it goes

279
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:16,500
The weirder it is to then ask about later right because it's like what he indicates is I have been thinking about this

280
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,880
Right on stop tragedy plus time equals comedy. Yeah tragedy plus comedy equals time

281
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,520
Yes awkwardness plus time

282
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,680
equals

283
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,640
Weirder like it just I I actually think comedy plus time does equal tragedy where it's like you make a joke or something funny happens

284
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
And it would be funny in that moment

285
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,720
Yeah, but then it's sad too long. Yeah, I was like, you know is a joke. Was that funny? Was it weird?

286
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,440
It's like oh, no, we've thought about the funny thing too long and now it's horrifying

287
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:53,780
like when I see mr. Bean in 1995 gives clothes torn off and he's got his naked bean dick and he's just running around a

288
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,280
Swimming pool and I'm watching that like busting up

289
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,640
But then a full-grown bean almost 30 30 years later does it cuz a bee chased him out of his house and that's

290
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,180
Tragedy now because time has made it tragedy. Is he allergic to bees in this show? It's not addressed

291
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,620
In the early episodes that Griffin has enjoyed Travis will have to report back to us

292
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,660
Hey, I have something for us today and it's a special something

293
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,340
I was looking through wiki house and I stumbled on an email that Ethan sent us. Thank you, Ethan. Thank you, Ethan and it's

294
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,100
It's a it's it's from a website called

295
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,400
Holidapi, which I believe is a mixture of the word portmanteau of the words holiday and happy

296
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,360
And holidapi this article has a lot of helpful tips for us

297
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,400
Can I just say that's a that's a portmanteau? That's terrible. That's not how you have to say that in doing portmanteau is itself

298
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Think about that

299
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,940
So holidapi has composed here a list of happy Independence Day messages and wishes that we can send each other and our loved ones

300
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,080
to

301
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,720
Celebrate the good times great oldies and this incredible country

302
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,460
This kick-ass country that we live in and how we can send messages to each other on on Independence Day to really

303
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,340
Acknowledge that a Griffin might have proposed a game

304
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,160
Sure. Sure. What if you read the message, right?

305
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,720
Okay, and then we counted to three and all three of us said who in our life we think would send that message to us

306
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,140
Oh, no, no this game won't work and I'll tell you why they're all noni. Can I begin? Ah, damn it. Okay, go on

307
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:47,400
Short greetings for text messages. So just like and this doesn't it's not just for us this this episode

308
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,280
I don't know if we're putting this out on our usual day if we do it is

309
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,080
July 4th right now when you're listening to this

310
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,200
So go ahead and snap off a few of these and just like shoot them over to your buds and see

311
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,640
What you get back from let's salute the nation

312
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,960
That's a test. That's one. That's the first one and that sounds like weirdly like making plans for something

313
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,720
Doesn't it? Like that's not just like hey happy for that's like let's do so. Hey, what are you doing right now?

314
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,320
Let's go salute the nation when you salute the nation

315
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,880
Do you just do you look do you look at the down at the ground or do you just try to shoot?

316
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,760
You lay down you lay down face down with your hand between your forehead and the dirt. That's good. That's good

317
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,360
That's good. So the second one escalates a little bit in that it says I

318
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,000
Pledged that the labor of our past heroes shall not be in vain Wow

319
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,000
Wow

320
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
Wow, hey, hey, hey Wow

321
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,120
Also, not necessarily what the 4th of July is about. Yeah, I think you're thinking more Memorial Day

322
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,960
That's more of a Memorial Day. Can you can you bring hot dog buns to the cookout?

323
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,840
Thank you. I pledged that the labor of our past heroes shall not be in vain is the kid

324
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,120
I asked a pretty simple question about the hot dog buns

325
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,640
That's also a thing you could say after watching a lot of Marvel movies, too. Uh-huh. Yeah

326
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,200
Uh-huh. You could also say something like I feel proud to be part of a prosperous nation

327
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Well, well

328
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,200
Followed up by Happy Independence Day. Yeah didn't start there though, huh?

329
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,240
Nothing nothing is as good as living in an independent and self-sustaining nation

330
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,560
Well, what are you talking about?

331
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,240
Doesn't mean anything you mean our self-sustaining nation that worries about our wheat supply oil supply

332
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,040
Nation that when boats can get her from China start choking on its own puke

333
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:46,920
That doesn't have enough doesn't have microchips to make things we're doing it

334
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,700
Computers that we have trucks sitting in factories that don't have chips in them

335
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,240
Our one gubernatorial douchebag just strangles the entire avocado pipeline

336
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,800
What is what a beautiful self-sustaining?

337
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:09,200
Self-sustaining we don't need anybody else. Nah, baby. We got it. Hey best wishes and Happy Independence Day

338
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,160
Here's wishing you have a Happy Independence Day. Happy birthday to our dear country

339
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,820
Let's remember all the past heroes who fought for our freedom

340
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Okay. Okay. I love our past heroes. Let me say yeah, we're a hero and in the past wild about it

341
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Yeah, yeah, I feel like they do have a day. That's their day

342
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,180
You know, I mean the ones that are past heroes and current heroes

343
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,720
Days like they both we were being honest

344
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,200
These messages would be like and let's salute the idea of signing a piece of paper because really that's I mean come on

345
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,040
There's always got to be somebody though. If you try to say what 4th of July is

346
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,800
There's always somebody who's like no, it's not actually that it's like the sign of that crucial independence

347
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,560
and then there's always gotta be some some Joker who's like actually is the day that the

348
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,040
the

349
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:06,800
Continental Congress announced that the different papers have been signed you you bring up such a great point doesn't why is the Joker so pedantic about

350
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:14,080
History. Yeah, I've never understood that thing. I'm like, ah, yes Batman. I will get you also not everybody signed the

351
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,960
Declaration on the fourth actually a lot of people signed it

352
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,960
It was red. That's the worst. Hey Trav. That's the worst Joker impression. I ever heard. Thank you

353
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm trying to it's a new take for the Joker that I'm trying where he's both the clown prince of crime, but also

354
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,520
the clown prince of factual accuracy

355
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Yeah

356
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,880
If somebody does come at you with that very pedantic correction just hit him back with a may God continue to uplift this country's glory

357
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Is that what he's been doing? I miss that. Oh

358
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Man, where have I been looking?

359
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Hit him with a very straightforward

360
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,560
Right forward right over the plate today is a very special day for the nation and its people

361
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,680
Well, yeah, I would then I would just send that every day for a while because it's probably true whether good or bad

362
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,320
There's probably something happening on that date. That feels pretty major

363
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,880
Yeah, here's wishing you and your family the best the nation has to offer as we celebrate our country's independence

364
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,280
So like some five guys is sure is that what you mean?

365
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,440
It's just some five guys in a national park go eat some five guys in a national park

366
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,060
That's assuming it's open because they could get staffing for it. They could that could be an issue

367
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,060
Those are texts but you all know

368
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,000
me

369
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,840
I don't like I don't like to text. Yeah feels very like so cold cold and impersonal. I like a car robotic

370
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,600
these are some

371
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,320
slightly more

372
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:50,960
Thoughtful longer messages that you could write in a car. I love getting cards from Griffin. Yeah, like I'll get a card over a few days

373
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,720
It's like hey, I'm hopping on fortnight. Let's go or like yeah. Hey, you're late for this. The postcard. It's like hey

374
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,680
What size t-shirt do you wear? Do you know? Yeah, or like can we reschedule today's recording because I have diarrhea again. Yeah. Yeah

375
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,800
Do you guys remember that greeting card? I got you both and it had like a cute

376
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:18,080
Cartoon firework on the front of it. And then when you open it up inside the card, it already had written

377
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:27,000
Baby, you're a firework. Happy 4th of July. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, and then underneath underneath that I wrote myself

378
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,180
I added the future progress and development of our great country do not depend solely on technological advancements

379
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,200
But how we build social cohesion and trust between our nation and its people let's continue building a great nation

380
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,200
We can all rely on and be proud of happy 4th of July. I'm Griffin McElroy, and I approve this message

381
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,200
What yeah

382
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,760
And then there was the one with the cartoon grill on it and it says you're a you're a barbecued e

383
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,540
Happy 4th of July. Yeah, and underneath that

384
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,800
I wrote every citizen should have a sense of belonging wherever they find themselves

385
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,760
May all our politicians rise to the great task of building trust between the people in the nation so we can have peace and stability

386
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,340
In our country. Here's wishing everyone a happy Freedom Day celebration. I do remember that

387
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,100
I did think it was weird that it was written in cutout letters for magazines

388
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,140
But other than that, it was really now I liked the sentiment. Do we call it Freedom Day?

389
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:24,860
I do not believe so. Futurama does. Is this person confusing real life with Futurama?

390
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,380
Perhaps they're conflating real life with Futurama. That does happen. Yeah, those are just some normal things to write inside of a greeting card

391
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,380
and

392
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,020
This is a this is my favorite one as we mark our insert number

393
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,480
Independence Day today try to think of something that you have done to better the welfare of the people if nothing comes to mind

394
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,100
Then try to think of what you might be able to do in the future

395
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,700
Happy Independence Day

396
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,400
Just a little home for you. That sounds like a card

397
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,100
That sounds like a card a funeral home would send you to thank you for your business. Yeah

398
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Yeah, you got on their mailing list and it's like what there's a tiny calendar that you have no use for whatsoever and a card

399
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,980
Asking you what you've done for the nation. Hey, I'm gonna play this is a quick math challenge

400
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,260
I'm gonna count to three and then you guys say how many years we like since

401
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,420
1776 worth of joy. You ready? One, two, three go

402
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:28,900
Three hundred and fifty four hundred forty some Wow. Yeah, it's it's three hundred and fifty four. I think

403
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
354 and 54

404
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Griffin

405
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,540
354

406
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,540
17 to 21

407
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,860
30 I said 240 I felt pretty good about that. 240 is pretty close

408
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,940
240 is pretty close. I believe it's 246

409
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:55,020
You didn't give me you didn't give me a lot of time, but you went with 300. You couldn't do simple

410
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,140
300 Griffin already puts it at 2076. It's your common core, bud

411
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,860
300 is obviously a bad start

412
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,860
That's obviously the wrong start

413
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:19,060
A two is a front and then any number afterwards would have been excusable. Yeah, okay

414
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
Yeah 17

415
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,300
was was the start of it right and

416
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,260
20 is where ours starts now

417
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,860
17 plus 20 300 I can see how you would get there. It's not it's not that 17 plus 20 is 300

418
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,860
I think we all can all at least agree with that

419
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,460
Do you guys remember the greeting card I sent you that had the cartoon American flag on the front of it?

420
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,080
And it said looking good in Stars and Stripes, baby. Happy Independence Day, and then underneath that I wrote each time

421
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,760
I remember those who laid down their lives for this day of freedom. We are celebrating tears rolled down my cheeks

422
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,980
I wish they were alive today to see how the country is progressing toward greatness

423
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm actually not getting any of your cards because every time you turn around my house number it just says 777 333 blue

424
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,860
It's like no grip. That's a holy holy incomplete understanding of arithmetic

425
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,860
Listen, I know we've talked about it before on the show

426
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,860
But if someone could snap their fingers and the founding fathers will be alive today

427
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:24,300
They would not care about where our country's that they'd be terrified at everything out TVs cars

428
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,060
Okay, maybe

429
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,220
Is it our old gags to try to use them for new for new purposes?

430
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,920
I would take a blink in and go see that new Jurassic World movie and he'd be like

431
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,320
The whole time like like hiding under the chair fucking idiot

432
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Wouldn't you love to actually like if you got people from a certain time period I don't know when this would be like say Shakespeare

433
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,440
times yeah, okay what and you brought him into the future and everybody's like, you know, I would take him to

434
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,140
Steak and shake or whatever like I don't have it, you know

435
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Or whatever. I would I was shown TV

436
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,680
The best thing to do is somebody from that time period would be or guess any biblical times

437
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Whatever would be to tell them about dinosaurs. Yeah, and then instantly tell them they don't exist anymore

438
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,240
Yeah, like hey, guess what dinosaurs like oh shit, you let them go on for like a half hour

439
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,160
You're showing them all the sick-ass like videos and photos that we have of dinosaurs

440
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:30,640
From the media and then at just at the right moment. You're like, but they don't exist. Yeah. Sorry, but sorry

441
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,360
And then send them right back and then they're right back there at the desk

442
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,040
But go go start digging for bones. You never know. Yeah. Hey, can we go digging for some bones in the money bone? Oh

443
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,440
Money I think you've been funny bone

444
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Monkey bone, that's what it was. Let's go

445
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,480
Hey, let's take a quick two hours to go watch monkey bone. It's

446
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,480
93 minutes. No, yeah, but you need 30 minutes

447
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,400
Benefits it's hard for me to think of one that is

448
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,120
Good for everybody in the same way that imperfect foods is imperfect foods lets you reduce food waste

449
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,440

Cuz once you throw them, they're pretty much gone. I like you never see Batman going around and picking them back up

481
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,980
They'll never fly the same again after they ding off of a wall

You know, that's also true or once they like sever someone's artery, you know what I mean?

They get a little rusty after that, right? So you want to buy what I don't think that's what he does

484
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,700
Well, listen, he doesn't purposefully murder anyone, but he's not doing triage. You know, he's much like bean in that way

485
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,780

when you check out the honey button appears and you click apply coupons and it finds all the battering coupons and

488
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,500
Then you wait a few seconds and honey searches finds coupons for that site

489
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,540
And then if it finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:33,140

There's an amazing documentary about queer history on streaming

523
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,140
Have I told you about this classic where giant robots fight or there's that one that most critics hated?

524
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:15,020
But I thought was actually pretty good. Oh, I know the one with the huge car chase and then there's that scene where the car jumps

536
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:17,580
I don't know how you this will be $75. Okay, that seems fair. Oh, no, Ross and Carrie at maximum fun

537
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,740
Oh, you knew it was a dot org. I have a gift. I

538
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,860
Just want to talk about like some personal justice or something you want to say

539
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,220
Nope

540
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,740
Okay, let's do another question. Okay, perfect. I

541
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,380
Wanted to give you something in a row. I felt like there was a munchkrat coming

542
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,340
Mmm-hmm. Guess I'm getting a little less predictable in my old age. Okay, I

543
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,060
Paint apartments for a living while walking. I bet that's a very satisfying job

544
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,540
Oh, especially if you're doing it like by yourself just put headphones on

545
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,940
Especially if it's a nice clean job. No cutting in you just oh

546
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,500
Oh, yeah, I paint apartments for a living. I bet it sucks when they don't move the furniture first

547
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,260
They're like, yeah, you'll move it right and you're like no that I just pay. Oh my god

548
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,140
Move your shit for a living. I

549
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,980
What if they have a cat you paint the cat into the paint the cat into the wall sucks

550
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,940
I've painted I love that book about how to write a movie called paint the cat

551
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,860
But it's like that's how you establish like a bean character right away

552
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,900
All right, if you want to establish this as a bean ask character

553
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,300
Which we're all going apartments for only got to have them paint the cat apartments for a living

554
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,660
While walking through the hallway to the apartment I was assigned

555
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,660
I overheard the building is having an ice cream social later for the tenants

556
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,100
Yes, you're gonna is having a heat wave. So the building has no the building has no AC. I love free food

557
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,940
Is there an acceptable?

558
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:47,700
Way for me to get some of this ice cream out of context the entire building is specifically for people 55 years and older

559
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,340
So I'll be at least three decades younger younger than the rest of the people there

560
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:56,820
And also I'm covered in paint and that's from melting in the Midwest. Okay, let me start with this

561
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,100
so much to add here what kind of

562
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,620
Cut-rate slumlord is like the old people are melting

563
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:12,180
We need a see and then this slum or turns around his throne is like let them eat ice cream

564
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:18,980
And then slams the door in their face. Yes. This is a bad building. They're spending money on

565
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,820
repainting

566
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:27,500
Before they preserve the temperature control for these poor old people. That's that's fucked up

567
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,500
And let me say this these that I'm and I'm not gonna I'm gonna try my hardest

568
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,420
I I don't want to propagate any sort of ages stereotypes

569
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:42,900
But I will say that this 55 plus year old ice cream socials probably be rocking some pretty gnarly fucking

570
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:49,980
Butterscotch briars and not the good shit not that fucking caramel core fucking Ben and Jerry's they are going to have some

571
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,660
straight up

572
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:58,380
Fucking right out the tub right out big old big old tub. That's a duty fruity out of the tub

573
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:05,380
I've never rolled up to an ice cream social where I didn't see that like boom boom big like five gallon

574
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:13,300
Bucket of just like signature select really pale chocolate versus every like just a tan chocolate or perhaps worse the

575
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,700
Tiny fluted cups with the paper lid you have to peel off like it's a penny

576
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:23,060
It's not it's not an arty and they have those like really cheap-ass waffle cones or they're not the way

577
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,900
They're just like little hollow

578
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:31,620
Dried out decayed husk of an actual ice cream cone. Oh bad news guys. I'm hungry for ice cream. Yeah

579
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,620
Yeah, yeah

580
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,940
For ice cream, I got the kids some of those they're like the drumsticks, right?

581
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,460
But they're like miniature and I know this is the perfect size. I can eat them in one fucking bite

582
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:53,260
I'm a giant and I love ice cream. Yeah, I'm a giant and I love ice cream would be a good ringtone if anybody's still

583
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,780
Okay, listen, all you gotta do is pick one

584
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,940
Person and stick at this ice cream so she'll just kept saying like yeah

585
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:10,620
Hey Gramps, just grab some ice cream before I finish painting your apartment. Boom. You're in there right now. Now you're someone's great

586
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,980
Hey, let's follow through they say

593
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,700
That's who the work of sufficient land of ours, but I'm a worker. I'm a painter

594
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:00,140
But not like not one of those artsy painters. Don't get it twisted. Okay, I was yeah. Have you thrown out for a

Nubbin of pistachio. Oh, thank you

598
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:20,260
This sucks, don't I deserve the ice cream for my work? No says the man in Washington

599
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,260
You can't be my guy. That's no I was being sorry. I was being Andrew Ryan

600
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,060
I've wanted us to get in the more characters. Okay, I want this to be my brother my brother me

601
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,060
Okay, well, thank you. Sure

602
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,780
But I was being Andrew Ryan were you also being Andrew Ryan I was old

603
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,900
Alternate universe Andrew Ryan where I never stopped being Batman

604
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:44,100
I I hate to be this guy because I try to like

605
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,060
Stand on some pretty anti-capitalist like group footing most of the time

606
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:55,620
But I will say this is one of those scenarios where you can get yourself a tub of shitty briars

607
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:02,260
sure, but for about 250 at Sam's Club and then you don't have and then you don't and then you don't have to be

608
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,300
In this situation, but it doesn't but he's working

609
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:12,420
Bring it to work with what Griffin ice cream to work with you two things Griffin. Yeah, two things one

610
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,740
It doesn't matter the price

611
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:20,900
Free ice cream is better than paid for ice cream. Yeah, just like don't but to Griffin what you are fucking forgetting, dude

612
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:27,300
Is this an ice cream social? There's at least gonna be Jimmy's there's at least gonna be chocolate sauce at least

613
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,380
In this building that doesn't provide

614
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,660
In this building in this building that doesn't provide

615
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,060
cool air

616
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:42,100
They're gonna have Jimmy's like sustaining cool air. That's enough of a problem. Yes

617
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,940
I agree that is an issue Griffin

618
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,540
But if you put social on the flyer and then there are no toppings at the very least Jimmy's

619
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,820
Take them to court. I don't care about the air conditioning thing. You said ice cream social

620
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,220
That means toppings. I mean at least Jimmy's and maybe

621
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,220
At least Jimmy's

622
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,140
I'm not over here asking for hazelnuts and magic shell, you know what I mean?

623
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:10,180
It doesn't have to be some crushed up oreos. I'm not a nice and Irma's in the in the hot the hot

624
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,940
Topping bathtub. Yeah, there's not gonna be cheesecake cubes or like cookie dough. I get that I get that

625
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,940
But some ready whip some ready whip. Yeah

626
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,020
Jar of maraschino cherries, what's that like three bucks?

627
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,700
Now those come on though. You don't want to clean up after that

628
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,900
Well, you're gonna put down a cloth on the table in the rec room

629
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,060
Well, anytime you're getting a lot of old people together. You want to put down some newspapers Justin Patrick McElroy. That is not his middle name

630
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:42,020
It's not my middle name. Um, I I think just go for it. They'd be happy to see you there

631
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:47,700
There's always ice cream left over if they got just enough ice cream for these people once again

632
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,420
Take him to court take this landlord to court

633
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,380
If you say if you walk in there and say hey, um, it's a hot day and i'm gonna work really hard

634
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,080
Can I get into that ice cream? They would be thrilled. You know, i'll be overjoyed

635
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,860
They would be to be able to share. Okay Griffin, you're making a face. No, they would be thrilled

636
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,020
It's just when was the last time you were in a room with exclusively a bunch of

637
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,500
They've got stories Griffin. They got stories. Let me finish

638
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:20,260
sweaty 55 plus year olds who are now reaping the benefits of the sweat from their brow, which is to say

639
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:28,500
Briers and jimmies and then you walk in there with your fucking air pods plugged in probably listening to fucking

640
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,580
choppo trap house

641
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,860

They look at you with your fucking invaders m t-shirt on and your fucking wallet chain wait and you're fucking

00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,900
Obama doll that you're just carrying around for and they look at you and like a ventriloquist

645
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,900

Sorry, we don't have any uh dairy free

655
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:22,500
Here you're gonna have to look they probably do though. I mean they probably they must okay

656
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,380
You would think they do you'd need to have at least one dairy-free option one other thing that we're not considering here

657
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,820
Okay, thank you god

so this uh

666
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,540
Today we're going to be talking about a new taco bell menu innovation

667
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,780
um innovation

668
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,780
No, that's not what he said

669
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:19,140
Huh? Oh shit. Oh shit. What the

670
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,580
Everything has changed

671
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:30,200
Everything's different. It's so big. What is so big travis the cheese it justin. Well, that's the big cheese at tostada

672
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:34,660
Is currently being tested in southern california for what would you pay?

673
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,940
What what wouldn't I pay justin? Well, I hope

674
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,220
I'll tell you what

675
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:44,900
You won't pay that's two dollars and fifty cents because it is 249 and if you pay a set over that you have been

676
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,820
Ripped off and then did you say this is available at all locations now at all locations in california?

677
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,060
That are that it's being tested in the masterminds of taco bell and cheese

678
00:54:55,060 --> 00:55:00,280
It have come together for the ultimate test kitchen test the big cheese at tostada

679
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:07,960
Just like the iconic cracker this innovation features a cheese at square, you know and love made with 100 real cheese

680
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,420
ridges, but it's not

681
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:17,480
Is now 16 times the original size just like you would buy at any restaurant in mexico

682
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,640
That's literally the sentence. It says is

683
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:27,480
The cheese that you know and love made with 100 real cheese ridges, but is now 16 times the original size

684
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:33,560
um, the collab were they paying by the word like it was an old-timey telegram

685
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,640
Should we put and ridges? No, no

686
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:42,120
We can't afford a man's ridges the collab creation tops the oversized cracker with layers upon layers of taco bell flavors

687
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,360
For a limited time in southern california, which I love that. They don't have to specify any more

688
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,400
It's just like, you know, it's got a bunch of taco bell shit on it. Just like you get it

689
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,400
This stuff we put on things

690
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,080
We put the leavings on it

691
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,680
You know how we take we take a hard thing and then we just do some meat jazz in there

692
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,540
Yeah for a limited time in southern california fans can crunch their cravings with this abundantly cheesy and nostalgic

693
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,360
Yet magically modern dining experience get fucked. There are

694
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,280
A few things it's weird that they put get fucked in their press release

695
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:17,160
There are a few things that everyone can agree on but the iconic flavors from taco bell menu items

696
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,440
And cheese it snacks appeal to all

697
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,160
sure to

698
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,160
All

699
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,800
Yeah, everyone can agree that we love taco bell flavors and cheese it snacks

700
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:38,200
We're thrilled about this new concept with cheese it which gives our fans the chance to experience the real cheese and crunch

701
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,480
They love from both our brands in a whole new way

702
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:48,840
Let me just say the real cheese and crunch parentheses for the first 30 seconds and then say goodbye to that crunch

703
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,760
Until they're enjoying the new orange slog bog

704
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Uh

705
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,600
I would love to see side-by-side pictures of this image and and then I opened the box

706
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,220
That that's not all uh, uh a crunchier exclusive surprise

707
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,760
By the way, they describe what it is, but it's a big cheese it with like beef

708
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,360
On it and sour cream and tomatoes and crisp lettuce and cheese

709
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,840
Um, that's not all a crunchier exclusive surprise awaits for users of the taco bell website and mobile app

710
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:28,040
It's the big cheese it crunch wrap supreme, huh? Okay. Okay now i'm now i'm on board now

711
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,720
I'm in something I can pick up you say like an original counterpart

712
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,080
This version includes seasoned beef nacho cheese sauce lettuce reduced fat sour cream and diced tomatoes

713
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:43,480
But the typical tostada shell is swapped for the oversized cheese it cracker before being wrapped inside a tortilla

714
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,480
That's grilled to go

715
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,040
This is the first time taco bell has offered a digital exclusive as part of a one restaurant test fans can get this cheesy

716
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,040
goodness in the big cheese it crunch wrap supreme for

717
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:02,220
429 this partnership is a true testament to cheese. It's continued success and commitment to innovation

718
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,360
Says stephanie miller president away from home kellogg company

719
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:14,360
We're excited to incorporate cheese it made with 100 real cheese into taco bell favorites and deliver customers of bold

720
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,640
Cheesy twist on the iconic chain's go-to

721
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,520
menu staples, so this is at they

722
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:28,680
Won all the cheese it but here's the real fucking kicker. This is at one taco bell location at two two

723
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,240
two two

724
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
Barranca parkway, irvine california

725
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:40,600
92606 for two weeks. So please you have to get there and let us know

726
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,520
How this is because it looks amazing now. My question is

727
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,760
Does taco bell have the strength? Do they have the power?

728
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,800
As a the fortitude to just sell me a giant cheese it

729
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,400
Yeah, I just want to eat the big taco mess on it. I don't want the mess. I want to pretend i'm a giant

730
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Yeah, just like a no, you know, hold on

731
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,920
With a giant cheese it you're like a borrower or a borrower

732
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,880
I want to pretend we're a borrower which I think you were about to say or maybe just a tiny mouse in the wall

733
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,120
one of those things but like I have two thoughts one the fact that they sell this un-crunch wrapped is

734
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:26,360
Bonkers the only thing I want to eat right now is this in this crunch wrap but crunch wrapped because un-crunch wrapped

735
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,520
You're talking about you

736
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,760
the person at the taco bell window hands you into your car, uh a

737
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:39,740
A temporarily firm square piled high with mess that then like what do you you tell me the geometry

738
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,940
Yeah, you're gonna take one bite and the structural integrity will immediately be compromised

739
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Lap of crap now your lap is the taco if you contain it in a tortilla garbage bag

740
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,820
Which is what the crunch wrap would be that's a different story second thing

741
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,300
Justin made us look at a jpeg of this for a long time

742
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,180
And I felt like it was that scene in big fish where the kids go to like the witch and she shows them the moment

743
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,180
Of their death. That's what I felt

744
