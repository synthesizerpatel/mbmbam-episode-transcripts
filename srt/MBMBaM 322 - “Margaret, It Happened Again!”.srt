1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm your sweet baby brother. Crack that beverage, baby, Griffin McElroy. The energy in the studio

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,040
is alive and electric. Cracklin, cracklin, cracklin. Bazinga, this energy's good. Cracklin,

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,160
oat brand, the energy bouncing from Justin and me, me to Justin.

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,640
Welcome to the Zeitgeist, folks. We are just riding a cultural wave right now,

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:24,720
thanks to our hot new party game, Which One Vapes? As you know, we invented this hit party game

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,400
accidentally last week, and it has taken on a life of its own created by Auburn Wood,

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,040
who actually went through and made the, almost to our exact specifications.

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,800
Yeah, this is well-tailored.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,800
My only regret about the whole thing is that we've got this just title wave of fun game

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,920
that we did not think of any way to monetize at all.

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
It's a gift. We'll come up with another one next time.

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,600
Wait, Jay Alexander or David Letterman? Ms. J or Mr. D?

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,120
Damn.

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,080
Damn. You know Ms. J's got a fashionable rig. It's like a cane,

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,280
like a fashionable cane that Ms. J lifts up to those lips and then vape juice comes out.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
Here's what I'm going to give you guys.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,280
Please.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,040
This is created, it is like not, this is a scientific process, and I have proof.

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,120
Because I have leaderboards here, the least likely and most likely to vape,

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,600
let me go through the least likely to vape first.

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,400
Oh, excellent.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
Starting from number six and going backwards.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,520
And we promise we aren't going to talk about vaping this episode as much as we did last episode.

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,480
Yeah, but this is a cultural zeitgeist. The Daily Dot said that this is an important website.

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,120
Very important.

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,760
And very important.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
It's been sent to the library of Congress.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
So here we go. Number six, Michelle Obama.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,520
Yes.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,040
Definitely not vaping. Yeah, so she's the least likely.

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
She's the number six least likely to vape.

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
She's not the most least likely to vape.

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
I see, I see, I see.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,240
Number five, Vanessa Redgrave.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Yes.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
Four, Bruce Lee. Fair.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
Number three, Joan Plowright.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,840
Okay.

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,200
Number two, Kate Bach.

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,960
Coming in at number one, most human being most least likely to vape.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
Most, no, okay.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Number one least likely to vape, Dorothy Danridge.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,960
Okay.

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Accurate.

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,600
Okay, now here's our top six.

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,920
Going to number one, heading to number one, most likely to vape.

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
Justin wouldn't let us look at this beforehand because-

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,800
This is proving to me that this is a scientifically accurate process.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,120
Okay.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Number six, Jared Leto.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,520
Yes.

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,120
Maybe even should be higher.

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,600
Well, I don't know.

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Let's see.

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,360
There might be some superstars up on top.

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,760
Hang on, hang on.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
Number five, Dane Cook.

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,680
Yes.

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
Holy shit.

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,080
So good.

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,240
Number four, Johnny Depp.

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,720
Wow.

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,960
Oh my god, these are very good.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,760
Number three, Shia LaBeouf.

72
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,480
Yes.

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm not sure about that one.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
I feel like he's ranking a bit high there.

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Yeah, I feel like maybe-

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
Number two is Macklemore.

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,880
And number one, John Leguizamo, of course.

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,680
No, number one is Criss Angel.

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,440
Oh, holy shit.

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Wow.

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,800
He probably has literal vape magic tricks.

82
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,920
He probably vapes and there's no vape rig around.

83
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
And people are like, how did you do that?

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
And he's just like, mind freak.

85
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't want our vaping listeners, because I know

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
there's a contingent of them, to feel like we are in any way

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,640
marginalizing you.

88
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
There is not a stigma attached.

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,840
I don't have a word to attach to this stigma,

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,800
because I don't necessarily dislike these people.

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm just like, yeah, that's right.

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
I don't think we are either pro or against,

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
so much as we're just like, this is a thing that's going on.

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,960
Sorry, boys.

95
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
I didn't understand what you're talking about.

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
I'm very much against these people.

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, not those people.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm talking about vape.

99
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
Say for Shia.

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
I think it's time for Shia to find his way back.

101
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,360
But I don't know.

102
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
I don't want our vaping listeners

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
to feel like we're picking on them or making fun of them.

104
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,600
That's not accurate.

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,320
Where's our ranking?

106
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,440
Because I know we're in the mix.

107
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
And then there's a special section

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
that is brothers most to least likely to vape.

109
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,240
Number three, Justin McElroy.

110
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,280
Number two, Travis McElroy.

111
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,760
Number one brother most likely to vape, Griffin McElroy.

112
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,120
I would think I was least likely to vape.

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,840
Here's the thing.

114
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,360
I do talk about cotton and rev.

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,640
I know the most terminology.

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,600
You do know a lot of terms.

117
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
That's just, I'm an admirer of the tumblers.

118
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,840
You're more a fanatic than you are like a brother.

119
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,280
Like if you knew a lot about baseball,

120
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
that doesn't mean you're most likely to play baseball.

121
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,160
That's true.

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
That just means you follow the sport.

123
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,560
So anyway.

124
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
Weak low lung capacity.

125
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
So not built for the stuff.

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,840
So anyway, whichonvapes.com is that website.

127
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,800
It's whichonvapes.com.

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
Oh, you've got the actual redirect.

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,200
I booked it last time.

130
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
And now the redirect is working.

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,440
So whichonvapes.com.

132
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,400
Shout out to Auburn.

133
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,920
Auburn pulled down the URL, whichonvap.es, which is good shit.

134
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,720
Very good, too.

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
But now the redirect is working.

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,440
Gene Hagan versus Margot Robbie.

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
Oh, I don't think Margot.

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,160
Yeah, I wouldn't think so.

139
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,920
I actually think it's Margot Robbie.

140
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,680
OK, and there's some odd ones in there for some reason.

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,040
A Mako Shark is one of the options that people have popped up.

142
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,520
Anyway.

143
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
This is our last episode that we're recording all together

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
before we wrap on the show this Friday with The Candlelight

145
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,480
Show, which I'm excited to see everybody at.

146
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
Going to be a big fun crowd.

147
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
And then next week, back to remote, back to the distance.

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
I've grown so used to recording with you guys in the same room,

149
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,840
I don't know how I'll return to the comfort of not

150
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,440
having to stare at your faces.

151
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
It's going to be real good.

152
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,680
We'll figure it out.

153
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,640
But anyway, thanks for hanging in with us.

154
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,440
And we love you all very much.

155
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
And now it is time to do what we get paid to do.

156
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,440
What brought us here.

157
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
It is time to dance with Hoobrunga.

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,640
Advice.

159
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,400
Advice brung us.

160
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Advice brung us.

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,240
And now we're bringing advice.

162
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
Here it comes.

163
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
I love my fiance and we've lived together for almost three years.

164
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
However, she has one annoying habit.

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,840
She always drinks only two thirds of a glass of water

166
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,760
and then just leaves the still partially full cup behind.

167
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,840
I keep asking her to either finish them or take them to the kitchen to be washed.

168
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
She insists she may want to finish it later.

169
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
Nonsense.

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,320
So my question is this.

171
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,480
How do I get her to clean up her mess?

172
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,440
Or should I be concerned about an upcoming invasion of Earth by aliens whose skin is

173
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,080
burned by water?

174
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
Death from terribly vexed and Terre Haute.

175
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah, I mean, it's got amoebas in it.

176
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,080
Yeah, it's got amoebas.

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
That's what the girl in the amoeba says.

178
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,600
There's an important question here, which is,

179
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,800
is there any frequency at which she does actually ever pick up old glasses and drink out of them?

180
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
Or does she just constantly say,

181
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,040
I may want to finish it later and never does it?

182
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,520
Yeah, is there any evidence to support this I'll finish it later theory?

183
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know.

184
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,440
Why are you looking at me?

185
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't ask the question.

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Answer the fucking question, Justin.

187
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,000
What are you hiding, Justin?

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
Follow the money.

189
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,200
I don't know.

190
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
I mean, I wouldn't think so.

191
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,600
I think if she was cleaning up after herself, this would be quite the odd question.

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
Also, no one has ever looked at the,

193
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
no one has ever been thirsty and looked at a third cup of anything and thought,

194
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200
mmm, yeah.

195
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,280
Ooh, age to perfection.

196
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,760
You never, like, in an ad for Pepsi,

197
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,960
you never see somebody just pick up a one-third full cup of flat Pepsi and be like,

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,720
mmm, the taste of the next generation.

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,880
What's the tipping point for water?

200
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,160
Because there's definitely,

201
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I have a glass of water at my bedside every night,

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,480
and my bedtime routine is make a pee-pee, brush my teeth first,

203
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,240
and then get a new glass of water,

204
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
because I won't drink that old shit.

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
Here's an old glass of water.

206
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,680
Here's an old glass.

207
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
There's literally two within reach.

208
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah.

209
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,400
What's the tipping point?

210
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,320
Like, how many hours old does it,

211
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,120
and what's getting in there to make it taste so weird?

212
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,760
Because it does.

213
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,320
It does taste weird.

214
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,840
You know, Griffin, for me, it's a sliding scale.

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,920
I can put my finger on it, but the answer for me is,

216
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:39,040
if I can't remember when I put it down, it's too old.

217
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,960
Because at that point, who put it down?

218
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,600
Exactly.

219
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,240
Because that's the thing.

220
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,760
I don't know why my fear with old water is always,

221
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
did someone else perhaps touch this?

222
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,840
That's why I put ice cubes in my drink,

223
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,360
not because I like the coolness of it,

224
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,280
but because ice cubes are like, hey, this shit's still good to go.

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,120
Listen, this is weird to me,

226
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,680
because if I screw up my courage enough to actually drink just plain water,

227
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,720
I get the cup, I fill it with some water,

228
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
I drink as much as I'm going to, and I put the cup back right away.

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,600
No, I've noticed-

230
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
I don't carry water with me.

231
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,840
That's a lie, because I've noticed you have a fun little blue bottle,

232
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,040
and it's like your water friend.

233
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,080
Well, that's a water bottle.

234
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,960
That's different.

235
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah, but like, you just lied to us.

236
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,960
Oh, that's a good solution, though.

237
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,240
Get some sort of like one of those aluminum bottle buddies

238
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,960
for your girlfriend, and be like, okay, great.

239
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,400
This you can seal back up, and then actually drink later.

240
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,280
I know what you're saying.

241
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah, get her a helmet with slots for two cups on it.

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,480
Exactly.

243
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,640
And straws that come down from them, and she can just slurp all they love.

244
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
And that's fun, too, because you can decorate it

245
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,000
to be like her favorite pro sports team.

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
Pro wrestler.

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
Maybe you put some horns on there, like a big mohawk.

248
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,200
That's fun.

249
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,920
That's fun.

250
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,720
And you got to stay hydrated, and you got to stay fun with it.

251
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
That's what I always say.

252
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
That's what relationships are really about,

253
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,280
forcing your partner to drink in the way that you are most comfortable.

254
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,840
Exactly.

255
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,640
Just shaping them to be more what you think they should be.

256
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,120
What's up with water, though?

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
Because I'll never leave a third of a cup of Diet Dr. Pepper sitting around.

258
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
That's Diet Dr. Pepper.

259
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
Somebody's been cleaning up after you for two weeks.

260
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm going to go ahead and say that's incorrect.

261
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,360
It's good to go.

262
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
That's Diet Dr. Pepper.

263
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I would never leave a soldier behind like that.

264
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,280
Water, I can get you out of the same room that the toilet's in, Water.

265
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,560
That's what you are to me.

266
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,200
If you think about it, it's completely nonsensical.

267
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,760
Don't worry about a glass of water sitting out in the air.

268
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
Because that's the same air you're breathing.

269
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,440
It's different, though.

270
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
Except in one circumstance, if it's under a ceiling fan,

271
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
because everything's coming off that fan.

272
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,840
Yeah, that's it.

273
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,360
Everything's coming off that fan.

274
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,960
Let's establish some danger zones.

275
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,640
Now, Justin just spilled some Monster Energy drink on himself.

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,800
Under the ceiling fan, can't drink that water ever again.

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
There's a lot of bad stuff in there.

278
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,640
Under the air conditioning vent, I don't know who's up there or what they're doing.

279
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
Other places, if I enter the bathroom with a cup of water, that's where that lives now.

280
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,360
Because the bathroom air is bad.

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
Kitchen, I don't know.

282
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
Chicken particles could be floating around in there.

283
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,360
Salmonella.

284
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
Can't have the water around there.

285
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
This might just be very localized to me.

286
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
But if I see my cat within 30 feet of it, I can't trust it.

287
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
Because my cat will shove her whole face into a glass

288
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
to get a little sip of water from my water.

289
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,800
Why does the water taste different, though?

290
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,520
What's getting in there to make it taste so bad?

291
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,080
Fluoride.

292
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,120
The fluoride's in it before it starts.

293
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,960
But then it controls your mind and tells you it tastes bad,

294
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,040
so you drink more, so you get the water pressure's up.

295
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,760
Follow the money.

296
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,720
Is it dust?

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,440
Is it just dust particles from...

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm breathing it all the time.

299
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,340
Here.

300
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,240
I'm not tasting the bad taste in my mouth from the air.

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
Griffin, perhaps your supposition is incorrect.

302
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
It's not what's getting into the water, but rather what is leaving the water.

303
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
All the good flavors evaporating out as it sits in the open air.

304
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
This is all perspective, though.

305
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,560
Did you ever have friends in school when they showed up and they had a smell?

306
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,400
That was just what their house smelled like.

307
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,840
You knew that you'd left some clothes there

308
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
because they would have that person's house smell.

309
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,280
Nobody knows their own house smell.

310
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,000
That's true.

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
I worry about that all the time.

312
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Go away from your house for two weeks and come back,

313
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,440
and you're like, oh, this is me.

314
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
This is my brand.

315
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,640
That's really actually very jarring when you're on vacation for a week

316
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,440
and you come back and you're like, whoa.

317
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
Who made grilled cheese?

318
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,040
Oh, wait a minute.

319
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,000
It's always grilled cheese up in here.

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,040
That's always my house.

321
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,760
Oh, no.

322
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,120
I'm grilled cheese man.

323
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
And everyone else who's ever come into my house knows it.

324
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,960
That's why Candles got invented.

325
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,280
It's just air hacking.

326
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,840
I call Candles air hackers.

327
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,960
Hey, do you have a Yahoo?

328
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
Hack the air.

329
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,880
I got this one.

330
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,080
I'm gonna send him by level 9,000.

331
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Yeah, Drew answers user Johnny, who asks,

332
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,840
by the way, we got to talk about that hack.

333
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,400
There's a Yahoo hack, like 500 million accounts exposed.

334
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
How's your guys shit going?

335
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,840
Doesn't sound like it's going very good.

336
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,800
Hey, Yahoo answers are definitely gonna be dead like by next week, right?

337
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,040
You're gonna have to sell it to pay for all the accounts.

338
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,680
All the hacks.

339
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,480
All the hacking.

340
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,280
Okay, great.

341
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:05,920
Hey, their information got 500 million people hacked, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

342
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,800
Half a bill, no big deal.

343
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
Half a bill, no big deal.

344
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,760
Who has got Yahoo account?

345
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
Like, what are you keeping on there?

346
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,960
What are the secrets?

347
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,520
All right, Griff, I'm ready.

348
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,640
Hit me with Yahoo.

349
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,200
All right, this one is asked by Yahoo answers user Johnny, who asks,

350
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,320
are roller coaster good for you?

351
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,440
Update, like for your body.

352
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
Are roller coaster good for you?

353
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,520
Are roller coaster good for you?

354
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,920
Let's talk about the health benefits of a coaster.

355
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,080
Good for, here's what I say, massages, very good for you.

356
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,920
Moving the toxins around, I guess.

357
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Yeah.

358
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,640
Squeezing the nodules and getting the bad stuff out

359
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,200
and moving the bad stuff to the good nodules.

360
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,840
And then releasing the knots and the tension and the aura.

361
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,200
I think a good coaster, flipsy spins all around.

362
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,120
And when you get out of the end of it, your muscles are all confused

363
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,560
and just loose and wild.

364
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,040
I think it's like a reverse massage.

365
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,920
It's like putting tension into the body.

366
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,960
It's not rubbing you in the specific way you need to be rubbed.

367
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,240
Let me posit a circumstance in which it can be very good for your body.

368
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,960
Okay.

369
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,560
A kidney stone.

370
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,520
Just breaks it all up.

371
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,240
Well, you got lodged in there, you can't get it out.

372
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,840
You can't get the kidney stone out.

373
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,320
Maybe it's lodged in there, shaped like an arrowhead

374
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
and it's buried in like the wall of your kidney.

375
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,960
Jesus, come on.

376
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm sorry, Griffin.

377
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,640
So you're positing that like,

378
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
oh, I have a really big kidney stone.

379
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,840
What am I gonna do today?

380
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,240
I think I'm gonna hit up Great Adventure.

381
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,960
Just get out there.

382
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,360
Yeah.

383
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
Is Great Adventure a park?

384
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,120
It's a park, isn't it?

385
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,680
I have no fucking idea.

386
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,640
Let me try one that I know.

387
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm gonna go to King's Island.

388
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,480
Yeah.

389
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
Yeah, I feel like we talk about King's Island a lot.

390
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,120
King's Island's really great.

391
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,520
I think roller coaster good for me because,

392
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,240
and this is just like,

393
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,080
I don't know if you guys know this about me,

394
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,280
it's just like a fun weird,

395
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,160
like a very random, just like funny thing.

396
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
It's the only way I can get a boner.

397
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
Oh no, what?

398
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,080
Yeah.

399
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,600
So I'll hop on like the Harry Potter experience.

400
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,480
I haven't actually been there,

401
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,800
but I'm sure I would go hog hyphen wild on it.

402
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
But yeah, I'll just go on a roller coaster

403
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
and get a bone bone and then, you know.

404
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
Is that good for you?

405
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,360
It'll last me a little, you know, long enough.

406
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
And then it's, I guess,

407
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,080
I mean, the closest amusement park to me

408
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,720
is Six Flags Fiesta, Texas,

409
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,480
which is about an hour and a half drive.

410
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
So it takes some work.

411
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,200
Is it really called Six Flags Fiesta, Texas?

412
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
And I don't think it's in a town called Fiesta.

413
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,920
I think it's just like letting you know,

414
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,480
hey, it's time to party, specifically Griffin.

415
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,600
So I have an annual pass.

416
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,120
They basically just let me come and go.

417
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm good friends with Barry who runs the rides there.

418
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,120
All the rides, huh?

419
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Well, just the one closest to the entrance

420
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
because I'll just like run in there, just dart in there.

421
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,600
Be like, yo, Barry.

422
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
He's like, yo, trying to get wood?

423
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,480
And I'm like, yeah.

424
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,600
And so I'll hop on it.

425
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,640
So Barry knows.

426
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,080
Yeah, Barry knows, Barry knows, Barry knows.

427
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,720
And then we'll go and then there's a, yeah.

428
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
I don't think roller coasters are good for your body.

429
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
Well, I disagree because it's the, again,

430
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,200
it's the only way I get more.

431
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,840
Yeah, okay, you've got an affliction.

432
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm saying like by and large,

433
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,800
I think there's like,

434
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,640
I think you're kind of getting beat up in there.

435
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
I don't know that I've ever gotten off a roller coaster

436
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,320
and thought, ah, better.

437
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,200
That's the stuff.

438
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Is adrenaline good for your body though?

439
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,760
Fuck yeah, dude.

440
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,600
Fight or flight getting triggered?

441
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
That's good because you go in there and you,

442
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,240
like you go into,

443
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,000
sometimes you just got to fight a roller coaster.

444
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,720
You know what I mean?

445
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,280
Yeah.

446
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,760
Yeah.

447
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,040
It's a very aggressive, very just sexual experience.

448
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
It's just being on a roller,

449
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,960
just being on a good coaster.

450
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
Is it the loops that give you the wood Griffin?

451
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,200
The what now?

452
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,640
I don't want to, I don't want to circle back,

453
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,840
but is it the loops that give you the wood?

454
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,920
I think it's just a blood flow thing.

455
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
It's getting on one with a good corkscrew

456
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
and then the centrifugal force

457
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
just puts my blood exactly where I need it.

458
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
The tip of your penis.

459
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:48,960
Well.

460
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,680
It's a little lewd Travis.

461
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
It's a little lewd to talk about that.

462
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
Are roller coasters good for your body though?

463
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,000
Do you think?

464
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,280
Probably.

465
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
Holistically speaking, I think they're like a net loss.

466
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
I think you get bruised.

467
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,120
I think you get shaken all around.

468
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,080
Sometimes your head goes,

469
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,800
between the two head rest.

470
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,680
This is true.

471
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,240
Could you make a roller coaster that is good for your body?

472
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,560
Okay.

473
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm saying that maybe like,

474
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,440
that's what you go into,

475
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,480
design like,

476
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,200
hey everybody,

477
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,720
this roller coaster is going to feel like a nap.

478
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,600
At the bottom,

479
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,320
what about this?

480
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,680
At the bottom of the dip.

481
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,480
Going up, going up,

482
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,200
going up, going up.

483
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm going down.

484
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,080
I'm screaming.

485
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,880
My mouth is open.

486
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,200
What's at the bottom?

487
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,920
Salad.

488
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,480
You're just going through, you're fine.

489
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,520
You're just like shoving it in there.

490
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,800
And then halfway through the ride,

491
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,200
it just stops for 45 minutes and like a pillow comes out

492
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,420
and you can just take like,

493
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,000
just a quick 45 minute nap

494
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
because that's always good for everybody.

495
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,120
45 minute nap is a fucking nightmare

496
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,960
and I wish you would know.

497
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,800
21 minute nap?

498
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,880
26 minute nap is like where you want to be.

499
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,400
Well, agree to disagree, I prefer 21 minutes.

500
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,000
So Emma Martina Luigia Marano,

501
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,200
born 29 November 1899, is the oldest living person.

502
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,600
And by the way, internet,

503
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,000
it took me a way too long to figure this out.

504
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,120
We should just, if I type oldest,

505
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
then there should be a website called oldest living person

506
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,560
that just tracks that shit.

507
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,720
Maybe that's the next project

508
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,840
from the people who brought you which one vapes.

509
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,920
Anyway, Emma, huge coaster head.

510
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,280
So there's something, there's something there.

511
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,240
What's the quote?

512
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,140
Is there, you said there was a quote in there

513
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,360
about like how much Emma loves coasters.

514
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,060
Yeah, it says, boy howdy,

515
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,200
I just love getting spun around

516
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,480
and getting wood on these coasties.

517
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Wait a minute.

518
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,940
And it says I can't do them anymore though

519
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,360
because I would turn to dust if I went on a roller.

520
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,160
If this woman went on Son of Beast at Kings Island,

521
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
she would just be reduced to ash.

522
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
Doesn't, it doesn't, it's been closed for a half decade.

523
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,800
She would, it would be quite a feat

524
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,720
if she went on the non-existent roller coaster.

525
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,000
But anyway, huge coaster head, Emma Marano.

526
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,640
No big deal, just like 116 years old.

527
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,480
That's pretty good.

528
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,940
116 years young.

529
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,780
No, old.

530
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,280
No, she's very old actually.

531
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,160
Looking really good though.

532
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,540
The top result is also Emma Martina Luigi Marano diet.

533
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,280
If you type in Emma, then like it fills to that

534
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
because you know some people are like,

535
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
I wanna be 116.

536
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,760
Secret, I'm guessing, lots of pasta,

537
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,120
lots of coasties, lots of wood.

538
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,720
Okay, that's one option.

539
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,920
That's one option is just you gotta move the blood around

540
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,480
and you gotta fill that tummy with pasta.

541
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,840
Gotta get that wood.

542
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
The last few days, someone has left a bike

543
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
parked on my sidewalk near my house.

544
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,240
Kickstand down, no lock.

545
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,600
Just standing there and not even in front of any residents.

546
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
It's not in bad shape.

547
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,160
It only needs a new front tire to be rideable.

548
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,860
I was sitting there for three days straight

549
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,700
with no movement. It was sitting there.

550
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,120
You weren't sitting there watching it, just not moving,

551
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,660
afraid the bike would run away if you made sudden movements.

552
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,660
It was sitting there for about three days straight

553
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,380
with no movement or anyone coming to get it.

554
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,800
So I said, fuck it and took it, am I good?

555
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,840
That was from Cycle Salvage in the American South.

556
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,780
It's from bike thief in Birmingham.

557
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,240
Thief, a bike taker.

558
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,680
This person's a bike thief, right?

559
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,520
Yeah, you took the bike.

560
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,360
I'm sorry, you're back.

561
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,040
Like, how long would a car need to sit on the street

562
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,440
before you're like, no one's coming back for this car, yeah.

563
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,440
That hooptie's got a busted spoiler.

564
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm just gonna take it.

565
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
What?

566
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,600
It sat in front of my house for three days

567
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,800
and no one moved the car, so I guess it's a free car.

568
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,920
You know, I tried the handle and it was unlocked,

569
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,240
so I grand thefted the auto.

570
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,160
You can't just take a thing

571
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,800
because someone left it stationary.

572
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,800
This thing is old and bad, so it's mine now.

573
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,540
It wasn't a fucking cat that you found outside

574
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,560
that was hungry, it was a person's bicycle

575
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,720
that maybe they need to reinflate the front tire,

576
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,160
but that's no excuse.

577
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,340
You're on some wisdom of Solomon shit,

578
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,200
like the bike goes to the person who loves it the most.

579
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,960
And maybe you're about to like try to deny this,

580
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,000
but let me ask you this,

581
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,040
and be brutally honest with both me and yourself.

582
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,840
What kind of due diligence did you do?

583
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,200
Did you put signs up that were like,

584
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,080
hey, if you come looking for this bike,

585
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,880
I've got it, it's safe, you can have it,

586
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,800
or were you just like, this is mine,

587
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
no one will ever know this is mine?

588
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,320
Like how much work did you do to make sure

589
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,080
the rightful owner would not think,

590
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,240
I know, crazy, it was just stolen?

591
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,960
It's just, you just stole it.

592
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,120
You just kind of stole a bike a little bit.

593
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,280
It's not the worst stealing of a bike that ever was.

594
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,120
No, it's not like you chopped the lock

595
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,280
and took a little kid's huffy, but it's not great.

596
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,600
God, I would love to have been there

597
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,160
when you finally broke and just did the damn dirty thing.

598
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,360
Can you imagine where you have to be at,

599
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,360
just like, okay, fuck it, I'm just gonna do it.

600
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,080
Just like you had to stick your courage

601
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,120
to the sticking place and just like walk

602
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,880
down your driveway and just like grab it.

603
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,140
Like, am I really doing this?

604
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,560
Am I really, I bet it was so exciting.

605
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,400
I bet you were thrilled.

606
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,680
Like, am I really stealing this bike?

607
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,240
Oh my God, I'm stealing this bike.

608
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,080
I'm doing this.

609
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,400
I bet they did it slow at first,

610
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,680
like they probably eased up and acted like

611
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,520
they weren't taking it.

612
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,760
They were just like dusting off.

613
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,240
And yelled, and yelled like, I'm taking this bike now.

614
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,440
I hope nobody stops me.

615
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,280
You're lucky as shit that you weren't bait by, oh yeah.

616
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,200
John Keenanus was across the street in a car.

617
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,400
Detective John Keenanus.

618
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,080
It was an episode of What Would You Do?

619
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,400
And you just lost the morality test.

620
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,240
I will say it is impressive that no one

621
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
just stole it.

622
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,920
Yeah.

623
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,740
I mean, someone did.

624
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,580
Someone did.

625
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,420
Steal it.

626
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,760
That person was the you.

627
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,040
I would love a followup where John Keenanus

628
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,800
does join a police force and becomes Detective John Keenanus

629
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,360
in a sequel show called What Did You Do?

630
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,520
And he just busts people for crime.

631
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,660
He's like, I've got a special TV segment.

632
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,140
You stole the bicycle and we've been filming it

633
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,080
for three days.

634
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh, well, yeah, I guess you got me.

635
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,440
I guess I learned my lesson.

636
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,320
You sure did.

637
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,160
You have the right to fucking remain silent.

638
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm Detective John Keenanus.

639
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,020
No second chances.

640
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,180
That's the third.

641
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,020
That's the kind of man I am.

642
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,120
That's the kind of man I am.

643
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,680
No more you took the bike fever.

644
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,840
You stole it.

645
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,680
You did.

646
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,580
You did steal it.

647
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,080
Okay, break it down into its base components.

648
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,320
There was a thing that was not yours.

649
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,160
Yes.

650
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,080
And you made it yours.

651
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
By way of your taking of it.

652
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,720
Without paying for it or even asking

653
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,040
for permission of a thing.

654
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes.

655
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's stealing.

656
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,920
That's, and I don't-

657
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,240
I've just described stealing.

658
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,040
I mean, let's be honest.

659
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,080
That bike was probably stolen from someone else, right?

660
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,920
Every bike has been stolen.

661
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm gonna go back to Austin and open up my garage

662
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,680
and both of my bikes are gone.

663
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,280
So like all bikes are stolen.

664
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,120
Yeah.

665
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,940
Basically.

666
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,080
I think someone stole this and then like,

667
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,040
maybe they lost their nerve or saw a cop or something.

668
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,480
Yeah, maybe it's cursed.

669
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,500
It could be a curse.

670
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,160
It could be one of those Jumanji bikes.

671
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,120
Could be a Jumanji bike.

672
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,200
And now you're what, riding it around?

673
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,640
Okay, listen, question asker, here's my question for you.

674
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
You take your hot bike,

675
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,760
you're riding your hot bike around the neighborhood

676
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,900
and somebody goes, hey, I think that's my bike.

677
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,300
How do you respond?

678
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,880
Because that's going to color like the rest of my,

679
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
if you're like, oh, it was sitting in front of my house.

680
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,300
And you question asker,

681
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,920
the fact that your mind is racing right now

682
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,680
to think about ways to prevent this,

683
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,240
that the proof is in the pudding right there.

684
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
I mean, you stole the bike.

685
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm worried that now,

686
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,460
after the thrill of stealing a bike has happened,

687
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,120
that you're now going to crave that high again.

688
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,760
And like, I don't know that,

689
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,040
I don't know that any bike is safe around you now, you know?

690
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,800
And then pretty soon it'll be a velocipede, you know?

691
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,240
There's only one circumstance

692
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,180
in which you find a bike in the wild

693
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,160
and you can make it yours.

694
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,280
And I think it's if you fish it out of the river.

695
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,600
Yeah. If you go fishing,

696
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,860
and this is why most people fish,

697
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,000
like it's not to fish, it's fucking boring.

698
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,920
They're all hoping to get a bike.

699
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,960
Well, because that's not stealing,

700
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,920
that's rescuing a bike.

701
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,480
You saved a bike at that point.

702
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,080
And it's good for the environment.

703
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,920
Yeah.

704
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,320
I want to suggest sort of middle ground

705
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,280
and see how it grabs you guys.

706
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,120
Okay.

707
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,040
What if you take the bike and ride it as your own,

708
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,040
but every night when you're done with the bike,

709
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,720
you return it to the sidewalk

710
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,120
and leave it standing there just where you found it.

711
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
For somebody that steal a bike,

712
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,520
don't have a bike, steal a bike,

713
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,200
have a bike, give it to be stole the bike.

714
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,840
No, I'm saying you like,

715
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,080
don't try to break this wild bike.

716
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,040
Don't try to like make it yours.

717
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,560
I'm saying like, leave it as a wild bike

718
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,280
that when you need a bike, it's there for you.

719
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,320
It's a community bike, but you ride it,

720
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
but you don't try to take possession of it.

721
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,160
You just use it when you need it.

722
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,760
And if it's no longer there at some point, oh well.

723
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,040
That bike's moved on to its next purpose.

724
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,880
Because what are you doing by taking it?

725
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,800
Here's what you're really,

726
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,020
like let's put a pin in it.

727
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,160
When you take it, what you're saying is,

728
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,280
I hope no one else steals, this is for I do.

729
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,120
Yeah.

730
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,360
That's all you're doing is like,

731
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm gonna pre-steal this so no one steals it

732
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,240
from the imagined possession that I've graded around it.

733
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,320
The only thing you can do now

734
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
is go throw it in the river

735
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,600
for some lucky fishermen to find.

736
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,620
And maybe leave a note on it that's just like,

737
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,800
this bike is not cursed or like, which bike?

738
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,600
And write on the note, serendipity.

739
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,080
Because I saw the movie a long time ago.

740
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,840
Well, you duct taped a DVD of serendipity to the bike.

741
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,560
Do they, if they throw the bike in

742
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,200
and then catch it themselves, is that then,

743
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,320
is it like baptism?

744
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,680
Is it then like, but they can't do it in the same,

745
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,160
it has to come back around to them.

746
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
They can't do it in the same event.

747
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,560
Through all the worlds.

748
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,380
Yeah. Okay.

749
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,280
Because also, the experiences that bike has had

750
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,960
will make it a fuller, richer bike.

751
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,800
You know what I mean?

752
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,680
If that bike is truly lived, you know?

753
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,840
Guys, I miss my bike.

754
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,840
I can't wait to get home and put some laps on it.

755
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,660
I miss my bike.

756
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,720
I can't wait to get home and tune her up.

757
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,520
Yeah, assuming it's still there.

758
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,080
Oh, it won't be, but if it is,

759
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,980
I'm gonna grease the chains and pump those wheels

760
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,820
and just tune her up.

761
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,040
Have you ever had a bike stolen from you?

762
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,640
Yeah, I had one stolen when I was a kid.

763
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,720
I had one stolen.

764
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,560
Grivance?

765
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,380
No, I'm due.

766
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,220
I'm due for it.

767
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,120
Mine was on the porch of the Fine Arts Building in Oklahoma

768
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,720
and my lock was broken on my U-bolt lock thing.

769
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,680
So I just kind of draped it around so it looked locked.

770
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,000
I was inside the building for about 20, 30 minutes

771
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,360
and came back out and it was gone.

772
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,420
And there was shrubbery and foliage all around the porch.

773
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,720
So someone had to walk up and check and test every bike

774
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,080
to steal my $80 Walmart bike.

775
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,320
No, I've never had a bike stolen,

776
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,160
but when I flew here for the TV show,

777
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,040
I left my bike and the front tire's a little beat up,

778
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,320
but I left it outside of somebody's house

779
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,520
and I just put the kickstand down.

780
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,460
I didn't lock it because Austin's a pretty friendly place.

781
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,320
So I left it there and I'm sure it'll be,

782
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,720
I'm sure it's not a big deal.

783
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,960
Someone's negligence is not an excuse

784
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,160
to steal things from them.

785
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,300
Yes, that's right.

786
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,820
They accidentally left their bike there.

787
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,560
Maybe they needed to run in some place real quick

788
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,960
and it took them longer than they thought it would.

789
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,800
Three days.

790
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,640
Yeah.

791
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,460
Three days longer than they thought it would.

792
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,520
They had to just run into that puzzle dungeon real quick.

793
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,340
Yeah.

794
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,560
Should we go to the money tone?

795
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,380
Yeah, let's go.

796
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,640
Wee!

797
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,320
I'm gonna need money to buy a new bike

798
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,440
because mine's in hell.

799
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,440
So our first sponsor this week is Blue Apron.

800
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,100
If you have been looking to maybe expand

801
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,420
your cooking prowess, but you don't know where to start,

802
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,640
it can be pretty intimidating,

803
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,140
but Blue Apron makes it really easy.

804
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,600
They're gonna deliver you a box

805
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,560
with all the food you need, fresh summer vegetables,

806
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,600
fresh, you know, great produce, great meats,

807
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,400
and step-by-step instructions with pictures

808
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,400
that'll let you create delicious home-cooked meals

809
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,440
with perfectly pre-proportioned, pre-proportioned?

810
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,520
I have a lot of trouble with that one every time.

811
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,360
Pre-proportioned ingredients?

812
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,120
Hey, Blue Apron, you make an incredible product

813
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,480
and your liner notes here that we're supposed to read

814
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
are pretty good, but I think we need to just come up

815
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,440
with a different word, because we just goof that one hard

816
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
each time.

817
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,720
And this is for less than $10 a meal, which is pretty great.

818
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,520
They've got variety, new recipes are created weekly

819
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,620
and are not repeated within a year.

820
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,100
You can customize what you want based on your preferences.

821
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,640
If you have, you know, dietary things

822
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,000
that you're trying to stick to,

823
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,960
Blue Apron can accommodate that.

824
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,800
And it's easy and fun.

825
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,920
Some meals that are coming down the pike in September,

826
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,120
paprika, spiced shrimp, and cheddar grits

827
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,920
with tomato and sweet corn, delicious.

828
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,880
Spicy hoisin, there's your ASMR, everyone.

829
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,720
Spicy hoisin.

830
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,780
Or they just threw up.

831
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,620
Chicken.

832
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,000
That's the mouth sound Griffin made was not.

833
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,640
That's how I, this is how, this is how I,

834
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,760
so I have different ways of eating each kind of food.

835
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,240
So the way that I did shrimp and grits was.

836
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,080
So keep, read the next one and I'll tell you how you got.

837
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,480
Spicy hoisin chicken stir fry with baby bok choy

838
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,060
and sesame ginger cucumber salad.

839
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,900
I love.

840
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,720
So that one, I do big bites, big animated bites on that one.

841
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,400
That sounds like a Sesame Street character

842
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,320
eating a transition into the next scene, like a monster.

843
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,340
What's the next one?

844
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm not doing any more.

845
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,640
Eggplant and chickpea, chickpea tag to gene.

846
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Fuck, we gotta learn how to say this word, fellas.

847
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,720
Anyway, that one's like.

848
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,360
And I do like a bunch of really quick little bites.

849
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Right.

850
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,020

856

Blueapron.com slash my brother.

857
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,320
What is that?

858
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,160
Kind of like bad corn.

859
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,360
Little bites, just little bites.

860
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,600
Little bites.

861
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,800
Can I tell you about Squarespace?

862
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,640
Wait.

863
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,820
I would like to tell you about Squarespace, please,

864
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,600
for once, can I just?

865
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,760
We never let Travis tell us about Squarespace.

866
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,080
Can I just, please?

867
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
But if it makes you feel any better,

868
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,320
it's because we think you're gonna do a really bad job.

869
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm not, I'm gonna do a good job.

870
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,820
So, you know, websites, where do you get them, right?

871
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,640
Like, it seems like everyone's got one

872
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,320
and they're like, maybe it's a website all about like,

873
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,680
I don't know, who vapes,

874
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,400
or like the invasion of Normandy or something.

875
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,960
I think you have to go to the store

876
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,640
or maybe there's like a government place

877
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,120
that you have to go to and ask them for a website

878
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
and then they do one.

879
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,400
You know what, I used to think that.

880
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,240
Yeah.

881
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,580
But no, you just go to squarespace.com.

882
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,360
They've already got a bunch of websites

883
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,040
that they'll just give you.

884
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,320
I don't think it works that way.

885
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,520
So they bought all the websites and then you go there

886
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,440
and they're like, that'll be $5 for a website.

887
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,480
And I say, okay.

888
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,000
An old man leads you down a dusty corridor

889
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,480
and he asks you some questions

890
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,400
about the kind of person you are.

891
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,200
And then he just reaches up and selects a website.

892
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,040
He grabs.

893
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,800
This one will do nicely.

894
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,960
Grabs an old Mason jar full of websites

895
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
and he unscrews the lid

896
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
and upends the websites out onto the table

897
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,980
and you get to pick the one you want.

898
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,200
He said, well, no, it couldn't be.

899
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,840
I've had this one here for years.

900
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,720
Certainly not.

901
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,760
Only one dark wizard has claimed this website before.

902
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,100
It doesn't work like this at all,

903
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,660
but it is very easy.

904
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,320
Travis, our prediction of you doing a bad job

905
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,520
like Swing Squarespace has been prescient.

906
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,540
Voldemort also has a website that uses Ruby.

907
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,160
I thought I was actually doing a pretty good job

908
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,920
till you got started on this old man tangent.

909
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,440
Well, no, this is the important thing about commercials

910
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,940
is to not let the other two brothers assail.

911
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,780
Yeah.

912
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,280
Stand your ground.

913
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,240
Let me run through it.

914
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,800
So Squarespace will teach you

915
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,420
and show you everything you need to know

916
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,040
to build a pretty amazing website.

917
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,880
I mean, macroshows.com on Squarespace.

918
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,360
It took me about 30 minutes.

919
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,000
How much did you have to pay the old man

920
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,600
at the store for macroshows?

921
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,560
I don't remember, but it was very reasonable.

922
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,000
It was a very low amount.

923
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Does he deal in trades?

924
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
No, but with every website,

925
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
you do get one Werther's original,

926
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,640
still warm from his pocket.

927
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,520
Travis, you are letting us walk all over you.

928
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,360
Let me tell you about the features.

929
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,380
It's easy.

930
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,200
You get a free custom domain.

931
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,520
They got beautiful templates, seamless commerce tools.

932
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,360
So if you want to make money off your website,

933
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,200
you can do that.

934
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Now, how did you fold the commerce tools into McElroy Shows?

935
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,240
Every time you click a link on macroshows.com,

936
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,080
you get charged $5.

937
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,600
What does the website man get?

938
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,880
The website man gets 4.99 of it.

939
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,720
That's a lot for the-

940
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,320
I get one penny, but I'm literally doing no work.

941
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,720
The website man doesn't,

942
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,180
he dresses very poorly.

943
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,440
And you would think,

944
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,040
with all the money he's making from the website residuals-

945
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,000
He's very invested.

946
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,840
He has a very diverse portfolio.

947
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,600
You are a fucking doormat right now.

948
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,960
Okay, let me try again.

949
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,040
They've got customer support out the wazoo 24-7.

950
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,800
You can talk to a human being who's going to help you out.

951
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,640
An old human being.

952
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,480
Just the same, just the old man.

953
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,040
Just an old man.

954
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,880
And you can-

955
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,700
He's very busy.

956
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,080

Go do it.

962
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,740
Start your own website.

963
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,060
Maybe have your own new cultural phenomenon,

964
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,760
like which one vapes.

965
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,960
I have a personal message here.

966
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,320
I wish I could be at the Squarespace offices

967
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,160
when he's like,

968
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,280
Valerie, get in here.

969
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,400
We found it.

970
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,620
The McElroy brothers found it.

971
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,920
The perfect advertisement for our website service.

972
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,920
You know that openly hostile sound you've been looking for?

973
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
Listen to this.

974
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,380
Got a personal message here.

975
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,300
Jumbotron message for Anthony,

976
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,060
soon to be Le Mou, Le Mou.

977
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,720
Le Mou?

978
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,680
And it's from Allison, soon to be Le Mou.

979
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Ha.

980
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Who says, I love you more than Griffin loves horses.

981
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,980
False.

982
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,040
Travis loves dogs.

983
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,880
Impossible.

984
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,160
And Justin loves not having to say big words in Jumbotrons.

985
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,000
Correct.

986
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,120
I can't wait to marry you on Saturday

987
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,280
and spend the rest of our lives

988
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,020
listening to the brothers together.

989
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,720
I love you so much, Burbles.

990
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,080
You can hit me up on my mobile anytime.

991
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,920
Oh, this wedding's actually happening this week.

992
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,760
We crushed it.

993
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,200
We stuck the landing on the date, folks.

994
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,920
October 1st is when Anthony and Allison are getting married.

995
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,440
Congratulations, you two are very excited.

996
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Hope everything goes well.

997
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm sure it will.

998
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,360
And enjoy your new life together.

999
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,760
I got a message for I-Tay, that's Allison Taylor,

1000
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,340
from Beelife, which is Blythe.

1001
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,800
Who is Blythe?

1002
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,360
Hey, happy birthday to you, I-Tay.

1003
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,340
Thank you for introducing me

1004
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,160
to the magical world of Bim Bam,

1005
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,480
biking and all things majestic.

1006
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,300
Cheers to all the bike riders and Mario, no, sorry.

1007
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,560
Hey, bike riders, thanks for listening to my message.

1008
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,680
Hey, hey, got a second bike riders.

1009
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,120
This one goes out to all the biker people out there.

1010
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,280
This goes to all the bike thieves out there.

1011
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,160
Take another run at this,

1012
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,680
read the rest of the fucking message.

1013
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,180
Thank you for introducing me

1014
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,380
to the magical world of Bim Bam,

1015
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,840
biking and all things majestic.

1016
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,620
Cheers to all the bike rides and Mario Kart times

1017
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,460
that are ahead.

1018
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,840
Also, happy birthday for like four years, girl.

1019
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,920
This one's for June.

1020
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,760
Didn't quite.

1021
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,400
So I wanged it just a little bit.

1022
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,240
Didn't quite get there.

1023
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,880
I feel like that you introduced,

1024
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,800
if I can double check this again,

1025
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,160
you were introduced by your friend

1026
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,240
to my brother, my brother, me,

1027
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,320
and the concept of biking.

1028
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,720
Yeah, it's tight, dude.

1029
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,560
You know cars?

1030
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,200
Imagine half of that.

1031
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,760
Hey, look what I stole for you.

1032
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,600
Look what I stole for you.

1033
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,200
It's like a car, but half of that and the engine is you.

1034
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,920
I would love to be in Blythe's childhood home

1035
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,240
when she sees kids outside moving quickly past the window

1036
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,960
on some kind of wonderful metal monster.

1037
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
If you're on a bike, you're the engine

1038
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,100
and all the food you ate that day is the fuel.

1039
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,940
Think about it.

1040
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,280
So you could go to Taco Bell and be like,

1041
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,360
I'm at the gas station for the me engine.

1042
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,200
If you think about it.

1043
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,920
Give me some bike fuel and a tostada.

1044
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
Can I get a bike?

1045
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,740
Can I get a Crunchwrap bike fuel?

1046
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm Barbara Gray.

1047
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm Brandi Posey.

1048
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,040
And I'm Tess Barker.

1049
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,120
We're Lady2Lady.

1050
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
Do you want a sleepover in your ears?

1051
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,880
Is that a friend in your pocket

1052
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,800
or are you just podcast to see me?

1053
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,760
We're a portable hangout.

1054
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,840
You can bring to the gym on the subway or on an oil rig.

1055
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,680
Seriously, we have listeners who do that.

1056
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,480
Chill with us while we get high with Margaret Cho.

1057
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,440
Talk showgirls with Katya from Drag Race.

1058
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,240
And hear Broadway star Anthony Rapp sing Hamilton.

1059
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,880
I am not throwing away my shot.

1060
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,280
I am not throwing away my shot.

1061
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,600
Hey yo, I'm just like my country.

1062
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,800
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

1063
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,160
and I'm not throwing away my shot.

1064
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,240
That's Lady2Lady.

1065
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Can you keep a secret?

1066
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,460
Neither can we.

1067
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,240
You guys want a Yahoo?

1068
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,440
You know what Griffin, I would.

1069
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,680
How about this one sent in by

1070
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,440
level 9000 Yahoo Juju Juju Juju Juju.

1071
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,080
It's from Yahoo Answers user 420.

1072
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,920
Nice.

1073
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,760
Who asks?

1074
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,060
That's not one that got removed.

1075
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,180
No. Amazing.

1076
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,160
And it's in pets horses asks,

1077
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,520
have you met or seen any celebrities

1078
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,720
through the horse world?

1079
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,320
Which is of course,

1080
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,440
if you look at a mirror during the dark hour,

1081
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,120
You can see into the horse world.

1082
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,800
You can peer through the Equestriaverse.

1083
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,880
You can peer into the Equestriaverse

1084
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,640
and its secrets will be revealed.

1085
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,520
I'm just wondering if anyone else has,

1086
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,520
I've seen Patrick Swayze, so this one's from a minute ago.

1087
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,000
I've seen Patrick Swayze at the, unless, oh my God.

1088
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,660
Swayze's in the Equestriaverse.

1089
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,460
Is that where he went?

1090
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,640
We've gotta get him out of there.

1091
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,600
Gotta get him out, DD2's gotta happen.

1092
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
Actually, you know what?

1093
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,520
DD2 did happen, by the way.

1094
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,160
Wait, wait, DD2. It's called Havana Nights.

1095
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,560
Yeah, DD3.

1096
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,400
Yep. Yeah.

1097
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,960
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

1098
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,080
I've seen Swayze at the Kentucky Horse Park before

1099
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,240
and in WEF, that's the Winter Equestrian Festival,

1100
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,200
in Florida, Seinfeld was there because his daughter rides

1101
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,360
and I talked to him.

1102
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1103
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,620
Here's what I said.

1104
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1105
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,320
Mary Kate Olsen tried my friend's horse the other week.

1106
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,440
Let me, let me try your horse.

1107
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,000
It is mine now.

1108
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,880
So we get to talk to her

1109
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,040
and I shook Steven Spielberg's hand.

1110
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,200
His daughter was in my junior hunter class.

1111
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,760
That's for hunting horses.

1112
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,600
The horse world.

1113
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1114
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,680
Like you see him out in the wild like,

1115
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,240
shh, shh, shh, I got a shot.

1116
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,720
No, you don't kill the horses.

1117
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
You ride the horses into the hunt.

1118
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,960
It's just you and the horse killing

1119
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,760
much smaller defenseless animals.

1120
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,960
I just think it's cool that celebs compete

1121
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,160
in the same sport I do and when they're in the horse world,

1122
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,600
they're still viewed as celebrities,

1123
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,140
but people generally leave them alone

1124
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,780
like they're normal people showing.

1125
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,160
No paparazzi or anything scattering.

1126
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,880
Ah, a blessy.

1127
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,020
Oh, thank you.

1128
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,680
No paparazzi or anything annoying scattering to them

1129
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,380
or to talk or greet them.

1130
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,920
It's just interesting.

1131
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,160
Do you have any celeb stories that relate to horses?

1132
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,420
Cher!

1133
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,260
I love to hear them.

1134
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,080
Oh, Cher?

1135
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,520
Yeah, she loves riding horses.

1136
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,360
Cher me those.

1137
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,720
Cher, Cher, nice horse!

1138
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,000
Hey, Cher!

1139
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,320
This person, through being a part of the horse world,

1140
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,000
has met Seinfeld Spielberg.

1141
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,840
Yes.

1142
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,660
Married Kate.

1143
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,040
Uh-huh.

1144
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,880
Suaz.

1145
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Suaz, Suaze, and like everybody's just totally chill.

1146
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,440
Yeah, everybody's totally chill with that.

1147
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,280
I'm saying that the horse world is fucking star-studded.

1148
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,440
Do you know who loves horses?

1149
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,280
Who?

1150
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,120
I'll give you two people who love horses.

1151
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,200
Please tell me now.

1152
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,120
Martha Stewart.

1153
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,960
Okay.

1154
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,780
Crazy about them.

1155
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,620
Channing Tatum.

1156
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,460
Yes, very much so.

1157
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,280
Crazy for horses.

1158
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,120
That makes perfect sense.

1159
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,040
Goes crazy for them.

1160
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,880
He's got his own.

1161
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,720
He's gone riding with Martha Stewart.

1162
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,320
I know this from Baby Geniuses.

1163
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,360
They do a whole segment called Band Challenge

1164
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,520
about Martha Stewart's pony, Band Challenge.

1165
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,300
Hunter Jumper says,

1166
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,600
I've never met anyone at a horse show, frown face, but.

1167
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,400
Never, and I mean, I've never met anyone at a horse show.

1168
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,000
But Bill Gates used to work with my dad

1169
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,400
and would come speak at his meetings.

1170
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,280
Same with Steve Jobs.

1171
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,840
My friend was in the Justin Bieber movie

1172
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,140
and a close family friend has worked with Channing Tatum.

1173
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,240
My family also goes to the TED conferences every year.

1174
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,080
We meet a lot of people there.

1175
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,920
Hold on!

1176
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,740
Hold the fucking phone!

1177
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,080
That's not what we asked!

1178
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,720
It's not, have you ever met anyone, period.

1179
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,240
That's a really acceptable diversion.

1180
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,200
Justin, have you ever met anybody at the horse thing?

1181
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,000
Well, no, but I saw Dave Chappelle

1182
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,480
on the street in New York once.

1183
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,320
So that was cool.

1184
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,160
So that was cool.

1185
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,000
Also, my dad is Steve Jobs, so fuck you.

1186
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,200
My dad hangs out with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, or did.

1187
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,040
Did, yeah.

1188
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,920
We've just lost a lot of people since September 4th, 2009.

1189
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,080
Have you guys ever met anyone through the horse world?

1190
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Have I met anyone through the horse world?

1191
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,280
So one time during the dark hour,

1192
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,520
I did look into the mirror during,

1193
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,820
it was a thunderstorm outside,

1194
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,540
and I looked into the mirror

1195
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,540
and Wanda Sykes was on the other side.

1196
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,400
Wow!

1197
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,640
Yeah, Wanda Sykes was looking.

1198
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
She was also, during the dark hour,

1199
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,440
was looking into the mirror through the Equestriaverse.

1200
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,040
And it was hard to see her through all the billowing mains

1201
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,120
and just sort of like dust clouds being kicked up

1202
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,560
while these Mustangs just sort of ran through.

1203
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,520
But yeah, we definitely saw, and I waved and she waved.

1204
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,960
She looked a little bit uncomfortable, but it was nice.

1205
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,680
Did she have a prophetic message for you?

1206
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,880
Because I've heard if you look in the mirror

1207
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,160
in the dark hour and you see Wanda Sykes

1208
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,740
in the horse world, she'll tell you something

1209
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,600
that you wish you didn't know about your future.

1210
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,040
I mean, any communication was sort of,

1211
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,500
language gets destroyed in the horse world.

1212
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,520
So it's really, it's tough.

1213
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,200
It was just Wanda Sykes screaming.

1214
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,400
It was Wanda Sykes, and she was screaming something.

1215
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,440
And I was trying to read her lips,

1216
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,840
but there were so many horses.

1217
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,840
That's the worst part, she was screaming a date.

1218
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,680
Just over and over.

1219
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,500
And she actually reached out

1220
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,880
and she wrote something on a notepad.

1221
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,000
And as soon as she held it up, her mirror shattered

1222
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,560
and she was actually lost to the horse world.

1223
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,360
Oh, I hate to see that.

1224
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,960
You hate that when that happens.

1225
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,520
I've never met anybody specifically

1226
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,740
through the horse world, but when I was in Scotland,

1227
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,240
Theresa and I did go on a horseback ride through the Glen

1228
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,480
and I rode a horse.

1229
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,320
And I-

1230
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,160
What was the horse's name?

1231
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,060
I can't remember the horse's name,

1232
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,680
but I swear it was, it was in,

1233
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,200
I don't know if it was like a spiritual thing

1234
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,040
or just like a spiritual successor thing.

1235
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,680
Oh, it was a spiritual thing, definitely.

1236
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,420
Because the horse was Napoleon Bonaparte.

1237
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,260
I can tell- Oh, shit.

1238
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,840
I can tell by the way the horse shit.

1239
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,160
Like, it shit, it was very, like, defiant and powerful.

1240
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,440
Napoleon, small man, huge craps.

1241
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,760
And he would do it right in the middle of the ground,

1242
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,280
staring at, like, staring into the eyes

1243
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,880
of his, like, officers to, like, show dominance.

1244
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,560
And he would only do it once a week

1245
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,880
because he wanted to get a really good one.

1246
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,720
And he'd be like,

1247
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Zutolo, it's time for the mega craps!

1248
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,560
And it would actually, like,

1249
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,960
kind of lift him off the ground a little bit.

1250
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,800
Yeah, it was like a fun cartoon dookie.

1251
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
And that's exactly what this horse did.

1252
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,320
And I was like, oh my God.

1253
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,880
Do you think, you know, like,

1254
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,360
you see those sedans that have, like,

1255
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,400
four people carrying it?

1256
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,720
Like, don't you think that, as it's this way,

1257
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,120
dominance, those should all have holes

1258
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,280
in the bottom to shit out of them?

1259
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,120
Yeah.

1260
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Because, like, what could be more, like,

1261
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,560
there's one thing cooler than being carried by four people

1262
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,760
and it's like, I'm actually gonna take a dump right now.

1263
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,920
Sorry.

1264
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,440
Please try to keep it steady.

1265
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,480
How about another question?

1266
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,120
I wanna get in the horse world.

1267
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,680
Do you have to pay your way in?

1268
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,920
I mean, yes.

1269
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,800
Do you have to own a horse?

1270
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,620
Yeah.

1271
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,460
That probably helps.

1272
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,520
They probably don't want any looky-loos

1273
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,720
that are just like, I don't have a horse,

1274
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,040
but I'm super into them.

1275
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,860
Yeah.

1276
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,880
You're just a poseur.

1277
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,920
You're a casual.

1278
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,440
Hit me with a cue, y'all.

1279
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,280
Here it comes.

1280
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,520
I was eating the cookie after lunch,

1281
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,000
before going to the, I want a munch!

1282
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,840
Squad!

1283
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,660
Squad!

1284
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,500
No, you fucked it up.

1285
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,340
I got it.

1286
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,520
That was a good time that you did it very well.

1287
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,360
Thank you.

1288
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,400
I want a munch!

1289
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,240
Squad!

1290
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,120
Am I supposed to sing it?

1291
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,240
I want a munch!

1292
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,080
Squad!

1293
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,640
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1294
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,800
The hut's back.

1295
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,720
I don't know, has the hut been up in the squad before?

1296
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,920
The hut is sticking cheese and hot dogs

1297
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,740
and fucking everything,

1298
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,920
so yeah, I'm assuming they've been in the mix.

1299
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,080
Here's the literal title of this press release.

1300
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,920
Give it to me.

1301
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,560
This is not a drill.

1302
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,400
Jesus God, no, it's happening for real!

1303
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,340
Pizza Hut unleashes latest cheesy goodness

1304
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,160
in all new grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza.

1305
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,100
What the fuck did I tell you?

1306
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,800
Pizza Hut embarrassing us with cheese.

1307
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,200
Okay, here's the beginning of the press release.

1308
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,560
We like to refer to press releases here on the Munch Squad

1309
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,080
because who better to talk about this stuff

1310
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,200
than the experts?

1311
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,900
Justin, wait, before you jump into it really quick,

1312
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,840
and this is important,

1313
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,980
this is like a drill, right?

1314
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,820
This is like a-

1315
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,480
No, this is not a drill.

1316
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,320
This is like a practice run.

1317
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,120
Grilled cheese, good.

1318
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,240
Original stuffed crust pizza, good.

1319
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,640
Grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza, real good.

1320
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,760
Nice, that's good copy right there.

1321
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,480
It features extra gooey cheddar

1322
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,480
and mozzarella cheese stuffed and baked onto the crust.

1323
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,520
Finish off the grilled cheese crust.

1324
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,080
It's topped with toasted breadcrumbs and melted butter.

1325
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,920
Excellent.

1326
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,200
Because that's been the problem with crusts

1327
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,160
to this point. More bread.

1328
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,720
It's just bread and butter.

1329
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,440
I just love the Hut's genuine cheese,

1330
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,720
like they're- It's all hand rolled.

1331
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,800
They use the sauce and the corks.

1332
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,320
My question is this, cheddar.

1333
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,560
Is there anything in there, Justin,

1334
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,640
that stipulates what separates this

1335
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,560
from a cheese stuffed crust pizza?

1336
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,520
I just fucking outline for you

1337
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,160
that includes hand rolled artisanal mozzarella.

1338
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,840
Is that the mozzarella?

1339
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,280
And toasted breadcrumbs and melted butter.

1340
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,600
Probably.

1341
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,760
The butter is probably what separates it from the herd.

1342
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,360
These motherfuckers put breadcrumbs up on the bread.

1343
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,040
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to throw in here.

1344
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,840
That's unacceptable, guys.

1345
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,520
It's impossible.

1346
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,880
Where did they get the crumbs from?

1347
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,400
They must have destroyed other bread.

1348
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,200
They must have taken whole bread

1349
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,720
to ruin it for other bread.

1350
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,200
Every pizza takes two pizzas to pizza

1351
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,040
and that's just, I'm an eco conservationist

1352
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,160
and that just sets me off.

1353
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,560
Here's a quote, perhaps the most unnecessary

1354
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,200
explanatory quote in American rhetoric.

1355
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,200
It's from David Tim, chief marketing officer of Pizza Hut,

1356
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,880
so you know he can be trusted.

1357
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,480
The grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza

1358
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,200
is the perfect combination of a classic grilled cheese

1359
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,400
and traditional pizza.

1360
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,240
Thanks, David.

1361
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,080
Thank you.

1362
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,960
I did wonder where you were going with this bad boy.

1363
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,320
You know what would be a way bolder statement?

1364
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,600
It's an imperfect comment.

1365
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,920
This hybrid should not and could not exist.

1366
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,760
Here's the truth.

1367
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,240
We've been working on this for two years

1368
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,680
and we just got to a point where it's like,

1369
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,480
we can't put any more R&D into this.

1370
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,240
We just have to release it in the wild.

1371
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,920
The result is a delicious, flavorful, and indulgent pizza

1372
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,040
that packs the punch of a gooey, cheesy, crunchy

1373
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,880
grilled cheese.

1374
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,720
Luxuriate.

1375
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,720
How much selling does it take to get the concept

1376
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,720
of the crust is like grilled cheese?

1377
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,680
I know what you're doing.

1378
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,000
And then it says, the result of eating this pizza

1379
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,920
will either be dumped forever or never dumped again

1380
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,640
or it's like unclear.

1381
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,520
Or like both, but alternating

1382
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,160
and you never know which one is going to be.

1383
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,920
Indulgent is maybe the best adjective

1384
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,680
because it's literally one shade below

1385
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,360
like gluttonous fuck pile.

1386
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,720
This is a real hedonistic pizza.

1387
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,720
Enjoy.

1388
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,080
Feed your corpulence.

1389
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,760
Bathe in olive oil and red wine as you enjoy it.

1390
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,720
Add this to your self-slime trash bag.

1391
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,520
Yeah, the perfect appetizer for a night at the vomitorium.

1392
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,840
Then have your servant come in

1393
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,840
and tickle your throat with her feathers

1394
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,360
so that thou must enjoy more pizza.

1395
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,720
Rub this on your face.

1396
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,760
You would think the press release would end there.

1397
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,800
But someone wrote all that stuff

1398
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,480
and was like, I still don't know if they get it.

1399
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,280
They say, this is how they justify cheese

1400
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,200
is rapidly becoming one of America's favorite foods.

1401
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,960
Dot cheese? Dot chase?

1402
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,600
It's 2016.

1403
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Cheese has been a predominant part of cuisine forever.

1404
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,260
It continues.

1405
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,520
Related, pizza is often ranked

1406
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,560
as the most popular food in America.

1407
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,400
Get out.

1408
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
Pizza Hut puts that in every one of their press releases.

1409
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,600
Pizza, still very good.

1410
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,680
Still very, very good and popular.

1411
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,040
We did millions of dollars of research

1412
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,480
to determine that people seem to like cheese and pizza.

1413
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,520
And I'm reading here down on the press release, it says,

1414
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,920
fuck hamburgers, that's crazy.

1415
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,020
Then it continues to round out the equation.

1416
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,780
Grilled cheese has been pegged

1417
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,340
as one of the most comforting foods ever imagined.

1418
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,520
Now all these favorites, and there are quotes on that,

1419
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,760
favorites can be enjoyed as one.

1420
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,680
This is like the person that tells you a joke

1421
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,240
and it's like, no, the horse has a long face.

1422
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,120
So why the long face is because the horse has a long face.

1423
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,800
I'm gonna read the last paragraph here, okay?

1424
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,320
Because the fact that this is a paragraph

1425
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,720
as part of a press release going out to the press

1426
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,720
does just delight me.

1427
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,880
Is there a newspaper, by the way, of record

1428
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,720
that is like great quotes,

1429
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,520
definitely gonna toss these in our story, cheese.

1430
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,840
It's very important right now.

1431
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,080
Pizza on the rise.

1432
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,760
People like pizza and cheese and they like grilled cheese.

1433
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,400
It's not the presses.

1434
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,360
Steven with his front page.

1435
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,160
The grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza

1436
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,240
can be topped with any one of the following

1437
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,480
fresh Pizza Hut ingredients.

1438
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,560
Fresh mushrooms, fresh spinach, fresh red onions,

1439
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,880
fresh green bell peppers, sliced banana peppers,

1440
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,960
sweet pineapples, sliced jalapeno peppers,

1441
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,680
Mediterranean black olives, Peruvian cherry peppers,

1442
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,600
and diced roma tomatoes, as well as pepperoni,

1443
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,360
Italian sausage, premium salami, classic meatballs,

1444
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,320
slow Russian ham, hardwood smoked bacon,

1445
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,520
grilled chicken, beef, and seasoned pork.

1446
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,400
Pizza lovers can customize their pizza

1447
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,920
with a choice of five sauces,

1448
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,200
including classic marinara, premium crushed tomato,

1449
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,280
creamy garlic Parmesan.

1450
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,160
This is now a menu.

1451
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,240
Hey, your press release is now a menu.

1452
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,720
They can also top their pizza

1453
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,440
with a choice of sauce drizzles.

1454
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,080
This is just your menu, idiot.

1455
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,320
It's your menu, dummy, idiot, dumb asshole.

1456
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,520
You just put this in your press release.

1457
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,760
It's just your fucking menu.

1458
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,400
Are you fucking Charles Dickens working on a word count

1459
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,240
so you get paid by the law?

1460
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,720
The things you can put on the pizza is all the things

1461
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,160
because there's no pizza law.

1462
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,080
These are the prices.

1463
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,240
These are the prices and the different sizes

1464
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,000
and here's every phone number to every Pizza Hut.

1465
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,040
So please. You call, you'll talk to Bill.

1466
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,240
He'll walk you through the process from that point.

1467
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,040
Hey guys, this is a great press release.

1468
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,000
I was just wondering, my name is Dr. Salad

1469
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,600
and I was wondering if there's anything for me

1470
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,360
at your establishment.

1471
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,160
Mr. Domino's has been able to help me out lately

1472
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,480
so I'm not such a heel with my local parties.

1473
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,360
Go fuck yourself.

1474
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,120
Cheese is so popular right now.

1475
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,520
Unless we can put grilled cheese into a salad somehow.

1476
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,560
That's crazy. That's ludicrous.

1477
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,840
Also, can I just make one quick note?

1478
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,760
They try to sell you a line

1479
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,640
about how they'll make your crust a pretzel.

1480
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,000
Griffin and I specifically requested-

1481
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,840
Oh, what the fuck?

1482
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,720
I didn't even think about that.

1483
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,320
It's all I've thought about for three days.

1484
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,360
Griffin and I specifically requested a pretzel.

1485
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,200
After a long shoot, a long day of shooting

1486
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,200
and doing, oh, we had to eat late night pizza

1487
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,800
and we specifically asked for a pretzel crust

1488
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,640
and did we get it?

1489
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,460
We did not.

1490
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,300
We did not.

1491
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,680
But could you get, wait,

1492
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,600
could you get a grilled cheese crust that's pretzel?

1493
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,360
Yeah, we can get whatever the fuck we want.

1494
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,800
There's no pizza law.

1495
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,640
There's nothing left.

1496
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,720
No, I actually don't think that that would work.

1497
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,560
I don't think you could.

1498
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,040
Anyway, let me actually read the question.

1499
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,440
I was eating a cookie after lunch

1500
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,200
before going to the computer lab.

1501
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,120
When I got there, I realized there was a crumb

1502
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,500
from the cookie stuck in a fold in my shirt.

1503
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,840
Without thinking, I popped it straight into my mouth.

1504
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,640
Several people in the lab stared at me in shock,

1505
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,200
even though I explained it was just a cookie crumb.

1506
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,080
No, no, no, no.

1507
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,640
You don't understand.

1508
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,200
It was a crumb from a cookie.

1509
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,780
I was enjoying a delectable Otis punk wire

1510
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,360
and I just couldn't let a single morsel

1511
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,200
of that bad boy get away.

1512
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,520
Oh, there's some under my nails.

1513
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,440
Oh, you're scandalized,

1514
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,560
because perhaps I should have shared.

1515
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,320
Sorry, all the Otis spunkmire for me, unfortunately.

1516
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,960
What do you want to call your cookie company?

1517
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,520
Well, I have a pretty appetizing name.

1518
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,360
What is it?

1519
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,960
It's Otis spunkmire.

1520
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,960
I can't put it on things.

1521
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,520
Finish the question.

1522
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,920
Okay, should I just brush it off

1523
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,040
or was I okay not letting it go to waste?

1524
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,440
That's from Insatiable Appetite in Athens, Georgia.

1525
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,840
You were absolutely not okay.

1526
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,280
That is unacceptable.

1527
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,100
What is it?

1528
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,940
Oh, it's acceptable.

1529
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,600
Well, the problem is they did not clarify

1530
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
the size of said crumb.

1531
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,960
If you have a cookie crumb on your shirt

1532
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,000
that's a passenger on you, that's embarrassing.

1533
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,460
Eating it isn't, that is whatever.

1534
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,640
Why do you fucking care?

1535
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,040
I don't know the level of CSI bullshit

1536
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,520
you would need to go through to confirm 100%

1537
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,440
that it was definitely a delectable

1538
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,560
Otis spunkmire cookie crumb.

1539
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,120
Especially when you work,

1540
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,720
let me change the question again, in a lab.

1541
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,200
Yeah, you work in a lab.

1542
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,560
In a computer lab.

1543
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,280
It's not like you don't fucking science.

1544
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,120
They're not like dicing.

1545
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,400
I missed the word computer.

1546
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,220
They're like, oh man,

1547
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,560
we've almost finished splicing the genome.

1548
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,600
Oh no, I made the one that gives me wasp wings.

1549
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,280
But this is wee, that's how science works.

1550
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,800
That's how science works.

1551
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,120
Okay, other options though,

1552
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,440
like people were acting pretty upset,

1553
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,680
but what would they have thought

1554
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,560
if you picked a cookie, come off your shirt

1555
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,800
and just like flicked it at them?

1556
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,640
Like that would be bad.

1557
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,460
I think they probably would have thought

1558
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,880
you were a real like bad boy.

1559
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,720
What were you supposed to do?

1560
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,560
Go get a napkin and throw away?

1561
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,400
Like what is this?

1562
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,700
No, hold it out in front of you

1563
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,200
as though we're like a spider and like,

1564
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,840
ooh, I've got a crumb, what do I do?

1565
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,440
I'm really panicked.

1566
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,920
Why are these people fucking mad dogging you?

1567
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,160
Hey, that's what I would say.

1568
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,040
If I picked delicious crumb from a spunk and chomped it,

1569
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,440
and you guys looked at me like,

1570
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,800
I would look at the two of you and I'd say,

1571
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,200
hey, mind your own fucking business.

1572
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,920
What I eat and do to my body is none of yours.

1573
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,800
It's possible that all of these other people

1574
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,360
at the computer lab, like they all got together

1575
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,720
and they just watched Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

1576
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,560
Oh.

1577
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,560
And they just see you like pluck a crumb and eat it.

1578
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,760
And they're like, what if,

1579
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,600
oh, and they all just horrified themselves.

1580
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,200
What if that was Richard Moranis himself?

1581
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,280
I don't think he got shrunk in the movie.

1582
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,880
Except he did in the second one.

1583
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

1584
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,600
No, he did in the third one.

1585
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,160
Yeah, Honey, we shrunk ourselves.

1586
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,240
Then why did you say that he did?

1587
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,080
He shrunk the kids.

1588
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,480
But he didn't in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

1589
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,840
He said it in the movie, the kids got shrunk.

1590
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,960
He shrunk the kids, he exploded his infant son.

1591
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,200
And then he-

1592
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,360
The order was, shrunk the kids, saved them,

1593
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,200
thought, I'm gonna keep doing this,

1594
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,280
I'm gonna keep following this particular dream.

1595
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,840
Blew up his son and was like,

1596
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,720
oh, Richard, baby, oh.

1597
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,640
No, I'm gonna keep doing it, I think.

1598
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,680
And then did himself.

1599
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,960
And I think that was the final straw

1600
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,800
because we didn't get a-

1601
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,320
Yeah, the fourth one has to be-

1602
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,480
Well, then there's the TV show.

1603
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,880
The fourth one has to be Honey,

1604
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,760
I think this relationship has run aground.

1605
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,600
Honey, I think we need to take a break.

1606
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,360
Wait, there's a TV show?

1607
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,600
Yeah, with Peter Scolari.

1608
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,760
Was the TV show just like every episode,

1609
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,800
like, how the fuck does this keep happening?

1610
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,640
It was all different machines,

1611
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,520
there was the shrinkery was in there.

1612
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,560
Do you think that when they were naming

1613
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,720
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids 2,

1614
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,480
somebody said, we'll go with I Blew Up the Baby

1615
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,120
and everybody went, let's see if we can come up

1616
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,040
with better than that.

1617
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,120
And it was like, I made the baby real big,

1618
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,320
I big jumped the baby.

1619
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,320
If each one is a sentence that you are saying

1620
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,560
to your spouse, then I think by five,

1621
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,200
it would just be like, Margaret,

1622
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,880
Margaret, I can't fucking believe this.

1623
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,320
I know this is gonna be hard to believe,

1624
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,000
but it happened again and it's still not my fault.

1625
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,400
Baby, I blew up the baby.

1626
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,520
Honey, we shrunk ourselves.

1627
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,960
Sweetheart, I done fucked this one so bad.

1628
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,920
Margaret, this is gonna be the end of our marriage,

1629
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,760
isn't it?

1630
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,280
Honey, I want you back, that's what it says.

1631
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,400
Honey, I want you back and also I'm very small,

1632
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,720
please come get me.

1633
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,360
Please pick up your very small husband.

1634
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,600
Honey, I final listened to your complaints

1635
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,120
and blew up my wiener, just like a crazy great hog.

1636
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,440
Honey, I shrunk your dad to the point of non-existence

1637
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,480
and now he's gone.

1638
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,560
Honey, I'm sorry about your dad.

1639
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,800
Honey, I shrunk my ego and blew up my level

1640
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,760
of consideration for you and listening.

1641
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,880
I blew up my listening skills.

1642
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,480
Please take me back.

1643
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,760
What do you think, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids TV show

1644
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,600
is about?

1645
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,640
Episode per episode, what do you think?

1646
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,240
Episode one, coming strong out of the gates.

1647
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,840
I think it's a pretty traditional child shrinking romp.

1648
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,840
Episode two, I think they probably should,

1649
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,200
I mean, it's all size play, right?

1650
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,560
So I think the dog probably gets weird.

1651
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,360
Episode three, the whole house got little.

1652
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,560
Oh no, all our stuff.

1653
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,640
Episode four, he accidentally shrinks

1654
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,080
the relationship counselor that they bring in.

1655
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,600
And then they just carry him around in their pocket.

1656
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,600
He's like a recurring character.

1657
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,760
Yeah, it was very cute though, I do like that part.

1658
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,440
Episode five, they shrink their son

1659
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,800
but blow up their daughter.

1660
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,000
And at this point, Peter's just like,

1661
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,560
I'm just trying to find new fun ways of mixing it up.

1662
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,400
He's just trying to feel alive.

1663
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,360
He can only feel alive by shrinking at this point.

1664
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,200
I'm just gonna hit both of you guys with some titles

1665
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,560
of episodes of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids the TV show.

1666
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,160
Honey, we've been swallowed by grandpa.

1667
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,120
Literally out the gate, they nail it.

1668
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,480
Let me just get on, let me just torrent this real quick.

1669
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,720
Torrenting, torrenting, shut up, I'm watching this now.

1670
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,640
Shut up, give me 22 minutes, nobody talk.

1671
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,480
Just let me sit here in it.

1672
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,320
Honey, the house is trying to kill us.

1673
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,320
Holy shit.

1674
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,640
Honey, I'm haunted.

1675
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,720
Honey, I'm haunted?

1676
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,680
Honey, you've got nine lives.

1677
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,640
Okay, so this is the, what's the fucking cat movie

1678
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,960
that's out right now, Happy Cat.

1679
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,760
Honey, they're after me Lucky Charms.

1680
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,840
No, that's not, that can't be.

1681
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,360
Okay, Wayne's invention succeeds in finding gold.

1682
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,440
A pot of doubloons claimed by a leprechaun

1683
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,800
just having fun with it.

1684
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,240
Hold on, just having fun with it.

1685
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,040
Listen, I know that the movies are pretty whimsical

1686
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,160
with the ant dog and the oatmeal pie.

1687
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,120
This is a franchise rooted in science.

1688
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,840
But you can't just be like, I don't know,

1689
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,920
you know, scientific leprechauns.

1690
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,720
Honey, I blew up the leprechaun.

1691
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,520
Honey, I know what you're thinking.

1692
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,160
Honey, you're living in the past.

1693
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,480
That's like a, is that a two-parter?

1694
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,840
That's where it all starts to go downhill

1695
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,840
for the Zelinsky's.

1696
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,600
Honey, I have conquered death.

1697
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,960
By the way, they did 66 episodes of this motherfucker.

1698
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,160
By the way, I bet Peter Scoleri really feels

1699
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,600
in ownership of this role at this point

1700
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,000
since he's been doing it 15 times as long

1701
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,840
as Rick Maraniss.

1702
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,000
Way, way longer than Richard did.

1703
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,840
Honey.

1704
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,800
What's the finale call, you think?

1705
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,640
Honey, who done it?

1706
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,560
Honey, we died.

1707
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,400
Honey, time stretches before me is an endless loop

1708
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,840
through which I'm trying to escape.

1709
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,600
Time is a flat circle, honey.

1710
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,840
Honey, time's a flat circle.

1711
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,680
Honey, now we're all sons of bitches.

1712
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,160
Honey, I invented the atomic bomb accidentally.

1713
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,720
Honey, I've become death destroyer of worlds.

1714
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,000
This is, oh man, this seems like a pretty good show.

1715
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,840
It really was.

1716
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,680
I actually remember enjoying it immensely.

1717
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,480
Honey, I shrink all of Australia

1718
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,120
and it's just fucking gone now.

1719
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,920
Can I tell you, Scoleri's a treasure.

1720
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,760
I love Scoleri.

1721
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,920
Scoleri's a fucking treasure.

1722
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,120
Yeah, he's great.

1723
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,800
Honey, I'm the sorcerer's apprentice.

1724
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,760
That was the last episode?

1725
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,600
No.

1726
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,120
No, the last one's called Honey, Who Done It?

1727
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,720
It's a murder mystery, I guess.

1728
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,000
Kind of seems like an anticlimax.

1729
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,920
You would think they would end with some shrinking.

1730
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,920
You would think they would bring it back

1731
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,240
and be like, honey, let's bring it home with some shrinking.

1732
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,000
Some good old fashioned shrinkage.

1733
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,000
Honey, the next last episode is Honey, I shrink,

1734
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,800
therefore I am.

1735
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,640
So that's where it was.

1736
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,040
I was kind of a thinker.

1737
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,160
I would like to see one episode in which

1738
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,200
he uses the enlarging, right?

1739
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,440
But enlarges everyone to 1.1 scale.

1740
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,360
So that is like 1.1 times the size.

1741
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,960
So it's definitely like weird, but not the inconvenience

1742
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,360
that they were dealing with otherwise.

1743
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,840
It's not like a giant baby.

1744
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,840
It's just like a seven foot tall man.

1745
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,520
Well, this has got to be an expensive show, I would think.

1746
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,520
Oh, definitely.

1747
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,880
What with all the science.

1748
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,360
And I mean, they're just going through kids nonstop.

1749
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,680
What with all the...

1750
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,880
Do you know how many kids they lost in the original Shrink?

1751
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,720
A lot?

1752
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,560
A lot.

1753
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,440
They would just let them out on the lawn

1754
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,720
and then that's it for them.

1755
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,920
1.5 kids.

1756
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,720
That ant killed six kids.

1757
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,720
But the ant has been working in this town

1758
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,120
for so many of the stories that ant could tell.

1759
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,360
Honey, I'm rooting for the home team.

1760
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,240
That's just one where there's no science,

1761
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,240
no wackiness. Nick is upset

1762
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,080
because he's having trouble playing baseball.

1763
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,080
So he asks his dad to make some inventions

1764
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,160
to help him play baseball better.

1765
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,920
That's just cheating, Wayne.

1766
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,120
No angels in the outfield, only man.

1767
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,240
Elsewhere, Diane is worried about her recital

1768
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,760
and Amy uses a cream that camouflages pimples,

1769
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,760
but she uses too much and it hides her nose.

1770
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,360
No, no, no, no, hold on.

1771
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,040
You can't both give me baseball machines

1772
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,880
and invincible nose.

1773
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,480
You're telling me there's two wacky science subplots

1774
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,360
in each episode of Shrink?

1775
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,880
You can't put both in there, Wayne.

1776
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,680
Yeah, okay.

1777
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,680
Last one, I promise.

1778
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,360
Honey, the bunny bit it.

1779
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,160
Nick invents a machine of his own

1780
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,640
in an attempt to resurrect his dead pet buddy Copernicus.

1781
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,480
Oh my God.

1782
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,680
Things go wrong when his invention

1783
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,680
summons a monstrous creature from another dimension

1784
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,760
that possesses the body of his deceased friend.

1785
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,320
Holy fucking shit.

1786
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,240
How's your Saturday morning programming, everyone?

1787
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,520
That's real?

1788
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,880
Nick defeats death and invites a demon

1789
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,400
from another world into our plane?

1790
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,840
Honey, we've lost the plot.

1791
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,920
Honey, we went the wrong place.

1792
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,960
That's gonna do it for us, folks.

1793
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,000
We hope you've enjoyed the program.

1794
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,320
Thank you so much for hanging in with us

1795
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,240
on this kind of weird, bumpy three-week schedule.

1796
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,960
We'll be back to normal soon after.

1797
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,520
I'm gonna actually predict that the next episode

1798
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,520
is probably gonna be a little bit late

1799
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,000
because we are- May we?

1800
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,840
No, no, no.

1801
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,680
We'll get one up.

1802
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,880
It's just I'm traveling that weekend

1803
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,240
and we are gonna be fucking wiped

1804
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,080
because we're doing- I'm gonna be trying

1805
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,440
to find a house.

1806
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,920
Yeah, Travis is house hunting.

1807
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,440
So the next week will probably be a bit off schedule.

1808
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,000
We apologize, but we're gonna get this thing back on track.

1809
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,200
We'll probably end up sitting on that live show too

1810
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,200
because girlfriend and I have got-

1811
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,960
Yeah, we need to put some stuff in the tank for this one.

1812
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,080
We need to bank some stuff.

1813
01:01:59,080 --> 01:01:59,920
Gotta bank some stuff.

1814
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,920
And also we're recording it,

1815
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,160
so we probably can put it out.

1816
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,160
That's a good point.

1817
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,160
A lot of twists and turns.

1818
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,000
A lot of twists and turns.

1819
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,400
This is quite the rollercoaster.

1820
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,600
The show, by the way, I just want everyone to know,

1821
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,400
I'm very proud of how it's coming along.

1822
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,960
I cannot wait for everyone to see it.

1823
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,400
Yeah, so we're all- I think you're gonna like it.

1824
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,680
If we've sounded like exhausted

1825
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,240
and we did a live Facebook live thing for CSO,

1826
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,080
and a lot of people are like,

1827
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,240
God, they look so tired.

1828
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,960
It's not coming from a place of us being like bummed out

1829
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,440
or anything because the show's going really, really well

1830
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,600
and I'm really happy with it

1831
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,680
and I think it's gonna be really good.

1832
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,200
We're just leaving on the fucking horse.

1833
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,040
We're just all going so deep in the pain.

1834
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,520
We're using every bit.

1835
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,360
You know what I mean?

1836
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,080
We don't have anything that at the end of the day,

1837
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,040
I am a toothpaste tube rolled from the bottom, you know?

1838
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,720
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

1839
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,560
for the use of our theme song,

1840
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,400
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1841
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,840
It's a great album that you should go get.

1842
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us.

1843
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,940

1844

Go click on podcasts.

1846
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,760
Go listen to stuff like Beef and Dairy Network

1847
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,020
and Judge John Hodgman and stop podcasting yourself.

1848
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,160
We all have other shows and video stuff

1849
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,080
and Twitter stuff that you can find at McElroyShows.com.

1850
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,720
I would like to plug one in particular.

1851
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,760
We just did an episode of Schmaners

1852
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,880
in which my wife did like a biography of Emily Post.

1853
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,720
Oh, interesting.

1854
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,760
That was amazingly fascinating.

1855
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,540
Emily Post like was incredible

1856
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,880
and like Theresa did a great job with it.

1857
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,440
It's my favorite episode I think that we've recorded so far.

1858
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,400
And I just wanted to plug that and say,

1859
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,440
go check out Schmaners, listen to that Emily Post episode

1860
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,960
and educate yourself on Emily Post.

1861
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,920
She's amazing.

1862
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,760
Yep.

1863
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,640
Is that it?

1864
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,600
That's gonna do it for us, folks.

1865
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,880
Thank you so much for sticking with us.

1866
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,440
We have a final question.

1867
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,280
Yeah.

1868
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,120
Found by Griffin.

1869
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,360
And what we do every week is Griffin reads this

1870
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,600
and we kind of think about it and dwell on it

1871
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,440
and then we come back the week after.

1872
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,800
Just sort of focus on most of our energies

1873
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,680
and just like release.

1874
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,120
Yeah, it's so nice.

1875
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,820
Anyway, this one was sent in by Rachel Roseng.

1876
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,200
Game recognized game, Rachel Roseng.

1877
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,440
We need to write down a fucking list

1878
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,760
of what everybody's stuff is.

1879
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,800
You need to write down a list.

1880
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,280
Yeah, you definitely need to do that.

1881
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,120
Thank you, Rachel Roseng.

1882
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Earl, who asks,

1883
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,720
what is Mary Tyler Moore's role in the big scheme of things?

1884
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,560
So good.

1885
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,360
Justin McElroy.

1886
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,400
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1888

He's been my brother, my brother, me.

1889
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,200
Kiss your dad.

1890
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,160

Listener supported.

1896
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,600
Why would you listen to a podcast of TV pilots

1897
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,040
that never got made?

1898
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,880
It must not have been any good, right?

1899
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,240
I don't know for a fact that anyone read it.

1900
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,640
They couldn't get to deal with that.

1901
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,040
There was kind of a regime change.

1902
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,240
Someone at the studio who was in a decision making capacity

1903
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,640
said, these guys seem like losers.

1904
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,120
They just blamed it on, OK, well, it must be women.

1905
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,960
We got word that USA had decided to stop doing comedy.

1906
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,320
Why aren't we making this?

1907
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,760
It was so good.
