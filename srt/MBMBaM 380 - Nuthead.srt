1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother being advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
Hey, I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,840
So, how was your weekend? Yeah, it was pretty good. I watched some new stuff.

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
There's a new, like, cooking show. Oh, cool. Let me tell you about my weekend.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Okay, I did want to hear about Travis's cooking show he's watching.

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,680
No, it's really good. Nadia from Great British Bake Off is on it.

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
I love the big family cooking show. Yeah, it's the big family cooking show.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,720
Justin, I know you had a big weekend, but let's talk about the big family cooking show.

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,320
It's just two big families, and I mean gigantic nine foot tall sort of Goliaths,

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
and they smash all the eggs. In the second challenge show,

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,920
you get to see their giant homes. And they eat a whole turkey bones and all,

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,640
and they climb up their beanstalk to their big castle in the sky.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,680
It's so good. Let's just talk about that for the intro.

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
That's the intro, I think, because nothing else. Justin, I know you had kind of a buckwild time,

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
but again, these giant families are cooking and fighting.

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,680
There's a big fight at the end of each episode. Guys, I want to talk about my thing.

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Your thing didn't make headlines. My thing made headlines.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,120
Actually, the big families did go around. They crushed many areas in Wales.

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,920
So, my good buddy Lynn and Sydney and I went and saw-

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,840
Now it's just your buddy Lynn and not our buddy?

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
Well, our good buddy Lynn, fine. Thank you.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,800
Yes, you're right. Thank you, Travis. Went to go see Escape to Margaritaville,

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
and double feature of Hamilton.

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
Is that the sequel to Escape from LA?

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,920
We went and saw Hamilton and Escape to Margaritaville with my new best buddy,

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,600
Mr. James Buffett, and it was basically the best thing that's ever happened to me.

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,280
Jimmy Buffett is basically the nicest person that I know, certainly the nicest person

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,200
that is worth a half billion dollars, easily. He wins that pretty much hands down.

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,640
I got to ask, because I know you put some thought into this.

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,920
You knew you were meeting James, the parrot king, and you knew you were meeting him.

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,680
It's going to be a momentous moment in your life. What do you wear for that?

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
How do you dress yourself for that occasion, I'm wondering?

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,080
Okay, so I did initially have a Hawaiian shirt with a sport coat over it,

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,280
and then Sydney was like, I don't think so, and I was like, you are correct.

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right, because we are also seeing Hamilton the same day,

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
and that would be quite the look.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,000
I mean, you could take a classier selection from the Thomas Bahama collection.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,600
I ended up going with a button down with tasteful palm trees,

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,920
small tasteful palm trees on the button down, just a wink and a nod.

45
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,240
One thing that was probably my favorite, there were many,

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,080
it was basically the wildest day of my life, but my favorite thing that happened

47
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,600
is that we were having brunch while we were waiting for Jimmy to arrive,

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,320
and Lynn and I ordered margaritas to kind of get in the spirit of things,

49
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,160
because we were going to go see Escape to Margaritaville, and it was kind of a theme day.

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,960
And the margaritas were still on our table when Mr. Buffett arrived and ordered a latte,

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,000
and he did notice, like, oh, you guys are already having margaritas.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,240
It's like, ah, god damn it, okay.

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,720
We did order it to have a fun time, and we did not think about the reality.

54
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
That was just supposed to be a joke for you and Lynn.

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,280
Not a joke, just living in the day, which the greatest thing about Jimmy Buffett

56
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,920
is he is exactly Jimmy Buffett all the time.

57
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,040
Like, he is just him.

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,880
He's 24-7 Jimmy Buffett.

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
24-7 Jimmy Buffett all the time.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,040
Like, the best, having fun, the best.

61
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
Like, so excited that we were having margaritas,

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
that we were living that Parrothead lifestyle, so into it.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
And his show was an absolute fucking delight.

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
If I can say my favorite joke from the show, co-written by,

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
I will add, Mr. Mike O'Malley.

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,700
Whoa.

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,800
Yes.

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,120
Really?

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,320
Singing the leaderboard, Mo.

70
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,860
Yes.

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
Mr. Mike O'Malley, co-written with Greg Garcia.

72
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
My favorite joke in it.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
Oh, it's a good, it's a percolating there.

74
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,280
It's a fucking good one.

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,920
It's set at this, like, island bar hotel called Margaritaville.

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes.

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
And the lady who runs it says,

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,040
and in the morning, we've got a top-notch breakfast Buffett.

79
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,400
And she said, the lady who's just shown up, says,

80
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,960
I think you, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced buffet.

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,440
And she says, no, I think you're thinking of the singer.

82
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,760
It's so fucking, I was on the floor.

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,040
No, it's good, it's good.

84
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,880
But we need to address, does Jimmy Buffett exist?

85
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,200
Does Jimmy Buffett exist in this, in the, in the fiction of this world?

86
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,280
Does Jimmy Buffett exist in Jimmy Buffett's escape from Margaritaville?

87
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
Well, that's a good question, Griffin, because like, in Mama Mia,

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,360
are the, do the characters ever reference that they are singing ABBA songs?

89
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,720
Yeah, I don't think, so I really do need a question.

90
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,680
I really need my question answered, because the answer is yes, that is,

91
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,880
that is, that, that is a pretty wild sort of world that they've built there.

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:25,440
Um, we are talking about a show where a gentleman shapes an LSD flashback

93
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,000
through the power of his mind so that undead insurance salesmen

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,480
wear Technicolor, uh, suits and do a kick line.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,520
Fuck, this is amazing.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
How do I get to this show immediately?

97
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
Yeah, how do you go right now?

98
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
It's in Chicago for another three weeks,

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,040
and it's moving to that big Broadway we call Broadway.

100
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,520
Mm-hmm.

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,280
Um, and it is, it was great, and I was seated, uh,

102
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
across the aisle from James throughout the show, and he was loving it.

103
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
Was it the whole time, like, tapping you, like,

104
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,640
oh, this part's, you're gonna love this part.

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait, you're gonna love this.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,520
No, he got, I told him, Sidney and I told him when we first showed up

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,680
that we were really paranoid about spoilers,

108
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
because we didn't want to know the tunes that were in it or anything,

109
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,600
and, and every time he would, like, be about to talk about something in the show,

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,760
he would stop himself, like, oh, no, I'm sorry, wait, I'm gonna let you see it.

111
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,560
Uh, was he not torn to shreds from, by the audience there,

112
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,520
just trying to get a piece of James?

113
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh, my man, it did get a little bit World War Z in there,

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,800
because we saw Hamilton with Lin, and then we saw Escape to Margaritaville with James.

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
I wish you could have gone to a screening,

116
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,600
I wish you could have gone to a screening of the My Brother, My Brother, Me TV show

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,120
with all of them, with you in the audience, like, oh, yeah, this is how it is.

118
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
Me too, boys.

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,520
Me too, I did it.

120
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,760
We got the big three right here.

121
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,920
Lin was trying to stay covert, so when people did start applauding as he walked in,

122
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,680
I just kind of turned around and waved my hands, like, thank you, thank you so much.

123
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,840
I do, I do make several podcasts, thank you so much for, uh, uh, uh, recognizing that.

124
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,720
I did meet two, uh, uh, my Bim Bam fans at Hamilton, Patrick and Heather,

125
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
who, like, saved my poor, my poor ego.

126
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,320
It's like, we've heard of you, like, oh, good, yes, yes.

127
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,880
Hey, thanks.

128
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,960
Uh, Lin, people cheered for Lin at Hamilton,

129
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,720
and he had to eventually, like, stand up and everybody was, like, taking pictures and stuff.

130
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Uh, Mr. Buffett came in and was trying to cloak it, you know, a little bit,

131
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
mainly because you don't want to distract from the show that people paid a lot of money for

132
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,160
and want to watch, but he did get spotted, and then people started cheering,

133
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,040
and then people just, like, sort of gang rushed.

134
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,000
So there was, like, 20 people just, like, trying to get a taste,

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
and he was very nice and accommodating to everybody,

136
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,560
but I was having a full-blown, like, where are the exits panic attack, uh, over there,

137
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,880
but he was, he was super nice to everybody, and, uh, I don't know.

138
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,480
It was, it was wild, and I can't thank Lin enough for such a, um, I mean, it just was,

139
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,560
just was out of hand.

140
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,960
Justin, I need to, I need to ask you a question.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
I know this is weird.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,720
I realize this is weird, but, like, this is my one chance to ask this question.

143
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,440
How did Jimmy Buffett smell?

144
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
I have to know this also!

145
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
I have to know this also!

146
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Did he smell like boat, boat wood, or pineapples, or, uh, panning lotion?

147
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Faintly of coconut.

148
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,600
Like, if you want to know the answer, it's faintly of coconut.

149
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Shit, do you think that that's a scent that he applies to himself,

150
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,320
or you think just his DNA has sort of absorbed enough of this banana boat?

151
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,160
He was bitten by a radioactive coconut at some point in his life.

152
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,880
If the greatest thing about, uh, the, I don't, I keep saying the greatest thing,

153
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,360
but, like, one of the highlights is how deeply into Hamilton Jimmy Buffett is.

154
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,400
To these, like, my, my, Cindy was seated next to James throughout Ham-

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,080
for the performance of Hamilton, and she heard him, like, singing along with several numbers.

156
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,480
So, like, my wife is probably the only person who's heard, like, the Jimmy Buffett covers.

157
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
God damn, release that album, Jimmy!

158
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
I know. How about that, that album? Where's that album?

159
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,520
Yeah.

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,320
Um, that, a couple people, because Lynn and Jimmy were in the same area,

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,960
were suggesting, like, you guys got to do something together.

162
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,160
And I, all I could think was, like, what the fuck would that be, exactly,

163
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,840
if Lynn and Jimmy collaborated on something?

164
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,560
And then I realized it would be the My Brother, My Brother, Me musical.

165
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,960
That is, like, literally the only, like, Venn diagram section of that that could exist.

166
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
Um, but anyway, it was great, and I don't want to bloviate about it anymore,

167
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
because it was, uh, uh, but it was, but I did appreciate that, like,

168
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,880
I was seated with them for both shows, so, like,

169
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
there are a lot of people around Chicago that have, like, inexplicable pictures of me.

170
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,280
Just, like, weird pictures of me, like, losing my mind, uh, uh, in the general radius.

171
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,800
So I apologize to anybody that I was, uh, making weird faces in your cool pictures.

172
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,400
Anyway, let's start the show, because we, we still have to do this advice podcast.

173
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,160
I haven't bought my, uh, my, my villa at the Margaritaville Retirement Community quite yet.

174
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,520
Didn't bring it, didn't want to broach the subject, uh, with James.

175
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,120
You didn't think he'd get you in gratis?

176
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,920
See, I feel like he could get me in, right?

177
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
Like, if anybody could, he could get me in.

178
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
But, like, I feel like he would be, the man's 70 years old,

179
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,000
and came straight from a five-day surf weekend to this show,

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,840
flew himself, natch, to this show from a five-day surf weekend.

181
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,360
I feel like he would be very judgmental of me if I tried to retire at 37.

182
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,400
Um, anyway.

183
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,360
How about this question?

184
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,680
Yeah.

185
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,680
I have a favorite pizza place that I go to once a week.

186
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,320
Sorry, I accidentally saw the second email.

187
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,240
We'll get to that, we'll get to that later.

188
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna skip to that, and then we'll come back.

189
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,120
Well, no, we've given this person a taste of having their question read on the show.

190
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
We will do the pizza.

191
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,160
You know what, let's do the second question.

192
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,880
We'll circle back.

193
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,600
We'll do the pizza question.

194
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,320
We'll circle back.

195
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,400
Because I don't think we're gonna have that much to add.

196
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
Second question is this.

197
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
How do I take it to the next level?

198
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
That's from Gmail.

199
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,280
I included this because I'm very excited to pitch my idea for next year's,

200
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,400
next year's theme.

201
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,400
L of 18, taking it to the next level.

202
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
All right, all right, all right.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,680
I feel like, I feel like the theme for 2018, we need to be, we need to be realistic about

204
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,600
how well we have sort of followed through on past year's themes.

205
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,640
Because I don't know that we've kept things especially serpentine.

206
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,440
I don't think we especially fixed nothing in 2016.

207
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,840
God, no.

208
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,920
I would say shit done broke a little bit more than average.

209
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,920
20 grift team, we were on it.

210
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I feel like 20 grift team, we stayed on it.

211
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
Can we really stick with L of 18?

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,320
Um, I would love, I just feel like it's too early to, I can't transition into the next

213
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,800
year yet.

214
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
We still have two months to zag on them.

215
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:58,960
Yeah.

216
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:06,800
I know, I love this theme, but like, like, two days ago, our buddy Lynn got up on stage

217
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,240
with Jimmy Buffett and sang Margaritaville to raise money for AIDS research.

218
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
Like, I think we're, I'm still zagging.

219
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
Like, I have not left the zag behind.

220
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,960
The zag is still alive.

221
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,600
I can, I can give you the second one that I came up with, which actually fits what you're

222
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,560
discussing now, which is percolate teen, letting it simmer.

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Okay, that's so achievable, which I do like.

224
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Yeah, because that's my day to day.

225
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,320
Also, there's a lot of things that rhyme with eight.

226
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
So maybe, again, let's just take some time.

227
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,320
Okay, but those are my two front runners.

228
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,200
I want to make it clear.

229
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,840
L of 18, take it to the next level, or percolate teen, letting it simmer.

230
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,160
And what, and what I love about those two is that they are diametrically opposed to

231
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,800
each other.

232
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,360
And I'm also now realizing I might be misinformed on what percolating is.

233
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
It might not be like a slow simmer.

234
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
No, let's get it percolating.

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That means it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's elevating, but much slower than.

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,720
How do I take it to the next level though?

238
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
Cause I think there's a, can I say this?

239
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
There's a lot of bad ways to take next level party.

240
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,200
Oh yeah.

241
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,240
Party drugs.

242
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,400
What about just do everything like you're doing stuff already, right?

243
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,960
Uh huh.

244
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,520
Just almost never, I want, I do disagree with that.

245
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,120
I'm almost never doing stuff.

246
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
You're doing some stuff.

247
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Just do it harder and twice.

248
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,000
Like if you do every, you take everything you do today, except to it harder and twice,

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
you're going to be elevating.

250
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,560
You're going to be reaching the next level very easily.

251
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,040
I ate that chili last night.

252
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,000
Last night was chili night.

253
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
So I can tell you one thing.

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm going to be doing harder and twice.

255
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,440
Griffin, again, you've been eating chili.

256
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
Griffin, Andrew McElroy.

257
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,880
It's got beef and beans and tomatoes in it.

258
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,400
You know it's my fave three.

259
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,600
You don't, don't lecture to me about the value of chili.

260
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,160
Okay?

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
Yes, obviously.

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
Chili's amazing.

263
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
It's one of the two foods I can eat.

264
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,400
Griffin, you have to stop eating chili.

265
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,400
It's like if Superman kept coming on our podcast to talk about how he eats kryptonite.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,200
It's like Superman, stop fucking eating the kryptonite.

267
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,040
It's so good, it's got beans in it.

268
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
It's my favorite flavor.

269
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,200
Like if Batman came on, he's like, what are you doing today, Batman?

270
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,040
Just thinking about my dead parents.

271
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Well, you should stop doing that, Batman.

272
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,800
Let me offer another suggestion of how to take it to the next level.

273
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,760
Okay.

274
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Two words, hype person.

275
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,320
Too expensive.

276
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
In this economy, no way.

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,280
Well, maybe you could barter it.

278
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,440
You know, like hype person for each other.

279
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,720
I'll hype person for you.

280
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,240
You hype person for me.

281
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,720
Just have a, don't, don't pay another person.

282
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,640
You can't afford that in this economy.

283
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,960
Just have a boom box that is constantly playing get ready for this by Too Unlimited.

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,760
For everything you are doing, like you're jumping hurdles.

285
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,280
Have Too Unlimited in the background.

286
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,520
You're making pizza for your family.

287
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,480
Too Unlimited.

288
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
Just pump it up.

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
Just pump it up.

290
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,240
And a hand mirror, and you can be your own hype person.

291
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,680
Now that's getting some stranger things upside down territory.

292
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,760
Like you look in your mirror and you're like, you're doing great.

293
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,880
You know, and it's just a nice positive affirmation.

294
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,840
The more you can look in the mirror and say, I'm amazing.

295
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
That's what I do every day.

296
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,080
And I'm fucking so many levels above.

297
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
Multiple times a day.

298
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,360
We actually have to pause the podcast so Travis can do it.

299
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,680
Yeah.

300
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,040
Well, he keeps the mirror around because he says it helps him in case there's a Medusa.

301
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,200
And I don't disagree.

302
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,880
And I'm glad, like, I know that I have at least one brother who won't be turned to stone.

303
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,520
Take that.

304
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
I want to hear a yahoo.

305
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,360
But Griffin, first I wanted to mention to anybody who wasn't aware.

306
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,560
Uh, we are going to be, uh, coming to the Midwest this week.

307
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
Fuck, it's so soon.

308
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Uh, we're going to be doing Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee.

309
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,880
We have already sold out of one of the Chicago shows and the Minneapolis shows.

310
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,680
If you want to come to Chicago, uh, please come.

311
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
It's going to be a very fun show.

312
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
It's going to be our first one of the tour and it's going to be hype.

313
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,640
I think there's going to be a lot of hype energy.

314
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,240
We're going to take it to the next level.

315
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
We're going to take it to the next level, basically.

316
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,560
Um, and, and Milwaukee is going to be the last one.

317
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,800
So we're just going to be leaving it all out on the table.

318
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,880
There are the bookends and you got to come see them.

319
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,280
McElroy shows dot com slash tours and you can get tickets for those.

320
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,480
Please come.

321
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,840
We would love to see you.

322
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,480
Uh, there's a lot of great seats available at the first Chicago show.

323
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,760
Especially Milwaukee is running low, but Chicago, there's a lot of seats available.

324
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,480
So please, please, please, please, please, please come.

325
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,520
We would really love to see you.

326
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,720
All right.

327
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,440
You got it.

328
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,080
Thanks, Griffin.

329
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,120
I'm glad you're going to be there.

330
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
Um, here's a Yahoo from Seth Carlson.

331
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,200
Thank you, Seth.

332
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,440
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

333
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
But, uh, JK Simmons is up in a farmer's insurance ad at the top of the screen.

334
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
So it is JK Simmons.

335
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,680
And it's great that it's JK Simmons because the question is,

336
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,640
can celebrities and normal people have their own separate heavens when they die?

337
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
Let me put it to y'all this way.

338
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,480
Celebrities are different people.

339
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,800
No matter how human beings they become.

340
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,760
Whoa.

341
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,360
Whoa, no matter, no matter how human beings they become while being in the spotlight with

342
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,040
millions and millions of people watching them from all over the world.

343
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,960
They cannot do what real normal people do in their everyday life.

344
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,480
When we are normal people, we live in a normal life without having paparazzi and the media

345
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,640
following us around anywhere we go.

346
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,280
When we are normal people, we live our lives anonymously, not publicly.

347
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
Did you guys know what a celebrity is?

348
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Because this person's got a whole paragraph.

349
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,040
Yeah, thank you, person.

350
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,680
Even without seeing millions of pictures of yourself all over the web,

351
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,680
and without seeing yourself on Wikipedia, blogs, videos, posters, newspapers, websites,

352
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,040
and all of the above.

353
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,120
Not to mention your full name and date of birth being shown to the whole entire world

354
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,720
where people know that your real full information-

355
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
I feel like this person has lost the plot of the original question.

356
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
Not to mention your full name and date of birth being shown to the whole entire world

357
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,280
where people know that your real full information and personal life.

358
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,080
Do you agree?

359
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,720
With what part, my dude?

360
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
What?

361
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,400
Are you talking about people getting doxxed in heaven?

362
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
What are you talking about?

363
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm very confused because up till now, I've been led to believe that stars are just like us.

364
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,560
That they get coffee just like us.

365
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,320
They walk their dogs just like us.

366
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
They go to the store just like us.

367
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,320
They smell faintly of coconut just like us.

368
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,040
Yeah, so I'm confused.

369
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,280
I have to circle back to the coconut smell because I'm wondering if it's synesthetic in a way.

370
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Like, you see him and you think of his music and the smell and perhaps even the taste of that sweet nut enters your mouth.

371
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,240
I think that maybe it's like a psychotropic effect.

372
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,280
Like, if you put a scientific smeller up, they wouldn't detect it.

373
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
But it is entering into your mind space.

374
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
Okay, so speaking of James, as long as we're on the topic.

375
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,880
If there's a heaven that I go to and Jimmy Buffett isn't there, that's not heaven for me.

376
00:19:50,880 --> 00:20:03,680
Flip side, if there's a heaven that Jimmy Buffett goes to and he's got some portly lad trying to shove a guitar into his hand so he'll play boat drinks 24 hours a day, that's not heaven for him.

377
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:13,760
I mean, flip side, I'm at the breakfast buffet because you know it's fucking like Great Wall of China, the breakfast buffet in heaven.

378
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
I believe it's pronounced Buffett.

379
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
Jesus please us.

380
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,840
It's also up there and he's great.

381
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760
That's actually the name of the breakfast buffet.

382
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,080
Yeah.

383
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,440
Jesus please us.

384
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,880
And then you're up there and you're on the breakfast buffet and you have to wait in line, but it's a short line.

385
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,920
And who's that next to you in the line?

386
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,760
It's Don Cheadle.

387
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
And you're like, oh, wow, Don Cheadle.

388
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
That's cool, but I don't really know what.

389
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,520
Did you die?

390
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,320
Did you pass?

391
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,800
Oh, no.

392
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
Did I die?

393
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,360
Oh, God.

394
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,720
I'm saying it's uncomfortable sometimes when you see a celeb and you don't know how to interact with them.

395
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,400
If I see Don Cheadle at the breakfast buffet in heaven at Jesus please us, that's going to be uncomfortable for me.

396
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,640
Like, I don't necessarily want to interact with celebrities day in, day out because I feel like I'll do a bad job of it.

397
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,880
Don't you think, Griffin, that a little bit of that discomfort is like, when am I ever going to see Don Cheadle again?

398
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,960
But in heaven, that answer is, I don't know, whenever, like forever.

399
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Whenever you want to see Don Cheadle, I guess.

400
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,200
Yeah.

401
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:20,240
So like that idea of like, I don't feel like talking to Don Cheadle now, I'll do it any other time in the infinite, you know, expanse of forever.

402
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

403
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
Is this the five people you get to meet in heaven?

404
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,520
Is this like you have to pick the five celebs that like inhabit your heaven?

405
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Is that what this book is about?

406
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,160
I may have misunderstood that.

407
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,120
I didn't think that was the five people you get to meet in heaven.

408
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
Like there was a limitation.

409
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,520
I thought it was a book and not an application.

410
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,280
Not like when you got there, St. Peter was like, you got five.

411
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,400
You got five, okay.

412
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
And don't laminate the list, am I right?

413
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,560
Because then how do you change- it's a joke from friends.

414
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,000
Travis just got bombed off the list for his friends joke.

415
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,520
That's just a deep-

416
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,080
Oh, pull.

417
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,640
I was just trying to-

418
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
So wait a minute, St. Peter, I only get five?

419
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah, you only get five.

420
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,760
Ah, Jesus.

421
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,880
Okay, so you got four.

422
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,440
Wait a minute.

423
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,040
No, I wasn't using- you know, he's around anyway, but that's fine.

424
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,760
You burned one.

425
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,280
You burned- damn it.

426
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,440
Carl damn it from Idaho.

427
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,480
I got you again.

428
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,640
The first person you ask for is infinite persons.

429
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
And then you're like, oh, you got it.

430
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,320
Or a funny celebrity impersonator.

431
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,520
Yes, give me Rich Little up there.

432
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,560
I've got all the celebrities.

433
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,680
I've got all the celebs.

434
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,320
I'll take Rich Little, Frank Caliendo-

435
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,440
And nobody else.

436
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Just those two, sucker.

437
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,480
And that's gonna do it for me.

438
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
Give my three to Frank.

439
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,680
Give the other three to Frank.

440
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,160
I just want separate heavens for famous people.

441
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,120
They've earned it.

442
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,080
Holy shit.

443
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,600
They don't deserve me to be around them.

444
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,680
They don't- they didn't do nothing to deserve that.

445
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,120
It's heaven, not hell.

446
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,080
Oh, shit.

447
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,560
That's- that's the Twilight Zone twist, right?

448
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,600
Of like, ah, as a celebrity, I'm so excited to have my own private heaven

449
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
where I don't have to deal with, like, the adoration.

450
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,480
And then, like, on day three, they're like,

451
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,520
I can't deal with this, like, seclusion.

452
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,640
And I- I like having fans in an audience.

453
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
I thought heaven would be great.

454
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,560
And then, like, a dude in a red suit pops up.

455
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,720
He's like, oh, did you think this was heaven?

456
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,360
I got you.

457
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,240
It's heck.

458
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,960
You're in heck.

459
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,640
And they- I mean, the- the choicest thing about celebrity heaven is,

460
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,800
judging by the headlines the past couple weeks,

461
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,080
it is not gonna be as crowded as I assumed it would be just a little bit ago.

462
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,640
I think you're gonna have some room to stretch your legs in there.

463
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,440
All right, here's a question.

464
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
I have a favorite pizza place that I go to once a week.

465
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,920
With every pizza you order, they give you a coupon.

466
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,120
Bring back 12 coupons, and you'll get a free pizza.

467
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
That's a wild way of doing that.

468
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,200
They just didn't want to spring from one of those punching machines on the card, huh?

469
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,760
All right, that's fine.

470
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,960
Here's a piece of trash.

471
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
Bring me 12 pieces of trash, and you get a free pizza.

472
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,360
Yeah, you turn it into a fucking World of Warcraft quest to free- freeze off.

473
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,280
Anyway, I collected all these coupons,

474
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,520
then went in on my birthday for the Frieza.

475
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,240
Good.

476
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,960
Good pimento.

477
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,920
Frieza.

478
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,400
Frieza.

479
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,720
I went in there, I collected my 12 coupons,

480
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
and I got the bad guy from Dragon Ball Z.

481
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,760
When the cashier told me the price, I handed him the coupons, and he said,

482
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
oh, okay, you have enough of them.

483
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,800
He wasn't annoyed or anything.

484
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,640
He just didn't show any emotion at all,

485
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,240
and it really kind of ruined the mood of excitement about this free pizza.

486
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
I know customer service is difficult and annoying and all,

487
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,240
but I think the cashier should have to act excited

488
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,120
when people bring in 12 coupons to not ruin the special moment.

489
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,400
What do you think, brothers?

490
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,320
That's from apprehensive at Appleton.

491
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,240
This is so good, because it is- there's two things going on right here.

492
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
One, they are- you are bringing these things in,

493
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,960
and you say, time for you to experience a loss.

494
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,160
Like, time for you to financially surrender yourself to me.

495
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,320
But at the same time, Justin, the World of Warcraft quest,

496
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,040
I can't get that out of my head, because I do want to, like, amazing travel.

497
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,720
Oh, and like, a golden glow, like, surrounds you for a second, you know?

498
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
Yeah, you're getting one over on them.

499
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,880
They never thought anyone would do this.

500
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
They made it as annoying as humanly possible.

501
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,720
The tough piece is, the coupons are cut in different shapes.

502
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
This is not even like you bring them a neat,

503
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
even stack of beautiful rectangular paper.

504
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
One of them is like a star,

505
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,840
and one of them is like a very, very, very small circle.

506
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,240
Maybe they're bummed because they know that if you're using a coupon for a Frieza,

507
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,880
the chances of you tipping have been reduced to nil.

508
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,080
Maybe that's the lack of excitement about that.

509
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,040
You gotta tip.

510
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,800
Even on a Frieza, y'all know that, right?

511
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,240
Y'all gotta tip on everything.

512
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,640
Okay.

513
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,400
You tip on a carryout, right?

514
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,360
You guys tip on a carryout?

515
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,600
I do now, because I joked once about not doing it,

516
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,760
and many people were like, you have to.

517
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
And I was like, oh, okay.

518
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,560
And now I do.

519
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,920
That's how suggestible Travis is.

520
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,840
Maybe they didn't do enough at once.

521
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
What I'm saying is like, if you order six pizzas,

522
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,480
and they're like, oh, hell yeah, what a great day,

523
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,800
and then you bring in 72 coupons,

524
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,400
and it's like, they're like, so that'll be basically $150.

525
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,760
And you're like, oh, well, basically, the prestige.

526
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,640
And then you bring out like 72 coupons.

527
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,520
That's gonna get a reward.

528
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,800
Or you open a briefcase,

529
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,680
and you have all of them banded together in the briefcase,

530
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,920
and you're just like, I'll pay for it with this.

531
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,480
Assuming you get a coupon for the Frieza for the Goku,

532
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,360
if you get an eat right there, 144 pizzas,

533
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,680
you will then get 12 coupons just from the Friezas

534
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,240
that you can use to get another Frieza.

535
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,400
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just figured out

536
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,160
the infinite pizza equation.

537
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm pretty sure if you just do 144,

538
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,240
you will generate an infinite engine,

539
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,360
and you have built an engine of pizza building

540
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,600
that is infinite.

541
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,400
Infinite pizza.

542
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,840
There's another pepperoni perpetual moment.

543
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
I'm trying to get like a perpetual moment.

544
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,400
There's nothing in there.

545
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,920
Keep going.

546
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,560
I'll get there.

547
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,840
Each pizza costs $10.

548
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,680
It's $1,440.

549
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,880
That's a lot, right?

550
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
It's a lot of money to invest in something.

551
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
But then mathematically, I ran the numbers infinite pizza.

552
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
So just think about it.

553
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,400
What you do is you donate those pizzas

554
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,960
to like a local shelter or a library or something,

555
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
and then you also get on BuzzFeed.

556
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,720
Yeah, yeah.

557
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,560
And then people will donate you more money

558
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
to buy 144 new pizzas.

559
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,000
And then I started to joke.

560
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
You invest those pizzas,

561
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,640
and you use that interest to buy more pizzas.

562
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
But you got to be careful because again,

563
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,000
guys, the economy, fuck.

564
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,840
Oh, you build that pizza bubble?

565
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,320
Ugh.

566
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,240
We haven't talked about the economy in a while,

567
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,400
but I feel like it's really off the rails a little bit.

568
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,360
Yeah, and this economy is in the toilet.

569
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,600
Or is it good now?

570
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,760
I don't even know where the economy is.

571
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,120
That's how off the rails it is.

572
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
Because it could be good or it could be bad,

573
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,040
and there's no way of tracking it.

574
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,640
It should not have come as a surprise to you.

575
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,920
This person would not be excited

576
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,560
if you'd ever watched any of the many extreme couponing

577
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,720
television programs that are available to you,

578
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,120
which I would highly attempt to deter you from.

579
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,200
It is not an enjoyable way of spending time.

580
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,080
But the grand finale of those shows

581
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,520
is always someone meticulously handing over

582
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,800
like 150 coupons to get all this free toilet paper

583
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
they could ever want for their butt.

584
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,000
And the person who is on the receiving end of that

585
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,120
behind the register,

586
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,560
you can watch them learning

587
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,320
that they lack the capability of killing someone with their mind.

588
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
Because that is what they are attempting to do,

589
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,360
is to try to stop this person's heart with their eyeballs.

590
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,360
Because they are not gized about the way they're spending time.

591
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,200
I think if that's your position,

592
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,120
you should be able to grill them

593
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,800
on what they're going to be using all of this stuff for.

594
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,760
For instance, oh yeah, you really got one over on us this time.

595
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,920
Boy, you must be doing some heavy duty shits to need this much, huh?

596
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,600
Tell me everything about that.

597
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,760
Boy, you guys really love mustard.

598
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
Put it on everything, huh?

599
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,560
Drink some of that.

600
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,280
Hey, drink a whole-

601
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,080
I'll let you do this

602
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,120
because you've got the right pieces of paper from the newspaper.

603
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,880
Boy, this is a fucked up shitty system.

604
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,320
But go ahead and drink a whole container of mustard for me right now.

605
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
And we'll get the bathroom ready for you

606
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,280
because apparently it disagrees with you.

607
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,520
You better start eating those pickles right now.

608
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
If you're going to eat them before they expire, go on.

609
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,640
Open a jar of pickles and eat it in front of me.

610
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I got a lot of coupons this game.

611
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,040
And I need something to entertain me.

612
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,240
I got plenty of time.

613
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,960
Get one of those spicy boys out

614
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,040
and get your crunch on right in front of me.

615
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,720
Entertain me, pickle lover.

616
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,840
You've never seen-

617
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,040
I love watching-

618
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,080
There's certain moments on the Extreme Couponing shows

619
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,880
where you can actually watch the cashiers' worldview crumble around them

620
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,800
when they ring all of them in

621
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,800
and realize that somehow through the machinations of this clipper,

622
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,680
they owe money back to the person.

623
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,680
It's rare, but it does happen.

624
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,080
It's like, according to this, I owe you five dollars.

625
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,880
And like in that moment, they cease to unders-

626
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,080
Like you can watch this person realize they have no idea

627
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,160
how capitalism or barter and trade or the world itself works.

628
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,560
And I just assume after that they go live in the woods.

629
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Oh, full blown hunter forager, like done, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

630
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,600
Yeah, I've seen too much and I've seen it

631
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
and the shine came off the capitalism apple.

632
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm in the woods now, see ya.

633
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
The other great thing about those shows

634
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,080
is when the person gives you a tour of their stocks

635
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,360
that they've gotten with it.

636
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,200
And there's always a shot where it's like,

637
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,160
and over here I've got 30 cans of peas

638
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,880
and I wish the camera would just like stay on them

639
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,560
like straight for like three minutes, like not move.

640
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,240
Just like force them to stand there

641
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,200
and confront the fact that they will die someday.

642
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,800
And when they do, they will have peas just litter.

643
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,680
They're gonna have to-

644
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
Your children are gonna have to-

645
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,360
God damn, how many boxes of expired peas

646
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,440
do we have to carry out before the estate sale?

647
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,240
I am Ozymandias, look upon my peas.

648
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,000
But then you realize that and you say,

649
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
and maybe this is how we elevate teen.

650
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,880
You say, I'm not gonna let these peas outlive me.

651
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,560
It's peas morning, noon and night.

652
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
We're getting British up in here.

653
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,960
It's all peas all the way down, baby.

654
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,800
You try to kill me, peas?

655
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,320
You try to outlive me, peas?

656
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,880
Oh shit, we got fucking 20 crates.

657
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,040
We have two metric tons of toilet paper

658
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,200
and I'm fucking 58 years old.

659
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,720
Let's get fucking going.

660
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,080
Crampies, crampies, crampies.

661
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,280
Yeah, I need those.

662
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,640
Hey plumber, plumber, get over here.

663
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,840
I need those wide pipes

664
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,160
because I'm gonna die in 20 to 30 years

665
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,520
according to medical science.

666
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Maybe these peas will keep me alive a little bit longer.

667
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,160
I'm not gonna let this bastard toilet paper outlive me.

668
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,000
You hear me, toilet paper?

669
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,880
Get over here, plumber.

670
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,560
I need double pipes, two toilets.

671
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:12,960
Let's go.

672
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,040
What do you kids want for dinner tonight?

673
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,240
A split pea soup.

674
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,840
Oh, you want me to split the peas

675
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
and therefore effectively double the number of peas?

676
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
I fucking think not, Jeremy.

677
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,960
I think not.

678
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,800
You're gonna have your usual peas

679
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,760
shaped into a hamburger shape on a pea bun.

680
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,480
Get to eating.

681
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
And then you're gonna go shit, Jeremy,

682
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,920
because we got to.

683
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,600
We all need to chip in here.

684
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,760
You're gonna make yourself...

685
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
I know I've always told you to not make the mummy hand,

686
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,840
but I am issuing a house-wide decree.

687
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,800
Everyone mummy hands for their toilet paper usage.

688
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Everybody has to mummy hand.

689
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,040
We're gonna get through this.

690
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,680
You got any teachers that are real pieces of shit?

691
00:32:49,680 --> 00:33:01,840
Here's the perfect time to go to the money sound.

692
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,640
Our first sponsor this week is MeUndies.

693
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,280
MeUndies.

694
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I don't like when they include language in these,

695
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,480
but I'm just gonna have to say it.

696
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,640
MeUndies makes your...

697
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
Makes undies that your...

698
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,120
butt.

699
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,920
Oh, yuck!

700
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
And we're not the only ones who love MeUndies.

701
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,080
Listen to what longtime listener and MeUndies enthusiast,

702
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
Christian, has to say.

703
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,600
Okay, this is from a listener of ours named Christian.

704
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,520
It says, MeUndies changed my life.

705
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,600
No longer do I suffer from uncomfortable scratchy cloth

706
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,800
like I did before.

707
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,640
I now look forward to putting on my MeUndies every morning.

708
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,400
It's like riding on a cloud.

709
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,720
And though I'm married, no one holds me better.

710
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
That's lovely, Christian.

711
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
That's basically a haiku.

712
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,160
So thank you so much for that.

713
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,000
You can be like Christian.

714
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,760
Do you think there's someone at MeUndies

715
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,480
whose job is specifically to come up with ads

716
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,080
just for my brother and my brother and me?

717
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,000
I think they gotta have their own dedication.

718
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,640
They were like, they can't handle the pressure

719
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,800
of talking about the underwear themselves.

720
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,440
You can get 20% off the best and softest underwear and socks

721
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,280
you will ever own with free shipping

722
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,040
and a 100% satisfaction guarantee

723
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,840
when you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

724
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,200
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

725
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,320
I also just want to say,

726
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
because it doesn't get enough credit,

727
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,280
they also now have bralettes and hoodies

728
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,760
and sleep pants and t-shirts.

729
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,040
Go check it out.

730
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,440
I want to tell you about NatureBox.

731
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,120
When it comes to eating better,

732
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,960
it feels like sometimes when you're snacking down,

733
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,400
it's either you make a decision.

734
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,160
Do you want delicious and billion calories

735
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,920
or do you want boring and tasteless food?

736
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,040
I say fuck both those.

737
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,240
And NatureBox also says that.

738
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,760
It says right here, fuck both those.

739
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,920
Because you can snack good and even better with NatureBox.

740
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,600
They got over 100 snacks that taste good

741
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,480
and are better for you.

742
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
And they're all made from high quality, simple ingredients

743
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,880
with no artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.

744
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,320
I talk about all the time.

745
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,600
I like that Big Island Pineapple.

746
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,720
Do you think that that is Jimmy's favorite also

747
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,760
is the Big Island Pineapple?

748
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,480
I mean, he probably-

749
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
You have to imagine.

750
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,880
He probably has his own sort of wet pineapple.

751
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,360
These are delicious, huge dried pineapple rings.

752
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,080
He has his own probably wet pineapple solutions.

753
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,840
But I bet he'd still get down on these.

754
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,960
They add new snacks every month

755
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,080
and they're shipped right to your door.

756
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,400
They will replace snacks you don't like for free.

757
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,760
And right now NatureBox is offering

758
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,960
My Brother, My Brother, and Me fans

759
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240

760
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,000

761
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,680
That's naturebox.com slash my brother

762
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,200
for 50% off your first order.

763
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,840
One last time, naturebox.com slash my brother.

764
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,920
Got a message here for Rosemary Trevail.

765
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,960
I don't know why you had to say it

766
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,560
like you're at a Ren Fair.

767
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
I just really like that name.

768
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,200
There's a lot to that.

769
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,480
One, it's got Trav in it, which-

770
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
You know that's the best.

771
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,080
Yeah, but also it's just a beautiful name.

772
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,640
It's a good name.

773
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,960
It's from Craig.

774
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,040
Oh, don't say Craig's name like that

775
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,200
after we're giving Rosemary the Shakespeare.

776
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,080
Well, I'm gonna go with Gregory Jamonson.

777
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
That's okay, Gregory.

778
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,960
That's you now.

779
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,480
Gregory Jamonson.

780
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,040
And Gregory writes,

781
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,600
I don't know what day this will be read on

782
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,520
or even what month,

783
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,920
but we shall get snacks tonight.

784
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,040
Parenthetical, you are the best.

785
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,200
Love, Gregory.

786
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,640
I don't know about this character, Trav.

787
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,320
I feel like he needs some third-

788
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,600
My name is Jumbo Tron.

789
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,760
And when I say that,

790
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
I think maybe I should be a robot man instead.

791
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,560
Yeah, start him over.

792
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,360
Start him over.

793
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:27,920
Okay.

794
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,560
This message is for Rosemary Trevail.

795
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,400
Jumbo Tron, you're back.

796
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,880
It's from Craig.

797
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,800
Well, don't read the message a second time, Jumbo.

798
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,080
Don't read it a second time, Jumbo Tron.

799
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,800
I don't know.

800
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,680
I know.

801
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,800
Let me try the next one.

802
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,840
You got a virus from-

803
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,040
This message is for Bevin,

804
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,840
like Kevin with B.

805
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,000
It's from Chris and Sarah.

806
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,680
I feel like we could do-

807
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,120
To Bevin.

808
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,440
Okay.

809
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,760
Master of Psychology.

810
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,520
I'm losing it now.

811
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,080
Yeah, you are a little bit.

812
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,040
I'm just melting.

813
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
You fought off the demons of anxiety,

814
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,560
persevered over the terrors of academia,

815
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,560
and created one incredible kick-ass thesis,

816
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,360
all while being an amazing friend and partner.

817
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,000
Thank you for letting us bask in your glory.

818
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,280
We loved being your companions for these adventures

819
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,920
and look forward to the ones to come.

820
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
See, Jumbo Tron couldn't have delivered

821
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,200
an emotional message like that,

822
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,680
because-

823
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,800
Well, he is real-

824
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
Here's what you don't know, Griffin.

825
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
His love is not real.

826
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,000
What you don't know, Griffin,

827
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
is halfway when my voice changed,

828
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,080
that is when I Bicentennial-manned.

829
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,240
Oh, you got a penis.

830
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,560
Yeah, Jumbo Tron got a penis.

831
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
You got a penis that can cum in everything.

832
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,000
That's my favorite line from that movie,

833
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,520
is Oliver Platt gives him a penis,

834
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,640
and he's like, can it cum?

835
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,720
And Oliver's like, it can cum in everything.

836
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,640
Cum in everything or cum and everything?

837
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
Cum and everything.

838
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
And Bicentennial Man then says like,

839
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,880
oh, like a real penis.

840
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,560
Cool.

841
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,200
Cool.

842
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,640
So great job, Bevan.

843
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,680
What is the everything?

844
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
Pee and, you know.

845
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,920
And whistle.

846
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,720
Whistle.

847
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,920
Look just cool.

848
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,880
Well, no.

849
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,760
No, not really.

850
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,400
Oh, sorry about that.

851
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,640
Just had to dispatch some goons real quick.

852
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,080
Hi, I'm April Wolf,

853
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,600
lead film critic at LA Weekly.

854
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,200
And when I'm not kicking butt,

855
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm hosting the new maximum fun podcast,

856
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
Switchblade Sisters.

857
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,240
Do you love genre films?

858
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,080
Do you love female filmmakers?

859
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,680
Do you love discussions on craft?

860
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,880
If your answer is yes,

861
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,720
you'll love Switchblade Sisters.

862
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,360
Every episode, I invite one female filmmaker on

863
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,000
and we talk in depth about their fave genre film

864
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,760
and how it influenced their own work.

865
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,120
So we're talking horror, action, sci-fi, fantasy,

866
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
bizarro and exploitation cinema.

867
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,800
Mothers, lock up your sons

868
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,360
because the Switchblade Sisters are coming for you.

869
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,440
Available at maximumfun.org

870
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,360
or wherever you find your podcasts.

871
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,480
How about this one?

872
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,760
It's sent in by Jace Parker.

873
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,320
Thank you, Jace.

874
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

875
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,120
Yasin, who asks,

876
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,600
what if we can breath in space

877
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,760
but the government tells us we can't

878
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
so we don't try to escape?

879
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
Hell yeah.

880
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,000
What if we can breath in space

881
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
but the government tells us we can't

882
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,520
so we don't try to escape?

883
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,020
Earth?

884
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,460
Earth, like we don't try to-

885
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:29,960
Earth?

886
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,620
By earth-

887
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
Earth is the biggest prison.

888
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,900
I think we can all agree on that.

889
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,580
Earth is a big prison

890
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,780
and maybe I don't want to be, you know, rained on.

891
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,340
Gross, I shouldn't have to.

892
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,100
I want to go above the rain, up in space

893
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,940
where I definitely can't breathe

894
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,300
but government tells me I can't

895
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,180
because they're up there doing who knows what.

896
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,740
Why would the government want to keep you on earth?

897
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,940
I think that they'd be fine

898
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,780
if you wanted to blast off to new-

899
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,940
Well, because I'm saying space is cool

900
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,940
and we're doing stuff up there, maybe.

901
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,440
Yeah.

902
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,900
Well, we're definitely doing stuff up there, maybe.

903
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,140
Oh yeah.

904
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,100
We can fly around-

905
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
You could fly around like Second Life

906
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,060
or, you know, punch an asteroid or-

907
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,900
Maybe they're afraid one of us will get to the moon

908
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,660
and be like, this is mine

909
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,020
and it's like, well, damn it.

910
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,300
Well, shoot, we didn't call-

911
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,580
Nobody called it.

912
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,340
Nobody's called dibs yet on moon.

913
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,460
We should have thought of that when we were there, maybe.

914
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,420
Didn't they call dibs on the-

915
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,260
They put their flag there, right? America was there.

916
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,100
There's a position at NASA, this is not a joke,

917
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,300
at NASA that was hiring in the last few years

918
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,740
that was galactic preservationist

919
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:43,220
and it was a person who made sure that nobody called the moon.

920
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,420
It was like they made sure that folks were cool

921
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,420
about all the planets and stuff

922
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,940
and nobody tried to get up to some shit.

923
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,780
Did they wait up there with a big space flashlight?

924
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,060
Like, hey, hey- Move it along, move it along.

925
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,980
Try to have sex on Jupiter.

926
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,980
I mean, the only question about that is like,

927
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,220
exactly how many, I'll be generous and say weeks

928
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,100
before Craig, the galactic preservationist, is like,

929
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,660
oh no, this is Craig's moon.

930
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,860
Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.

931
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,180
Like, I fully do have ownership

932
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,780
and jurisdiction over this moon.

933
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,180
And guess what? Jupiter's got like 17 moons.

934
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,020
I'm not gonna claim IO, but I'm gonna get one of the smaller ones that nobody knows the name of.

935
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:26,980
Kiss me.

936
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,260
The one with all the exotics on it.

937
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,300
Well, yeah.

938
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,340
Off my shorts?

939
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,740
I'm crying.

940
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,860
Okay, Nessus.

941
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,740
Here's the thing.

942
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,780
Can I just say, and this is a bold move, but I think it's gonna stick.

943
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,820
I claim Mercury.

944
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,620
Oh, Trav.

945
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,820
No, no, no.

946
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,380
Hear me out.

947
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,460
I have a very strong sense that when I do that, someone will-

948
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,020
This will be like an Air Bud situation where it's like,

949
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,100
wait, well, that's gotta be against the rules.

950
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,140
And then they'll flip through the book and realize there's no rule

951
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,740
against me claiming Mercury, and it holds up in a court of law.

952
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,740
Mercury's mine.

953
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,140
I'm gonna take Uranus, but just so I can rename it like Cool Planet,

954
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,740
and people can't make the joke anymore.

955
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,340
A good joke, though.

956
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,380
How long will it take me to get there?

957
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,180
Can I Google map?

958
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,780
Now, it'll take me 17 hours to get to Uranus Road in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

959
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,180
And that is kind of still funny, like Uranus Road.

960
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:26,740
Like, drive my car, my F-150 into Uranus.

961
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,620
How about another Yahoo?

962
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:29,940
Do it.

963
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,580
Yeah, sure.

964
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,300
I mean, this one is sent in by Morgan Davies, so let's keep it wavy.

965
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,620
And it's from Yahoo Answers user Cassandra, who asks,

966
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,580
nightmare about a nut head?

967
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,700
Since a few days ago, I keep having this nightmare

968
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,860
about seeing a nut head everywhere.

969
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,900
Wait, what?

970
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:50,260
It's just a man dressed in casual clothes with a giant nut as a head.

971
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,580
I can't explain what nut it is in shape, but I would say a walnut.

972
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,740
In the dream, I would see him appear to me like a ghost

973
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,060
through house windows from the inside on the ending of a road not too far,

974
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,900
street corners, libraries, fire exit, and other creepy places.

975
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,460
He would disappear two seconds after I spot him.

976
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,820
Other people won't spot him.

977
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,940
It's kind of like those horror movie scenes where they see a ghost of a loved one

978
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,340
or a deceased person from a haunted home,

979
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,820
and only one or two people see it, but others don't.

980
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,940
I get very scared, and I start saying short prayers,

981
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,900
feeling that I haven't seen anything like this in my life.

982
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,260
The dream is very continuous, and does that mean I need deliverance?

983
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,980
He doesn't have eyes, mouth, nose, ears, et cetera,

984
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,980
but I can sense he's looking at me or just in my presence

985
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,260
before I spot him and disappear.

986
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,220
What the fuck?

987
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,060
What do you think can happen next in the dream?

988
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,220
I'm not having any mental problems or disturbances.

989
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,420
You're going to die.

990
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,580
You're going to die from a nut attack.

991
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,940
You have a nut allergy.

992
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,460
That might be the real one.

993
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,180
You have a nut allergy, and this is your body talking to your brain.

994
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,300
Your fucking lungs and your whatever gets bad when you have a nut allergy,

995
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,220
your blood, it's like in your brain, like,

996
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,060
yo, be afraid of walnuts.

997
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,260
Thanksgiving's coming up.

998
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,940
Stay on your toes.

999
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,860
It is weird.

1000
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,060
People are always trying to sneak nuts in there.

1001
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,540
I know.

1002
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,620
It is so weird to be the origin of a creepypasta.

1003
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,060
I didn't know what it felt like to be the first person

1004
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,820
that someone heard a story from that heard the story from someone,

1005
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,620
like with the middleman of a creepypasta.

1006
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:28,340
This is like, okay, in many ways, I think scarier than Slenderman.

1007
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,580
I think we have, and this is why I did want to talk about is

1008
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,140
I think we could get a lot of profit, a lot of financial profit,

1009
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,300
and this bad or good economy, it's good to diversify your portfolio.

1010
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:39,940
Or neutral.

1011
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,420
It might be neutral economy, waffle neutral.

1012
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,020
I think it's chaotic.

1013
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,940
But anyway, it's definitely chaotic.

1014
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,620
But anyway, Nuthead, I think, has a lot of potential.

1015
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,340
Yeah, we found our offering.

1016
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,220
Now, we'll get this dumb show for seven years.

1017
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,100
We finally found our platform to get off.

1018
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,020
That's kind of just like Nuthead.

1019
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,380
The sci-fi original movie Nuthead by the McElroy brothers.

1020
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,180
And Nuthead, very scary.

1021
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:11,620
Will we get sued by the Planner's Peanut and all that that's happening?

1022
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,260
Are we going to be sued by the Planner's Peanut?

1023
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,780
Because he's got a sort of cool style these days.

1024
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,380
And I'm worried that maybe we could see some.

1025
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,860
Is there a Nuthead out there already that we're going to?

1026
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,220
I guess the Ohio State Buckeye mascot is kind of like that.

1027
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,820
He's kind of like that.

1028
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,980
But it's like, you know what nut that is.

1029
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,860
Well, a Buckeye is really more, it's like a seed.

1030
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,060
And he's got a warm and inviting face that says like,

1031
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,660
it's football time, baby.

1032
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,060
This nut doesn't have a face and he doesn't say anything.

1033
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,940
Does he carry around big nutcrackers though?

1034
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,060
No, I think he's just a, here's the thing.

1035
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,700
We could go with a lot of like accessories.

1036
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,220
But I think man in a suit, right?

1037
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,020
Casual look, casual look.

1038
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,980
Casual look.

1039
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,500
Yeah, so like a jade through top and some corduroy pants.

1040
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,180
But, and just like moves with stillness,

1041
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,140
like moves in a very controlled manner.

1042
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,340
And it's just ever present in your dream hellscape.

1043
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,620
I don't know that he needs any accessories

1044
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,620
except maybe a walnut shaped car.

1045
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,060
Now that's, now we're on some busy world of Richard's scary

1046
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,380
but spelled like S-E-A-R-Y.

1047
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,900
Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1048
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,140
But maybe you don't see that until dream 12.

1049
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,300
And like dream one through 11, you're like, oh God, oh God.

1050
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,060
Dream 12, he gets in his walnut car,

1051
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,140
propeller pops up on top, he flies away,

1052
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,460
and he has a fun time in the sky with his worm.

1053
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,180
And on 12, you're like, hey, well.

1054
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,180
Oh wait, maybe Mr. Nuthead's fun.

1055
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,940
But then in dream 13, he's back.

1056
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,020
And this time he has a hundred knives.

1057
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,420
Yeah, oh, so maybe not Mr. Nuthead.

1058
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,420
The thing I don't love about this

1059
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,180
that I would wanna tweak this IP

1060
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,100
that we've created from a Yahoo answer

1061
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,780
is the casual clothes.

1062
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,540
That just strikes me as very strange

1063
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,540
that you're like Nut Predator would be just in sweats.

1064
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,860
Oh shit.

1065
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,540
That could be a lot scarier, I think.

1066
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,660
Maybe you're invading Nuthead's home in this dream.

1067
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,300
You're in Nuthead's dream, right?

1068
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,100
So Nuthead, when he's out scaring,

1069
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,260
or they, let's say they, let's not assume,

1070
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,740
when they're out scaring, they're in full scary tux,

1071
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,940
right, or whatever.

1072
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,860
And when they're at home, they're in maybe a polo

1073
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,940
and some me on these lounge pants.

1074
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,260
And it's an interesting look, but it's theirs.

1075
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,980
And then they keep looking at you through windows

1076
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,060
because they're like, what the fuck?

1077
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,500
Oh, she's back, she's back, she's back.

1078
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,260
Yeah, Nuthead wakes up in the middle of the night

1079
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,260
next to their partner in bed and shakes them

1080
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,020
because they had the dream again.

1081
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:46,420
And then Nuthead looks at them and says nothing.

1082
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,300
Nothing, Nuthead can't talk.

1083
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,820
I mean, I don't have a mouth, but yeah.

1084
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,380
Nuthead has to, we have to say Nuthead talking

1085
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,460
for like a few films in, I feel like.

1086
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,980
I mean, they probably just rattle around

1087
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,740
and then Nut bumps up against the husk.

1088
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,660
And so it sounds like, you know, and that's,

1089
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,660
you know what, very scary.

1090
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,260
Like, I love that.

1091
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,180
But you know, what is scary except the abnormal?

1092
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,900
So to the Nut family, like they're, you know,

1093
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,660
rattling around and it's like, yeah, that's normal.

1094
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,700
And then they see a human and their face opens up.

1095
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,020
Yeah.

1096
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,500
And there's like jagged bones and shit in there.

1097
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,460
That's terrifying.

1098
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,460
A human being's faces are scary as shit.

1099
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,060
If Travis, you've got a good point.

1100
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,300
I've got, my mouth is full of sharp bones

1101
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,900
and a lot of those bones have metal in them

1102
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,460
because I eat a lot of Sour Patch Kids.

1103
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,960
Right.

1104
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,500
And can you imagine that?

1105
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,900
Like it's all wet and pink and gross in there.

1106
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,180
And you've got this weird like exposed organ in your mouth

1107
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,540
that's like, and it can like, it licks.

1108
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,660
What's going on with that?

1109
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,540
Is it poisonous?

1110
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,180
If I'm a Nuthead.

1111
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,380
And you eat nuts.

1112
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,580
Yeah, you eat nuts.

1113
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,460
Nuts don't eat you.

1114
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:53,220
Yeah, if you were eating, even eating Sour Patch Kids

1115
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,900
would be hugely disturbing to nuts.

1116
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,740
Like they eat the children.

1117
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:56,980
Yeah.

1118
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,220
Because they don't know the difference between fruit.

1119
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,780
I think this is an important part of the character

1120
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,020
is that they're an idiot because it's.

1121
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,620
That's the one thing about like,

1122
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,820
the good thing about the Nut Man.

1123
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,940
Is that what we're calling him?

1124
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,980
Nuthead, just Nuthead.

1125
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,180
The good thing about Nuthead is he is extremely gullible.

1126
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,500
So like, if you turn off the lights in the room,

1127
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,780
he's like, I've gone blind.

1128
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,340
Yeah, no, he's a very scary idiot.

1129
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,660
You know how they talk about like the dinosaurs had a brain

1130
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,020
the size of a walnut?

1131
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,420
Yeah.

1132
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,300
This is what, this, this, this is what they're talking about.

1133
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,500
Okay, but it's a large nut, right?

1134
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,860
Oh no, it's quite large.

1135
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,420
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1136
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,820
What if it's not a big walnut?

1137
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:48,660
You open the window and you're like, oh my God, it's a headless man.

1138
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,300
No, no, no, look, there's a little walnut on there.

1139
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,340
On a regular size neck?

1140
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:58,340
On a regular size neck, it just tapers up to a walnut.

1141
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,180
It's already talking about like steep taper on the neck.

1142
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,980
What's scarier?

1143
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,700
What's scarier?

1144
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,140
Because I think small walnut is much, much, much, much, much, much, much scarier.

1145
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,140
Yeah, good luck.

1146
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,060
I mean, like, if you see a large nut, you are in a horror situation.

1147
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,060
You are going to know that you need to crack it.

1148
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,700
Like, it's obvious you need to bury an ax in there.

1149
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,940
If it's a small nut, like, good luck.

1150
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,060
Good luck, yeah.

1151
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,660
Like, you'd have to hold still.

1152
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,340
Well, and imagine the scene of like, you look out the window and it, what looks like,

1153
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,740
just like a regular walnut sitting on the window sill.

1154
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,820
And you're like, oh, somebody left a walnut on my window,

1155
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,980
but then it stands up and there's shoulders?

1156
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,620
Shoulders.

1157
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,100
Get out of town, there's a Travis shaped hole in the wall.

1158
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:39,860
Okay, from a marketing perspective though, is tiny nut head gonna be a lot harder to

1159
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:44,980
cosplay? Because I feel like people are gonna want to bring this character to cons.

1160
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,940
It's gonna require head binding and a very, very intense,

1161
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,180
you gotta shrink your head down and that's all there is to it.

1162
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,420
Let me offer a solution that I think the boys in R&D and marketing are gonna be happy with.

1163
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:06,580
It is a creature with a small nut head, but they wear a helmet that looks like a big nut.

1164
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,820
And you don't find that out till maybe movie four.

1165
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,540
Um.

1166
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:14,260
So the entire time they've had a small nut in there.

1167
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:14,500
Right.

1168
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:14,740
Okay.

1169
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:21,460
I think we would be remiss in not doing our duty if we did not maybe even explore

1170
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,940
the space of what if the head is truck nuts?

1171
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,740
Like, I feel like it's our job as doing a comedy podcast, three dudes on it.

1172
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,940
Can we not do the Wayans brothers work for them?

1173
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,900
Like, they're obviously going to be parodying this with truck nuts.

1174
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,300
Yeah.

1175
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,500
I don't know that we want to.

1176
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,020
I mean, if you want to beat them to the punch for scary movie 80,

1177
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,460
like, I'm fine with that.

1178
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,660
If you want to go ahead and say, like,

1179
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,540
Well, they got options.

1180
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,060
You could do nut head and they could do butt head and there's a big butt up in there.

1181
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,660
There's a lot of fun stuff.

1182
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,140
Who?

1183
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,980
I mean, this is the big question that everybody's sort of asking that are on the tip of their

1184
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,140
tongue and I did want to hold the cards close to the vest, but I think we should go ahead

1185
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,340
and just get it out there.

1186
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,180
Who's playing nut head?

1187
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,620
Let me Google best actors.

1188
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,100
Google best actors because who we like?

1189
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,940
Martin Sheen as nut head.

1190
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,780
Nobody would see that one coming, I feel like.

1191
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,580
And I feel like he needs, you know, he's been out of limelight for a little bit.

1192
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,820
Gotta be Viggo.

1193
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,660
Oh my God.

1194
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,460
Viggo Mortensen.

1195
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,780
Gotta be Idris Elba.

1196
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,500
Idris Elba is in everything.

1197
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,900
I don't like he's way too busy.

1198
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,260
But you know who we might be able to have some chance with is Mads.

1199
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,140
Yeah.

1200
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,860
Gotta get Mads Mikkelsen on this.

1201
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,820
Oh my God, Justin.

1202
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,860
You are actually doing a very good job at casting nut head.

1203
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,940
Like Mads Mikkelsen is nut head.

1204
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,460
IRL.

1205
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,820
He's real life nut head.

1206
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:57,780
Like I heard he's been looking for a franchise and this could be, I mean, sure he was in,

1207
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,860
you know, Doctor Strange and Star Wars and Casino Royale, but like this could be his

1208
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,100
franchise that is just Mads.

1209
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,620
Cause you know, once he's retired, he's going to want to work the con circuit.

1210
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:13,780
And what better way of establishing those sort of bona fides than with a huge horror

1211
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,940
franchise that is all Mads.

1212
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:22,420
I'm worried that we just took the first draft and kind of ran with it.

1213
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,260
Cause nut head I think is very good.

1214
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:30,180
Is there another, are there other characters that we could generate here?

1215
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,540
Do you mean like a nut head kids club kind of thing?

1216
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:38,820
Well, no, it's maybe before we go all in on nut head is lamp body anything.

1217
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,500
And this is a person with Mads Mikkelsen's head and I think we could get better acting

1218
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,540
out of him that way.

1219
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,980
But then his neck and everything below it is just one very big lamp.

1220
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,700
That's sort of the direction I would love to explore.

1221
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:55,460
What you need in a good horror character I think is what you need is the reveal of like,

1222
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,380
so maybe it's like, um, the tips of their fingers are micromachines, you know?

1223
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,260
So it's like, oh, that's just a normal per- Oh no.

1224
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,060
Oh no.

1225
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,580
They got micromachines on their fingers.

1226
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,420
They got micromachines for feeners.

1227
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,060
Is guitar boner anything?

1228
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,740
Is that anything?

1229
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,140
No, Prince already did that back in the Super Bowl.

1230
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:15,860
You're right.

1231
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,820
It's done.

1232
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,860
Guitar boner's done.

1233
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,620
What about cream cheese feet?

1234
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,300
Cream cheese feet is very scary.

1235
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,620
Now can they ambulate?

1236
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,820
Well, I think they kind of slip and slide all over the place.

1237
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,340
That's a bad scary way.

1238
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:28,740
Yeah.

1239
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,220
Yeah.

1240
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,260
Let me pitch this.

1241
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,500
Washboard abs, but literal.

1242
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:32,980
Okay.

1243
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,180
Okay.

1244
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:34,820
Okay.

1245
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,220
All right.

1246
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,740
I love that.

1247
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,700
We could probably combine all these for the Avengers style.

1248
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,980
I thought you meant in one person with a lamp body, but washboard abs and cream cheese feet

1249
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,500
and a walnut for a head.

1250
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,340
This is just a big pile of things in my garage.

1251
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,380
This character exists in my garage right now.

1252
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,100
That's it.

1253
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,140
That's the reveal, right?

1254
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,380
So, you know, in a movie where it's like you see a scary shadow in the lightning flash

1255
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,580
and you're like, oh, that's a person.

1256
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,700
And you turn it on and it's just, oh, it's just a pile of things on the chair.

1257
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,580
The pile of things on the chair is the killer.

1258
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,900
Oh, shit.

1259
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,700
Oh, shit.

1260
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,180
That's so good.

1261
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:16,100
And maybe Mads is the guy who owns the house and he doesn't realize until it's too late.

1262
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,300
And we can call it Mads and the real nut.

1263
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,700
And he doesn't maybe because then we get a psychological horror element of is it the lamp

1264
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,540
a real, but it is a real.

1265
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,660
And it's also played by Mads.

1266
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,300
Mads Mikkelsen and Martin Sheen are roommates.

1267
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,900
Loving it so far.

1268
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,580
In college.

1269
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:32,900
Bring it.

1270
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,460
And they've just-

1271
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,060
In college, but now.

1272
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,180
Yeah, no, they went back because-

1273
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:38,740
They're non-traditional students.

1274
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,540
Martin Sheen retired and went back because he wants to get his master's and like-

1275
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,980
Because he has to prove to his dad that he can inherit the hotel fortune.

1276
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,100
And so he goes back, right?

1277
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,340
And Mads realized he never really had a childhood because he was a child star.

1278
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,780
And so now he wants to go back to college.

1279
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,700
To get his madsters.

1280
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,500
Uh-huh.

1281
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,860
And they've rented an apartment and-

1282
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,220
When does Nuthead even show up in this fucking feature, Travis?

1283
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,820
Well, Nuthead comes at the end where Nuthead reaches up and you just see like a hand,

1284
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,380
which is actually unidentifiable as Nuthead because-

1285
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,380
Okay, hold on, okay, hold on.

1286
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,900
Hold on, hold on.

1287
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,820
Travis has just suggested an innovation,

1288
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,020
which I believe is bigger than Nuthead, bigger than anything.

1289
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,980
Where, and it's a secret horror movie.

1290
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:32,660
Seren Dippin, fucking Cusack and Beckonsdale, or Beckonsworth.

1291
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,380
No one can remember right now, Griffin can't.

1292
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,300
Get together, they put the number in the book.

1293
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,900
Oh, fate brought them back to-

1294
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,100
While you were sleeping.

1295
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,580
You woke up and you got a pencil through his balls,

1296
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,300
but I love him and not you and I'm so sorry.

1297
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,860
And then Sandy and the other one get in bed and goodnight,

1298
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:57,620
and then a hand reaches up and comes up from under the bed and reaches up

1299
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:02,340
and grabs at the person, grabs at them, grabs at them, it's so scary.

1300
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:06,740
And then it cuts to black and then all the things you say to me,

1301
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,260
because I'm one step, you know?

1302
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,420
And it was like, it was a horror movie the whole time, dumb-dumbs.

1303
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,220
Yeah, exactly.

1304
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,740
Just people say it's so scary and you'll be watching the whole thing like,

1305
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,460
this doesn't seem that scary.

1306
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,980
I don't think it's very scary.

1307
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,980
They're out on a lake and then, uh-oh, Jason jumps out of the lake at the end.

1308
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,260
Spook, spook, spook.

1309
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,180
Smash cut to black.

1310
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,460
And there you said it again.

1311
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,740
And here's my innovation.

1312
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,660
If I might take this innovation even further,

1313
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,780
the post-credit sequence is an hour and 45 minutes long.

1314
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,580
And it's them fighting the nuthead.

1315
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,860
It's them fighting the nuthead.

1316
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,140
So it's like, stick around for after the credits,

1317
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,220
but do make sure you go to the bathroom during the credits

1318
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,020
and get something to eat and maybe call the babysitter.

1319
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,300
The movie is about to start.

1320
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:47,540
Yeah.

1321
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,940
And I think maybe it doesn't have to be an hour 45 minutes.

1322
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,380
I think this is in every movie.

1323
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:56,420
And so while you were sleeping two still woke,

1324
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,740
they have to fight off the nuthead

1325
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,340
and they probably have a little bit of trouble with it,

1326
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,020
but then they push them in front of the train tracks

1327
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,900
and it's a very poetic and great way to kill the nuthead.

1328
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,380
Thor Ragnarok, they beat the devil or whatever at the end.

1329
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,980
I haven't seen it because I don't go to movies anymore,

1330
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,380
but they beat them and they're like, yeah, we did it.

1331
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,060
And they have the big feast at the end

1332
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,580
and Thor's there and the Hulk there

1333
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,540
and they're all having fun.

1334
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,860
And then nuthead reaches up on a table.

1335
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,780
Everything you say to me.

1336
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,540
And then it cuts to the end of the credits

1337
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,700
and they're like, nuthead smash into the,

1338
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,420
they kill him with their superpowers, their big hammer.

1339
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,900
So it could be, I mean, it's just,

1340
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,340
it doesn't have to be a horror movie.

1341
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,940
It's just before the movie ends,

1342
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,540
someone has to fight the nuthead.

1343
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,700
And that, can I tell you something?

1344
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,540
We're going to make bank on that.

1345
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,460
Yeah, because you're going to make money from nuthead

1346
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,660
being in every movie ever made.

1347
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,300
Yeah, right?

1348
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,940
Like the, and it's going to create one big,

1349
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,860
like nuttiverse where like every movie is connected by nuthead.

1350
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,500
And then the way ends when they do the scary movie 80 sequel

1351
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,100
and they do have truck nuts at the end of it

1352
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,340
and they do all their fun jokes at the end of it.

1353
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,420
They're going to have to confront the nuthead

1354
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,980
and there's nothing they can, and it's going to confuse.

1355
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,940
I thought this was a parody.

1356
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,420
Why is the nuthead, he has to be in all movies now.

1357
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,300
They passed the law.

1358
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,460
It's all, it's illegal.

1359
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,540
I have, I have terrible news.

1360
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,980
We have put all this in the podcast.

1361
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:15,700
Oh man.

1362
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,420
Oh no.

1363
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,220
TM, TM, TM.

1364
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,860
Yeah, the past-

1365
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,060
TM, TM, TM, TM, TM.

1366
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,460
Oh, I thought you were saying because the past 25 minutes

1367
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,220
have been sort of a freestyle,

1368
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:29,380
just nonsense sort of diarrhea sort of pinata situation.

1369
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,140
No, no, no, no, no.

1370
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,260
That's, that's all fine.

1371
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,580
That is, however, the conclusion of our podcast.

1372
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,500
We hope you've inexplicably enjoyed yourself throughout.

1373
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,540
Want to, one last time,

1374
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,820
because it's the last time I'll get to talk to you

1375
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:48,180
until it happens, McElroy shows.com slash tours.

1376
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,940
Please go get tickets for the Chicago show

1377
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,540
and our Milwaukee show.

1378
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,900
They're going to be a lot of fun.

1379
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,300
I promise they will be fun and also somewhat buck wild.

1380
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,420
And please send in your questions for those shows.

1381
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,460
And when you do, just a little brief reminder

1382
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,540
on the best way to get your questions on the shows.

1383
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,420
Anything that's like looking for actual help

1384
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,900
about a non-serious situation,

1385
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,180
like those are the two best scenarios.

1386
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,220
Like just a funny story that you saw.

1387
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,420
We appreciate the funny stories.

1388
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,460
It's just, please understand,

1389
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,700
it is just not a very good launchpad for us to do our thing.

1390
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,580
And the same is like, if you are asking about

1391
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:34,100
like a really serious situation between friends or whatever,

1392
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,260
we're not going to make goofs

1393
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,980
about your very serious life situation.

1394
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,020
So when you send in those in,

1395
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,340
just make sure to put either Chicago,

1396
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,820
Milwaukee or Minneapolis in the subject line

1397
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,220
so I can find them quickly and easily.

1398
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,340
Oh, and same for Yahoo's.

1399
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,420
I could really use some help from my Yahoo soldiers out there

1400
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,100
just because we're doing four shows back to back to back

1401
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:54,740
and need a lot of stuff.

1402
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,580
Also, I should mention next episode that goes up

1403
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:58,820
will be a live show from one of these things,

1404
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,780
but we're going to try not to put up two in a row

1405
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:02,580
like we've done in the past.

1406
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,420
We'll hang on to these and we're going to have

1407
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,260
a lot of live shows in the bank.

1408
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,460
I'm not sure what we should do with them,

1409
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,500
but we'll figure it out.

1410
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,260
Also, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1411
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,060
for using our theme song,

1412
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,980
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1413
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,100
It's a fantastic album.

1414
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,380
We're so grateful that we're able to use that

1415
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:15,940
as our theme song.

1416
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,500
And thanks to MaximumFun.org for letting us be on the network.

1417
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,980
You can check out all the great shows there at MaximumFun.org.

1418
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,140
Shows like Lady to the Lady and Stop Podcasting Yourself

1419
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,740
and Jordan and Jesse Go and John Hodgman

1420
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,900
and all kinds of great shows all at MaximumFun.org.

1421
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,220
And we have other stuff that you can find at McElroyShows.com.

1422
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,900
I also, I want to mention because it's not on MaximumFun

1423
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,540
and it's new and I'm really enjoying doing it.

1424
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,340
Me and my friend Tybee have started a podcast called Run,

1425
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,700
a Doctor Who fan cast.

1426
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,140
We're about to wrap up the Eccleston season

1427
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,500
and then we're going to jump around to Tennant

1428
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,020
and Matt Smith and Capaldi episodes.

1429
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:54,420
So that when the new season premieres with Jodie Whittaker,

1430
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,460
we can talk about that.

1431
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,780
You can find it on iTunes or on Twitter.

1432
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,140
It's Run Fan Cast.

1433
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,940
But yeah, we're having a really great time doing it

1434
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,460
and I hope you enjoy it.

1435
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,940
Y'all want to wrap it up?

1436
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,780
Yeah, absolutely.

1437
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,100
All right.

1438
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,700
This one was sent in by a ton of people.

1439
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,420
Thank you, everybody.

1440
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,660
It's from Yahoo Answers user Malcolm who asks,

1441
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,220
is every Greg blood related?

1442
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,660
I can't find any information.

1443
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,900
My name is Justin McElroy.

1444
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,260
I'm Travis McElroy.

1445
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,220
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1446
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,980
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1447
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,820
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1448
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:33,140
Uh oh, what's that coming from under the bed?

1449
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,660
Oh no, he's here.

1450
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,860
And then we have to fight the nut head.

1451
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,860
Just like it's the end of the thing.

1452
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:39,780
Play with me.

1453
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:54,740
You stopped recording, didn't you?

1454
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,420
Guess what?

1455
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:10,820
What?

1456
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,500
We just hit our 100th episode.

1457
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,220
What?

1458
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,820
And what do you think is going to be in store

1459
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,020
for the next 100?

1460
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:18,420
Probably some more feuds with Jennifer Hudson

1461
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,260
and I'm telling you.

1462
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,300
We'll probably do more investigative reporting too,

1463
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,020
like we did with the Kodak and their racist film.

1464
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,020
Not to mention exposing the truth.

1465
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,580
Like how we did with the ugly history of the Texas Rangers.

1466
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:34,100
But we always lighten the mood with a splash of pop culture.

1467
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,220
Olivia Pope's new wig.

1468
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,180
Have you seen that?

1469
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:36,900
It's popping.

1470
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,100
Just like your lip gloss.

1471
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,460
And Janet Jackson.

1472
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,500
And you know we like to put our nerd glasses on

1473
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,900
and talk about things like Marvel.

1474
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,780
It's true.

1475
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,260
That's it.

1476
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,860
I don't speak about DC.

1477
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:50,740
But you just did.

1478
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,620
All from a perspective that's black, queer.

1479
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,060
And ladylike.

1480
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,460
So come on over and learn, laugh, and play

1481
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,580
and join the corner.

1482
01:03:58,580 --> 01:03:59,540
It's a lot of fun.

1483
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,500
I'm having fun right now.

1484
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:06,580
Minority Corner.
