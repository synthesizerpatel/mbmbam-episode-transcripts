1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,520
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,920
Oh no. You're sweet, baby brother.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,360
30 Griffin. Are you okay?

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,640
Yeah, I've just been working out my radio voice.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,680
Okay, because it sounds like you kind of like swallowed a pog slammer and it got stuck.

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,520
Yeah, like a real pog throat.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,560
Podcasts are over. Radio is the future.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,920
Oh god. Now it sounds like you're melting in acid.

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
Time for some ads.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,760
We just started. I don't want to do ads.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,120
We just had a great rock block of comedy 90 seconds for you,

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,200
now it's time to hear from our sponsor, Dutch Miller Chevrolet.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,880
No, I don't want to give free publicity to Dutch Miller Chevrolet.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
Well, I think it's pretty narrow casting to

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
people living in Huntington who want to buy a new Chevy truck.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm so excited. I'm like feeling so energized right now. I'm fantastic.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
Oh, you're excited because that graphic novel is coming out?

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,360
My graphic novel is coming out, I guess. You can probably pre-order it, I'm sure,

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,960
but that is not why. It's because last night I got to hang out with my good friend,

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:59,440
and James Buffett at his concert in Cincinnati. 51 sold out shows there in Cincinnati.

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:08,720
He is just the biggest deal there. Summer cannot start in Cincinnati

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,160
until Jimmy and the Coral Reefer band comes to town.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
That was really frustrating this year because he waited until mid-July.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,320
Yeah.

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,680
And we were like, Jimmy, what about 4th of July? What about all the cookouts?

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
And he was like, you have to wait.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
He said, don't even try to go to them.

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
That's spring, motherfuckers.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,040
But then he came and he saw his shadow, and then Summer was able to start.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,520
I was so thrilled. Me and the whole family got to meet Jimmy, perform on Jimmy's pre-show.

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Yeah, I had a great time there. I'm part of Justin's family,

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
and he definitely invited me too because I live here in Cincinnati.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,280
Yeah, it's weird.

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
I invited Travis, and he didn't even want to say hi to me.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
He didn't even want to see me while I was in town. He was not interested.

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,440
You invited me to come in the brief window you had when you would not be busy with Jimmy Buffett

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,320
if I wanted to come say hi and wave you off like an old-timey cruise line

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,200
so that you could go have fun at Jimmy Buffett without me.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,120
Didn't want you to embarrass me in front of James because he would be sure to-

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,360
That's fair.

46
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't think that's unfair. That's not even what I'm, like,

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,640
gized about, y'all. I'm on a new mission. Can we talk about it real quick?

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah, what level are you on right now, Juice?

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,840
This grind I'm in, it's getting good. I'm in the thick of it right now on this one.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,480
It occurred to me recently that the third season of Pete & Pete isn't available on DVD,

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,800
and for some reason I had been talking or thinking about anything else

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,080
when now that I have the world's tiniest and most adorable bully pulpit that I want to-

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,560
Yeah.

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,520
So I'm going to try to shake a few trees. I'm on the case. See where I can shake out.

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,800
And guys, I think I'm making a little headway.

56
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Except for catching the attention of the giant corporation that would need to actually make this

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,120
happen and could with, I assume, an email. I haven't quite caught them yet,

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,880
but things are going pretty good. Here are the people that I've got involved in this case right

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,440
now.

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,920
Okay.

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,280
Did you talk to Jimmy about this?

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,520
Didn't talk to Jimmy about this. Should have brought it up with Jimmy. God, kicking myself.

63
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,000
Also, did see Emilio Estevez at the show. Did not bring it up to Emilio Estevez.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,840
Oh, you guys got some clout.

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,920
By the way, apparently Emilio Estevez is in your hood, Travis, so get on it.

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,600
Oh, yeah. He's a big fan. He filmed a movie here, bought a house here. Loves it.

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
Loves it over the Rhine.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,040
Okay. I've looped in PJ and Alex from Reply All because they do some internet investigations,

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,480
so I'm trying to get them on it. I do have Danny Tamberelli,

70
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,800
little p, is involved with this discussion. It's big.

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,440
And then someone was like, I think it was PJ, actually said, according to this,

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,720
it's because of a single unlicensed Luscious Jackson song that was on an episode that Nick

73
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
didn't get the rights to. And then I tweeted about that, and then Luscious Jackson comes back

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,200
on their official Twitter feed and is like, pardon, no one has ever spoken to us about it

75
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,280
from Nickelodeon. We are open to talking about it. So I don't know, Nick. You tell me.

76
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, shit, building bridges.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
You tell me, y'all.

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,760
Let me check. Oh, Justin, I just checked my GPS tracker and it seems like the ball

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
is in their courts.

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,560
Yeah. It seems like, listen, it's not up to Luscious because Luscious Jackson is down.

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,400
It's not up to little p, because he's down. I haven't heard from big p yet. I can't imagine

82
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,640
he's the one standing in the way. So you tell me.

83
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,120
Who is it?

84
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
Endless Mike.

85
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,960
Is Endless Mike in the way?

86
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,160
Might be Endless Mike.

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
Is it Rick Gomez?

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,000
Get at us, Rick Gomez. Lift the van.

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,880
The problem, I think the hardest part about this campaign, and it has been difficult and

90
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
challenging for me in mind, the problem is that I'm also trying to get into the movie

91
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,520
Trolls 2 or Trolls Will 2 or now if you prefer. So I can only tap resources that I don't think

92
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,600
necessarily will aid me in getting into the movie Trolls 2. So I am trying to keep these two.

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
I can't put the full force of my efforts behind it.

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,800
Have you guys ever thought about the fact that the three of us are basically living

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,360
our lives as if they are big dumb Christmas lists made by large children who are just like,

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,560
I want to be in Trolls and I want the Pete and Pete 3 on DVD and I want to be Jimmy

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,960
Buffett's best friend and I want to do a high five to Emilio Estevez. And it's like,

98
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,880
whatever forces govern sort of the universe are like, okay, let's see what we can do.

99
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
Let's see what we can do to get you in the picture.

100
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,520
It really makes me think that like the McElroy brothers, not the three of us,

101
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,360
but I mean the idea of us, our careers might be dying and everyone's just really nice to us.

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,360
No doubt about that. Yeah, I've seen the numbers. I've seen the figures.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,920
Let's get into the questions before we do one quick update. I think I just gave myself

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,200
food poisoning with the old hot dogs I ate for lunch. Now they're from 4th of July.

105
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,360
I know they're from 4th of July and they were still in the package. I figured they were okay,

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,920
but I'm starting to feel, you know how you start to like feel it and I'm just starting to feel it.

107
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,160
So let's get going. And I just wanted to set you guys up for that. We might have to stop.

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,640
Okay. Well, I consider myself ward now, I guess. Good.

109
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,960
Let's get into it. Here's our first question. I live on the third floor of an apartment building.

110
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,040
One day after coming home from a run, the lady who lives on the bottom left of my building

111
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,200
whispered, come here, and gestured to her door. As I walked to her door, she went inside and I

112
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,960
waited outside for a couple of minutes. And then she came back with a box of chocolates.

113
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,640
But before she could hand them to me, she asked me where I live. I told her I lived on the top

114
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,600
right of our building. She then frowned, shook her head and put the box of chocolates away.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,040
She told me she thought I was the woman who lived on the top left and then closed the door.

116
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,000
I couldn't have eaten the chocolate anyway, but I was very sad that she took them away.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,640
The woman she was talking about looks nothing like me anyway. What did the woman across from me

118
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,200
do to deserve chocolate? How do I prove to the old lady that I am also deserving of chocolate?

119
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,520
That's from Sad About Sweets in San Diego. Now, normally this is an advice show,

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,760
but Sad About Sweets has asked us to dip our toes into what? Prognostication?

121
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Mind reading?

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
More like life coaching, I think.

123
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,760
Yeah, I got some life coaching and it's, I can highlight four different places you fucked up

124
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,680
so bad. It's almost a one per sentence, which is a pretty good ratio. Let's see, a stranger opens

125
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,800
the door in your apartment building and they say from their room, come here, and then you oblige,

126
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:13,680
that's one, that's one, that's one off the bat. They hand out some chocolate and then they pull

127
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
it back real quick and you continue staying there, that's two. They say, where do you live, you

128
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
answer three.

129
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,400
This is, listen, I know it's too late to pick a theme for 2018, but I think part of it should be,

130
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,640
don't tell anyone where you live, unless they know, unless they know.

131
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,560
In general, they don't give you the chocolate, which you couldn't have eaten anyway,

132
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,160
but you were still sad about. The fact that you were sad about that you didn't eat these

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:48,720
neurotoxin filled chocolates is like wild to me. It is wild to me. Do you want to know what the

134
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,000
person did that lived on the floor above on the left over them where they live on the bottom left,

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,920
they stomp it too loud. They do a stomp and they do a dance and it's too loud.

136
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,240
They do the stomp when the neighbor's parent is trying to sleep and now they're having to die

137
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,560
for it.

138
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:11,440
Yeah, and they're having to eat the neurotoxin to get very, very, very sick forever. It's weird

139
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,160
because you're so good, but you're also so bad and you got to just take a look at it and think

140
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,400
a little bit better when you think your thoughts when people sort of confront you with a situation

141
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,280
like this.

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:30,480
I will also say, one of my favorite, like top 10 favorite things about being an adult

143
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,960
is I no longer have to earn candy from it. Like, I don't have to go trick or treating.

144
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,880
I don't have to like hope that somebody in my class splurges on buying everybody those four

145
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,640
chocolate, peanuts, Valentine's things. Like if I want candy, I can just go get it.

146
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,440
No question.

147
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,240
So the idea of wasting a single thought after this of like, I have to be living a day. No,

148
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,960
if you want something, go get it. You don't have to take handouts from anybody.

149
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,000
I watched one of those YouTube movies where they made skittles, but like in a kitchen,

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,920
and I said, man, those look good. And it was about 1130 at night. I was like, wow,

151
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,240
those look really tasty. And I was like, oh, that's right. I'm 31. And I went and I got

152
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,000
in the car, drove to the gas station, got some skittles, came home, ate them all.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,800
Had a hard time going to sleep because all the skittle energy inside of me, but I did

154
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
it because I could.

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,080
Sold my Spanish teacher some skittles for a fundraiser once. And later I asked how they

156
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,240
were. She said they're really good, but they're so sweet. She had to cut them in half.

157
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,840
Whoa.

158
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,280
She's a thrilling woman.

159
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,320
That doesn't make, I guess, unless you're eating them half at a time.

160
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
Hey, you own a Yahoo?

161
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,080
Yeah, I'd love that, Griff.

162
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,680
All right. All right. I mean, this one was sent in by Adrian Calles. Thanks, Adrian.

163
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,400
It's an anonymous Yahoo answer user, but I'll call him the Geico Lizard asks,

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,360
what would you do if someone laughed at your telescope?

165
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,400
Oh man. Tell me about it.

166
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:12,560
Oh, you're just trying to get away from the jocks on earth by putting your head in the

167
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,360
clouds up in the stars, looking at God's great creation, checking out some of your favorite

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
constellations. I'm talking about Virgo and Sagittarius and all the great ones. Gemini

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
is up there too.

170
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,160
The big ones.

171
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,040
Then all of a sudden, a bigger scientist comes over and says like, oh, is that it?

172
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,920
You may as well be using a little paper towel tube, you little putts.

173
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,200
And that makes me feel like shit.

174
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I think the worst case scenario would be like, you're looking through your telescope,

175
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,560
you look at like Mercury or Venus or whatever, and you see an alien with a telescope that's way

176
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,680
nicer than yours. And you can see through your telescope, though it's a little blurry, that alien

177
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
talking to their friends and pointing at you and laughing.

178
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh no.

179
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,720
And you're like, there's life out there and they think I'm a dingus.

180
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,440
Yeah, they've like written on the face of Neptune, like huff my shorts, Daryl.

181
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,480
Ow, that would hurt so bad. You spend your whole life dreaming of like, oh, I wonder if there are

182
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,960
aliens. And you're like, there are, and they're making fun of me. Oh.

183
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,360
I don't like when people feel the need to point out that my telescope is made of cardboard

184
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,440
and has no lenses in it and does not increase the distance that I can see.

185
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
No, it's just a cardboard tube.

186
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,800
And I can't, I don't know how to get one of the big telescopes. And if I did spend the money on

187
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,440
it, I wouldn't know how to use it. So can a kid just have some fun with a cardboard tube,

188
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,520
pretend he's a space pirate looking for his next celestial plunder?

189
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah, I don't see any problem with that juice. That's just an imagination.

190
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,600
That's what I call that.

191
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
I think I'll get off my case about it.

192
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,320
I think a power move, if somebody was like, oh, that's a real dinky telescope,

193
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,880
you just suddenly tip it towards the ground and say, it's a microscope, asshole.

194
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,160
And now they look dumb.

195
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,080
I just added upside down for a second so I could polish the lens.

196
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,720
Now you look stupid, Steve.

197
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,760
You know what I'm going to use this to look at? Your dignity.

198
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
Because it's minuscule now.

199
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,960
Got them.

200
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,960
You do that with their muscles too. Like, oh, I guess it is because I'm looking at your

201
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,520
muscles and there's nothing there, noodles.

202
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,080
You can make fun of how weak they are because they don't have any muscles.

203
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,440
You can't see them even with a really good, a decent telescope. It's not the best.

204
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,160
It's not great.

205
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,480
Yeah, so there's a lot of things you can do with a telescope bully to hurt them.

206
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,760
Maybe shine light through one end so it magnifies it.

207
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Oh, a laser beam.

208
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,600
No, wait, hold on.

209
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
No, that doesn't work. That's not right.

210
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,280
I'm thinking of a magnifying glass.

211
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,720
Could you tell them that this is a model of one that you are going to order and that the

212
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,680
salesman is so eager to book this sale that he brought you a model of the one you're considering

213
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,720
so you can really see if it's the right fit for you.

214
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
Because you're such a whale, but they're so happy to get you.

215
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,000
They're like really buttering you up.

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,080
They left one of their samples there with you.

217
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,360
Ooh, or maybe like scratch like in the Tyson in it.

218
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,000
And then when someone's like, that's a dinky telescope, like, oh, is it?

219
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,280
And then spin it around.

220
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,240
They're like, oh shit, that was Neil deGrasse Tyson's telescope.

221
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
And it's not true, of course.

222
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,480
You say, yes, I stole it from him.

223
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,160
I made it mine because I took it.

224
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,640
So now I see the stars.

225
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,080
Yeah, he's dropped off, hadn't he?

226
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,760
Haven't seen him doing his tweets lately.

227
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,880
It's sort of holier than thou space tweets.

228
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,560
Well, that's because he doesn't know how to see it anymore because I took his favorite

229
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,280
telescope.

230
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,760
So only I can see the moon.

231
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,440
And now I'm the space king.

232
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,160
So you could take your telescope and hit it against their telescope until a break.

233
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
So you'd be like, hmm, it seems like both our telescopes are now bad.

234
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,400
Seems like we both have bad telescopes.

235
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
How do telescopes work, Justin?

236
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,840
Here's one thing you could trick.

237
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,520
They have two different glasses on.

238
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,160
Here's something you could try.

239
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
When they're not, they make fun of it and you turn around, like they just hurt your

240
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
feelings because they're right before your telescope.

241
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
And I bet when you turn around, they probably even go harder on it.

242
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,000
You know what I mean, like they're like making fun of even the color and the second rate

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,920
brand of your telescope.

244
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,960
And then when you turn around, you hold it up and what have you written there on the

245
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,760
telescope?

246
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,560
It's their name.

247
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:56,080
And it's like, I think this one is your telescope and I was keeping it for you for a second.

248
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,040
Oh, okay.

249
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,880
I thought you were saying this telescope is you when you were making fun of yourself.

250
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Okay, third possibility.

251
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,680
It's also, well, I got it for you as a gift.

252
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,920
That's a good one because you could do you have so many options you do once you pull

253
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,720
off the move.

254
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,840
Another thing you could do is as you're looking at telescope and something comes on says,

255
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,880
hey, shithead dumb telescope, you kind of pull away from it and smile and look at him.

256
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
You just kind of stand there smiling and they're like, what are you smiling at?

257
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,960
And then a meteor hits them and kills them.

258
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,480
It's pretty good.

259
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,600
That's a good move.

260
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,960
And you walk away whistling.

261
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Don't worry, be happy.

262
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
That's a pretty good move.

263
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,840
And it's like the end of my sort of like science coming of age movie.

264
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,360
How about another question?

265
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
Would you all be okay with that?

266
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,840
Greetings, brothers.

267
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,880
I frequently go hiking, but my legs are very long and I often find myself passing slower

268
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,360
hikers.

269
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't like to raise my voice, especially out in the serenity of the wild.

270
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,200
So usually just try stomping my feet real hard to get their attention.

271
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,700
What?

272
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,640
Very often, though, people have headphones in or just don't hear me stomping and I end

273
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,320
up shouting, hey, or excuse me, just before I pass them to avoid getting punched.

274
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
This tends to scare the hell out of people.

275
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,600
And I'm wondering if there's something I could be doing differently.

276
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
Do I need to speak up as soon as I see them?

277
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
Should I carry a cowbell with me?

278
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,600
That's from Sneakings Too Easy in East Tennessee.

279
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,320
This is great.

280
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,280
Who are these people going hiking with headphones on?

281
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
How are you going to hear bears and shit?

282
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
No, they're listening to bears.

283
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,400
Wait, what?

284
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Yeah, they're listening to bear sound playlist on Spotify, just because you're not always

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
seeing bears.

286
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,120
So if you want a 24-7 bear experience.

287
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,880
Griffin, I meant for safety, not for enjoyment.

288
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
Like, no, I went hiking and I didn't see any bears.

289
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
Well, that's good.

290
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,760
A bear is dangerous, but the sound they make is beautiful.

291
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,720
Beautiful choir.

292
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:01,680
Is the impetus on Tennessee for making their hiking trails so conducive to sneakers?

293
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,200
It seems like they need to have maybe some more mirrors on the trail and some more sort

294
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
of crackly tinder, perhaps.

295
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,040
Is that something that's an option?

296
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,960
Crackly tinder?

297
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
Just like tinder, like leaves and branches, you know, tinder.

298
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,120
Like, I'm using it like a fire sense, but like, you know, leaves and branches on the

299
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,080
forest floor.

300
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,120
The crunchy stuff.

301
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
The crunchy stuff.

302
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,560
More croutons, more pretzels, more peanut shells.

303
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:30,960
Thank you.

304
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,360
More melba toast there on the floor.

305
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,800
You know, crunchy things.

306
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,080
The crunchy stuff.

307
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,280
You know.

308
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,680
I love this question so much.

309
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,040
There seems to be like a broad category of flawed human interaction and that it starts

310
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,960
with like baseline level, you're at the grocery store and you're walking towards a person

311
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,800
and you both overcorrect, like you both try to get out of each other's way but keep getting

312
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
in each other's way and you do it like nine times.

313
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,400
Just sort of moving around other human beings is a real fucked up bad process, it feels

314
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,960
like.

315
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,560
And this is the pinnacle of that, I think, because you are already in sort of a heightened

316
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,120
sort of like nature defense state when you're out on the trails.

317
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,840
Can I admit something about the little grocery store shuffle?

318
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:25,600
I am somebody who is desperate for human emotion, or human connection rather.

319
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,160
What?

320
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,440
I live, like I work out of my house, right?

321
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,600
So like when I leave the house and especially if like my family's not around that day or

322
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,320
whatever, I leave the house it's like, oh, people.

323
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,200
But I'm also like an incredibly awkward person in like a social sense.

324
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,080
There is nothing that I delight in, dare I say, revel in as the grocery store shuffle

325
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,160
because just for a moment I have a connection with another person that is based on the both

326
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,600
of us fucking up.

327
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,800
And wow, and that is so, not me fucking up and dropping a big jar of pickles on my foot

328
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,240
and everybody's having a laugh.

329
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,000
That's a connection of another sort.

330
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,920
This is one where we both, we've started this conversation with the phrase, I'm human, I'm

331
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,360
fallible, I'm Justin, what's up?

332
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,000
Justin to that same point, my favorite, that kind of connection, my favorite connection

333
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,640
is the entirely perceived connection.

334
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,040
So like when you find yourself similarly at a grocery store going the opposite direction

335
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,560
of someone else, so you keep like meeting in the middle of aisles, so by the end of

336
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,760
it, you have not interacted at all, but you have become familiar with them.

337
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,040
Yes, very aware.

338
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,640
I love that.

339
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,280
Or like if you're on a long stretch of highway and like you and the same car kind of keep

340
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,520
passing each other, you have not like spoken.

341
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,360
You don't know who that is, but you're like, you and me, red car, we're in this together.

342
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,400
That's real, that's real love.

343
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,640
The card thing is like, that's where like 50% of marriages get started.

344
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,680
The other 50% is like, I'm at match.com.

345
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,520
Another road phenomenon, I just drove to and back Cincinnati in like 48 hours, so I've

346
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,640
been on the road quite a bit.

347
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
Another road phenomenon I was thinking about today, this is sort of in the same category

348
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,160
of like interactions with strangers.

349
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:28,160
Isn't it a weird moment where you watch someone be a total fucking idiot in the driving capacity

350
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,720
for I mean, miles and miles.

351
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,640
It could go on for like a long time and you just watch someone do the dumbest shit.

352
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,920
They're like tailgating trucks.

353
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
They can't see them and cutting you off.

354
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,360
And there's that there's a moment if you pass them where you get to look over and you're

355
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,840
like, I'm about to see what the stupidest fucking person on earth looks like.

356
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,080
And you're imagining in your head like how dumb they're gonna look and what a piece of

357
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,200
shit and how mean and stupid and petty their face is gonna be.

358
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
It's always a let down.

359
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,120
They never look as hateful and like a literal.

360
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
It's never like the Noyb.

361
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,400
It's never like Oscar the Grouch like, that's right, I drive too.

362
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
OK, we're so far away from it.

363
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,040
What what what's the solution?

364
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
I will answer this.

365
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,040
Why is it your responsibility that other people have made themselves so murderable?

366
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,800
Why are you you're letting them pass the buck on to you and making you they should be trying

367
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,760
to not get murdered and that is not your problem.

368
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,520
They need to have their head on a swivel.

369
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,240
It's not fair.

370
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,880
It's not fair.

371
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,680
But if I was this person, I was walking around listening to my bear sounds and I was on the

372
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,640
trail and, you know, I got those primal instincts just flowing through me.

373
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
And then I shaped that wasn't there before.

374
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,960
And suddenly is there inches away from me to my side trying to pass me?

375
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
I would I would react with a startled, you know, roundhouse kick.

376
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,760
And that's not that's not fair.

377
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,720
But that's the situation.

378
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,320
So can you just sort of sprint like when you get close to a person?

379
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,480
Can you just run past them real fast?

380
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,040
And the fun thing about that is you can also look back and look really scared as if something's

381
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,600
chasing you.

382
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
I do like that.

383
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,920
Do you really want to give someone the experience of looking behind them and seeing a long legged

384
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,760
monster sprinting at them?

385
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,560
Now you're in front of them.

386
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,760
You're in front of them at that point.

387
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
There's a scary monster behind them, though.

388
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,080
What if OK, what if rather than sprinting past them?

389
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm just when you get close enough, you do a really like ballet leap.

390
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,520
That's just like super fucking graceful.

391
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,520
And out of the corner of their eye, they're just like a deer, a gazelle.

392
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,960
Oh, I wouldn't punch that.

393
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,000
Right.

394
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,440
And they're like, no, that was just an amazing human being.

395
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,280
And then you're off.

396
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,720
That's a good point.

397
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,120
You do a little Lion King makeup.

398
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,640
Yes.

399
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,360
You know what?

400
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
Lean into it.

401
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,400
Yeah, borrow that Lion King makeup from the musical and do like an antelope and just go

402
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,720
springing through the right past them.

403
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,240
They'll be scared for a second until they see how beautiful you look and graceful.

404
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,440
So here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Stacy Trombone.

405
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,240
Thank you, Stacy.

406
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,640
It's from Yahoo Answers user who is anonymous.

407
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,640
So I'm going to call him Ted Heaton, the third State Farm agent.

408
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Just got an ad here for Ted and he looks he looks very agreeable.

409
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,120
And so Ted asks, what is the right way to scold my lovebird when he does something wrong?

410
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,000
It's a real bird.

411
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,520
Yeah, we're talking about a real bird.

412
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,320
It's sort of a parrot, a type of parrot, like a little parrot guy.

413
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,560
If it wasn't though.

414
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
Oh, shit.

415
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,000
No, okay.

416
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,600
It's in category pets, birds.

417
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,720
So this is not like you could read this like, what is the right way to scold my lovebird?

418
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,880
My fucking parrot.

419
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
What's wrong, Justin?

420
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,760
I got an answer for you.

421
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,920
I decided to go ahead and give you guys this.

422
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,000
You know, it's so rare that we are actually helpful on this show that I just wanted to

423
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
give you guys some real helpful tips.

424
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,120
Okay, punish this bird.

425
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,080
Here's the rules of avian trading according to the sprucepets.com.

426
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,600
There's three.

427
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,480
There's just three.

428
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,640
And let's hope we can keep these tips straight.

429
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,600
Number one, never hit a bird.

430
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,520
Yeah, guys.

431
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,440
Yeah, for sure.

432
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,400
Yeah, for sure.

433
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,040
Definitely.

434
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,760
Birds are extremely fragile creatures.

435
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,120
Yeah, no shit.

436
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
The slightest force can cause severe injury or death.

437
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,520
Maybe an ostrich, I might feel comfortable hitting in an extreme circumstance.

438
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,720
You still shouldn't.

439
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,920
All right, rule number two, don't hold a grudge.

440
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,680
Birds are intelligent, but also very sensitive creatures.

441
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,840
When you express displeasure with your bird's behavior, make the lesson short and sweet.

442
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,440
Prolonged negative attention can cause undue emotional stress for your pet.

443
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,760
Rule number three is never compromise your bird's health.

444
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,200
Don't punish your bird by withholding food or neglecting cage cleaning.

445
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,040
What is the, it is so wild to me that there is a human being that is one, an owner of a bird,

446
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,560
and two, an owner of a bird that thinks that they're going to let their bird live in filth

447
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,600
to inspire it to better its existence.

448
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
Like, it's a bird.

449
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,200
So how, this, they're so delicate.

450
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,080
They're so, so delicate.

451
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,280
We're not gonna punch him.

452
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,400
We've got that.

453
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,920
What is the right way then to scold my lovebird when he does something wrong?

454
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,680
Oh, you know what?

455
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,280
Maybe love more.

456
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Maybe say like, I understand why you're doing this.

457
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
It's my fault.

458
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
That's probably the right answer, yeah.

459
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,560
But the better answer I think is to, they're probably in a cage.

460
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,320
Put their cage right in front of the TV.

461
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,520
Put it on episode of Frasier.

462
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,400
And then right when it's like two minutes from done, you stop it.

463
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,240
Oh, it's gonna be stuck in their head all week.

464
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,160
But how did he get out of this one?

465
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,400
And you can keep doing that with the whole series.

466
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,840
But you would go like in the bathroom and finish the last couple minutes yourself.

467
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
Because you don't want to.

468
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
Don't subject yourself to that kind of torture.

469
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
You didn't refuse to eat seeds.

470
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,520
The bird did.

471
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,400
Yeah, so.

472
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,400
Yeah, you didn't yell so loud that your cousin woke up.

473
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,280
The bird did that.

474
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,160
So the bird deserves the Frasier blue balls, but not you.

475
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,080
Because you didn't yell that so loud your cousin woke up from a big nap.

476
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,560
An important nap that caused them to work the night shift.

477
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,520
And you know they were tired, but it wasn't you.

478
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,640
You didn't shit in one of your Burger King Batman Forever collectible mugs.

479
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,360
Your bird did.

480
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
The bird did that.

481
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,200
And your bird can't pretend like they didn't know that cup was important to you.

482
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,440
They clearly know how to speak English.

483
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,640
And they know how you feel about Jim Carrey as the Riddler.

484
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,760
So you can wash it, but then the frosting of the mug is gonna come off.

485
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,000
Thank you.

486
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
Yeah, nobody wants to talk about it, but it's true.

487
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,320
Let's take a break real quick and go over to the Money Zone.

488
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
How would that treat you guys?

489
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,360
Okay, let's go.

490
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,840
I want to tell you about my unders.

491
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,280
Yeah.

492
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,360
As it is colloquially known.

493
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,760
Your dumpster, your dumpster card.

494
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,480
What?

495
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,600
Your dumpster card.

496
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,640
It guards your dumpster.

497
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,080
I would like to tell you about my caboose cover.

498
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,920
All right, MeUndies is our sponsor.

499
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,360
Okay, well, it's true.

500
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
They probably want us to say the name of their company.

501
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,200
I mean, it's a Venn diagram.

502
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,240
They make a hell of a dumpster guard, but that's not the name of the company.

503
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,560
If you've listened to four episodes of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

504
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,040
you've probably heard us talk about MeUndies at least once.

505
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,080
And they are my favorite underpants.

506
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,000
And it's not just underpants.

507
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,160
They've got brassiere options.

508
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,920
They've got pants options.

509
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,520
They've got a really great hoodie, like zip up hoodie.

510
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,160
Their socks are incredible.

511
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,400
So for right now, I want you to stop what you're doing.

512
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,320
Go to meundies.com and take a look.

513
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,000
And I'm going to make it even better for you

514
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,360
because we have a deal for our listeners.

515
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
First time purchasers are going to get 15% off their first pair of MeUndies

516
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,880
and free shipping that's 15% off plus free shipping and 100% satisfaction guarantee.

517
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,880
So go to meundies.com slash my brother.

518
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

519
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,760
Get 15% off your first pair, free shipping.

520
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,880
Go meundies.com slash my brother.

521
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,680
Hell yeah.

522
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,800
Hey, can I tell you about Quip?

523
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,000
Not unless you love it more than I do, which is unlikely.

524
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,840
Okay, why don't you tell me about Quip?

525
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,200
You know, most toothbrush brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks

526
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,720
rather than better brushing, but not Quip.

527
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,520
Quip is a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes

528
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,560
and packs premium vibrations for a perfect two minute clean.

529
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,360
Plus the guiding pulses remind you when to switch sides

530
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,280
and they'll deliver new brush heads on a dentist recommended schedule

531
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,520
every three months for just $5, including free shipping worldwide.

532
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,400
I've been using my Quip for quite a few months.

533
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,520
I love so much about it.

534
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,160
One, no dumb charger.

535
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,160
You just put in a battery and it works for months.

536
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,280
It has a case that flips over and goes onto the top

537
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,360
and it turns it into a travel case.

538
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,280
Otherwise, it's like a very discreet stand

539
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,440
that you can actually use this reusable adhesive

540
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,040
to stick to something to get it out of the way.

541
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,640
The pulses are nice.

542
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,520
They remind you to brush.

543
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
The subscription thing is so cool

544
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,040
because who remembers every three months

545
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,920
to change your toothbrush?

546
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,400
You don't.

547
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,800
But Quip shows up with a fresh battery

548
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
with a head for the toothbrush.

549
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,080
It's like, hey, I don't want to be weird about it,

550
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,520
but it's nasty now and you should get a new one.

551
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,240
And then you do and it's easy.

552
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,280
You don't have to go to the drugstore or anything.

553
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,240
You just get it and use it and it's nice to use.

554
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,880
It looks great.

555
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,680
I don't know.

556
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,480
I love this toothbrush.

557
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,560
Quip starts at just $25.

558
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,080
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now,

559
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,640
you'll get your first refill pack free

560
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,680
with a Quip electric toothbrush.

561
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,200
It's spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

562
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,680
Check it out.

563
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,200
You will not be disappointed.

564
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
Hey, how about a Jumbotron?

565
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,240
Okay, this one's for JP or perhaps Jape.

566
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
And it's from Meg who tells Jape,

567
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,080
happy first anniversary, my baby.

568
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,920
That's M-Y-B-B-Y, one word.

569
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,720
So my baby.

570
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,640
This past year has been the best ever from an adorable role

571
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,600
for initiative first date to buying us a house.

572
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,240
I couldn't ask for a better life partner.

573
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Also, thank you for letting me cry so much

574
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,560
because you are my emotional vacuum.

575
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,320
I love you and I like you.

576
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,120
Your baby.

577
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,040
Your baby.

578
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,840
Good love here.

579
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,440
And one, it sounds like very, very eventful year

580
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,960
from first date to buying a house.

581
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,800
Congratulations.

582
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,840
Congratulations.

583
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,520
Congratulations and that's just a great partnership.

584
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,280
I would give it a 10 out of 10, so.

585
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,280
Well, I'm gonna say 9.9 out of 10

586
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,760
because I always like to leave a little bit of room there.

587
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,520
So that someone's like, yeah, we did really good.

588
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,400
But you know what?

589
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,040
Let's work on our communication and maybe buy some more plates.

590
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,960
Yeah, it's aspirational.

591
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,920
Yeah, it still gives people a thing to shoot for.

592
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,760
This next message is from Michael and Jesse

593
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
and it's for Jackson Yoder.

594
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,680
Dear Jackson, may you always puff the fattest clouds

595
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
in 2018 and beyond.

596
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,400
That's great.

597
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,120
Happy birthday, my dude, from your companions in sadness,

598
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Michael and Jesse.

599
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
And if you're enjoying a vape right now,

600
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,800
let's just do one, a big rip, just sort of across the country.

601
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,040
Let them see like, you know what I'm saying?

602
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,480
Cotton across America.

603
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
Just like around the world.

604
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,360
Cover this country in cloud and Jackson will know what's up.

605
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,680
Three, two, one, rip and blow that shit.

606
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,180
Yes.

607
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,680
Justin, you want to read this next one?

608
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,800
Hell yeah.

609
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,960
This is for the KGB from Murphy.

610
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,120
It says, we have an event or a booth or elections or something.

611
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm so glad to share this wonderful macro content

612
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,800
with you guys.

613
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,480
Thank you for making my ears at CMU so amazing and memorable.

614
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,720
Keep being the awesome people you are

615
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,520
and I'll see you as soon as you can build a structural house

616
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
in less than a week.

617
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,960
Motion to purple and get faux.

618
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,320
Man, there is just a lot of coded language in that one.

619
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,720
Is that actually for the KGB?

620
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,080
Maybe it's, that's a nerve pain.

621
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,440
It might have been.

622
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,040
That's cool though, if it is, because it's like,

623
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,400
now we're part of it, you know?

624
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,840
That's the big conspiracy, I guess.

625
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
Yeah, we can't get back out at this point.

626
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,080
Now we're too deep in it.

627
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,600
Too deep, way too deep.

628
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,840
Real exciting and also, I think you said,

629
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,880
thanks for making my ears at CMU so amazing.

630
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,600
No, I didn't.

631
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,480
My ears, there's two Y sounds.

632
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
You said ears and so I just wanted to-

633
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
We did say ears.

634
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,880
It did sound like it.

635
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,040
So I just wanted to dunk on you real fast.

636
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay, listen to it.

637
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,480
My ears.

638
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,980
Sky high!

639
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,600
Okay, you say it together at a reasonable pace.

640
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,040
At a reasonable pace, sure, thank you all for making my ears.

641
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,920
Okay, do you see what you did there?

642
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,440
Sky high, half court!

643
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,720
Completely unnatural, no one talks like that.

644
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,400
Beginning this summer,

645
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,360
you can listen to new episodes of Inside Pop every other week

646
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,400
for an even deeper dive inside the world of pop culture.

647
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
Now we're still bringing you our brilliant insight,

648
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
always on the nose opinions,

649
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,880
and insider-y inside information

650
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,360
on the most interesting pop culture stories of the week.

651
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,200
And we'll also have interviews with the pop culture professionals

652
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
who create the culture you crave.

653
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,120
For example, we'll speak to casting directors

654
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,000
about how they find the right talent for the right role.

655
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,520
We'll talk to music supervisors

656
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,640
about how they choose the music to create the right mood.

657
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
And we'll grill producers,

658
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,640
we'll discuss what exactly a producer does.

659
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,600
Oh man, Sean, how many times has someone said to you,

660
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,080
oh, you're a producer, so what do you actually do?

661
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,400
So. Many. Times.

662
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,560
Same here.

663
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,840
So make sure to catch Inside Pop every other Wednesday

664
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,600
on Maximum Fun to indulge your pop culture obsessions.

665
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,880
And to hear in-depth interviews from the movers and the shakers

666
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
in TV, music, film, and more.

667
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,640
Next question.

668
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,760
Next question.

669
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,280
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

670
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,000
That's not a question.

671
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,640
That's not a question.

672
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,400
God in heaven, oh no.

673
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,560
The corn remix is brilliant.

674
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,600
I want a munch!

675
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,940
What?

676
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,280
Too much!

677
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,600
I don't care about that at all!

678
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,760
No, no, no, no, no.

679
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,560
No, no, no, no.

680
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,000
I know.

681
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,920
The Hummus and PitaCo prepares to launch Hummus ice cream.

682
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,280
It's coming.

683
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,320
Didn't we do the Hummus milkshake?

684
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,360
We did do that in Detroit, so no one will ever hear it

685
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,120
because it was part of our Star Wars show.

686
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,880
On the heels of the successful May launch of the first Hummus shake,

687
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,520
I'm so glad to hear it went well, by the way.

688
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,240
And also, I should have mentioned this earlier,

689
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,680
you can do the Hummus shake.

690
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,360
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

691
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,640
Remember that meme?

692
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,480
Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure.

693
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,760
The brand's first ice cream will be available at the Hummus and PitaCo's

694
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,040
Chelsea location beginning on National Ice Cream Day,

695
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,920
have they no shame, this Sunday, July 15th,

696
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,360
oops, at all locations beginning August 1st.

697
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,520
Okay, so you still have time to prepare.

698
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,000
It's all natural and made with good-for-you ingredients

699
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,320
like protein-packed chickpeas, real tahini, and pure vanilla.

700
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,720
The four available flavors get their sweetness only from ripe dates

701
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,640
and creaminess from either almond milk or coconut cream.

702
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,200
The indulgent chocolate flavor is made with almond milk.

703
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,120
Their goal here, as near as I can tell,

704
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,080
is to talk long enough that you forget that they put hummus in your ice cream.

705
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,200
Yeah, sure.

706
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,680
Gotcha.

707
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,600
Straight out, though, can I tell you fool something?

708
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,560
The idea of like sweet hummus, I'm on board.

709
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,880
Graham crackers and chocolate hummus.

710
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
I've heard it's good, I've heard it's good.

711
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,720
I've had dessert hummus, that's not what I'm saying.

712
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,040
I'm saying it's just a lot of hummus to eat.

713
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,240
It's just the idea, I just have a problem with,

714
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,160
I put a scoop of hummus on this cone, do you want to enjoy it?

715
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,240
I'm sure it's very delicious.

716
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
Sometimes you sit down in front of some hummus

717
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,600
and maybe you're talking with friends.

718
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,640
For me, the best time to have hummus and suddenly like all the hummus is gone

719
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,440
and you realize like I just ate a shit ton of hummus.

720
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,520
Maybe that's what this is for.

721
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,120
Like, oh, I accidentally ate a lot of hummus.

722
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,600
I am.

723
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,680
The quote is very good on this one.

724
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,200
It's from founder Dave Pesso.

725
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,600
We never get them from the top.

726
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,080
And this one comes straight from the top from Dave.

727
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,240
We were so blown away by the popularity of the hummus shake.

728
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,720
Indeed.

729
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,040
Yes, I would imagine.

730
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,400
Yes, that we knew we had to keep inventing new treats, says founder Dave Pesso.

731
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
This all started when I developed the dessert hummus

732
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,520
as a healthier alternative for my daughter.

733
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,360
And the response from my family was so great

734
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,480
that we wanted to share it with the hummus and pita co-guests.

735
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,440
As a prank, as a goof.

736
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,960
The fiction that Dave wants you to believe is he's at home from his day job

737
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,320
of being the founder of the hummus and pita co-guests.

738
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,840
He invents dessert hummus at his house

739
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,760
and then as an afterthought decides to add it to the menu of his hummus company.

740
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,680
Oh, and make some delicious hummus.

741
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,880
Oh, you know who would like this?

742
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,840
Do you know who would like this?

743
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,920
The fucking company I founded that has hummus in the name.

744
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,440
Are you fucking with me, Dave?

745
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,960
Hey guys, I've got a weird thing to pitch at this board meeting.

746
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,920
You know how we make hummus?

747
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,640
Yeah, you're all nodding, okay?

748
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,000
I made some hummus.

749
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,360
Do you think we could maybe sell it?

750
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,960
Who would I talk to about getting, oh, me?

751
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,760
It's me?

752
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,480
Okay, great.

753
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,480
Great idea, self.

754
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,840
It is also so good, the idea that Dave Pesso would make a treat

755
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,440
that he would foist on his daughter,

756
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,760
but it may not be good enough for the guests of the hummus and pita company.

757
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,600
It's just good enough for his family.

758
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,800
And here's what you don't know is that he also made her a hummus dog

759
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,080
and a hummus bed and bought her her first hummus car.

760
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,720
His hummus.

761
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,800
I bet it tastes fine though.

762
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,840
I bet it tastes good.

763
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,120
I bet it tastes good.

764
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,240
It's just a lot.

765
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,560
I enjoy hummus and I've heard good reviews of the sweet hummus.

766
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,000
It's just, for me, it's the removal of the act of dipping

767
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,480
that then makes it hummus shake, hummus ice cream.

768
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,760
I'm sure they taste good.

769
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,560
I still know that I am scooping heaping helpings

770
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,520
of just pure chickpea sort of mash into my gob.

771
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,360
And that's the thing I have trouble sort of getting over, I guess.

772
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,160
But wait, they call it ice cream.

773
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,440
Is it non-dairy?

774
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,480
It sounds like it.

775
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,280
It sounds like it's just chickpeas and vanilla and tahini

776
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,120
and almond milk or coconut cream.

777
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah, I see.

778
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,960
It's dairy.

779
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,840
It's gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan.

780
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,520
Fuck, I bet this would go down real smooth.

781
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,400
Okay, this might be the first Munch Squad you've done

782
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,560
where I'm like, all right, I might fuck with this.

783
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,760
I think it's only in New York,

784
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,160
but we're going to be there after it launches.

785
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,040
Let's get over there.

786
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,160
Let's give it a shot.

787
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,200
How about a Yahoo?

788
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,920
Yeah, do it.

789
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,360
Okay, this one was sent in by virtually every person

790
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,640
who emailed us this week.

791
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,480
I've not seen a consensus like this in some time.

792
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,360
It's from another question mark user, so I'm going to call him.

793
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,560
Four dogs working together to use a computer asks,

794
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,920
would you be embarrassed if someone tried to kill you in public?

795
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,240
Oh, golly, is my face red?

796
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,600
You're at the party and there's a bunch of college drinking,

797
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,240
going on party and dancing, listening to LMFAO,

798
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
just the staple college party stuff.

799
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,480
And then Screamface smashes in through the window

800
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,720
and you're like, ah, fuck, I'm so sorry.

801
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,800
I will pay for the window.

802
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,760
This guy sucks ass and I'm so sorry.

803
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,800
I did not invite him.

804
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,640
He keeps trying to do a killing to me and it sucks.

805
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,320
I'll leave.

806
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,800
He's going to chase me down into the tunnel,

807
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,680
but then he gets lost in the tunnel and he gets really tired

808
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,520
because he's like not good at killing.

809
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
So I can be back here in like a half hour.

810
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,680
I could actually swing by Super America

811
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,880
and pick up another 18 pack of Coors.

812
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,720
Okay, bye.

813
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,640
All right, see you, I gotta go.

814
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,560
Ah, see, I was picturing more of like you're walking through

815
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,360
perhaps like a square in Venice.

816
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,840
It's beautiful buildings everywhere.

817
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,720
Perhaps you're walking through like an outdoor cafe

818
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,280
where people are sipping their espressos

819
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,440
and suddenly as a sniper shoots you from atop a cathedral,

820
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,160
they miss, but you're really embarrassed.

821
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,600
Oh, everybody looks up from their espressos

822
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,800
and they're like, who are you?

823
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
And you're like, oh, I'm sorry.

824
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,400
I'm sorry, please get back to your espressos.

825
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,360
I just, I have some international secrets.

826
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:17,120
I'm Doug Born and let's just say I'm sort of a hot target

827
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,360
for the, you name it, man.

828
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,080
CIA, KGB, I'm the other Born, Doug Born.

829
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,880
Do you want to see me jump super high?

830
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
Do you think Damon has the guts

831
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,160
to start a movie called Doug Born Hot Target?

832
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
If I saw that in the DVD shelf,

833
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,320
I might still give it the pass on by,

834
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,560
but I'd give it a good think about real quick.

835
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,480
I was doing some reading about the Borns.

836
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,320
Did y'all know they made one

837
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,760
and they didn't want to do the director

838
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,040
they'd done for the other ones?

839
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,680
And so Matt Damon from The Martian said,

840
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,160
no, I don't, I'm not going to be in it

841
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,360
because I love that director.

842
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,480
And so they said, okay, we'll get Jeremy Renner instead

843
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,840
and just Jason Bourne won't be in this Jason Bourne movie.

844
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,240
So really the idea of Doug Born Hot Target has precedent

845
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,280
and it would be a Bourne movie without the right Bourne in it.

846
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,320
He's the wrong Bourne,

847
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,880
sort of the man who knew too little situation

848
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,560
just stumbling around.

849
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,920
That one didn't even have,

850
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,480
the Bourne legacy didn't even have any Bournes, right?

851
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,840
It's like Bourne Free.

852
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,440
Bourne Free would have been a way better title.

853
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,600
Bourne Free would have been good.

854
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,840
I think at one point somebody saw the back

855
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,480
of Jason Bourne's head and said, Jason Bourne?

856
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,440
But then he was gone and that's how they tied it in.

857
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,680
Yes, I would be pretty embarrassed, I guess.

858
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,440
I would be embarrassed because of me.

859
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,440
I would probably not make some great noises.

860
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
Right.

861
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,600
If I was running away from the It Follows monster.

862
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,280
Because you think about the It Follows monster

863
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,640
and you think like, wow, that must suck,

864
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,400
having to constantly stay on the run.

865
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
But then you also got to think about sort of,

866
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,960
you're at the grocery store and you're walking down the aisle

867
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,880
and there's another person walking down the aisle towards you

868
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,560
and you go to the left and they go to the left

869
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,080
and you go to the right and they go to the right

870
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,000
and you're like, I need you to get the fuck out of the way

871
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,120
because if this thing touches me,

872
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,800
it's gonna fuck my body up.

873
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,080
It sort of adds multiple layers to it.

874
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,560
That or they are actually the It Follows monster

875
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,240
and they're just stopping at the store.

876
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,040
If there's one thing I know about the It Follows monster,

877
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
it's that it follows.

878
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,800
And so I've never seen it, so I don't know at what distance,

879
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,440
but it's not called the It Catches monster.

880
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,160
Oh no, oh Trav, It does a catch in the movie.

881
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,880
Oh, it does?

882
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,040
Oh boy, it does a big catch.

883
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,400
Then it's really misnamed.

884
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,800
It should be called the It Catches You monster.

885
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,040
Yeah, it wants to and when it does.

886
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,000
Yowza.

887
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,200
Yeah, it ain't pretty.

888
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,600
You gotta see that movie, Trav, it bangs, dude.

889
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,720
Is it scary?

890
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,080
Oh fucking yeah.

891
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,560
Yeah, yeah.

892
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,480
Then I'm not gonna watch it, why would I do that?

893
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,800
Anyway, this has been our movie review segment.

894
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
I work at a very successful startup

895
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,480
with a casual atmosphere and very friendly people.

896
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,120
Net Nanny.

897
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:58,960
What?

898
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,120
It's Net Nanny, the company's Net Nanny.

899
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,640
The startup Net Nanny?

900
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,040
Yeah, they're still trying to get some investors.

901
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,400
They think like a startup and that's why they've been so successful.

902
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,040
Y'all ever think about Net Nanny 2018?

903
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,320
I don't think it exists anymore,

904
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,080
but there is a period where we were like,

905
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,600
I don't want all the internet.

906
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,960
Some of it's real dirty.

907
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,200
Can I, hi, as Justin McElroy,

908
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,440
a 37 year old man in the year 2018,

909
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,960
can I get Net Nanny?

910
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,280
Because I would love to have less of it.

911
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,360
If you could give me less of it.

912
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,520
I need an adult to tell me like,

913
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
to be the voice of reason of like,

914
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,840
this is, you don't get all the internet you want.

915
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,200
Here's the internet you need and that's all you can have.

916
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,000
I need like one eighth of Wikipedia and Club Penguin

917
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,600
and I am good to go.

918
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,920
Everything else is just a fucking distraction.

919
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,280
Anyway, we have a large open office

920
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,640
with an employee kitchen in the center.

921
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,680
Oftentimes you'll be getting a coffee or your lunch

922
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,680
and another employee will walk in and do their own thing.

923
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,000
Usually there's a polite, how high are you?

924
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,880
And that's it.

925
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,800
However, there is one employee,

926
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
a higher up with the company who also does this,

927
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,320
but instead of moving on after the greeting,

928
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,840
stares at me expectantly, waiting for more to be said

929
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,640
when there never is more to be said.

930
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,600
He then says, well, I guess that's the end

931
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,120
of that conversation.

932
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,720
Christ almighty.

933
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,280
And continues to do his thing in the kitchen around me.

934
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,040
Holy fucking shit.

935
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,960
This also isn't a one-time thing per employee.

936
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,920
He has done this to me and others multiple times.

937
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,440
This is monstrous.

938
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,120
What should I and the rest of my office do

939
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,200
when confronted with this awkward character

940
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,440
that's anxious in the Big Apple?

941
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,720
Oh my God.

942
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,280
We've been in the game long enough

943
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,200
that I worry now people don't even want help.

944
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,760
They just want like us to take a little of the load.

945
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,800
They're just trying to take a couple of the packs

946
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,280
that they have and sling them onto our backs.

947
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,520
Just a little help on the road.

948
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,200
Our rind has been toughened by doing this podcast.

949
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,680
So I think we can haul a little bit more

950
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,800
than the average bear.

951
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,680
But good Lord, this person's a literal demon.

952
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,200
An absolute demon.

953
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,360
All right, what can we do?

954
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,320
What I think you should do is they walk up

955
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,400
and they say, hey, how's your day going?

956
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,160
And you say, well, I guess that's the end

957
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,280
of that conversation.

958
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,000
And you walk away because they can't do it.

959
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,600
What if you just skip the middle and you say,

960
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,280
well, thank you for asking.

961
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,640
And then you walk away.

962
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,520
Because that acknowledges like, hey, I appreciate you,

963
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,080
which is probably exactly what they want of you.

964
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,040
But you don't have to say anything more than that.

965
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,240
Or say, you know what?

966
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,120
That's not what matters.

967
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,800
So what matters here is how are you?

968
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,080
Justin, I'd like to role play this out with you.

969
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,880
Oh, happily.

970
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,600
Yeah, for sure.

971
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,040
You say to me, I have an idea.

972
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,960
You say to me, how are you?

973
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,760
Okay.

974
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,960
This as far as the script goes?

975
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,560
Yeah, that's what you say.

976
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,760
And then I have a response.

977
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,640
We're going to see how it works.

978
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,320
What do I do?

979
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:02,800
What can I be?

980
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,360
King Griffin.

981
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,680
Griffin, you be Jim in the back.

982
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,200
Jim Halpert, make us a coffee.

983
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,320
How about Griffin has just made a delivery

984
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,320
and he's saying his goodbyes to everyone

985
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,160
and then he'll see us again soon.

986
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,840
And then our scene will commence directly

987
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,200
after Griffin's goodbyes.

988
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,000
Oh, I like that.

989
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,800
And where do we work?

990
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,880
Can we get a suggestion from the audience?

991
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,840
Staples!

992
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,880
Staples!

993
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,000
I heard Staples.

994
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,800
Okay.

995
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,160
Staples corporate.

996
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,640
All right.

997
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,140
Okay.

998
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,680
Oh, I got a delivery here.

999
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,240
It's for the rest of the Staples.

1000
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,740
Staples.

1001
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,200
And go ahead and sign here for me.

1002
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,040
That is a nice place you all have here.

1003
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,760
Oh, thank you.

1004
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,840
Can you mind if I use your toilet?

1005
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,800
Oh, we don't have one.

1006
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,560
Huh?

1007
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,360
We don't have one?

1008
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,880
Well, I see you got a big open elevator shaft over there.

1009
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,600
Do you mind if I sort of figure it out in there?

1010
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,480
Yeah, go for it.

1011
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,880
Jeffrey said we don't have a toilet.

1012
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,640
That means we don't have a toilet.

1013
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,040
Are you saying my friend Delip is a liar?

1014
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,080
No, yeah.

1015
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,720
No, I believe you.

1016
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,320
I'm just going to use the big elevator shaft.

1017
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,600
Go piss in the elevator shaft.

1018
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,560
That's what we all do.

1019
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,560
No, it's the other one.

1020
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,240
You can do that in the elevator shaft too.

1021
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
Hey, I have a question before you go.

1022
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,460
Yeah.

1023
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,080
If you are a hot dog.

1024
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,720
Yeah, great.

1025
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,220
Okay.

1026
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,400
Yeah, I haven't heard anything like this before in my life.

1027
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,840
So go ahead and keep talking.

1028
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,520
Like, I don't know if it's a reference to something.

1029
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,160
I don't know what it is.

1030
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,480
So I just assume you're having a conversation with me

1031
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,120
because I don't know it.

1032
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,760
Just a quick time out for people at home.

1033
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,680
This is going exactly how I thought

1034
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,800
it would play out in this scenario.

1035
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,320
So hope someone's taking notes.

1036
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,920
Okay, time in.

1037
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,720
Yeah, okay.

1038
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, I don't have a TV or anything.

1039
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,120
So I miss a lot of references.

1040
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,280
So I just assume right now you're telling me that

1041
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,840
you're a big hot dog enthusiast.

1042
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,440
So go ahead and keep going.

1043
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,560
Would you eat yourself?

1044
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,880
Wow, that's a hell of a question.

1045
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,080
Yeah, it's a good question.

1046
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,120
I've never heard that either.

1047
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,080
Probably not because I recently ate old 4th of July hot dogs.

1048
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,400
I'm pretty sure I have food poisoning right now.

1049
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
Hence the sort of elevator shaft panic.

1050
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,640
So that's a no.

1051
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,560
When I play a character a lot of times.

1052
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,240
Oh, wait, hold on.

1053
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,040
Is this a time out?

1054
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,560
I don't know if this is another time out.

1055
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,920
Okay, time out, time out.

1056
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,960
When I play a character,

1057
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,120
I guess it just kind of accidentally sounded

1058
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,480
a little bit like Will Ferrell's impression of Harry Caray.

1059
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,760
Oh, is that what it was?

1060
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,320
And then I just kind of want to do a bit from that.

1061
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,680
Okay.

1062
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,400
No, I got that.

1063
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,360
I definitely got that.

1064
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,120
It's just that Avery, my character, didn't know that.

1065
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,320
Okay, well let's-

1066
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,120
Here's the weird thing.

1067
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,720
My character, Delip, did get it, but me, Travis, didn't.

1068
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,080
Can we get back into the scene?

1069
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,600
Yeah, let's get back in.

1070
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,440
All right, have you left yet, Griffin?

1071
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,240
I guess so.

1072
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,920
Are you really that tired of Avery?

1073
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,240
Time out, time out, time out, time out.

1074
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,440
Do you want Avery to leave?

1075
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,960
No, I actually think Avery is bringing a lot to the scene,

1076
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,880
but I feel like the tone of Avery's exit

1077
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,960
has to match the rising tone of our scene.

1078
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,680
So maybe Avery can, Avery can always reenter, Griffin.

1079
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,720
I mean, we found that test audiences really enjoy Avery.

1080
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,200
I'd rather not.

1081
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,440
So we're willing to make it kind of the Urkel character

1082
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,240
of the whole thing.

1083
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,640
Yeah, okay.

1084
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,320
Time in.

1085
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,120
Later, suckers.

1086
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm crotch-chopping.

1087
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,240
So how are you?

1088
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,920
I know, right?

1089
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,420
Ding.

1090
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:25,300
The elevator got the doors open, no car.

1091
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,220
Sure enough, this thing is empty as hell.

1092
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,300
Well, here I go.

1093
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,500
Can I get a spotter?

1094
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,300
I'm just, or does somebody have a belt I can use

1095
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,060
to kind of tie myself to this guardrail?

1096
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,340
Because I'm really, oh no!

1097
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,340
We find out in episode two that he survived

1098
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,020
because he landed on the pile of shit

1099
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,260
from previous times people had used it.

1100
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,860
It's a real Shawshank situation.

1101
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,780
Let's end this fucking show.

1102
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,860
Thank you so much for listening to my brother.

1103
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,940
My brother and me, we hope you have enjoyed yourself

1104
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,860
half as much as we have.

1105
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,700
We are gonna be headed out on the road

1106
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,500
for a book tour this week as you're,

1107
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,700
this week as the crow flies as you're listening to this.

1108
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,460
Most of those are sold out,

1109
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,060
but I think we do have some tickets available

1110
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,380
for the Cincinnati show.

1111
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,300
That's gonna be on Wednesday the 18th at the Taft.

1112
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,220
You can get tickets to that at mcroyshows.com forward slash tours

1113
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:25,220
as well as our show in Orlando and Atlanta

1114
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,020
on August 31st and September 1st, respectively.

1115
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,540
So go get tickets to those and we hope to see you there.

1116
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,980
I have something to say real quick

1117
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,620
because this is the episode, yeah, the week of it.

1118
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,700
So San Diego Comic-Con is this weekend.

1119
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,300
We do the Adventure Zone thing Friday night

1120
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,780
and then Saturday I am doing autographing

1121
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,700
with Dad and Carrie Peach,

1122
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,180
who is the artist on the Adventure Zone graphic novel

1123
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,940
from 11 to noon at table AA19.

1124
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,940
It is ticketed, tickets are free, I believe,

1125
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,660
but it is a limited number of tickets for that.

1126
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,900
I'm also doing one with the cast of Maximum Funds Bubble,

1127
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:11,940
which I am a member of, one to 145 at table AA08.

1128
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,300
Once again, that is ticketed.

1129
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,740
And then from two to three, we're doing a panel,

1130
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,980
the Adventure Zone graphic novel of me, Dad, and Carrie Peach

1131
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,500
moderated by Jackie Jennings,

1132
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,780
who was one of the story producers

1133
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,780
on the My Brother, My Brother, Me TV show.

1134
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,820
Oh, hell yeah.

1135
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,260
Location is 28DE, so that's hall 28DE.

1136
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,540
And then five to six on Saturday,

1137
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,340
I'm doing a panel with Maximum Funds Bubble.

1138
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,500
And the location for that is Neil Morgan Auditorium,

1139
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,340
San Diego Central Library.

1140
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,700
One more Sunday, 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.,

1141
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,780
How to Be a Nerd for a Living panel,

1142
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,500
Breaking Into Careers in Geek Culture.

1143
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,700
And that's location grand one and two,

1144
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,660
Marriott Marquis, San Diego Marina.

1145
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,540
So come to those.

1146
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,020
And you might also probably just like see me around.

1147
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:04,580
Yeah, but not us, because we're fucking out of there.

1148
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,340
We're taking off, we're scooting.

1149
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,820
I might not make it to next week, actually,

1150
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,140
depending on how the next couple days goes.

1151
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,820
Because of the hot dogs?

1152
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,500
Yeah, so thanks to Maximum Funds

1153
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,700

00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,740
for the use of our theme song,

1162
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,060
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1163
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,100
And is there anything else?

1164
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,580
Uh, mcroymerch.com.

1165
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,420
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1166
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,460
Anything else?

1167
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,260
No, that's it.

1168
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,660
Here's one that's sent in by Jordan Brandon.

1169
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,020
It's our final Yahoo of the Day.

1170
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,340
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user.

1171
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,380
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

1172
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,460
Has gone wrong.

1173
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,660
So I'm gonna call them.

1174
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,900
Amazon asks.

1175
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,300
I mean, there's an Amazon ad and there's a Discover card ad.

1176
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:07,940
But I'll say-

1177
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,660
You did great.

1178
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,140
No.

1179
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,620
Amazon asks, what is the name Todd short for?

1180
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,780
My name is Justin McElroy.

1181
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,140
I'm Travis McElroy.

1182
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1183
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,500
This has been my brother, My Brother May Kiss Your Dad.

1184
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:32,900
Square on the Lips.

1185
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,820
Maximumfun.org.

1186
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,860
Comedy and culture.

1187
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,980
Artist owned.

1188
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,100
Listener supported.

1189
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,460
Hi, I'm Paula Poundstone.

1190
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,740
And I'm Adam Felber.

1191
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,700
Adam, I haven't gotten one thing done today.

1192
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,740
Well, let me see your to-do list.

1193
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,300
Ah, yeah.

1194
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,260
Well, here.

1195
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,060
Make 30 second promo for nobody listens to Paula Poundstone.

1196
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,420
So at least you're getting that done.

1197
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,540
Score!

1198
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,380
Except you haven't said what the show is about.

1199
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,820
We're like a comedy field guide to life starring me and you.

1200
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:09,860
I give useful advice and we have real experts to talk about things like how to keep a friend

1201
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,100
or what to do when you encounter a bear.

1202
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,060
Bully for you, but you haven't said where people can find the show.

1203
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:21,860
Oh, Maximumfun.org or wherever you find your podcasts.
