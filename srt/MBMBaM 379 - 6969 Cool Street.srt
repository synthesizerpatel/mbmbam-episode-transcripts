1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,040
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,320
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,720
This is your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,040
Did we catch you mid-yawn, Griffin?

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,800
You did catch me mid-yawn. That was not a goof.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,640
Although I do want to talk about the big DST, the big elephant in the room,

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,240
the fact that we're not saving daylight anymore, or we are now.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,800
We no longer are. We've done away with the shackles of that terrible, terrible policy.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,440
I looked at the daylight that we had, and I said, I'm all right.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000
I feel like I have too much daylight, one hour's worth of it.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,320
So let's just, it's 2.03 p.m. Texas time right now, and my body feels like it's 11.30 p.m.

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,320
And I know it's like not, we didn't jump that far, but it still like sucks so bad.

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
Like all of this, this whole thing sucks so bad.

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,680
And I was wondering, I had, I had an idea after my second nap today,

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
and I was, I was hoping you all would hear me out.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,080
Maybe we could spread the word about it and maybe get something going.

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,040
We've gotten lots of things going in this show.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,200
You know, we brought back camo cargo shorts back in the summer of 2013, and that was very cool.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,160
And I was hoping maybe we could do this.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:21,440
So I had this idea for new time, how time would do it from, from now on.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,320
This is such a big idea. I need to sit back down.

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,840
Why were you standing?

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
You're standing up? That's weird.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,240
I was standing because I was getting ready to disagree with Griffin,

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,560
and then I sat back down because I just need to listen.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
You're doing it in like sort of the 1776 style,

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
where you had to stand up and you know, tap your cane against it.

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,800
Here's the idea.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
I saw an elderly man come to my table, and I was trying to be polite.

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,040
Sure.

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
You wake up in the morning.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,040
All right.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
Arm gives out a warning.

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
You don't think you're going to make it on time.

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Parents just don't understand.

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay.

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,160
You wake up in the morning and it's 9 30.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
So that's the first step of it.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
You wait, you wake up in the morning and it's just, it is 9 30.

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
Well, I'm hooked so far, Griffin.

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,600
Now reel me in.

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,160
So not, cause 9 30 is like a bet, a really good one.

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,120
Cause if you wake up at 9 30, it's like, whoa, I slept in so late.

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
I feel, I feel great.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,440
I feel so energized, but also there's still a lot of the morning left and the, you know,

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
the day's still right in front of you cause it's 9 30 and it stays 9 30 until, I mean,

52
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
you probably eat a little something right then.

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Right.

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,960
And then the next time you get hungry, that's a time that I'm just going to call lunch time.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,240
The lunch time.

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,640
All right.

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,960
So if I'm, I want to make sure I'm keeping up with new time.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,000
Wake up.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,160
Which I feel like a punchier title would be.

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,760
McElroy time.

61
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,880
Griffin time.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,680
Griffin time.

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,800
Stop, stop.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,440
Griffin time.

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,880
Okay.

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,280
I love how quickly you cut us out of that in case this is a landmark sort of moment.

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
So you wake up.

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,520
It's to protect you two.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,400
Cause it could also be, it could also blow up right in my face.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
So you wake up and it's 9 30.

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,280
Is it 9 30 because that's when you woke up or does everybody-

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
That's what wake up time is, you know?

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
That's just what wake up time is.

74
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,200
9 30.

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,560
Oh, what a good, holy shit.

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,920
I haven't slept until 9 30 in a long time, but I still have a lot of my day left over.

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,200
I'll have a bowl of cereal.

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,760
To nail it down, whatever time you, when you wake up, it is 9 30.

79
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,920
It is not 9 30 and you wake up.

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,560
You wake up, that is automatically 9 30.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,960
Yes.

82
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm so glad you're with me.

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,600
And then you're hungry again after the breakfast and now it's just lunch time.

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
And we don't need to give that a number.

85
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,960
And then as soon as you finish the last bite, the last scrumptious morsel of whatever it is

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,800
you're having during this midday meal, it's not lunchtime anymore.

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,640
And it's immediately 4 20.

88
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,000
And it doesn't, you don't have to be-

89
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay.

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
I'm not encouraging drug use at this time.

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,680
It's just, that's, it would be fun-

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
That's the next biggest milestone.

93
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
It's, well, it's just funny.

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah.

95
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
It's just very funny.

96
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
So wake up, 9 30 breakfast.

97
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm hungry again.

98
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Now it's lunchtime.

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,360
Oh, I can't talk on the phone right now.

100
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,920
It's lunchtime.

101
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
I'll call you back at 4 20.

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
And you fit home, sandwich gone.

103
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,480
Okay, now it's 4 20 and it's going to stay.

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,160
It's going to stay 4 20 until it just gets dark.

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,360
And then when it's dark, it's seven o'clock because it's seven o'clock.

106
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,040
That's a decent lunch hour.

107
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,120
Also, depending on what time zone you live.

108
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,920
And by the way, time zones are not, they don't exist anymore.

109
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,280
But the TV, the televisions about the, you know, the good shows are about to start

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,440
because it's seven o'clock and seven o'clock, you know, you eat whenever you feel like it.

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,680
And then when you get sleepy, it's 2 a.m.

112
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
And it's like, oh, yeah, I'm partying.

113
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
Now it's 2 a.m.

114
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
Well, no, you party during seven when it's 2 a.m.

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,320
It's like, okay, I should really crash because it's, you know, I've got a long day ahead of me.

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, this is great because 2 a.m.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not, I think I should go to bed.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
It's why haven't I gone to bed yet?

119
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,080
The responsible thing is to go to bed now.

120
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,440
2 a.m. is you feel good about how much you've partied tonight.

121
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,560
And also, you know, like, oh, I'm going to get that good sleep.

122
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,120
And you know that you're going to get seven and a half hours of sleep.

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah.

124
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,400
Because you're going to wake up at 9.30 the next morning.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm trying to envision the clock in my head.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,040
At the top of the clock, it says 9.30.

127
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,800
Okay.

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
And then if you go down the clock some.

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,320
Yeah.

130
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,400
And you also, just to be clear, have to manually turn this dial on the clock

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
because you wake up at 9.30, eat breakfast,

132
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,760
and then you reach up and you turn the clock to lunchtime.

133
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
It's more of a progress chart for yourself.

134
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,040
And it's not going to stay on lunchtime very long.

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,320
It's just how long it takes you to eat the sandwich or bagel or soup or, you know, whatever.

136
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,600
And now it's 4.20.

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,280
And you're going to show your watch to all your friends and be like, get it.

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,720
And you'll be able to do that for, I mean, until the sun goes down.

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,640
Griffin, I don't think that this is your intention,

140
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,360
but it does kind of sound like most of the day is taken up by 4.20.

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,160
Hmm.

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Because it kind of sounds like you wake up, you eat breakfast,

143
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,040
and then when you finish breakfast, you eat lunch.

144
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,000
Then when you finish lunch-

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,200
You don't eat lunch immediately after breakfast, you dummy.

146
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,840
Then what's between 9.30 and lunch?

147
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
You just do stuff while it's 9.30.

148
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
Yeah, you just do stuff until you get hungry again.

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,680
And it's 9.30 the whole time.

150
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,720
But when you finish the last bite of your lunch, it is then 4.20 till it's dark.

151
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Is this correct?

152
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,560
Yeah.

153
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,720
Wait, so dark, at dark, when it gets dark, it's 7 o'clock.

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,080
I can't believe how many, it's fucking like four or five, I lost count, times.

155
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,680
And I can't believe you're having this much trouble.

156
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
I just want to know when it's 7 o'clock.

157
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
And then the sun goes down.

158
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,840
And in the newspaper, every day, it's going to say sunrise is at 9.30,

159
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,200
and you're going to miss it.

160
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,160
And sunset is 7 all the time.

161
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200
It's always 7.

162
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,640
And then you're going to watch Survivor.

163
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,120
I liked that it's 7, because it gives you an hour until the good shows are on.

164
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,080
Well, or unless you live-

165
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,360
I guess for you, they come on at 7.

166
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,000
Do they come on at 7 for you?

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,040
Yeah, so it's always like, the sun's down, turn on the TV, Survivor's on.

168
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,120
And it's what I love about all the times I've picked, because they're all brilliant,

169
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,480
is that each one, when you look at the clock and it's 9.30 a.m., you think,

170
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
I've got a lot of day left ahead of me.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
When you eat lunch, you're like, not thinking about time, because you're just really deep,

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
deep, deep, deep in this sandwich or soup.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,600
And by the way, in this new time, those are the only two acceptable lunch foods.

174
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,120
And that's another thing we're going to get.

175
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,120
4.20 is still a lot of the day left ahead of you,

176
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,080
and 7 o'clock, a whole lot of the night left ahead of you, until 2 a.m.

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,600
And it's like, oh, it's dead.

178
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,160
It's done.

179
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,200
I have to go to sleep right now.

180
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,640
Now, along with dietary changes, Griffin, I do also anticipate that this new schedule

181
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
will require employment changes, because it sounds like everyone is going to have to work

182
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,200
from home.

183
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
Well, you'll work when it's 4.20.

184
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
You'll work when it's 4.20.

185
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,920
That's not how I understood that to work.

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
But then, just until you feel it.

187
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,040
I feel like this is outside of time.

188
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,440
I feel like you're-

189
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
When are the people supposed to clean Disneyland?

190
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,000
Because it seems like-

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,480
2 a.m.

192
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,640
Okay, so they go in at 2 a.m. when they should be asleep.

193
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
So they just don't get to sleep anymore.

194
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,280
Is that right?

195
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Probably not.

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,840
Probably not.

197
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,080
Oh, man, that's rough.

198
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,920
I mean, there's lots of- but for everybody else, you can get a good amount of sleep in

199
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,880
there, except for the people-

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
They could sleep 4.20.

201
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,880
It sounds like 4.20 is kind of free, free period.

202
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
Kind of a free period, yeah.

203
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
4.20 is just sort of a free skate.

204
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,520
Go out and do whatever you want.

205
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,560
But at 7 o'clock, you better watch Survivor and get your vittles.

206
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,920
Because then you have to go to Disneyland and clean it.

207
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
There's no more seasonal affective disorder.

208
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
There's no more wars.

209
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,040
Okay, because no one knows what time to show up for the war.

210
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,400
Yeah, it's like, I'm going to show up on the big theater of war front at 4.20, and then

211
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,640
it's sort of a staggered arrival, and it's like, well, this isn't- let's just go home.

212
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
Yeah, what if there was a war and nobody came?

213
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,520
You know what I mean?

214
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,560
Because it was 4.20.

215
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
Because it was 4.20.

216
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,200
Sounds like you guys love it, and sounds like America's gonna really love this one.

217
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,720
And also, I've got all of these watches with four times on it, and they're priced to move.

218
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,480
Coming soon to topotico.com, it's these watches.

219
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
Coming soon to Movement Watches.

220
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,040
It's just sort of a big- it's four sort of sections, and they're very, very helpful.

221
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,920
Before we move on to questions, can I tell you guys something real quick?

222
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,320
A true Travis McElroy Daylight Savings Time fact.

223
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,680
I did not know that Daylight Savings Time had any kind of effect last night.

224
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,800
I wasn't aware, missed it, didn't catch the buzz, didn't know it was happening.

225
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
And I realized this morning, I only found out about it because I saw someone talking

226
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
about it on Twitter.

227
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,840
Because in my house, I only have like two or three analog clocks now.

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,040
Like, most of my times are like on my phone, or my computers, or on my game systems, that

229
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,840
kind of thing.

230
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,640
And I thought about like, there's a very real chance that there's somebody that doesn't

231
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,520
own any analog watches or clocks that Daylight Savings Time could come and go and change,

232
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,360
and they would never know it.

233
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,640
Yeah, it's almost like it's a stupid, stupid, stupid idea that sucks and there's no point

234
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,040
to it.

235
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,920
And those people are living maybe the most blissful, most wonderful, except that it gets

236
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,520
dark at like 3.30 p.m. and you're like, huh, strange.

237
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,600
You're sleepy all day, and there's no reason for you to be sleepy.

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,960
I got an extra hour of sleep, but my body's default state when threatened is like, oh,

239
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,680
I want a nap.

240
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,920
Did you all know that they keep changing the day that Daylight Savings Time ends on?

241
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,440
Like, in 2005, they pushed it back so it would be after Halloween.

242
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,800
What do we-

243
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,600
Because of Candy Lobby.

244
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
Because of Candy Lobby.

245
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,480
Yes, and it's like, if it's that pliable, fucking, then do my Griffin Time.

246
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,600
Like, if we're just having fun with it, with time, and how it works in the sun and God,

247
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
then what are we doing?

248
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,720
Someday, when I'm in charge, I'm gonna keep moving spring forward ahead and move fall

249
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,320
back back until eventually it's like, you gotta turn your clocks forward an hour on

250
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,760
Sunday and then turn them back an hour on Monday.

251
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
It's still not worth it.

252
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,000
It's just like, in those two days, everybody's either late or early for everything.

253
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Do you know how-

254
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,400
This is not a joke.

255
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
I learned this yesterday.

256
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Do you know how Amtrak deals with Daylight Savings Time?

257
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,080
When it's fall back so you get an extra hour?

258
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Do you know what Amtrak does?

259
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,240
Fucking pulls over for an hour and kicks it.

260
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
That's what Amtrak does to stay on schedule.

261
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
They're like, well, we got an extra hour.

262
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,240
Let's kick it.

263
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,080
And wherever they stop next, they just kick it for an hour.

264
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,400
All right.

265
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,120
It's the worst.

266
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
We're literally, we've been Andy Rooney for like 13 minutes.

267
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,800
Let's shake it.

268
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,520
Let's shake it off.

269
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,680
The government's pretty fucked up right now.

270
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
Maybe they could just like get together for this.

271
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,680
Can we just like build some bridges, get rid of Daylight Savings Time, get rid of the penny,

272
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,320
and let's just do a little house cleaning since we can't agree on anything major.

273
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
Let's like get rid of the penny and Daylight Savings Time.

274
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,280
Everybody hates it.

275
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,960
How about some questions?

276
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,920
Yeah, a question.

277
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,760
I just moved to a new neighborhood and I passed an elementary school on my way to work.

278
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,600
This means I must cross at least one residential intersection that has a crossing guard.

279
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
What is a child?

280
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
Yeah, can I talk about Andy Rooney for a second?

281
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,680
You just brought him up.

282
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,600
He was just an old man blathering on about the stuff that bothered him.

283
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,520
I just realized that like there were only, he was on the air for like 100 years,

284
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,320
and there were only two possible reactions to Andy Rooney.

285
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,280
Regular people looking at him being like, what is this old man going on about?

286
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,000
And old people who are like, that's what I'm fucking talking about.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,480
Yeah.

288
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,120
Like, that seems like a challenging gig to me.

289
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
I think if he was born 20 years later, he would have the most successful podcast in America.

290
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,280
Oh, that's true.

291
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,640
Yeah, but the problem is that Andy Rooney only asks the questions.

292
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,120
And he never offered the answers.

293
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,760
And I think it's time that I step up and I just go point by point,

294
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,360
everything Andy Rooney brought up, and I solve it.

295
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,640
Now that's a podcast.

296
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,840
Andy Tooney.

297
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,960
Randy Ooney.

298
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
He was kind of the first podcaster.

299
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,360
He was very angry and talking to no one.

300
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,280
That's basically it.

301
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,560
He would have had a show just called What the Heck with Andy Rooney,

302
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,240
and then Marin would be out of a job.

303
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,800
I just moved to a new neighborhood, and I pass an elementary school on my way to work.

304
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,720
This means I must cross at least one residential intersection that has a crossing guard.

305
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,560
What is a childless pedestrian to do?

306
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,600
Am I offending her if I cross on my own?

307
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
Because sometimes she's helping a child cross the opposite way,

308
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
and I feel confident in my own abilities to navigate the intersection.

309
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,400
Oh, woof.

310
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,200
This is tough.

311
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,760
This is great.

312
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,520
Or do I wait to help me cross?

313
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,680
And if she does start to pull up her sign,

314
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,800
do I have to wait for her to get halfway out before I cross?

315
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,800
Is it rude?

316
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,320
Okay, so et cetera, et cetera.

317
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,000
You got the question.

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,400
You get it.

319
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,480
That's from Home Guard in Toronto.

320
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,680
The rub here, I'm not worried about the crossing guard's feelings

321
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,720
because the crossing guard doesn't need to help me out.

322
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm 30, and I've never been struck by even one vehicle a little bit.

323
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm batting a thousand vis-a-vis being struck.

324
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,160
But if a kid is on the other side or on the side of the street that I'm on,

325
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,080
and I say, fuck this, and I just walk across

326
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,400
because I don't see a vehicle coming and the light's green,

327
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,000
I feel like I'm maybe being a bad role model.

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
And I get that.

329
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,080
But it is pretty punk rock.

330
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,360
It just is the other kid.

331
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,480
They'll stop.

332
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,360
Trust me.

333
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,840
Trust me.

334
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,320
They'll stop.

335
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,840
Pedestrians have the right of way.

336
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
See, I am worried about the crossing guard

337
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,240
because I'm worried it would be like a rock-a-doodle

338
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
Sean DeClair kind of thing.

339
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,720
Go on.

340
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Where the crossing guard would see me cross without her help.

341
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,960
I just said crossing path.

342
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,120
Yeah, everything that she understood about how they can't cross without me.

343
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,960
But then she would see me cross without her,

344
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,520
and she would think, what have I been doing this whole time?

345
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,200
Maybe they didn't need me to cross.

346
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,160
And then I would have to go on an adventure with an animated kitten boy

347
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,920
to fight off some owls or some shit.

348
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
All right, let me give you this.

349
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,000
One day you just have the crossing guard hold all the kids back for like a half hour.

350
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,080
No crossing.

351
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,720
Build up a, I'm talking about a mess of kids.

352
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
A big old pile.

353
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
A whole gaggle of kids.

354
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,280
Just a gaggle of these little, a conflagration of kiddos.

355
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,840
And they chill there for like a half hour like, what the fuck is going on?

356
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,760
And then you show up in the gaggle and you say like,

357
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,120
this is ridiculous.

358
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,720
You don't know what you're talking about, you big goober.

359
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,280
And all you want to do is control me and my body.

360
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,120
And I say, screw that.

361
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,800
Freedom.

362
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,560
And then you start to cross.

363
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,680
And then you do get hit by a car while you're going across.

364
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,320
And it's something that you, but you planned it.

365
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,960
It's like your friend.

366
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
And his soft car.

367
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
His super soft car.

368
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
It's Randy's soft Honda.

369
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,120
And he comes and he hits you a little bit.

370
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,480
I mean, he hits you.

371
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
He hits you, but it's soft?

372
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
It's like a pillow fight, you know?

373
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,960
It's gotta be, it's gotta look bad.

374
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,800
You will go to the hospital.

375
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,160
Like, but you'll be fine eventually.

376
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Maybe there's a big crane up in the sky so high up that they don't see it.

377
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,640
And then you get hit by the car and then your body just gets pulled up

378
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
by the crane really fast into the clouds.

379
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,400
And so it's like you got hit by the car and launched 400 feet upwards.

380
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
And then you hang there with wings and a halo.

381
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,480
And you say to the kids, I should have listened.

382
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,280
And you sit back down.

383
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
You're like, oh, no.

384
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
Well, at least heaven's real.

385
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,140
Bye.

386
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,720
If only I'd paid attention to the crossing guard, as you all should from now on.

387
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Now I'm off to hang out with Jesus.

388
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,640
And then in the future, you can still cross.

389
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
And it's not that big a deal.

390
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
But now two things are going to happen.

391
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,360
One, the kids are still going to see you and be like, oh, I don't know.

392
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,160
I did watch that person get hit so hard they turned into angel.

393
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,840
And the other thing is you're going to look even cooler because of that.

394
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
Like, oh, shit.

395
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
Wait, you're that person that got hit by the car and you're still doing it?

396
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
I love your devil may care attitude.

397
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm not going to follow you because I did watch you get hit so hard that you went to heaven.

398
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
Justin There's another option.

399
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
And that is that you dress like a crossing guard.

400
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,160
So basically what I'm suggesting is you dress like a crossing guard.

401
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,800
And then as you pass, you're like, officer?

402
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,120
And then they like tip their hat to you.

403
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
And the kids are like, well, of course.

404
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,040
He's a crossing guard.

405
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,880
He knows what he's doing.

406
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
The faith in the-

407
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
Travis He's had special training and such.

408
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,040
Justin Yeah, the faith in the institution remains.

409
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,640
Travis Because here's the thing.

410
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,960
If you don't take the initiative and just cross yourself, the other side of this is like,

411
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,320
so you want to go, you know, east-west, but that crossing guard is crossing kids north-south.

412
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,040
You're going to stand on the corner, wait for her to get back, and then,

413
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,800
after you.

414
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,160
And then like, are you waiting for the crossing guard so you can get it?

415
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
Because you're just so-

416
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm like, and then she goes out and you're like, thank you.

417
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,120
And then you cross the street.

418
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,840
Like, I don't-

419
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,440
Justin It's- this situation is so bad that my anxiety

420
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,880
would be so legitimately piqued on a daily basis at, you know, I'm walking to work,

421
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:06,160
so it's going to be 930, that I would literally, the block before, pop open a manhole cover

422
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
and take the sewer for a couple blocks.

423
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,320
Travis A sewer would be a great option.

424
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:21,120
One other one would be to wear, like, a black cape and a mask and a t-shirt that says, like,

425
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,800
Mr. Fart on it.

426
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,800
So the kids, like, see Mr. Fart sneak across when he's not supposed to, but they all are

427
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,160
like, they know that's Mr. Fart.

428
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,440
You don't want to be like him.

429
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
Justin Oh, your character's name, Jay Walker.

430
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,840
Travis I kind of was super crazy about Mr. Fart.

431
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,800
Justin No, Mr. Fart- okay, Mr. Fart is my father.

432
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,320
Please call me Jay Walker.

433
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,800
Travis And what I love about Mr. Fart is you could

434
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,560
do that and do the get hit by a car driven by your friend, Randy, and the soft Honda.

435
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
And it's both good.

436
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Justin I'm not sure I like the comeuppance because

437
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,440
I do want kids to learn that Mr. Farts of the world can sometimes get ahead, but it's

438
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,240
not going to pay off.

439
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,200
Okay, if you want to play a long game, you can definitely have, like, a month of Mr.

440
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,760
Fart crossings punctuated by a car.

441
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,520
Travis That's my favorite Nintendo game, by the way.

442
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
Mr. Fart Crossing is the best.

443
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,920
Justin You could have, like, a month of Mr. Fart

444
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,320
crossings punctuated by Mr. Fart getting hit by a car, and then all the kids are like,

445
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,560
fucking finally.

446
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,960
Finally, this guy gets his just deserts.

447
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Travis Or maybe you pull one of my favorite tropes

448
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,160
which is, like, the crossing guard and Mr. Fart, clearly there's animosity there, clearly

449
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,960
there's tension.

450
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,320
But just like in that one episode of Reboot when the main bad guy, like, played a cool

451
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,200
guitar solo-

452
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,920
Justin Megabyte?

453
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,360
Travis Yeah, with the, you know, the cool-

454
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
Justin I know, yeah, I know what you're talking

455
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,320
about, for his birthday.

456
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
Travis Right, for Enzo's birthday.

457
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,880
But I can't remember, Bob?

458
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,680
That was it.

459
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Like that, where there's, like, a cool moment where the crossing guard and Mr. Fart work

460
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,480
together to maybe stop- I really want to introduce Jay Walker to this.

461
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,560
Maybe they want together to stop Jay Walker, the greater evil.

462
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,800
Justin How about a Yahoo?

463
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,840
Travis Yeah, please.

464
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
Travis I feel like you guys aren't as on board with

465
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,600
Jay Walker as I am.

466
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,920
Justin It's just Mr. Fart is so much better.

467
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,560
Like, Jay Walker is-

468
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,800
Travis But Mr. Fart just crosses whenever.

469
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,000
Jay Walker crosses wherever, you see?

470
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,760
So Mr. Fart at least adheres to where the crossing areas are.

471
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,240
Justin Can we get both of them, and both of them

472
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,160
struck by the same soft Honda?

473
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,800
Because then the kids-

474
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Travis Yeah, oh, and Jay Walker dies and Mr. Fart

475
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,240
lives, and that's where he learns, like, I don't want to be like Jay Walker.

476
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,520
Justin Right, and maybe Mr. Fart comes down with

477
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,880
the halo and angel wings and goes to heaven, but Jay Walker is in hell.

478
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,520
Travis Oh yeah.

479
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,600
I want to go back to medical school and become Dr. Fart.

480
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,280
Justin Here's one sent in by Hannah Troxel.

481
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,240
Thank you, Hannah.

482
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,760
Yahoo Answers user Henny asks,

483
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,800
Can I play video games in my mind?

484
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,920
Can I play video games in my mind?

485
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,520
I do not have the money to invest in building a gaming PC.

486
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,400
So can I play video games in my imagination?

487
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,120
Justin I love this a lot, because I love the idea

488
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:23,280
of just being, you know, at the DMV or at church or in line at Yogurt Land, the only

489
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
three places I ever go.

490
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,440
And you're just standing there and somebody's talking to you, like the preacher, but you're

491
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,880
not paying attention because your eyes are just glassed over because you're just playing

492
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,240
and with your best friend Master Chief in your mind, in your, you know, your mind castle.

493
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
Travis In your mind den.

494
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,040
Justin In your mind den, you're playing with Mario

495
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,240
and Yoshi and you can do anything in there.

496
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,080
And so maybe you're standing there and the preacher's like, are you even listening

497
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,720
to my, we're doing Ratshack, Meshack, Abednego.

498
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,440
It's like my favorite one.

499
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,480
You're not even paying attention.

500
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,680
And you're just like, I just got all the stars.

501
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,560
I just got 30 points.

502
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,720
You don't even know about that.

503
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,920
Travis Oh, shoot, I lost.

504
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,760
Because sometimes you do still need to lose.

505
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
Justin You want to amp up the difficulty a little

506
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:13,600
bit.

507
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,080
Travis Yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,120
Justin You don't want to make it too easy on

509
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,520
yourself.

510
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,440
Travis Oh, no, they got me, you know.

511
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Justin Did you hear, Preacher Man?

512
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
The new Shenmue game is out.

513
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,840
Shenmue 3 is here and I'm playing it now.

514
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,480
Travis And in my imagination, it's very good,

515
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,080
which is maybe not how it's going to manifest in the physical space.

516
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Oh, it's so, oh, how about a game of Lucky Hit?

517
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,800
Did you just say something?

518
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,680
No, it's in my mind.

519
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,720
Justin Good news.

520
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,520
Character is back for No One Lives Forever 3 right now on the Rixbox.

521
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,560
That's right.

522
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,040
The Rixbox, the only gaming console in my Rix head.

523
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,080
Travis I'm so excited for the Rixbox 360, which

524
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,320
is when I'm going to get a third lobe.

525
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,440
Justin It's got rumble.

526
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,320
Travis This lobe's got rumble in it.

527
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,240
Justin It's got motion sensitivity.

528
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,040
If I move my head quickly enough, I'll make that jump.

529
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,640
Travis Now there's two Master Chiefs and they're kissing.

530
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,520
It's a mod I did in my Rixbox.

531
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,800
Justin Oh, look at that.

532
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,000
I found all the cheat codes in my brain.

533
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,840
Travis There's just times where you can't.

534
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
There's just times where you can't game out.

535
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,320
And everybody wishes they were playing video games all the time.

536
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,080
But sometimes you can't because you're in the Yogurtland line or the church line.

537
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,600
Justin How far would you need to take the simulation?

538
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,640
Are you going to have times when you're on the bus and you want to play Rixbox but you

539
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
can't because you're downloading Bloodborne 2 to your Rixbox?

540
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
Travis Yeah, it's got to update.

541
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,480
I know the batteries on the controller are dead and I didn't go get more from the Rix Greens.

542
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,600
Travis I think you downloading Bloodborne 2 is just

543
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,920
you sitting in a bus saying like, alright, so this time around, more guns.

544
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,680
Justin That's how you program it.

545
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,000
You just have to say out loud, alright, here's all the monsters that are in it.

546
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,520
Here we go.

547
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
There's a man who looks like a crow.

548
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,280
Travis I do like that because it gives crossover

549
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,960
like a whole new world of possibilities.

550
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,960
We're like, it's Bloodborne, but also my friend Todd is there.

551
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,600
Like you can just crossover everything.

552
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Travis My favorite thing about the Rixbox 360 is

553
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,280
that I'm in all the video games.

554
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,160
It's real targeted marketing.

555
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
Oh man, the Rixbox.

556
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,560
Here's another question.

557
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,560
I have a coworker who's been telling the office an incredible lie for the last two months.

558
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,120
She claims she bought a house, she's shown us pictures, hired people to do repairs,

559
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,720
and even left early a couple of times during packing and moving.

560
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,440
The thing is, after some suspicious details to her story, I had a realtor friend of mine

561
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,720
look into this house.

562
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,680
Not only is it still for sale, but it's had no offers on it,

563
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,200
and it's now being rented out to two totally different people.

564
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,760
What is the best way to go about letting her know that I know?

565
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
And that's from Are You For Real at Rockford.

566
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,520
Travis What is more buckwild in this situation?

567
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
Travis This is what I'm weighing right now.

568
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,760
Travis Okay, what is more buckwild in this situation?

569
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,280
This lie, this wild lie, or the fact that you fucking Shelby wooed it.

570
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,320
So I do not know that I have that.

571
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,640
I don't think I have that game in my Rick's box to think like,

572
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
you know what, I'm going to talk to a fucking realtor friend of mine

573
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,000
and get to the bottom of this.

574
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,280
This must have been troubling you so much.

575
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,000
Justin Yeah.

576
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Monsieur Perrault, I have a most fascinating case I think you'll like to be very intrigued by.

577
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,920
Travis Well, I have a showing today,

578
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,040
and I was going to make cookies, but yeah, I'll take time out of it.

579
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,720
Is there no realtor realty confidentiality thing?

580
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,840
I'm like, I can't just go look up to see if someone owns a house.

581
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,200
Travis I mean, I'm more interested in what was the detail that-

582
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,600
Justin It's got 10 toilets in it and no doors.

583
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,800
That doesn't sound like a house.

584
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,320
I need to get to the bottom of this.

585
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,680
That's like what the kitchen's on the ceiling.

586
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,600
Okay, so you're fucking lying then.

587
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Travis I was hoping this question.

588
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,160
This question went in with and so my question is,

589
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,880
what are some great hobbies that I can maybe get into?

590
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
Travis No, but this is the thing.

591
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,320
That's the thing though, I would love to catch somebody in a group.

592
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,880
We all dream of catching somebody in a grift like this.

593
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,800
And so I celebrate your initiative.

594
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,680
Justin There's only one way.

595
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,120
There's only one solution though.

596
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
You have to buy the house.

597
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,040
You buy that house, you get some pictures, like move in,

598
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,320
get all your shit in there, then brings a picture to the office

599
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,400
and be like, that's so strange because I live there.

600
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,800
Done.

601
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,680
Travis Or you don't and you'd never tell them,

602
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,480
but you do try to see like how buckwild you can make the story get.

603
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,880
Justin Yes.

604
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,120
Tell me more about the house is the only sentence you need.

605
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,120
Tell me again about the basement, just whatever.

606
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,320
And then you're like, really?

607
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,160
I'm like, that's it.

608
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,960
Travis It's a pretty cool house, but it'd be way cooler

609
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,520
if there were two bowling alleys in it.

610
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,160
And then the next day you show up like, it's funny you said that

611
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,480
because we just finished the remodel and look at that.

612
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,200
And it's a picture of the galaxy bowl down the street.

613
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,560
It's like, oh, great house, wink.

614
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,000
That's you winking to everybody else.

615
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
Justin This person is living their own door

616
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,920
slamming farce right now.

617
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
And they didn't mean to get in this deep.

618
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,200
I don't know how it happened, but you have a real opportunity here

619
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,160
to get in on the grift.

620
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,440
This is what my first action would be going to this person

621
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,640
in confidence and saying, listen, I know the truth.

622
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,880
And I'm here to tell you, I fucking love it.

623
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
Let me get a slice of this.

624
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,360
Let me get up in there.

625
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,840
And then you're like showing up to the office,

626
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,560
like had a great time at the barbecue at your house.

627
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,800
Travis Photoshop pictures of the two of you standing

628
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,440
in front of like Zillow pictures of house.

629
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,080
Justin At least see if you can get some housewarming

630
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
swag out of it, something.

631
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,760
Get a pineapple, a potted succulent, something out of it.

632
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,040
And then, oh no, the house burned down.

633
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,240
Fake insurance scam.

634
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,560
Justin You do have to have an out.

635
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
You have to have an exit for your grift.

636
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Travis Sold the house, sold the house.

637
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
Justin Sold the house again.

638
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh, I put it back up for sale.

639
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
Travis Flipped it, got the property brothers then.

640
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,720
Property brothers came.

641
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,600
Justin Oh, shoot.

642
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,840
Old man came in, tied balloons, everything floated away

643
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,920
so he could find his wife or whatever.

644
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,720
Didn't see the movie.

645
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,680
I think that's what happens.

646
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,840
Travis And I didn't get full coverage.

647
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,480
So that's on me.

648
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,920
Justin I didn't get full man balloon coverage.

649
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,480
So shoot.

650
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,560
Shoot, I guess.

651
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,840
Travis Sold it.

652
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,600
Damn thing was full of rats.

653
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Had to.

654
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,480
Justin Chocoblock rats.

655
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,080
Or you show up, big bushy fake beard on cool hat

656
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,760
that says like big real construction company.

657
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,200
And then you show up and you're doing a voice like,

658
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,960
hey, I finished fixing all the turlets in the real house

659
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,360
you have.

660
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
Travis All 10 of them.

661
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,160
Justin All 10 of them.

662
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,240
Hey, do you know your kitchen's upside down?

663
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,520
Travis I love bowling alleys.

664
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,200
Travis It's the most wonderful,

665
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,360
terrible house I've ever seen in my life.

666
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,640
What a lucky person you are.

667
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
Justin I walked into the kitchen,

668
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,400
get a glass of water, fell up to the ceiling,

669
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,760
broke my neck and died.

670
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,400
I'm a goat.

671
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,040
Travis Smash.

672
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,640
Travis Anyways, Mr. Winchester.

673
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,440
Justin Smash.

674
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
That's you jumping through the window to escape.

675
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,800
Travis Is it possible?

676
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,440
I watch almost exclusively children's programming.

677
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,040
So this is where my brain goes.

678
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,960
Is it possible your realtor is trying to teach you a lesson

679
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,720
about snooping on people?

680
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,360
Because there is very little that's less wild

681
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,280
than storming into your office and being like,

682
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,080
I know you don't own your house, but they do.

683
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,200
And you've been lied to by your realtor friend.

684
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,880
That is actually the most believable scenario to me.

685
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,240
Travis Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,920
This is definitely a backwards, not a honeypot, backwards.

687
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,040
Justin Why would you pick?

688
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,520
Travis Something.

689
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,760
Justin I'm trying to think through the group.

690
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,640
Why would you pick a specific like searchable address?

691
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
Because like I know how Zillow works.

692
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,880
And if you told me your address, I could just look.

693
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,800
Like I wouldn't need a realtor friend.

694
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,200
I would just like look at it.

695
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,640
Travis I just bought a house.

696
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,160
You wouldn't know where it is.

697
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,720
Don't worry about it.

698
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
Travis Well, I mean, they probably gave a fake address,

699
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,280
but America's so big that there's a house for every address.

700
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,280
So she probably said like 6969 Cool Street.

701
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,920
And it was like, oh, that's that one does.

702
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,880
That one is real.

703
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,080
And by the way, God, I'm looking at some houses right now.

704
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,440
And even if it was like a one bedroom, zero bath,

705
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,320
35 square foot house for $500,000.

706
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,680
If it was on 6969 Cool Street,

707
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,960
like I could bulldoze the house and start over.

708
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,240
You can get a new house.

709
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,920
You can get a remodeled kitchen

710
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,240
and add at least one bathroom to the house.

711
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,160
You cannot just get 6969 Cool Street.

712
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,080
You cannot just buy that address.

713
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,840
Justin Okay, big news.

714
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,160
Oh my fucking God.

715
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,640
Travis Did you just Google 6969 Cool Street?

716
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,720
Justin Yeah, there's one.

717
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,680
And it's in Weed Sport, New York.

718
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,880
There it goes.

719
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,480
I'm not fucking shitting you.

720
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,400
The city is called Weed Sport.

721
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,720
And it's 6969 Cool Street in Weed Sport.

722
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Travis Oh my God, Justin.

723
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,920
Justin That is the choicest.

724
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,080
Travis I mean, I've been looking to, you know,

725
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,680
I missed the seasons.

726
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,280
I got to get out of Texas.

727
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
I miss Eastern Time, which is, you know,

728
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,200
not going to be a thing once my thing takes place.

729
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,800
But yeah, it sounds good.

730
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,600
Is it on the market?

731
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,320
Is it available?

732
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,040
Justin It does not look to be available.

733
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,800
Travis Fuck it, I'll show up on their front door

734
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,560
like the fucking finale of the OC

735
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,680
and be like, I know you live here,

736
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,880
but I need to live here.

737
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,640
Did you know your address is the best?

738
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,680
I bet the person that lives there

739
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
is the coolest fucking person on Earth.

740
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,400
Justin No question.

741
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,920
Travis Yeah, it's not for sale.

742
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,560
Are you kidding me?

743
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,920
You can't just buy this address.

744
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,440
Justin I hope they're pretty cool,

745
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,520
because we just prompted hundreds of thousands of people

746
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,840
to go like Google Image Search their house.

747
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,640
Travis Oh, please don't, don't, don't, don't,

748
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,200
Justin Don't do this thing, no, no, no, but I am.

749
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,000
But don't, you should don't.

750
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,800
Travis No, but don't, don't, don't, don't.

751
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,440
Justin But I already did.

752
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,320
Travis Admire it from afar without touching.

753
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,200
It's the most beautiful golden fawn

754
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,720
that you've stumbled upon in the forest.

755
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,880
Don't spook it, stay, admire it,

756
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,200
but don't, you know, send them anything.

757
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,560
Justin Man, Weed Sport looks like a cool place too.

758
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,600
It's very small.

759
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,120
Travis It's actually Weed Sport,

760
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,760
and the town's original name was Hacky Sack, New York.

761
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,120
Justin Ha, ha, ha, ha.

762
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,960
Travis But they got it confused with Hackensack,

763
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,120
and so they changed it to Weed Sport.

764
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,160
Justin So they changed it.

765
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,040
Travis That is a fucking good address.

766
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,080
Justin Let's go to the Money Zone,

767
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,960
because usually when we do that,

768
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,000
we take like a little break,

769
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,600
and I can just, you know, talk to Rachel and Henry

770
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,680
and start to figure out this big life move

771
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,440
where we move up to New York.

772
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:22,320
Travis Our first sponsor this week is Bowl and Branch.

773
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,920
Been a while since we've heard from them.

774
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,560
Justin Don't guilt our sponsor.

775
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,600
Travis No, it's just every two times.

776
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,760
Justin Oh, Bowl and Branch, haven't heard from you in a while.

777
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
Travis Still got comfy sheets?

778
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,200
That's right, they do,

779
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,600
and they're going to take your sleep and style

780
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,480
to the next level, and with Bowl and Branch,

781
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
that upgrade has never been more affordable.

782
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,280
They're crafted from 100% cotton,

783
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,720
so they look and feel super soft,

784
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
because you buy direct from them,

785
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,840
you don't pay expensive retail markups,

786
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,800
and lots of places like the New York Times, Forbes,

787
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,560
and the Wall Street Journal have raved about them.

788
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
Travis I'll tell you what, no joke,

789
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
when Teresa and I moved into a real house,

790
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,440
which we actually did buy, Justin,

791
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,600
we got a couple new sheet sets from Bowl and Branch

792
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,880
and some new towels for guests and that kind of thing,

793
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,080
and Bowl and Branch was our one-stop shop for,

794
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,440
you know, they have this thing called bath sheets

795
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,320
that are like really huge towels that wrap around you,

796
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
they are amazing, highly recommend,

797
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,400
and flannel sheets, flannel sheets perfect

798
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,880
for coming up on those cold wintery months.

799
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,680

and they can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.

822
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,600
I've talked about this a lot,

823
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,120
like I didn't know how to cook at all

824
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,600
but I wanted to learn and so I started doing Blue Apron

825
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,640
and now like I can cook lots of stuff

826
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,440
and it's very, very exciting and it's a cool skill to know.

842
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,320
Candy necklace and ring pop edible underwear maybe

843
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,720
because they're flavorful accessories.

844
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,000
Choose from breezy skirts, plush PJ pants and comfy shorts

845
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,560

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,600
That's cheating, we can't do two people.

853
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,880
You needed to do two messages.

854
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,240
This is for Chaitlin.

855
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,960
This is for Chaitlin, we oughta maybe eat some boy.

856
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,400
Grant and Amanda or Gramanda, bleep bloop,

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
achievement unlocked, first anniversary.

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,600
Buying this year in advance, so congratulations

859
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,720
on your first year of wedded bliss or impending divorce.

860
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,640
Can you believe the Cubs won the World Series

861
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,360
two years in a row?

862
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,480
Here's to many more years of happiness

863
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,200
even if Caitlin is a dirty Yankees fan.

864
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,840
Love you both.

865
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,120
Wow, that's twice as many sports references

866
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,320
as we normally have.

867
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,640
Venom, I've been bam, I hope everybody really got good.

868
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,720
Real sort of fever pitch to catch the pitch.

869
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,960
This is the name of the new movie here

870
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
and it's that big Cubs-Yankees rivalry

871
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,480
that is going around and congratulations

872
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,440
to the real winners of the big one.

873
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,000
I know the Dodgers and Astros were both in it

874
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,960
so one of them, congratulations whoever did come out on top.

875
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,320
Griffin, it's your state.

876
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,840
People are gonna tweet at you.

877
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,480
We got lots of baseball teams in my fucking state.

878
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
But they're gonna tweet at you, Griffin.

879
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,840
Aren't you afraid of the tweets?

880
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,280
I ain't afraid of no tweets.

881
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,080
I can't do more than that or we'd be sued.

882
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,280
In celeb news this week, the hosts of Lady to Lady

883
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,000
took a break from hanging with today's hottest comedians,

884
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,040
actors, and writers to sell a sex machine.

885
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,360
What'd they do with all that cash?

886
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,880
Rent a party bus to go to Magic Mike Live in Vegas, of course.

887
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,000
All of this on the heels of a salacious sizzler session

888
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,720
with Home Alone 4 star French Stewart.

889
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,120
Want to know what the fuck we're talking about?

890
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,560
Tune into Lady to Lady whenever, wherever you listen to podcasts.

891
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,680
Can you keep a secret?

892
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,480
Neither can we.

893
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,400
How about a Yahoo answer?

894
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,560
Yes.

895
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
This one was sent in by Dylan Haston.

896
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,040
Thank you, Dylan.

897
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,280
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

898
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,160
I'm gonna call them.

899
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:58,400
Ann asks, what is the saddest story you can think of

900
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,560
using only four words?

901
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,560
Oh, for sale, baby, oops.

902
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,720
For sale, for sale, baby, oops.

903
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,120
Unused baby shoes.

904
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,640
Cheap, cheap, cheap.

905
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,560
Unused baby, hey, I just shortened that.

906
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,840
We just shortened that dumb six word story into a four word story.

907
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,760
Unused baby shoes.

908
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,800
Cheap, cheap, cheap.

909
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,680
That's four words.

910
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,960
We could probably get it down shorter.

911
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,080
I can do it in one word.

912
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,140
Okay.

913
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,400
Tears.

914
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,520
That's actually not that good.

915
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,600
Okay, wait, I can do it in one.

916
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,100
Sad.

917
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,560
Yeah, it's still not great.

918
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,880
Wait, maybe if I make that one word really long though.

919
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,380
Sad.

920
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,120
No, it's nothing.

921
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,520
Four word sad story.

922
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,040
Diarrhea at the prom.

923
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,320
And that one can be real.

924
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,960
I actually don't wanna say anything else.

925
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,200
All I want are those fucking answers.

926
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,640
Oh, it's funny that you say that, Justin,

927
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,080
because you got some good ones.

928
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,200
Yeah, I bet we do.

929
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,240
Faith said, my taco has fallen.

930
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,760
How about this one from Eve who says, the sale is over.

931
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,920
Hashtag only girls know.

932
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,280
Oh, jeez.

933
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,240
Okay, you can't have a sad four word story

934
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,440
and then hashtag it to make it land.

935
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,320
That's nothing.

936
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,560
Rekara said, I stepped on Lego.

937
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,080
So that's very relatable.

938
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,440
There's five pages of these.

939
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,480
But no, wait, no, no, no, hold on.

940
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:42,800
Hold on.

941
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,520
No, no, no, no, no.

942
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
It's not like deer and deer.

943
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,320
I stepped on Lego.

944
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,120
Do you mean you stepped on a Lego or some Lego?

945
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,400
It's a five word story.

946
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,320
Just drop the article just to get breezy with it.

947
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,760
Lego stepping.

948
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah, that dog don't hunt.

949
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,400
Sorry.

950
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,160
Oh, actually, there's a good one.

951
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,120
That dog don't hunt.

952
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,080
That dog don't hunt.

953
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,560
Socrates says, the Clintons are crooks.

954
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,760
So wait a minute.

955
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,000
This was a day ago.

956
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,720
This is still.

957
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,280
And not that sad.

958
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,160
I mean, it's sad for you, I guess.

959
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,960
Do people not know what sad means?

960
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,680
I stepped on Lego.

961
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,240
That's not sad.

962
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,200
It's painful.

963
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,320
Do you step on a Lego and feel like just sadness for the Lego maybe or for you?

964
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,600
A lot of political tweets.

965
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,760
And there's six pages of answers.

966
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,920
It's just, are any of them actually sad?

967
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,040
Oh, I mean, this one from Bramjeet says, love kills people.

968
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,800
Bramjeet was like, I need three.

969
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,160
And also it still makes sense.

970
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,280
I got it in three.

971
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,960
Hatchet man tattoo fading.

972
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,240
See, that's sad.

973
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,440
That's quite sad.

974
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,600
The real reason I wanted to do this was because of a really great and poignant poem that was

975
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,520
dropped in here by an anonymous user.

976
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,760
But it's a shame they were anonymous because they could be a new poet laureate.

977
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,680
And I'll try to separate the words out so you can sort of tell where the four are.

978
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,760
My grandpa died too early.

979
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,600
Too early.

980
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,720
And that's number two early sort of in one sort of word experience.

981
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,120
My grandpa died too furious.

982
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:46,800
You know, I would point out here that too early is redundant because you could just

983
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,760
say he died early because too early, I mean, it's implied by the early.

984
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,680
What about like my or not my, we have to lose my.

985
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,360
Grandpa died on time.

986
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,640
Grandpa died too late.

987
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,760
Well, if you're going to drop the my, I mean, grandpa died too early.

988
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,800
You don't need the my.

989
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,520
That's obvious.

990
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,240
Who's grandpa?

991
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,880
Who do you think?

992
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
Why not just grandpa died?

993
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,000
Is there a time where your grandpa died where you're like, yeah, that went down smooth.

994
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,880
Awesome.

995
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,520
Oh, cool.

996
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,200
I had a test tomorrow.

997
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,080
Thank you, grandpa.

998
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,680
One last present from the old man.

999
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,040
I mean, people make a big deal out of that baby shoes one, huh?

1000
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,800
But like, it seems wicked easy to do this with even fewer words.

1001
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I don't think that that's as big of a deal as we sort of make it out to be.

1002
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,240
Oh, no, that's two.

1003
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,240
Oh, no, family explode.

1004
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,440
Come on, dude.

1005
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,440
That was Hemingway, right?

1006
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,080
Did that one?

1007
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,160
Oh, no.

1008
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,840
Oh, shoot.

1009
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,680
Wife disappeared.

1010
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,640
Oh, no.

1011
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,680
Puppy melted.

1012
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,760
Oh, beans, wolf attack.

1013
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,360
Oh, no.

1014
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,800
Family frozen.

1015
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,760
Family froze.

1016
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,280
Shoot.

1017
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,080
Farted on crush.

1018
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,520
Crush Mondays.

1019
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,120
That one's fun because it's got sort of two.

1020
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,920
It's too sad.

1021
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,400
It brings you down and then at the end, it's sort of like a funny Garfield thing.

1022
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,440
How about another question?

1023
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,760
Stone cold Steve Austin.

1024
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,000
And then a sad face emoticon because that doesn't count as a word.

1025
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,400
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

1026
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,120
I work at an Ethiopian restaurant in Michigan.

1027
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,160
Every Thursday, an 80-year-old man dressed in hiking gear comes to eat just before close.

1028
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,440
When I prompt him for his order, it's always the same response.

1029
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,600
He says, give me the bean combo.

1030
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,600
There is no bean combo.

1031
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,560
Oh, man.

1032
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,240
I ask him to clarify and he just grumpily changes his order.

1033
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,280
What is the bean combo and why won't he tell me what it is himself?

1034
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,280
And that's from there is no Ethiopian secret menu.

1035
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,480
Justin, it seems like if any of us are going to know what the bean combo is,

1036
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,520
it's going to be you.

1037
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,600
Here's what you do.

1038
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,640
Get some beans.

1039
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,320
You cook them up real nice.

1040
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,160
And then what's that on the side of them?

1041
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,200
You guessed it.

1042
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,320
Different beans.

1043
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,800
Okay.

1044
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,400
So you just kind of...

1045
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,680
What kind of cocktail do you like?

1046
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,120
Like a garbanzo pinto?

1047
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,760
Me?

1048
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Thank you for asking, Griffin.

1049
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,920
Black beans are the best beans, but then you'd all mix in there.

1050
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,040
Great northern.

1051
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,240
It's like that great old tune, Ebony and Ivory.

1052
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,520
I'm promoting harmony.

1053
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,680
That's yeah, it's explicitly what the song is about.

1054
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,080
Sure.

1055
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,580
Yeah.

1056
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,960
This old man comes in here every Thursday.

1057
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,840
How have you not just been worn down and added a bean combo to the menu?

1058
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,480
Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,040
You know what?

1060
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,480
You got it.

1061
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,040
You got it.

1062
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,480
Bean combo coming right up.

1063
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,320
You can name it after him, by which I mean you can call it shithead.

1064
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,080
You can't go into a restaurant, order something that's not there,

1065
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,440
unless it is actually kind of the...

1066
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,600
It's a pretty sick move actually.

1067
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,280
And we may have actually just found out who lives at 6969 Cool Street.

1068
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,960
Is it possible?

1069
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,400
He's wearing the same outfit.

1070
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,840
He's ordering the same thing.

1071
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,080
Is it possible that this older gentleman...

1072
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,680
Definitely.

1073
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,160
Definitely.

1074
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,600
I know where you're going, and I definitely...

1075
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,080
Do you know where I'm going?

1076
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,320
Yeah.

1077
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,680
Because where I'm going is he's doing a Groundhog Day.

1078
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1079
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,920
He's doing it.

1080
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,040
He just thinks he's doing a Groundhog Day.

1081
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,200
You know, like he thinks he's in Groundhog Day, and to your credit,

1082
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,600
it sounds like you're reacting the same every time too.

1083
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,560
So you're not really doing anything to break him out of this Groundhog Day.

1084
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,160
Yeah, here's that bean combo, man.

1085
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,080
I've done it.

1086
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,720
I did it.

1087
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,240
I'm in the right timeline.

1088
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,760
Thank you, Andy McTowell.

1089
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,720
I was gonna say, it's 1965.

1090
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:06,320
And Chester, this dude's name, goes to his favorite diner, Ralph's Bean Hole,

1091
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,960
and he goes there and he cramps his favorite meal, the big bean combo.

1092
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,280
And he's wearing his hiking gear because he's about to, you know,

1093
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,120
go out on the big one, the big journey.

1094
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,000
But Ralph is like, oh, don't go into that ravine.

1095
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,040
You know, it's dangerous.

1096
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,200
Lots of coyotes and crevasses.

1097
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,400
And Chester's like, no, I got this one.

1098
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,320
And he falls into the crevasse, and he lands in four wolf's mouths,

1099
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,560
and they just make short work of him.

1100
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,360
And now, every Thursday, because that was the day, the fateful day,

1101
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:44,720
his unrestful spirit wanders into this place.

1102
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,000
Now it's an Ethiopian restaurant because Ralph made a lot of bad decisions.

1103
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,480
He should have offered something besides beans, in retrospect.

1104
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,800
And so now he comes in and he's like,

1105
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,520
let me get the bean combo so that I may finally be free.

1106
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,720
Because that's what's going to happen.

1107
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,360
One day you will cook them some beans, and he's just going to disappear

1108
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,000
because you've sort of, you know, Sixth Sense,

1109
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
sort of finished his business on this world.

1110
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,720
Here's the, if it's any kind of like a regular time,

1111
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,640
if it's like 7 p.m. every Thursday, what if you just like,

1112
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,160
okay, what if you just like had a table ready for him?

1113
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,400
Like with like special care put to it,

1114
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,720
and like a little like plaque with his name,

1115
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,680
like a little, you know, note card, place card with his name.

1116
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh my god, this is going to get you on the,

1117
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,240
this is going to get you on the local news, by the way.

1118
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,000
This Ethiopian restaurant has gone out of its way

1119
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,640
to help out this very confused old ghost.

1120
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,880
Please do it for the vine.

1121
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
Just do it for the vine.

1122
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,600
Do it for the vine of the old man reacting to this great miracle that you've done.

1123
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,200
And then you lift the lid and it's beans,

1124
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,320
and people watching at home are like,

1125
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,480
oh, this is a mean prank, it's just beans.

1126
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,200
But his face at the beans!

1127
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,400
His face as he looks up and smiles with a tear in his eye as he turns into vapor,

1128
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,000
and finally goes to heaven.

1129
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,440
Please release this man with beans.

1130
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,920
Please set him free with beans.

1131
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,120
You have beans in the back, just make the old ghost some beans.

1132
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,360
For just pennies a day, you can set this ghost free with beans.

1133
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,440
How good is your Ethiopian restaurant doing

1134
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,280
that you're not listening to your customers?

1135
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,680
Because to me, it sounds like your customers are crazy for the bean combo,

1136
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,760
and you should probably get it on the menu.

1137
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,920
Also, how good is your Ethiopian restaurant

1138
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,960
that this dude consistently doesn't get what he wants,

1139
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,120
but is like, I can't say no to it.

1140
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,480
They never have what I want,

1141
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,160
but damn, if it isn't the finest Ethiopian food I've ever had.

1142
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,720
Guess what?

1143
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,080
Kusra's always right.

1144
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,840
So you do have bean combo.

1145
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,800
Please, to make.

1146
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,680
When I'm going to IHOP and I say, let me get an enchilada,

1147
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,440
I am correct.

1148
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,240
Yeah, they're going to wrap a thin pancake around some strawberries

1149
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,200
and they're going to give you a crepe.

1150
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,600
Sounds good as hell, though, still.

1151
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,400
I think I would curse that.

1152
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,080
Yeah, now I kind of want that.

1153
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,200
I do kind of want that.

1154
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,040
Just banish this old ghost and get on the news.

1155
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,640
Just kill this ghost.

1156
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,200
This Ethiopian restaurant went out of its way to do one final act of kindness

1157
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,280
and banish this ghost to the hell dimension.

1158
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,920
This real ghost.

1159
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,840
I'd like you to meet Derek.

1160
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,680
He went to the store to get beans.

1161
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,800
There's no more news.

1162
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,240
It's been a slow week.

1163
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,680
It's been a slow week.

1164
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,200
We here at WeedSport, it's been real chill.

1165
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,000
I don't think ghosts are real qualifies as a slow news day.

1166
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,240
Well, ghosts were real.

1167
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,840
The one we had, we let get away with being.

1168
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,240
Earth's last ghost extinguished by an unthoughtful bean dealer.

1169
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
Hello and welcome to news.

1170
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,280
We've gotten so many complaints about how big and scary everything is all the time.

1171
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,160
So we thought we'd give you something a little bit more lightweight.

1172
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,960
We'd like you to meet Jeremy who went to the store to get beans to kill an old ghost.

1173
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,000
Here with this package is journalist Amanda Goodcamera.

1174
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,560
Hi, I'm Amanda Goodcamera.

1175
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,360
It's true.

1176
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,560
The beans have been displayed and the ghost is no more.

1177
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,360
The terror that once plagued this Ethiopian restaurant is gone.

1178
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,320
Thank you, beans.

1179
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,280
You've done it again.

1180
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,720
We didn't film the ghost, unfortunately, because fucking Jeremy was a little hot on the trigger,

1181
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,280
but...

1182
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,840
He just, he told us he went to the store and bought the beans and we just thought like,

1183
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,360
yeah, fuck it.

1184
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,040
This has been news.

1185
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,800
Sorry for cussing.

1186
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,680
We've been canceled.

1187
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,560
We've been canceled.

1188
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,520
News is canceled.

1189
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,520
That is going to do it for us this week, folks.

1190
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,120
I hope you've enjoyed yourself here on our program.

1191
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,520
We've certainly enjoyed having you.

1192
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Our program, we've certainly enjoyed having you.

1193
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,240
I'll say that.

1194
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,160
Hey, if you live in Chicago or Milwaukee, I think Milwaukee is close to sold out,

1195
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,400
which is exciting, but we're going to be up there here in a couple of weeks.

1196
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,280
So if you live there, Chicago, we're going to be there November 16th at the Chicago Theater.

1197
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,600
Milwaukee, we're going to be at the Riverside Theater on November 19th.

1198
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,920
You can find tickets at macroshows.com slash tours and come see us if you live there because

1199
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,080
there's still some tickets available and we'd love to see you.

1200
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,280
If you would like to see us, you could also go to podcon.com, register for PodCon.

1201
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,200
It is going to be a very cool convention.

1202
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,560
We've been sort of involved with all like the planning stuff and setting up the whole

1203
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,440
thing with the Knightville folks and Hank Green.

1204
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,640
And I think it's going to be a really cool event.

1205
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,760
If you go to podcon.com, you can just get tickets.

1206
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,720
Now, even if you're not going to be in the area, they have remote attendance.

1207
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,400
So it's like you are there and you'll get audio recordings of almost all the panels,

1208
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,120
performances and live recordings from PodCon.

1209
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,000
And this sounds really neat.

1210
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,480
Two more plugs, I promise.

1211
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:20,240
Real quick, Teresa and I, along with our dad, Clint, who does the Adventure Zone with us,

1212
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,880
are going to be on the JoCo Cruise this year.

1213
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,720
You can go to jococruise.com, J-O-C-O cruise.com.

1214
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,680
Check out that lineup.

1215
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,600
It's amazing and come hang out with everybody on a fun boat for a week.

1216
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,680
And also, what was the other thing I was going to say?

1217
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,960
Oh yeah, our Adventure Zone podcast, the D&D podcast where we play with our dad.

1218
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,720
One, we started a new arc that our dad is DMing where we play as superheroes and it is super fun.

1219
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,600
It's so much fun.

1220
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,720
Dad is doing a great job and we're really pleased with how it's going.

1221
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,240
In the second episode, we go to a rundown Bible themed theme park.

1222
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,920
It's so, so great and we're having so much fun and I bet you will too.

1223
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,560
And with the Adventure Zone, we have a graphic novel coming out

1224
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:10,640
and you can go to theadventurezonecomic.com and pre-order that now.

1225
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,920
It is the graphic novel adaptation of our first arc, Here There Be Gerblins.

1226
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,040
So go to theadventurezonecomic.com and pre-order yours now.

1227
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:21,760
Two more quick things.

1228
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,320
Thanks to Sean Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1229
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,480
It's a Departure off the album Painting the Days to Bed.

1230
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,760
It's a super, super good album that maybe it's getting a little bit colder.

1231
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,560
Maybe you're settling in for your own long winter and you want a good soundtrack for it.

1232
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,360
It is this.

1233
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,960
