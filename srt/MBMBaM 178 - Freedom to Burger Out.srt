1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:49,040
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,680
We are here. During the Thanksgiving holiday, we repurposed our program

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,720
to serve as basically just a turkey advice show. We work in conjunction with Butterball,

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,280
sort of their podcasting arm. Who fired their entire customer service department,

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
which I thought not only goes against the holiday spirit, it kind of goes against the

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
whole Butterball ethos. I'll say this, you know, as I was going through the questions,

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,240
you know what I wasn't expecting? What? So many questions about fucking the turkey.

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,440
Yeah. Yeah, a lot of those are people trying to get like a rise out of trying to like,

13
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,600
goof the goofsters. Yeah, but I would say that 10% of them were really graphically detailed.

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,920
Sure. Well, they were like, where do I put it in? And it's like, I don't know. How about the

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
giant cavity, you stupid idiot? Like you're clearly just fucking with us at this point.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,320
And the turkey. We've since we got laid off from Butterball, we have a lot of turkey advice build

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,080
up. Let's go around, introduce ourselves and just say how we cooked our turkeys this year.

18
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm the oldest brother on this program. This year I went

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,440
with a nice sun-dried turkey. It's a little dicey to get the procedure exactly right.

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,400
You got to leave it in the sun and then you'll wait.

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,960
For how long?

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
Enough. You'll know.

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,080
Until the little thing pops.

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,960
Until the little thing pops out. It usually takes about a day.

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,160
The belly button. A day is not nearly long enough.

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,560
You're not going to want to eat it. That's the other thing.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,640
My name is Travis McElroy. I'm the middle-est brother and I sat on it.

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,720
You incubated it.

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
I incubated it for 16 days.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
My name is Griffin McElroy.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
Also, that turkey ended up tasting of farts.

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,080
Yeah, I bet.

33
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
You just really wanted to say farts today.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,280
Farts, farts, farts.

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
You guys haven't heard because this is our third stab at trying to start the show,

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
but Travis has tried to incorporate farts into each attempt.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,160
Well, my offer, our intro should just be us farting into the microphones for three minutes.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,000
It's kind of a dry week, so that might impress upon the rest of the episode.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,720
My name is Griffin McElroy and I just tormented a live turkey for like a year.

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,320
I built a dungeon, a turkey dungeon.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,760
Then I would go in there every day around noon.

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
You got to have it be at a regular time so the turkey knows that it's coming.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,920
Then I just terrorized it.

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Then eventually it basted in its own terror and that is how you get a good brine on a turkey.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,440
You can really taste the begrudging acceptance that his

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,000
turkey wife has probably remarried and moved on with her life.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,800
That really comes through in the meat.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,920
And then I teach him to love me and then I get him to hunt, kill,

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
and cook other turkeys, Homeland, season four,

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
catch it on Blu-ray and DVD, get the full collection.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
Turkey Claire Danes is great.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
She is just all over the place.

53
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
Very dynamic performance.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
So wait, you're saying that.

55
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm saying I recreated Homeland season four

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,440
because there's no way they're going to make it there without my help.

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
Only it's all turkeys.

58
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,400
I found a turkey that looks a lot like Claire Danes.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
Found a turkey that looks a lot like Mandy Patinkin.

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,160
That was not as hard as you think it would be.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
And then I shoot the show in my backyard.

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
And the turkey is turned against, is weaponized against other turkeys.

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
He's an Uncle Tom, he's an Uncle Tom turkey.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,320
Can you not like, did you not follow along?

65
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,880
I know, I guess it is kind of a confusing show, but.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
When did you find time to eat?

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,760
I didn't, I guess.

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,840
That's the life of a big Hollywood producer, you know.

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,760
So you just blew right past Thanksgiving and the turkeys were spared

70
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,960
because of your involvement in their creative process?

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,920
Well, I mean, we got to take them at least to sweeps

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,960
and then we'll see if we can get like season five, season six.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,760
This is how this fucking business works, Travis.

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,920
Okay, you know, I'm new to it.

75
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,480
I didn't know there was so much starvation involved in turkey eating.

76
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
I've been looking at a lot of pictures of turkeys

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
in the build up to this bit, this classic, sure to be classic bit.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,160
And something occurred to me that distinguishes turkeys

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,520
is that they are the only animal that looks delicious in their natural form.

80
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,200
I don't think that's true at all.

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,480
Now, if you look at a picture of a turkey, right?

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,360
If you just say, I'm going to look at a turkey today

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,280
and then you go to like a Google image search and just search for turkey

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,560
and tell me if they don't look like they are just flaunting the meat.

85
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,240
I actually think they look like they have ball bag heads

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
with ball bags underneath their heads

87
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,040
and then their whole body is kind of a ball bag.

88
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,480
Kind of an overlapping series of scrote.

89
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,320
Some of the animals you have to work to imagine how you might eat them.

90
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
And I feel like the turkey really has it on display.

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Like, check it out.

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
You know where you're going to eat me.

93
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,400
But its head looks like a penis.

94
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,320
Obviously the head is like clearly labeled not for eating though.

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,040
This is what I'm saying.

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,840
It's convenient.

97
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,200
It's like a pull tab.

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,960
You know, like definitely don't eat this.

99
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,400
It's obvious you don't want to eat this.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
And the tail looks like a beautiful fan.

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,400
So you don't want to eat that, obvs.

102
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
But then the rest of it just looks delicious.

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
Like it's obviously you want to eat it.

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
I can't go here with you, Juice.

105
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Oh man, I love turkey.

106
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,760
How about a question?

107
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah, here's a question.

108
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,400
Turkey?

109
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,360
Okay, how about another one?

110
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
Now let me rephrase that as a question.

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,160
Turkey?

112
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Turkey?

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,960
Okay, that's better.

114
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
That's a little bit better.

115
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Um, hold on.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm just scrolling through all of the turkey questions.

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,000
And beating it to some that aren't.

118
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
No, I'm not, sir.

119
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,080
Sir.

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Gift giving season is here and in an effort to find some sweet deals,

121
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
I came across some good quality refurbished electronics.

122
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,360
Is it socially acceptable to give somebody a refurbished item

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
or would I be committing a social taboo of the highest order?

124
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
And that's from Joey.

125
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm huge into refurbished.

126
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,320
I think that's great because you're keeping something out of a landfill.

127
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,520
You know, you're not creating more waste.

128
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
Captain Planet.

129
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
I've been thinking about this question for a bit now.

130
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
And, um, as somebody who used to work at GameStop,

131
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,320
I actually am a lot more hesitant about this prospect

132
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,640
because I have some fucking horror stories that would turn your hair white.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,760
About refurbished electronics?

134
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,040
About refurbished electronics.

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,440
Do you know, let's play a quick guessing game.

136
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,720
Of all the PlayStation Portables, Sony's classic handheld gaming device

137
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
that were turned into our store for trade-in credit,

138
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
uh, how many were chock-loaded with the butt-slammin'-est porn

139
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
you've ever dreamt of?

140
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
Not enough.

141
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
Did you say a hundred percent?

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,760
Congratulations.

143
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,280
There were certain devices that was just like,

144
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
obviously anything with any sort of hard drive

145
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,920
that you can download multimedia content to,

146
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,960
that also had a screen on it,

147
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,720
which people turn it into like the PlayStation butt-slam.

148
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,560
Three thousand, I'm at it.

149
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,840
But, Griffin, so you're concerned,

150
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,800
because when you refurbish it, you also reformat it, right?

151
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
You're not handing it back to-

152
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,960
Yeah, but to reformat it, I had to press the button, right,

153
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
and scroll to the thing in the menu.

154
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
And guess what it always, like,

155
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,080
before I could get to that old user interface,

156
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,520
I saw a fucking butt with a man's like whole head in it, like-

157
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,560
So your concern would be that you would be re-gifting someone

158
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
a refurbished game console?

159
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
A refurbished device that at some point

160
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,640
someone had used to bait it?

161
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,560
Haunted by the ghost of baiting.

162
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
What if the sales associate had not been as diligent as I was?

163
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,040
Guys, like, there was this one time this dude came in,

164
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,720
and he handed in his PlayStation 4,

165
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,680
like, I'd like to trade this in.

166
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,520
I was like, I can't wait to see what's on this shit.

167
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,120
And he actually said, make sure you check out

168
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
some of the stuff I got on there.

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,520
I think you're really gonna like it.

170
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,720
He actually told me that.

171
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
And it was, like, it was just asses for days.

172
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,880
It was gigabytes upon gigabytes of gigabytes.

173
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
I wish I could have been in the car with somebody

174
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,960
who had just dropped off a porn-loaded PlayStation,

175
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,360
because they'd be having that discussion in their head, like,

176
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
no, I've formatted it, didn't I?

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,080
Better point is that they reach over

178
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
and they pick up the other PSP they have,

179
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
and they're like, wait, wait, wait,

180
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
none of my porn's on you.

181
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,920
Oh, no.

182
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
This is my Crash Bandicoot one.

183
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
Crash Bandicoot one.

184
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
I turned in the wrong one.

185
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
Damn it.

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,520
God damn it.

187
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,240
Travis stepped all over my funny bit.

188
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,200
Sorry, go ahead, Justin.

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,960
I'd been waiting to do this funny bit

190
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,520
while you guys talked about your stuff.

191
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
Do it.

192
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Travis stepped all over it.

193
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,120
He said, no, I've got a different bit I'm gonna do.

194
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
It was very rude.

195
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,360
Can you give me a basic rundown

196
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,960
of what your bit would have been?

197
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,160
You want me to recap my bit for you?

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
Well, now I feel bad, and I feel like I'll always wonder.

199
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
Last time, Justin's bit.

200
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
I feel bad, too,

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,040
because I feel like I contributed to the bit chomping,

202
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,200
and so I need to know if the guilt is justified,

203
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,560
if your bit was actually any good or not.

204
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,720
Okay, so basically what was gonna happen

205
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,320
was that the guy in the fictional car

206
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
was gonna be like, I must've deleted it,

207
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
and then he was gonna be like, oh, I'm sure I did,

208
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,080
and then he would slowly have the realization.

209
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,400
You know what the bit was about?

210
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,360
It was about human foibles.

211
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,520
It really would've cast a light, a very human light.

212
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,480
I think that's something everybody can relate to.

213
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,760
Travis is exonerated.

214
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,920
B, I feel like everybody sort of got

215
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,800
where the bit was going from the start of it.

216
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
That's the problem, though.

217
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,400
Why do you think we're so chock full of bits

218
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,860
that we can afford to just leapfrog bit to bit

219
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,560
and not just cling to every one for dear life?

220
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,620
This is episode 178 or something.

221
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,080
The listeners are super busy,

222
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,560
and if we can deliver unto them a bit in five seconds,

223
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,720
and then they can fill out the other solid 25 seconds

224
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,800
of material in their own minds

225
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,800
while we swing from vine to vine like joke Tarzan,

226
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,520
I don't think there's any problem with that.

227
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,640
Guys, guys.

228
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,480
Yeah.

229
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,840
Refurbish bits.

230
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,520
Okay.

231
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,640
This is how we keep it going for another 178 episodes.

232
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,400
So let's bring back, we can bring back Torcy.

233
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,120
We can bring back ghosts.

234
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,640
That's always a good refurbish bit.

235
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,420
Yeah, this is shit we already do, Travis.

236
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,880
This isn't like, oh, let's talk about ghosts and horses

237
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
a bunch, like that's it, that's our show.

238
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,720
We are doing that.

239
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,520
We've been refurbishing bits.

240
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,360
I see.

241
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,480
At least the dozens of episodes.

242
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
What about refurbish Furbies?

243
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,800
Refurbies.

244
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,840
Refurbies?

245
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,080
I don't have a rest of that.

246
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,320
I just think that that's a really funny word.

247
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,840
Do you guys know that Furbies

248
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,960
are still like regularly popping off?

249
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,400
And I feel like Furbies are only distinguished by their,

250
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
you remember there was that one Christmas

251
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,160
where forget about it.

252
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,000
Like you had to get it.

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,140
If you didn't have a Furby under the tree,

254
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,400
you should leave your parent card.

255
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,920
I got Harrow.

256
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
You got Harrow?

257
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,300
Was that?

258
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,920
Harrow was the off-brand Furby

259
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,120
for parents that maybe had kind of a tough year.

260
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
That was the tagline.

261
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800
Hey.

262
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,760
Did you have a tough year?

263
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,080
Because they understand.

264
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,960
No, it's okay.

265
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm good enough.

266
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,080
Yay.

267
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,360
This is what Harrow would say.

268
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,640
He would say things like he can't tell the difference.

269
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,560
Really, the other parents are just paying for a brand name.

270
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,440
Listen, I'm a smart boy.

271
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,480
Things like that just to make you like.

272
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,320
I remember that Harrow.

273
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,400
You named him Jim Belushi, didn't you?

274
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,720
I named him Jim Belushi,

275
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,760
and one day he disappeared.

276
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,120
Next thing I know, he's on TV.

277
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,120
He had his own show.

278
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,240
Or agents.

279
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,640
I was, of course, suggesting you named him

280
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,800
after the secondhand Belushi,

281
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,640
but you are instead suggesting

282
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,700
that you were gifted Jim Belushi, the actor,

283
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,200
and you gave him his start.

284
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,140
You have to be careful.

285
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,480
You can't get him wet.

286
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,080
You can't feed him after midnight,

287
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,920
or else he's gonna start his own shitty TV show.

288
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,200
That was definitely, definitely on Harrow's instruction.

289
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
For Christ's sake, don't let him near a harmonica.

290
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,360
That'll be your whole day.

291
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,920
How about a Yahoo Griffin?

292
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,740
Okay.

293
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,580
Oh.

294
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,260
Coffee break, okay?

295
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
This Yahoo is sent in by Ashley Burgart.

296
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,100
Thanks, Ashley.

297
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,180
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Big C, who asks,

298
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,660
should there be limits set

299
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,860
for how much can be ordered at fast food drive-throughs?

300
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,300
It seems like I am always getting behind some van

301
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,620
that is ordering like 10 combos.

302
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,120
I don't think this should be allowed.

303
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,980
People with huge orders should be denied

304
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,700
drive-through service and made to place orders inside.

305
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,100
It is unfair to those of us using the drive-through

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,940
for its intended purpose to get our food quickly.

307
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,860
I see a drive-through

308
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,460
as kind of like a supermarket express lane.

309
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,740
Order limits should be set

310
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,040
for it to keep its lines steady moving.

311
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,760
Sometimes I read questions on this show

312
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,060
just because they make a lot of fucking sense.

313
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,220
Yeah, this guy's got some fucking good ideas.

314
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,940
I don't, okay, I have a problem

315
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,060
with the premise of his question though,

316
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,060
because I don't think anyone is gonna go inside Arby's

317
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,620
because they wanna soak it in.

318
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,460
Oh, you could have just.

319
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,260
I have to prolong this experience.

320
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,060
In this day and age of drive-through convenience,

321
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,420
who eats in the restaurant?

322
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,820
Our local Arby's and Wendy's has a lot of seating in it,

323
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,380
and it is so confusing to me.

324
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,140
The idea that you would say,

325
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,460
I know where I wanna eat, inside Arby's.

326
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,020
I wanna go into Arby's and sit in there.

327
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,140
And listen, you can make the argument and say like,

328
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,860
well, maybe you have time to kill before a flight

329
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,940
or before you have to be somewhere

330
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,260
and you're not from around there.

331
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,060
Okay, great, get the food and go to a park.

332
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,420
Get the food and go literally anywhere else.

333
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,740
Shut your trash.

334
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,220
Go get your food and go to a park.

335
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,920
You'll be the guy eating Arby's in the park?

336
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,900
Yeah.

337
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,000
That's a good look.

338
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,840
A guy at Arby's has that.

339
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,280
Ooh, get your Arby's and go to a Wendy's.

340
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,280
When you go to Arby's, Arby's tagline is,

341
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,840
hey, you got five minutes?

342
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,380
Because you have five minutes

343
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,640
that you need to refill the old food tank

344
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,920
as fast as you possibly can

345
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,240
because you have plans in seven minutes.

346
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,980
Nobody goes to Arby's and is like,

347
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,600
what is the best possible venue

348
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,560
that I can eat this food in?

349
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,720
Can I get seconds on these onion dippers

350
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,200
because I am just enjoying the ambiance.

351
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,840
This is not a classism.

352
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,920
I'm not saying like.

353
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,200
We do seem to hate on Arby's a lot though.

354
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,040
No.

355
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,880
Have you guys noticed how it's always Arby's?

356
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
Is Arby's just the funniest?

357
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
I think Arby's is a funny name,

358
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,800
but also I'll go to an Arby's

359
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,040
so I don't feel bad about it.

360
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,520
I went to Arby's two days ago to get some grub.

361
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,480
I get it.

362
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
Good mood food.

363
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,480
Mighty Minis.

364
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,920
They're delicious and new.

365
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,760
But.

366
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,320
Tell me more.

367
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Okay, so they got two little things

368
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
and they're on Hawaiian buns

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,680
and they're two little sandwiches with roast beef

370
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,000
and they have crispy onions on them

371
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,220
and then some like a.

372
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,060
Ooh.

373
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,880
I don't know.

374
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,720
It's like a flavor sauce.

375
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,560
I really don't know what the sauce is.

376
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,380
So sort of like Slammers.

377
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,220
Slammers with roast beef.

378
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,380
They're like little Slammers.

379
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,220
Anyway.

380
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,040
But it's like a little.

381
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
What kind of meat?

382
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,960
Oh, roast beef.

383
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,780
Roasted beef.

384
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,620
You dumb fucking.

385
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,680
It's really hoping it's gonna be pulled pork

386
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,740
because I associate pulled pork with the Hawaiian rolls.

387
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,580
No, no, no.

388
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,600
It's a roasted beef.

389
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,400
Anyway, I just don't know.

390
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,240
If you have.

391
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,620
The only context I can see is

392
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,860
if you have kids and you're like,

393
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,260
I cannot be in a car with these children anymore.

394
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
Like I have to put them in a place

395
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,760
where I can get them out of my field of view.

396
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,600
I get that.

397
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,440
I understand that.

398
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,920
But if you're just by yourself,

399
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
you have to know how much you're gonna upset

400
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,800
other people who will see you.

401
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,640
What if I'm driving through the drive-thru

402
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,540
and I am driving past the window

403
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,760
and I see a man doing a Sudoku

404
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,080
and eating a Mighty Mini out of the corner of my eye

405
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,200
and we make eye contact.

406
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,760
That's my entire day.

407
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,600
You know, you're forgetting.

408
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I was thinking about that guy.

409
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,820
You're forgetting.

410
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,460
Some of these places have free wifi.

411
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,080
Whenever I drive past a McDonald's,

412
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,240
it is illuminated by so many MacBook Air screens

413
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,040
of people, you know, getting some files.

414
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,200
You're also forgetting McDonald's birthday parties.

415
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
That is true.

416
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,160
You play the game where you put the straw up to your nose

417
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,120
and you try and jump it and drop it in the cup.

418
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,400
You get in the plate place for a little while,

419
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
get a good static buildup.

420
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,440
Was it a common thing that the McDonald's birthday parties

421
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,520
making games out of like.

422
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,880
McDonald's shit.

423
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,800
Oh yeah, like Depression era children

424
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,840
at like fashion games out of whatever was available.

425
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,400
There was one where you had to stock,

426
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,000
stack as many Filet-O-Fish boxes on top.

427
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,840
I remember that.

428
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,660
We have video of that.

429
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,500
Sure.

430
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,680
I feel like that might not have been a McDonald's policy.

431
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,080
That might've just been dad being like,

432
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,560
well, this birthday's shitty.

433
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,320
All right, give me those Filet-O-Fish boxes.

434
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,100
Here's the game kids, stack them.

435
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

436
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,600
That was the best birthday that I've ever had in my life.

437
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,440
Man, there are some people in Yahoo Answers

438
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,120
that are just fucking furious about this idea.

439
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,480
What do they have to say?

440
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,280
No, lotto's.

441
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
This is a free country.

442
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
That would be taking away rights.

443
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,400
Oh my God.

444
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,220
What right?

445
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,480
Excuse me, pardon me.

446
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
What legal right does that take away?

447
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,220
Is that freedom of expression?

448
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,120
Is that right to bear arms?

449
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,440
Is that right to refuse army quarter?

450
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
Freedom to burger out.

451
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,800
That would be taking away rights.

452
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,960
I don't care if you're buying 1000 cheeseburgers.

453
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
You don't care?

454
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
You don't care if I buy 1000 cheeseburgers?

455
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,120
Let me read the source because the source is social studies.

456
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,940
What's up now?

457
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,280
This person talks a big game,

458
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,680
but I think if they were at Arby's,

459
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,180
they have five and a half minutes to get this shit

460
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,840
from pulling into the drive through

461
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,880
to consuming every last calorie.

462
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,320
And then someone in front of them is like,

463
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
hi, I need one, two, three, four, five,

464
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,240
1000 cheeseburgers, please.

465
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
And they're like, well, that's going to take us.

466
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,880
It's going to take us a couple of days.

467
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,520
Because we don't sell cheeseburgers.

468
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,120
Person behind was like, well, this isn't ideal,

469
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,840
but I don't want to infringe on this person's rights

470
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,100
because I learned not to in social studies.

471
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,640
Can I just say I have a bigger problem

472
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,740
when I'm in the fast food line

473
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,480
and it is not the size of the order,

474
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,040
but it's the time to take when they order the order.

475
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,640
I got stuck behind a woman at rallies,

476
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,040
which already I wasn't super proud of myself,

477
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,520
but she went through like 10 different items

478
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,240
asking what came on it and like wanting a breakdown

479
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,880
of the ingredient list and like the care

480
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,720
that would be taken creating the thing.

481
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,960
Where was this at?

482
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,880
At the rallies.

483
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
Well, rallies is just kind of an off brand.

484
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,400
It's not really one of the big three.

485
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
It's not the one you go to.

486
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
I imagine that this is probably this person's first time

487
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,080
at a rallies.

488
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,800
Maybe they've even been to a Checkers before

489
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,640
and they don't know about the regional differences.

490
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,680
There are a lot of questions.

491
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,160
Rallies is a fair place to inquire

492
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
about those kinds of things.

493
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,920
The hard thing is you might actually create a deficit

494
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,100
by buying a thousand cheeseburgers.

495
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,100
I went to Wendy's, this was three days ago I think,

496
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,460
and I was in line and when I got to the window,

497
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,600
the gentleman told me, we don't have any beef right now.

498
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,920
You have to pull up and wait a few minutes.

499
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,640
I was at Wendy's and they didn't have hamburgers ready.

500
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,520
From my reaction to this gentleman,

501
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,840
you would have thought that I was in Soviet Russia.

502
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,080
I could not believe that here in this great land,

503
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
I was being told I had to wait on a hamburger.

504
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,360
I get it if I'm getting chicken strips.

505
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,080
You may not have those handy.

506
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,560
I understand that.

507
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,240
I had a weird fast food experience

508
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,160
that I wanted to touch on.

509
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,640
Can I ask if it was funny at all

510
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
before we jump into it with both people?

511
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,240
It was more bewildering.

512
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,800
Well then it may be not right for the show.

513
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,200
But I would like to say it.

514
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,900
I've been trying to work through it.

515
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,560
You can say it, we'll try and find the humor.

516
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,880
Maybe it'll be like a little slice of life type of humor

517
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,360
like they do on Prairie Home Companion.

518
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,720
But I don't want you to just tell a story

519
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
because it's really not that kind of podcast.

520
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,960
I can do it really fast.

521
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Put it through your Dave Barry filter, Travis.

522
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,400
Take the slice of life moment

523
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
and then tell it as American humorist

524
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,280
and national treasure Dave Barry would tell it.

525
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,720
No, I pulled up to the Wendy's

526
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,160
and there was a dude standing next to the screen

527
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,160
where you order and he like knocked on my window

528
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,000
and I rolled it down.

529
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,820
He's like, what are you going to have?

530
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,600
And then he talked into his headset

531
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,480
and all I could think was,

532
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,600
oh, this is some kind of weird Wendy scam

533
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,840
where he's pretending he's going to take my money.

534
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,720
And he was like, okay, pull up to the window.

535
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,560
And then I got up to the screen.

536
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,400
He was working for bootleg Wendy.

537
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I guess I got to the screen

538
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
and realized I'd forgotten to order something.

539
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,980
And I was like, oh, this guy was talking

540
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,880
because the screen is broken.

541
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,720
And I rolled it down.

542
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
I was like, hey, could I also get some thing?

543
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,760
And the voice from the screen was like, yeah, sure.

544
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,680
And then I pulled around to the window.

545
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,140
Why was that guy there?

546
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,000
Was he a ghost maybe?

547
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,240
I don't know.

548
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,200
Did you imagine him

549
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,260
and you were actually talking to the screen the whole time?

550
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,300
Maybe it was Wendy's new hollow projector technology

551
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,920
and the man was a hologram like Wolf Blitzer.

552
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,680
Oh, maybe, you know, I didn't ask.

553
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,080
I guess that was my fault really

554
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,480
is I should have gotten up to the first window

555
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,160
and be like, hey, why is that dude there?

556
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,080
Well, you should have thrown like a fist full of coins

557
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,040
at him if they traveled right through his body,

558
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,920
then you're dealing with a...

559
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,960
Well, that's assuming it's soft light technology.

560
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,160
If it's hard light technology,

561
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,000
then they're still gonna strike off of him.

562
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,740
The only way you can know for sure

563
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,120
is that if they look like a famous person,

564
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,480
because you know that if Arby's has a hologram projection

565
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,840
outside taking orders from people,

566
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
why wouldn't you,

567
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,760
you gotta make him look like James Dean

568
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,400
or Elvis or something.

569
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,360
Or Dean Stockwell, how good would that be?

570
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,680
Oh my God, if he's putting your order into Ziggy.

571
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,960
Fuck, that would roll.

572
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
I don't know, I'm checking the numbers

573
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,600
and it looks like, yeah, 100% probability of diarrhea.

574
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,940
But I tried the new chicken go wrap.

575
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,120
I should have left.

576
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,040
You're gonna hope that your next leap

577
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,680
will be the leap to your bathroom.

578
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,880
Ziggy says you're gonna die

579
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,320
if you eat this combo meal, definitely.

580
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,880
Every day for the next 30 years.

581
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Definitely. Yes, you will, absolutely.

582
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,520
I was just wondering what it takes to become a mayor.

583
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,480
I have no political affiliations or any substantial income,

584
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,160
but I think I would be a good one.

585
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,760
What do you guys think is the best approach

586
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,200
to take to become a mayor?

587
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
Nay, a great mayor.

588
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,420
That's from Mayorally Musing in Nebraska.

589
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,960
I've seen a lot of stories lately about unlikely mayors.

590
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,800
Yeah, like the little kid mayor or a dog mayor.

591
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,700
The little kid mayor, the dog mayor.

592
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,160
I think you gotta have an angle.

593
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,520
Like why would you be mayor?

594
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,160
Superhero mayor. Superhero mayor.

595
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,720
Mayor by day, superhero by night.

596
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,080
John Mayer, people love that.

597
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,480
There's a town in New Hampshire,

598
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,680
I think, where a boat is a mayor.

599
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,800
They have a boat mayor. Seems convenient.

600
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,520
It's not like a play on words or anything.

601
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,740
Their mayor is a fucking boat.

602
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,660
They have a boat that has municipal power over the city.

603
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,200
What about a mer-mer?

604
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,260
That's right, a horse that's a mayor.

605
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,840
But here's the thing, you're not a horse.

606
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,200
That's problem one.

607
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,240
Ooh, what about a mirror mayor?

608
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,880
And you have a mirror and it says over,

609
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,480
like, look into the mirror to see the mayor of this town.

610
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,040
It's you. It's you.

611
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,160
It sounds like, it's like that Time Magazine cover.

612
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,020
It sounds like to me that you guys

613
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,280
just wanna think of fun wordplay.

614
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,360
Moore mayor and Jay Moore is the mayor.

615
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
What about a mayo mayor?

616
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,960
Uh-huh.

617
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,540
It's a jar of mayonnaise.

618
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,380
Sure.

619
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,840
I don't even know what a mayor does.

620
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,980
Nobody knows what a mayor does

621
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,740
because a mayor doesn't do any.

622
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,440
Oh, I think the soda's too big,

623
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,400
so let's go ahead and cut, no, shut up, no.

624
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,920
Maybe we, I'm passing a law, no more soda.

625
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,840
Like, you can't, you don't,

626
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,440
you have no legislative powers over any of us.

627
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
I think the mayor just appears at things, right?

628
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,080
I think it's entirely different.

629
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,640
Yeah, you make appearances.

630
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,640
I think mayor has the fourth estate.

631
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,560
What is the Tom Clancy shit?

632
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,720
Like, he has, he is not judicial, legislative,

633
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,860
or executive, he has powers elected to him,

634
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,960
given to him by the secret parts of the Constitution

635
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,600
that allow him to protect the other three branches

636
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,160
of government using any means necessary.

637
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,240
The fourth, so he's using the fourth freedom.

638
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,600
The fourth freedom is, that's right.

639
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,440
That's what you're talking about.

640
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,760
That's what third echelon has.

641
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,340
Freedom is, freedom of speech, freedom of dance,

642
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,960
freedom of movement.

643
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,280
Freedom to burger out.

644
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,120
Freedom to burger out is the fifth freedom.

645
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
The fourth freedom is, you can.

646
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,960
Fourth meal.

647
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,520
You can legally waterboard people if you're the mayor.

648
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,480
I think the main thing mayor does

649
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,760
is probably go places and get free shit.

650
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,280
Like in a small town, I imagine,

651
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,440
that's basically he's cruising up to the deli

652
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,920
and asking him to throw a few extra slices on.

653
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,900
He travels from deli to deli with his giant scissors

654
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,400
that he also uses to cut the ribbon on things.

655
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,000
He shakes hands with.

656
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,440
That's the first, okay, that's,

657
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,160
Travis, you've stumbled on step one unintentionally.

658
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,140
That step one, if you wanna be a mayor,

659
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,640
you have to invest in giant scissors.

660
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,840
No one's gonna take you seriously.

661
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,040
I would also suggest a golden shovel for groundbreakings.

662
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,520
If you have those already,

663
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,320
that was actually, in my failed campaign for mayor,

664
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,120
that was my slogan, my campaign slogan was,

665
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,800
hey, I already have the shovel.

666
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,000
And it was a picture of me holding a shovel.

667
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,640
Explain to me why you deserve our votes.

668
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,840
You can just keep that shovel money right in your pocket.

669
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,400
It also helps, oh, you gotta walk around

670
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
with a push broom and say, I'm gonna clean up this town.

671
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,200
Don't do what I did, which was have a poster

672
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
with me in the broom and under it just says,

673
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,800
sweep it up.

674
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,040
Say, this is a real broom,

675
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,120
but it was just you holding your palm out flat

676
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,040
and somebody photoshopped a broom on top of it.

677
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,520
But the broom was a clip art broom

678
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,360
and it was way too small.

679
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,840
Then he just switched it out and changed his tagline to,

680
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,400
he knows how to use Photoshop.

681
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,760
He knows what brooms look like.

682
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,680
He knows how to find clip art.

683
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,960
I'm gonna Photoshop all kinds of business into this town.

684
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,840
I just don't, everyone's so upset about Rob Ford

685
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,560
doing all, getting on all of these shenanigans.

686
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,440
And it's like, he's the town clown.

687
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,280
It's not like the president is doing crack.

688
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,200
Nobody knows what this dude does.

689
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,920
Nobody knows what his job is.

690
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,200
Nobody knows where Toronto is.

691
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,180
I think it's up.

692
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,520
Yeah, it's definitely up.

693
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
We can't help this person at all.

694
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,660
How do you become a mayor?

695
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,600
It's an elected position, that much I do know.

696
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,280
I think it helps.

697
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,160
You gotta get signatures first.

698
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,000
Signatures?

699
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,840
Yeah, I mean, you need a hundred signatures.

700
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,520
I think in Nebraska,

701
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,500
as long as you're outside of one of the major cities,

702
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,400
I think you probably have a pretty good shot.

703
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,560
Do you have a shovel?

704
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,280
I think it helps if you were a mayor in school

705
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,040
and then you can carry that over

706
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,520
and then maybe get like be an apprentice mayor.

707
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,840
Are you talking about like current mayor?

708
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,760
In student council,

709
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,720
are you talking about you majored in mayor?

710
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,080
I mean, student council preferably,

711
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,160
but you wanna have the practical experience,

712
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,680
you could have a paper that says you're a mayor,

713
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,480
but you wanna have some credits to your name.

714
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,200
Something that says like, I mayored the lunchroom.

715
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,260
I mayored at the library for a while.

716
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,960
I don't think you know what the word means.

717
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,800
I don't think any of us know.

718
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,760
You have to mayor before you can mayor.

719
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,600
You know what I mean?

720
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,040
It's one of those things because they want someone

721
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,120
with experience, but how do you get the job

722
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,480
to get the experience?

723
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,960
Can you shadow the current mayor?

724
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,560
Could you stalk the current mayor?

725
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,100
Oh, fun.

726
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,440
You could become the mayor.

727
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,360
Ooh, okay.

728
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,400
Plastic surgery, become the mayor,

729
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,880
just silently take over like in Dave.

730
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,460
You gotta Dave the mayor.

731
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,400
It's been a long time since I saw Dave,

732
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,000
but I think that's what happens.

733
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,500
There was an 11 year old mayor in Texas.

734
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,920
Yeah, that's how we do.

735
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Our fucking shit is so free.

736
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,640
We will do shit to just make sure everyone knows

737
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,480
how free we are down here.

738
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,520
We got an armadillo mayor.

739
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,320
Fuck you, fuck your rules.

740
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,200
We don't need them.

741
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
We're basically a big state full of pirates.

742
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,640
He actually, he was in an unincorporated community

743
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,640
and his one platform was that he was gonna get them

744
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,080
incorporated and the problem was that making them

745
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,420
an incorporated community, there are laws that said

746
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,960
he would have to be 18 years old,

747
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,720
so he would put himself out of a job.

748
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,800
It was sacrificing his own mayorship.

749
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,360
Isn't that a beautiful, beautiful story?

750
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,000
And that got him the job.

751
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,880
That got him the job because he was gonna sacrifice himself.

752
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,680
You think they were just waiting until he turns 18

753
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,880
and then they get him back up in office?

754
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,700
I don't know, this is a long time ago.

755
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,840
There was a movie.

756
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,960
And his name was Barack Obama.

757
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,800
Barack Hussein Obama.

758
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,760
Look at him now.

759
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,600
Look at him now.

760
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,480
And now you know the rest of the story.

761
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,300
That is why Barack Obama has carried Texas

762
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,720
with such a wide margin of votes

763
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,860
in both presidential elections.

764
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,940
And that's why when he retired,

765
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,160
when he is kicked out of office in 2016 or earlier,

766
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,160
God willing, Benghazi, then he's gonna come back to Texas

767
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,520
and he's gonna be the governor here

768
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
because we just can't get enough

769
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,840
of that guy's fucking flavor.

770
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,360
We just cannot get enough of his freedoms.

771
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,600
Can you step back?

772
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,720
We love his Obamacare.

773
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,960
They always make jokes on West Wing

774
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,800
that when you're president,

775
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,260
it's like the last job you'll ever have.

776
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,600
Can you be president and then go be governor of somewhere

777
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,400
and then be mayor of somewhere

778
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,840
and then be on city council?

779
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,340
And then work your way back up?

780
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,760
And then you die as the treasurer

781
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,200
of some student council somewhere?

782
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,040
Is that what you're saying?

783
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,360
I'm just saying, what's the life cycle after presidency?

784
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,440
I think you just lamp.

785
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,440
And I think you just talk at schools about abstinence.

786
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,240
You can finally tell everybody what you think of them.

787
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,560
Oh.

788
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,000
God, how loose cannon would I?

789
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,560
I don't understand why presidents, former presidents,

790
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
aren't going full loose cannon.

791
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,240
The only thing that keeps me from going full loose cannon

792
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,080
right now in my day to day is the possibility

793
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,560
that here in about seven years,

794
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm gonna be the president.

795
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,100
And I cannot have my campaign sullied

796
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,440
by the actions of my youth.

797
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,240
But if I had already been president at this point.

798
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,200
What are they gonna stop you from doing?

799
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,980
You can't take that away from me.

800
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,480
Try to take me off the nickel.

801
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,320
You can't.

802
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,640
Try to put me on the dime.

803
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
There's somebody else there.

804
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,120
I'll stand in the background.

805
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,560
I'm not even worried about it.

806
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Loose cannon.

807
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,480
Hey, you gonna spin me?

808
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,540
Don't look at him, look at me.

809
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,040
Don't look at him, look at me.

810
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,780
Look over here.

811
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,920
I'm in the corner.

812
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,120
If you want to check out the spider on the one,

813
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,220
check it out.

814
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,060
There's a pyramid there.

815
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,880
I built that.

816
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
Really close in.

817
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,560
Look at it.

818
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,720
The spider's got Justin's face on it.

819
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,840
You don't give a fuck.

820
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,800
Look at the top of the pyramid.

821
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,640
There's an eye there.

822
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,920
It's my eye.

823
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,080
It's always been.

824
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,920
Let's get a money zone.

825
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,760
Let's give you money.

826
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I got a message.

827
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,400
Got a message for Eric,

828
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,160
but that's not the important thing.

829
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,080
The more important thing is that this message

830
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,500
is as near as I can tell from the sheet from Nas.

831
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,680
So Nas in this case is spelled N-A-Z,

832
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,680
which is not the traditionally accepted spelling of Nas,

833
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
the rapper, which is N-A-S.

834
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,500
Correct.

835
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,400
Well, you didn't have to tell him that.

836
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,160
I just thought it was important

837
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
that people know that it's.

838
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,320
To be friend, he's Nas to the public,

839
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,840
but he's Nas to his friends.

840
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,680
He's not.

841
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,480
Okay, so Nas the rapper writes,

842
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,280
Eric is my very best bud.

843
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,160
He introduced me to my bim bam

844
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,740
and listening to the show together

845
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,400
is one of our favorite things to do.

846
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,480
Happy birthday, friend.

847
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,080
You're the best and I love you.

848
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,760
And I'm definitely the rapper.

849
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm definitely the rapper, Nas.

850
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,120
You know, this is an angle on Jumbotron announcements

851
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,960
that we never thought of.

852
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,840
You could assign a celebrity to wish you

853
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
a very special greeting.

854
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,680
Think about it.

855
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,480
This message is for Eric and it's from Tom Hanks.

856
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,560
And he says, I never would have gotten into acting

857
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,040
if it weren't for you.

858
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,480
You're the best.

859
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,400
I based my character and big on you.

860
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,160
Because of what happened to you when you were a child.

861
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,080
When you were cursed by a fortune teller machine

862
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,180
and then you fucked some lady

863
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,720
that was like 20 years older than you

864
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,760
and she is technically wanted for statutory.

865
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,160
Life sure is hard.

866
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,040
Love you lots, best bud, Tom Hanks.

867
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,960
Tommy Hanks.

868
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,240
Tommy Salami to his friends.

869
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,360
Please don't tell everyone that my true name

870
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,800
is Tommy Salami and that I changed it

871
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,100
when I moved to Hollywood.

872
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,760
Hollywood sure did change Tommy Salami.

873
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
That guy used to be cool.

874
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,480
They accidentally put out a draft

875
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,160
of that new Walt Disney, Mary Poppins movie.

876
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,000
They, the first trailer they sent out

877
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,580
credited him as Tommy Salami

878
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,540
and they had to recall the old celluloid on that bad boy.

879
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,380
Yeah.

880
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,800
Got another message from Michelle.

881
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,920
Who's it from Griffin?

882
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,960
It's from Maureen, Aaron, Mark, Rhea,

883
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,880
Murder and Sweet Baby, her two kids.

884
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Basically the entire cast of Rent.

885
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,040
Okay.

886
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,280
Happy birthday, Michelle.

887
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,160
Okay.

888
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,320
You go ahead, go for it.

889
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay, but don't like ask me to read something

890
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,760
and then like chomp it.

891
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,560
A lot of bit chomping this episode.

892
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,900
A lot of chomping this episode.

893
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,760
Happy 30th birthday, fucking goddammit.

894
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,640
Happy 30th birthday, Michelle.

895
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,280
We know how much you love my bim bam

896
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,120
so we joined forces to wish you the best birthday ever.

897
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,040
May it be filled with friends, wine, fleetwood, mac,

898
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,160
dancing, more friends, and kale.

899
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,540
You're the tortilla that covers

900
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,540
our Santa Barbara love burrito.

901
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,260
Let's stay weird and friends forever.

902
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,840
Beautiful.

903
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,080
You really had me tilt kale.

904
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,640
You had me tilt love burrito.

905
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,480
Yuck, yuck, yuck-a-duck.

906
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,520
I gotta wash that memory away

907
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,800
and the only way I can do it is with stack soap.

908
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,040
Stack soap is a beautiful, unconventional product

909
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,740
that is a soap with a divot.

910
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,200
So when you get down to the stupid sliver,

911
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,740
you jam the sliver into the divot

912
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,800
and oh my god, eternal soap.

913
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,440
Do not prematurely slam the divot.

914
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,280
Don't slam the divot before the time.

915
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
Because we tried to do that with our stack soap

916
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,780
and Teresa was like, well our soap doesn't fit

917
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,960
but we had not been patient and we had not waited.

918
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,360
Sometimes you get too excited about that momentous time.

919
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,280
We tried to slam the divot.

920
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,520
I've been rocking the same bar for like a year now.

921
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,280
Just keep, I just keep slamming that divot

922
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,520
and like I get so excited to just slam it.

923
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,640
I take it with me everywhere I go.

924
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,660
Camping, spaceship.

925
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,600
Time.

926
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,440
Camping, spaceship.

927
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Time travel.

928
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,940
Can you even imagine if I took this shit

929
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,300
back to colonial days and was like,

930
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,800
check out this stack soap, colonial fucks.

931
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
And they were like, oh goodness.

932
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,080
Because that's how they talked.

933
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,640
And then you check your book and it's like,

934
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,840
oh and now I'm gonna blot out the sun with my power

935
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,480
but you didn't because it was just an eclipse.

936
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
But you read it wrong so there's not an eclipse.

937
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,240
So they just think you're a liar.

938
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,480
And then they burn you to death and keep your soap.

939
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Burn you to death and keep your peppermint,

940
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,200
jasmine, and unscented soap.

941
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,560
There's three different varieties now.

942
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,960
You can get them on Amazon but go to, do me a favor.

943
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,120
If you're in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, DC,

944
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,960
South New Jersey, Virginia, or Kentucky,

945
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,240
go to Whole Foods, buy them there

946
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,800
so more Whole Foods will carry them.

947
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,720
And just buy that.

948
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,560
Don't buy anything else.

949
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,880
Don't buy anything else

950
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
because they know they track everything.

951
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,520
Buy it at Whole Foods, get it as a gift,

952
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,160
and go to stacksoap.com to get more information about it.

953
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,720
Speaking of foods, man,

954
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,920
I got a deep hunger in my belly.

955
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,560
I finished all the Thanksgiving leftovers.

956
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,520
I ate it for like six meals in a row.

957
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,260
I'm like half turkey fat now.

958
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,000
I wish I had something I could put in my bell bell.

959
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,040
Well, I got great news for you, Griffin.

960
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,420
Nature box. Okay.

961
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,060
Nature box.

962
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,620
Have you heard about it?

963
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,340
I've heard of nature and I know like what boxes are.

964
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,140
So I'm imagining just like you put some bushes

965
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,340
and dirt in a box.

966
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,780
Yep.

967
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,020
No, you're so wrong.

968
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,860
Shit.

969
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,300
Do you like bush boxes?

970
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,480
Is that like an old porn vagina?

971
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,180
What are you talking about?

972
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,540
The nature box is a collection of healthy snacks

973
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,100
sent to you every month and they're not bad,

974
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,220
they're delicious, but they are healthy.

975
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,680
We can get like dark cocoa almonds, those are very good.

976
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,740
Salted caramel pretzel pops, delicious.

977
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,580
French toast granola.

978
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,980
Listen, I put it to you this way.

979
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,480
You know when you can go to a vending machine

980
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,100
and you want to eat the healthy option,

981
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,640
so you're like, oh, that nut granola bar thing

982
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,700
that's coated in sugar and it's all like this process

983
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,340
to gross food, but you're trying to trick yourself

984
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,780
into thinking that's the healthy option?

985
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,660
Those are Skittles.

986
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,440
You accidentally bought Skittles.

987
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,360
This is the real option.

988
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,800
This is the thing that's gonna get to you

989
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,260
and you're gonna be amazed by both how delicious it is

990
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,100
and it's good for you.

991
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,780
Like what more do you want than that?

992
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,860
I can't imagine.

993
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,040
And you're gonna be able to,

994
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,820
we're gonna get you a little discount here.

995
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,800
It's no big deal.

996
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,960
Don't tell anybody.

997
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,440
Tell everybody.

998
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,300
But make sure they use this coupon code.

999
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,120
That's the thing.

1000
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,780
If you want to tell everybody,

1001
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,620
you're gonna get your first order in nature box 50% off.

00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,280
Just use the coupon code MYBROTHER.

1003
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,720
It's all one word.

1004
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,620
You're gonna get it ship free to you.

1005
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,540
Nothing artificial, nothing weird,

1006
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,740
but you are gonna get it a little cheaper, 50% off.

1007
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,180
And it's gonna cover all your tastes.

00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,300
You want savory, you want salty, you want sweet.

1009
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,120
It's all there.

1010
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,460
You want umami?

1011
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,940
Ooh, umami, do you?

1012
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,460
I don't think that's a thing, but.

1013
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,500
Umami, it's yeah, it's the hidden flavor.

1014
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,340
It's the fourth.

1015
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,120
No, I don't think umami do you.

1016
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,260
It's the fourth estate of flavors.

1017
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,380
It's the flavor that protects the other flavors

1018
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,300
and it can do whatever it needs to to do it,

1019
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,980
including waterboarding.

1020
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,100
Alton Brown invented it.

1021
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,620
Alton Brown invented it.

1022
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,200
Cause um, it's just the best.

1023
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,780
So naturebox.com, go get it, eat it, live.

1024
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,140
Pretty good tagline for them if they need one.

1025
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,500
Get it, eat it, live.

1026
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,060
Alive.

1027
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,020
Hey, I'm Jesse Thorn.

1028
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,180
Hey, I'm Jordan Morris.

1029
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,100
We're actual friends.

1030
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,420
And actual professional broadcasters.

1031
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,540
We host Jordan, Jesse Go!

1032
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,820
A show about, you know, friendship, being a person.

1033
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,020
Yeah, we run the full spectrum from feelings

1034
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,340
to some of the most vulgar jokes you can imagine.

1035
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,180
And honestly, putting it that way

1036
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,760
makes it seem like it's half and a half,

1037
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,660
at best 25, 75.

1038
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,500
It's definitely mostly vulgarity,

1039
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,340
but it's a pleasant, friendly vulgarity

1040
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,740
from two guys who went to a reasonably

1041
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,980
prestigious UC college.

1042
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,360
Why don't you try the show out now?

00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,660
Or somebody awesome that maybe you haven't heard of yet.

1046

Justin, oh my God, introduce Farm Wisdom.

1049
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

1050
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,860
Grow some corn and watch some porn.

1051
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,700
No, why would you?

1052
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,460
Nailed it, nailed it.

1053
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,300
That's gross.

1054
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,940
You really touched on the too hot topic

1055
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,780
that farmers are worried about today.

1056
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,020
What should they grow,

1057
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,420
and then what should they do with their free time?

1058
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,360
We got it covered.

1059
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,380
Do you guys think there's farmer porn?

1060
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,500
Do you think that there's a set of specific things

1061
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,740
that only, like a good mulch,

1062
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,620
that farmers just can't get it going

1063
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,720
unless they experience that in their porn?

1064
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,560
Definitely.

1065
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,420
You think that farmer porn has to have mulch?

1066
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,780
I'm saying that there, that's a-

1067
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,700
I think regular porn has to have mulch,

1068
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,560
but that's just me.

1069
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm a man of very exotic tastes.

1070
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,440
I think that farmer porn has to incorporate

1071
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,140
some sort of element about topsoil erosion,

1072
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,940
about the water table.

1073
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,340
I think that like, they have to set that up.

1074
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,380
Like, you know how some porn has like a fiction to it,

1075
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,220
they have to set that up.

1076
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,180
Like, hey, I lost my phone when I was over here

1077
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,020
for the party.

1078
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,180
Come in, cool.

1079
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,220
Yeah, hey, can you tell me about the water table

1080
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,620
here at your place?

1081
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,720
And she's like, oh yeah, it's,

1082
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,020
we're looking at a pH balance of about four,

1083
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,460
which makes it good for, you know,

1084
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,860
more acidic things like peaches.

1085
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,660
Wouldn't mind, I'd like to see your peaches.

1086
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,940
Yeah, they're great.

1087
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,420
We have this new mulch,

1088
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,580
and they're growing really nice and plump.

1089
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,260
All right, well, thanks, bye.

1090
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,100
And then he leaves.

1091
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,940
And then he leaves.

1092
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,760
And then he leaves.

1093
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,600
And then he leaves.

1094
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,440
And then he leaves.

1095
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,260
And then he leaves.

1096
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,100
And then he leaves.

1097
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,940
And then he leaves.

1098
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,920
And then he's ready.

1099
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,820
I bought a book to learn how to raise goats

1100
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,980
to make artisan goat cheeses,

1101
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,040
and was shocked to find that when baby goats' kids

1102
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,820
are delivered breach, they sometimes look dead.

1103
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,660
They aren't.

1104
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,740
In order to, quote, wake the goats up, end quote,

1105
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,280
the farmers must grab the kid by its neck and feet

1106
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,740
and swing a big U shape several times

1107
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,860
to clear the amniotic fluid out of its nose and lungs.

1108
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,020
Gross, right?

1109
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,300
That's from Tiffany.

1110
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,180
I mean, that's how humans.

1111
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,080
They have to do that to human babies, too, I think, right?

1112
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,400
How else are they gonna start breathing?

1113
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,280
Don't you think that that's like 50-50,

1114
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,840
like that's what you have to do,

1115
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
and also it's probably pretty fun for the farmer?

1116
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,720
Probably pretty fun to do it, yeah.

1117
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,280
The farmer's like, ooh, breach!

1118
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,200
Whip, boop, boom, go dance!

1119
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,000
Pretend to do like a quick little Fred Astaire cane wobble.

1120
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,760
My father, who is a soybean and corn farmer in Illinois,

1121
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,780
told me and my sister,

1122
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,440
if you see a dead snake in the road,

1123
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,760
in three days you'll have rain.

1124
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,080
And if it rains in January, you'll have frost in May.

1125
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,000
That's science, it's from Cindy.

1126
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,600
It's not science though, Cindy.

1127
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,440
Cindy, I hate to break.

1128
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,080
The thing is, I feel like you could do correlation science

1129
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,580
with like the rain in January, frost in May,

1130
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,480
but what connection could a dead snake

1131
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,280
possibly have to rain?

1132
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,440
If I start killing snakes, can I summon the right,

1133
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,260
like what are the rules to this science?

1134
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,160
I bet your dad is trying to fib you out on that.

1135
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,760
I bet it starts raining two days after,

1136
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,760
and he's like, well, if you think about it,

1137
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,220
I guess if you count from hours,

1138
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,720
it's really three days.

1139
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,640
If you count the first day as a day,

1140
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,680
you can pretty much justify anytime you see a dead snake,

1141
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
it's probably three days.

1142
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,720
And are we talking about like the first person

1143
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,560
that sees a snake?

1144
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,200
Like if you see the snake and it starts raining one day,

1145
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,280
can you just assume that someone saw that dead snake

1146
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,960
two days before you did?

1147
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,620
Oh, good question, because if you see it

1148
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,540
and then your friend sees it the next day,

1149
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,080
who's right and who's wrong?

1150
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,920
People will just keep seeing this fucking snake

1151
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,960
over and over and over again.

1152
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,320
You could have like a perpetual drought.

1153
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,140
That's why I should say,

1154
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,600
if you see a dead snake in the road and then eat it,

1155
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,120
it will rain in three days.

1156
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,160
If a snake sees it's raining,

1157
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,400
does it call its parents right away?

1158
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,720
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1159
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,140
Has anyone heard from Jimmy?

1160
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,120
It's been like three days.

1161
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,200
Oh, fuck, Jimmy, no.

1162
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,040
No.

1163
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,640
I can't believe we don't have any subway hacks.

1164
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,480
I know.

1165
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,240
We did get one where someone was worried

1166
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,080
that the other way around,

1167
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,680
that if you subway hacked the subway artist,

1168
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,900
they would not give you enough condiments.

1169
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,520
I felt it was a very scary world

1170
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,120
in which the subway artist would be able

1171
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,000
to revenge himself upon us.

1172
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,920
Oh, vindictive.

1173
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,360
He knows he got snowed,

1174
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,280
so he's gonna try to take away your mustard?

1175
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,120
We got a subway hack from somebody claiming

1176
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,680
you can get a subway sandwich with every topping,

1177
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,360
including all toppings, for around $18.

1178
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,360
For some reason, it really upset the artist

1179
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,160
to get it on flatbread.

1180
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,760
Oh, man, that sucks.

1181
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,300
Let me get a turkey, ham, Swiss, pizza sauce,

1182
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,120
avocado, chicken, bacon, ranch.

1183
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,360
Of course I want it toasted,

1184
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,980
and I want it toasted after everything's been put on it.

1185
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,820
You can do that,

1186
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,800
but you'd legally have to eat it in front of them.

1187
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,880
God, now I'm really hungry.

1188
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,680
Like the fucking kid in the chocolate cake from Matilda.

1189
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,840
People in the subway start cheering you on.

1190
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,340
Should you thank a waiter every time they pour you water?

1191
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,520
Yes.

1192
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,400
Thanking them every time feels weird,

1193
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,000
but so does ignoring them.

1194
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,360
Thank them every time.

1195
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,540
You thank them every time.

1196
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,680
That's an easy one.

1197
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,000
Let me throw this out.

1198
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,840
Okay.

1199
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,200
You do a thanking of diminishing returns.

1200
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,040
Thanks!

1201
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,580
The first time, you're like, oh, thank you.

1202
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,040
The second time, you're like, oh, thank you.

1203
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,880
Thanks.

1204
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,920
The third time, you're like, well, thanks.

1205
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,360
And then by the end, you're just like,

1206
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,200
fuck you.

1207
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,600
Thank you, thank you.

1208
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,840
Thank you.

1209
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,680
It has to go back to the-

1210
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,520
You just look at them and nod.

1211
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,920
Goes back to the other side.

1212
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
God damn it.

1213
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,560
Enough, enough.

1214
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,800
That's plenty.

1215
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,160
I'm peeing like a madman over here.

1216
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,360
You guys wanna get a who?

1217
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,840
Please.

1218
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,520
It's Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Eubank.

1219
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,360
Thanks, Ashley.

1220
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,540
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jordan, who asks,

1221
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,680
why do I look bad in pictures, but good in a mirror?

1222
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,280
I look horrible in picture, but good in a mirror.

1223
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,600
I heard if you look into a mirror

1224
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,900
and then you hold up a small mirror

1225
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,660
and look at yourself by projecting the mirror image

1226
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,980
onto the small mirror,

1227
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,880
that is what you look like to other people, is this true?

1228
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,120
What?

1229
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,940
Wait, hold on.

1230
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,780
It took a weird turn,

1231
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,320
because I was about to be like, okay, yeah, I get it.

1232
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,440
What?

1233
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,280
What?

1234
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,120
They have a point,

1235
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,920
when you look in your mirror image, right?

1236
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,040
They talked about this on Radio Lab.

1237
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,880
If you look at the mirror image,

1238
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,880
that's not what other people see.

1239
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,260
They see the opposite of that.

1240
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,000
You are seeing all of your features reflected, but backwards.

1241
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,520
How do you look into the mirror

1242
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,200
and the other mirror at the same time

1243
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,720
with your reflection in it?

1244
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,280
You hold up a mirror and your face to the mirror

1245
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,720
and you look at your face in the second mirror

1246
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,320
that you're holding up to the first mirror.

1247
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,640
That's easy peasy.

1248
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,400
Wait, so you're looking in mirror A

1249
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,480
and seeing the reflection from mirror B

1250
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,000
of the reflection in mirror A?

1251
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,120
Yeah, this isn't that hard.

1252
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,960
I do not understand

1253
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,240
why you're having so much trouble with this.

1254
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,140
And if a sunbeam hits mirror A,

1255
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,960
you will burn your face off.

1256
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,800
Okay.

1257
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,380
You will lose your eyesight.

1258
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,600
But in that circumstance,

1259
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,160
if you're looking at A to see B and A,

1260
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,100
aren't you not seeing,

1261
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,920
you're seeing a double, triple,

1262
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,520
wait, the triple reflection.

1263
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,800
I'm so confused.

1264
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,280
What you have to do is rip your own eyeballs

1265
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,120
out of your head.

1266
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:01,960
Okay.

1267
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,780
Now, again, you're not-

1268
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,620
You didn't say that.

1269
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,460
I didn't have all of the details.

1270
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,240
You are not gonna get the full picture of it,

1271
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,120
because again, you will be missing eyeballs.

1272
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,520
And that is a pretty important part of the face.

1273
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,800
I think with the mirror,

1274
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,360
I think if I were to guess at an actual answer here,

1275
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,000
I think the difference between mirror and photographs

1276
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,960
is that even if it just takes a moment,

1277
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,060
when you're in a mirror,

1278
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,720
you can adjust your angles and your facial expression.

1279
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,240
So you can kind of see,

1280
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,400
you can adjust and tweak the look.

1281
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,980
But I think in a camera,

1282
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,560
you're just kind of throwing caution to the wind

1283
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,880
and hoping that it's a great angle.

1284
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,160
I actually, I think it has more

1285
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,760
of a psychological factor to it,

1286
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,600
where I think you can look in the mirror

1287
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,160
and know that that is ever changing.

1288
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
And maybe you've got a bad hair day that day,

1289
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,400
but you're able to subconsciously forgive it

1290
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,360
because it looked really good the day before.

1291
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,460
But when you look at a picture,

1292
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,960
you know that that's locked in time forever.

1293
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,460
It's always gonna look like that.

1294
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,920
So you're way more judgmental.

1295
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,760
Oh my God.

1296
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,840
So you're saying like the permanence of a photograph

1297
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,940
is what makes it look worse?

1298
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,780
Yeah.

1299
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,000
This is why Facebook needs an option

1300
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,600
where like if you get tagged in something,

1301
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,440
you have the option to delete it.

1302
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,600
Or just a text only Facebook.

1303
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,040
How great would that be?

1304
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,940
I guess it would have to be called something else

1305
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,800
at that point.

1306
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,580
Or you could do like an ASCII interpretation of your face.

1307
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,420
You know what I mean?

1308
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,720
Like maybe an emoticon that you think looks a lot like you.

1309
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,420
For me, like 8D because I'm always got those big eyes.

1310
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,220
I always got a big smile on my face.

1311
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,060
And people were just like,

1312
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,600
no, like when they see an 8D,

1313
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,720
then it's me.

1314
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,140
And sometimes I'll try to put like an M dash

1315
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,460
in the middle of it to like signify my nose,

1316
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,520
but now it looks like a dick.

1317
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,360
Oops.

1318
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,680
Oops, that's not what my face looks like.

1319
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,640
I don't think, I hope not.

1320
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't think you have dick face personally,

1321
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,820
but I'm your brother.

1322
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,960
I'm blinded by my love for you.

1323
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,180
Can I just throw this out?

1324
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,320
Facebook sometimes really embarrasses me

1325
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,440
because sometimes if I'm yelling at someone

1326
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,920
in a post or something,

1327
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,300
and I am breaking down reasons why I'm mad at them

1328
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,720
and I say option A parentheses,

1329
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,200
you know, to like separate that out.

1330
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,400
And then I put option B parentheses.

1331
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,720
It just instantly turns that into a smiley face

1332
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,740
with sunglasses, which really cheapens my argument.

1333
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,580
Yeah.

1334
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,280
It's like you're saying,

1335
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,320
hey, because you ruined my wedding and hey.

1336
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,160
And what's up?

1337
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,320
And here's something a cool guy would say.

1338
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:31,320
Imagine this in my cool guy voice.

1339
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,500
You stole my wife.

1340
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,880
Hey.

1341
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,620
Question.

1342
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,460
Hit me.

1343
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,360
No, you do it.

1344
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,760
I thought you had one.

1345
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,360
Read the one about bladder shy.

1346
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,360
I'm, it's gonna be hard because I really have to pee.

1347
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,080
I'm extremely bladder shy.

1348
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,080
I'm only comfortable going at home.

1349
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,520
I can go in public restrooms if no one is in there,

1350
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,120
but if anyone is in the bathroom,

1351
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,640
I can't even go in the stalls.

1352
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,200
This is especially a problem at large public events

1353
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,000
like sporting events or concerts.

1354
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,400
Is there a way to get over this problem

1355
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,720
or at least lessen its effects?

1356
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,200
That's from Sam Crossfire Quave.

1357
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,400
Let me tell you, I used to have the same problem.

1358
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Not so much with the stalls thing.

1359
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,140
That's fucking crazy.

1360
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,840
But in the urinals, definitely.

1361
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,600
If there's other people in there, no thanks.

1362
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,560
To the extent that like if I'm going in a urinal

1363
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,320
in a restroom where nobody else is,

1364
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,400
and then I hear somebody like walk up to the door,

1365
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,960
my penis is like, and shuts down.

1366
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,040
Powering the energon slow.

1367
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,800
My penis is a transformer.

1368
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,840
And what got me over this is at some point in my life,

1369
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,480
I became, I'll say borderline incontinent.

1370
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,480
I have a bladder that is capable of holding

1371
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,160
like 15 cubic millimeters of liquid at any given time

1372
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,080
and then I have to excuse myself.

1373
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,200
I have, as I've talked about on the show,

1374
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,200
not ashamed to admit it, IBS that is probably deadly

1375
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,200
and it's just when it has to,

1376
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,080
it's become such a routine thing now,

1377
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,680
me using the potty, that if I don't just get it over with,

1378
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,660
it would literally be my entire life.

1379
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,720
So that is sort of how I got over my nervous bladder,

1380
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,720
is that I have taken away any option from my palate.

1381
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,780
It's like, it's my way or the pee your pants way.

1382
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,040
Let me throw out option smiley face with sunglasses.

1383
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,880
Okay.

1384
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
Travel around with a duffel bag full of your decorations

1385
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,000
from your home bathroom, decorate the stall with your stuff

1386
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,200
and it'll make you feel more comfortable.

1387
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,460
I love that, you hang up the little cross stitch

1388
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,160
that says if you tinkle while you sprinkle,

1389
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,840
be a sweetie, write the CD.

1390
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,720
Yeah.

1391
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,640
Just hang it up.

1392
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,920
Don't leave that in there though, please.

1393
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,680
No, you have to take it with you.

1394
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,240
But there's this, oh, you put the toilet seat cover

1395
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,520
from your toilet seat on there, you put your mat around it,

1396
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,540
you have your potpourri going,

1397
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,840
you have your picture of Neil Diamond,

1398
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,780
you have your cross stitch and you just go to town.

1399
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,120
Everything in there that you just said,

1400
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,280
that whole list all was normal.

1401
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,920
I just wanted to give you the peace of mind

1402
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,640
that all the things that you have in your pee zone

1403
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,240
are totally normal.

1404
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,080
Thank you.

1405
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,440
Sydney always gives me a hard time

1406
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,440
because whenever I go to like a new place,

1407
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,920
I usually will go to the bathroom right away.

1408
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,720
I love to go pee.

1409
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,200
You want to scope the sitch.

1410
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,600
Also because I'm really socially awkward

1411
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,680
and the bathroom's sort of like my safe place

1412
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,800
where I can get away from it all.

1413
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,600
It's like a little vacation for people.

1414
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,800
And there's no problem with pre-planning.

1415
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,120
Like Danny Ocean didn't just walk into the Bellagio

1416
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,680
and like grab all the shit and walk out.

1417
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,640
Like you got to get some blueprints and stuff.

1418
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,760
And sometimes they have like a weird toilet.

1419
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,960
I went into a bathroom where the urinal was like

1420
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,320
this bucket set up thing that they had turned into a toilet.

1421
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,280
Like you want to prep for that.

1422
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,780
You want to know that ahead of time.

1423
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,780
You don't want to get in there

1424
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,840
and suddenly you're throwing off your rhythm

1425
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,920
because it's like, well, hold on.

1426
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,760
And then you've peed your pants.

1427
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,400
This problem is especially bad in the sort of environs

1428
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,020
that the question Astrid mentioned,

1429
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,800
like stadiums and concert venues.

1430
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,920
I feel like they are getting worse

1431
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,380
about not distinguishing pee zones from hand washing zones.

1432
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,080
In the effort to sort of push everyone cattle-like

1433
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,480
through the experience,

1434
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,120
it is not uncommon to see urinals that look a lot

1435
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,000
like hand washing stations and vice versa.

1436
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,560
For kids, you go to like an elementary school,

1437
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,440
maybe you're voting or something like that.

1438
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,600
You go to the bathroom.

1439
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,360
You've just peed in a child's sink is what you did there.

1440
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,240
You just peed in a child's sink.

1441
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,920
What I hate even more because yes, that is awful.

1442
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,800
But what I hate is the bathroom planner

1443
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,200
who puts this hand washing sink

1444
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,120
like directly like six inches away from a urinal.

1445
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,920
So that means if person A is washing his hands

1446
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,720
and person B is pissing, it's like, oh, hey.

1447
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,560
Well, they do that.

1448
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,400
I'll be over there in a second.

1449
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,120
They do that intentionally

1450
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,600
because that way if someone is having a hard time,

1451
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,040
you can give them some words of encouragement.

1452
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,880
Like, hey.

1453
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,720
I've been where you've been.

1454
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,640
I've been where you've been.

1455
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,240
I got through it and you will too.

1456
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,800
Get that pee out of there.

1457
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,640
Get it on out and then come over here and wash your hands.

1458
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,980
I'm gonna go back out to the movie,

1459
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,440
but first I wanted to tell you, you're my big man.

1460
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,280
You're my big, big man.

1461
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,100
You're my big man.

1462
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,320
You can do this.

1463
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,940
Okay, enjoy the Wolverine.

1464
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,000
I was peeing in a urinal a couple weeks ago.

1465
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,920
Tell me more.

1466
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,240
Hold on, this is good.

1467
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,400
I was peeing in a urinal in a restaurant a couple days ago

1468
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,880
and I watched this gentleman out of the corner of my eye.

1469
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,240
I don't think he knew I was in the urinal

1470
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,200
because he kind of went out of the toilet stall

1471
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,500
and went straight to the sink.

1472
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,760
And I watched this gentleman from the corner of my eye

1473
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,040
turn on the water, wait a second, and then turn it off.

1474
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,840
Fucking that guy is on point.

1475
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,480
So if he didn't know you were there,

1476
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,760
who was that whole act for?

1477
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,800
I don't know.

1478
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,440
There are other stalls that had closed doors,

1479
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,800
so I'm assuming he thought a little show for them

1480
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,040
or maybe someone had been walking in.

1481
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,360
I don't know who this production was for.

1482
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,000
He didn't activate any sort of hand drying afterwards?

1483
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,480
Is it possible that he was going to wash his hands

1484
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,360
and he turned on the water

1485
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,160
and in the second after he turned on the water,

1486
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,840
he just went, ah, no, I'm not kidding, and turned it off.

1487
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,760
I'm gonna grab the knob.

1488
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,240
Why start now, Wayne?

1489
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,440
Why start now?

1490
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,680
Maybe, and this is totally reasonable.

1491
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,920
Maybe he peed in the toilet stall, right?

1492
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,280
And listen, it's entirely possible.

1493
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,580
Ladies, you might not know about this.

1494
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,360
It's entirely possible for a dude

1495
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,760
to do that particular business

1496
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,880
without touching his zone at all.

1497
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,120
You just, you unzip, you flump, you do it,

1498
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,760
you pull the pants forward to retract it

1499
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,840
and then you zip up, no contact.

1500
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,560
So maybe he got up to the sink, turned on the water.

1501
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,520
He was like, wait, did I touch my business?

1502
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,880
And then he said, no, I didn't.

1503
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,240
I'll just go ahead and turn this right off

1504
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,640
because your pants aren't dirty.

1505
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,480
You know what I mean?

1506
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,300
That's true.

1507
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,140
It's just the sin that's dirty.

1508
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,800
When you touch your zone, you get sin all over your hands.

1509
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
You gotta wash that off.

1510
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
But you've almost certainly encountered

1511
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,560
some sort of fixture that has been touched

1512
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,680
by someone else with dick on their hands.

1513
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,520
No, maybe not.

1514
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,200
I mean, it's entirely, like shit's super automated now.

1515
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,040
That's true.

1516
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,040
I'm saying it's entirely possible

1517
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,400
to get in and out of the bathroom

1518
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,080
without touching nothing but your pants.

1519
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,400
And in those situations, I think it's 100% acceptable

1520
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,080
to walk out of the doors and keep making that army sandwich.

1521
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,640
What if he's hydrophobic?

1522
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,920
He might be hydrophobic, too.

1523
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,480
Like he was trying to work up his nerve?

1524
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,760
This is his little way of facing his fear

1525
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,040
and he's on step six, right?

1526
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,580
And step six is just turn on the water, Wayne.

1527
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,920
You don't have to use it, but just know that it's there.

1528
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,240
If you need it.

1529
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,280
But you don't because you didn't touch your dick at all.

1530
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,120
You're fine.

1531
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,940
Go ahead.

1532
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,780
That was step five.

1533
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,560
Step five was to learn to pee without touching your dick

1534
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,480
because he's also dick-phobic.

1535
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,120
It's not that hard.

1536
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,640
It's super easy.

1537
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,720
98% of the time, I do it.

1538
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Is this a weird thing?

1539
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,040
I've never talked or said any of this shit out loud before,

1540
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,240
but I don't think it's that weird of a thing.

1541
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,560
I guess it's a weird thing

1542
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,760
because you guys are like stymied right now.

1543
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,880
No. No, it makes sense.

1544
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,480
I know where you're coming from.

1545
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,760
Just on plus.

1546
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,600
Okay.

1547
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,440
It's so common.

1548
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,080
It's so normal that you think it doesn't even bear talking.

1549
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,360
I don't even think it bears repeating.

1550
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,000
Sometimes you do just pee without touching your stuff.

1551
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,840
Sometimes you touch it a lot though.

1552
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,600
Sometimes you gotta jostle to get the engine going.

1553
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,940
Sometimes like first date town,

1554
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,300
you can't keep your hands off of it.

1555
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,140
Listen, thank you so much for listening to our program.

1556
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,040
We hope you have had a good time.

1557
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,200
I wanna thank people who have sent us stuff in the mail.

1558
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Real quick, dipping into the mailbag.

1559
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,240
We have a P.O. Box.

1560
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,740
It's P.O. Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

1561
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,000
So I wanna thank Corinna Terbs.

1562
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,720
She's a beekeeper who sent us some honey

1563
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,920
that had been aged in whiskey barrels.

1564
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,260
You have not eaten all of it, have you?

1565
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,100
There's still some?

1566
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,000
No, I saved some.

1567
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,440
I can bring it to Griffin's wedding.

1568
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,280
Turkenhillapiary at gmail.com is her email address

1569
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,800
and she didn't ask for plug or anything.

1570
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,280
I just really, I dug it.

1571
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,080
So I wanted to tell you guys where you can get it

1572
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,200
because she's thinking about going full-time

1573
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,240
in the beekeeping game and I say go for it.

1574
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,160
Chris Cucciara, Cucciara, yes.

1575
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,000
The Cooch?

1576
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,440
Chris Cucciara, the Cooch,

1577
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:39,280
sent us boxes of all the monster cereals,

1578
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,340
which is amazing.

1579
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,660
Matthew Segal sent us a horse and pony

1580
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,320
body language phrase book.

1581
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,320
Which is so kind, be able to communicate better for them.

1582
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,840
Our buddy Martha sent us some pictures,

1583
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,420
some prints that she made.

1584
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,480
And Cruz Flores sent us some Halloween candy

1585
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,740
and it says at the bottom of his note,

1586
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,320
it was dictated but not read, which I really appreciate it.

1587
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,840
We also got, by the way, I have misplaced the label,

1588
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,520
but who sent it to us.

1589
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,360
But we got three dog tags that have emblazoned on them

1590
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,440
in case of an emergency blast my cash.

1591
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,760
Oh, that's amazing.

1592
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,600
This is our franchise.

1593
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,560
So awesome.

1594
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,280
I'll bring those to you guys too.

1595
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,320
You guys are amazing.

1596
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,240
Yeah, you're all the best.

1597
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,260
Thank you all so much for sending us that neat stuff.

1598
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,280
And thank you to folks tweeting about the show

1599
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,240

01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,220
salted caramel pretzel pops, and Italian bistro pretzels.

01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,300
That's my box.

1617
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,540
That's how I roll.

1618
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,580
And make sure you check out all the other great shows

1619

Jordan and Jesse Go, Bullseye, Judge John Hodgman,

1621
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,740
Stop Podcasting Yourself, and of course,

1622
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:45,060
Sawbones with Justin McElroy and Sidney McElroy.

1623
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,180
Probably my favorite show on the network.

1624
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,020
Larry, let's check it out.

1625
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:48,860
Two things.

1626
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,420
Thanks, John Roderick and the Long Winters

1627
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,560
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

1628
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,220
Off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1629
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,640
You can find it on Amazon.

1630
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,580
You can find it anywhere.

1631
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,060
Makes a great Christmas present for them

1632
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,900
who have been a fan in your life or anybody

1633
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,960
because it's a really good record.

1634
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,300
Also, we're not gonna have an episode next week

1635
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,860
because I'm getting mail weed.

1636
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,300
Will the week after that be our Candle Nights episode

1637
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,100
or are we gonna do the Candle Nights episode

1638
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,500
on like the 23rd?

1639
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,300
I don't know.

1640
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,780
Let's figure that out when we're not

1641
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,580
like actively recording an episode.

1642
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,500
Start sending in your Candle Nights questions.

1643
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,380
Candle Nights coming up.

1644
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,020
Make sure that you put in the subject

1645
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,380
something about Candle Nights

1646
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,660
so that I can separate those out.

1647
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,500
Don't swear.

1648
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,580
Don't swear in your questions

1649
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,100
because we don't swear in the answers.

1650
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,120
It's our family-friendly episode every year

1651
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,300
that is the hardest to record and to edit.

1652
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,900
So yeah, seriously, thank you guys all very much

1653
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,900
for your love and support.

1654
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,700
I feel like I'm getting married to all of you.

1655
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,220
You know what I mean?

1656
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,140
Legally, he is.

1657
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,260
Legally, I am getting married

1658
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,820
to everybody who listens to the show.

1659
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:49,980
So thank you.

1660
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,720
We're all going to have such a lovely family together.

1661
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,980
All right, Griffin, I'm ready.

1662
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,820
Finally, Yahoo.

1663
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,660
For the last question.

1664
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,660
Finally, Yahoo was sent in by Sean Moran.

1665
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,480
Thanks, Sean.

1666
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,480
For the Yahoo Answers user, Mixi Minix, who asks,

1667
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,860
is it possible to get sick from farting a lot

1668
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,060
under your covers at night

1669
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,860
and then opening them in the morning?

1670
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:15,500
Oh, Justin McElroy.

1671
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,940
Oh, Travis McElroy.

1672
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,020
God, I hope not.

1673
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,060
It's been my brother and brother and me.

1674
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,420
Kiss your dad.

1675
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,660
Square on the lips.

1676
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:30,660
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

1677
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,780
Maximumfun.org.

1678
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:42,860
Comedy and culture.

1679
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,900
Artist-owned.

1680
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,100
Listener-supported.

1681
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,400
My name is Dave.

1682
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,300
My name is Graham.

1683
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,720
And we're both the hosts of Stop Podcasting Yourself,

1684
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,080
which is a podcast from Canada.

1685
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,540
In fact, we've won the best podcast in Canada

1686
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,980
two years in a row at the Canadian Comedy Awards.

1687
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,820
Sounds made up.

1688
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,820
It does sound made up.

1689
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,660
Even as I was saying it, I'm like, did that really happen?

1690
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,900
Here's the thing.

1691
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,580
Stop Podcasting Yourself is a very positive show

1692
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,940
about two people who hate absolutely everything.

1693
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,780
But we love you and you listening through all this.

1694
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,660
People have already fast forwarded through this part

1695
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,500
of the program.

1696
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,320
Anyway, thanks.

1697
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,280
We're Stop Podcasting Yourself,

1698
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:53,940
and you can find us at Maximumfun.org.
