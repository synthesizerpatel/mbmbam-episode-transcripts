1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. Folks, it's cold and flu season.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I hope you have your your vitamin C, your echinacea. What else? What else is your portable bubble?

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Your bubble that saves you from infection.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm talking like a shower curtain kind of like force field thing.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sure. So are you guys ganking ganking out?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Excuse me.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ganking is for your A, racism. Don't appreciate it.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sorry.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a isn't that for your memory?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's for your memory, but that's how you remember to take all the other vitamins.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Remember not to get sick.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Right. You know, people in Contagion, I, I liked Contagion.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I liked how early Gwyneth Paltrow left the film, but I think.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Get out of here, Gwyneth.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey, there's the door, lady.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Go cry on Blythe Danner's shoulder.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I do wish that there had been a boy in a plastic bubble who had risen up to lead them.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, he would have been their hero.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey, didn't Ewan McGregor do just that?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I guess in a way he just he did. It just didn't commit to it.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That movie was startling for me on, on, well, three levels.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The first being, oh, my God, this is how this is it, guys.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is it.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is how it happens.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I hate to interrupt. I haven't seen Contagion.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, well, here, let me give you the, let me give you the elevator pitch.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Everyone gets real sick.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Just real sick.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Have you ever been to a hospital?

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Uh-huh.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's like it made the world into a hospital.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, pretty much it.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, so the whole world smelled slightly of antiseptic.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So that was part one.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Part two is Ewan McGregor's head bubble is just so darling.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He wears a head bubble like it's like a plastic bag.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's like you've never seen American Beauty.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He wears that on his head.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He wears that right on his head.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It keeps him safe from disease.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How many times in the movie do people ask each other if they've been taking their one a day?

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That doesn't come up really.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, it's apparently not effective in treating whatever contagion is.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And the third point is that Ewan McGregor's got kind of a fucked up grill.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, how's your grill, Yuey?

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I didn't know because was that movie magic or does he really have that fucked up a grill?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I think in every film he's ever made, it's been CGI'd out.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's pretty fucked up and it's only from one side.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
On one side, he looks like, you know, Obi-Wan.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And on the other side, it's like, oh, no.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, man.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He looks like...

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Grody-Wan.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I guess.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So this is our Ewan McGregor fan cast.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm your older brother than my brother and me.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm your baby brother, Griffin.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I apologize for how my voice sounds.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have the contagion.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Griffin has the contagion.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And for people who haven't seen it, I hate to spoil it for you, but apparently the only thing that treats it?

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
More cowbell.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I thought...

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I was really surprised.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That was the only treatment, the only prescription that was available to people.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And there was a run on cowbell stores?

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't understand.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But unfortunately, it wasn't covered by their insurance, so it was cost prohibitive.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Right, exactly.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So people are, like, dying in the streets selling fake cowbell that are made of aluminum foil.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is a triangle.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hey!

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You need a horse bell, you fucker.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is one of those things with the little metal beads on it that you rub to make it sound like it's raining.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A shrakka.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A shrakka.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Two of my female friends are moving into a new house, rent-free, because one of their parents owns it.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It is a three-bedroom house, and they have invited me to live there with them.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They are my best friends, and I spend most of my time with them.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My concern is whether or not it's a good idea to live with two women with whom I have no romantic connection with,

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
because TV has taught me that doesn't always work out well from Gmail.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Zombie John Ritter.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just a reminder, if you're writing a gender-specific question like this, make sure to include your own gender,

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because it can get kind of confusing.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm thinking it's male.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It is a male.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think you're right.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've managed to piece it together from context clues, but I had to devote brain cycles to that that I could have been using coming up with advice and wisdom.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Or a cure for contagion.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I lived with a girl I was not romantically attached to for a month once.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It was in an apartment.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Travis did the same thing, didn't he?

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I did it for like three months, and it's not a good idea.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I lived with a couple, and it was great.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, a couple is different.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're a secret third wheel.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wait, are the girls a couple?

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't think they are.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think they would have mentioned that.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If they are, then yes.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Live in there.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You know what?

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Here's the thing.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't think it has any more complications than moving in with anyone.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's just different complications.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Explain, Travis.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, you move with anyone you don't know or anyone you haven't lived with before, and you have a certain amount of, how's this going to go?

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Maybe we're going to do things that is going to annoy each other.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Maybe we'll hate each other.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, they find it.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wherever I hit it, they find that thing that they can never find.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Exactly.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And with moving in with female roommates, there's a certain amount of what tensions could possibly be created over a year that you're not expecting.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're talking about sexy stuff.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, sexy.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And you've got to assume with two women, they're going to find it.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Wherever you hit that thing.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where do you hide it?

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because it's not deep enough buried in the yard.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You know that thing, they can never, ever find.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They're going to find it.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You get two girls together, they're going to go full scooby-doo.

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
They don't even know what it is.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They're going to scoop it up and just be all up in your shit.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They're going to find it.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You would have gotten away with it, too.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's the big worry.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, I think it could work.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think two would be easier than one, right?

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, I think so, too.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Personally.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You have to turn off that switch in your brain that tries to interpret things as flirting.

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You know that thing where it's like, oh, she just touched my shoulder, or she said I look really cute.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Just turn that switch right off, and you are like a monk to them.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You have no feelings towards them in any romantic way, and you have to set that up from the get-go.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You do have to prepare yourself for some of the other unspoken things that come up when you're living with two women, vis-a-vis period stuff.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, please indulge me.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, they're just going to, you know.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Please, go on.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They're just going to period, and when that happens, you've got to be prepared.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And with two of them, they're going to sync up.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They are going to sync, and when that happens.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So really, you're saying you're going to live in a place for three weeks, a month, basically.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're going to live in a place for three weeks, take a week off.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am not entirely sure that I know what a period is.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm in fact sure I don't.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think that if King of Queens has taught me anything, there's knives involved and a lot of growling.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think it's when you get.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And a lot of snickerdoodles, I think.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They just keep eating constantly.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You get pregnant temporarily for four days, right?

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Basically, yes.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But with a ghost baby, and then it goes away, I think.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's where Casper came from, actually.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's where ghosts come from, all ghosts.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wow.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have never been as uncomfortable in one second as I just was.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It just washed over me like a wave.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's called the Justin flip.

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He flips it on you.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think you're going to be fine.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And I think that, you know what?

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, apart from all the period ghosts.

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Except for that, you're going to be fine.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hang some garlic up.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's key.

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The other thing is not knowing how a situation is going to work out is not a good reason to not do it.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I completely agree.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Try it.

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know.

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Maybe it's awesome.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Embrace yourself for becoming one of the girls.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's just going to happen.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You've got to deal with it.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Top model.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And you know what?

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's be honest now in this enlightened age.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That can be kind of awesome.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, sure.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You know?

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Girls, they decorate better.

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The house always smells better.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh my God, yeah.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You know?

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Most of the better TV is targeted at women.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Every time I went over to a girl's house in college, I always thought, man, I wish my house was decorated like this.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Because it looks like an adult house.

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It looks like a nice place that people actually want to be.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
They always have juices and almond milk.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Sitting around super fruits.

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Just so I'm clear, Trav, before we get the emails and to make sure they get directed at the right person,

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you're saying that the nice thing about living with two women is that it's always clean.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is that what you're saying?

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wow.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No.

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That there's always a hot meal on the table when you come home from the salt mines?

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can I say, because it's just a nicer place to be, a nicer environment,

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
a gentler environment?

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That makes sense.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll let that slide.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't think clean is right because I know some dirty girls, you know?

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I know some messy-

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Girlfriend actually knows all the dirty girls.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I know some messy ladies.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And also, you got to think about how much of that apartment, the square footage, is going to be covered in ectoplasm.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You know, from the ghosts.

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I think people knew what I was talking about when I said ectoplasm.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Do you remember? Do you remember what we were talking about like five minutes ago?

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It was this whole goof.

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I want everyone to know that this whole episode for me is about period ghost stuff.

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Good. So tune in. Go get the fam.

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Gather around the radio.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Go get Unky Dan around the radio.

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes, please.

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, absolutely.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How about this one?

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This one is sent in by Jacob Locker.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank you, Jacob.

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Terry Banto, who asks,

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Audio chip embedded in adult diapers. Good idea?

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What?

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Wait, what?

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you have an elderly relative who needs to wear adult diapers and who is also somewhat impaired in their mental functioning?

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
My stepfather is 92 next month. He's been wearing them for a couple of years.

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's also become rather negligent in terms of personal hygiene,

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and so I thought it would be a big advantage to know that his diaper, or as I call them, Mantees, is saturated. That's not okay.

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Wow.

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
How great would this be? A diaper with an audio chip, like some of those musical greeting cards that's triggered by a specific level of saturation.

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It can play tunes such as Moon River, Bridge Over Troubled Waters, or Rollin' on a River, even handles water music. You get the idea.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Anyway, when a caregiver or relative hears the music playing, it's diaper change in time, and grandpa will not be able to argue over it.

250
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Anyone like this idea? Any venture capitalists?

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And then he goes on to say that this is an actual idea he's been kicking around for a while, and he's not just trolling.

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I think the music should be played at ear-splitting levels, but piped directly into the cerebral cortex of the elderly person,

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
so that it's blisteringly loud music that only they can hear,

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
so that their own self-mess shame will be tied to a specific trigger.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It'll be like a whole cerebral shutdown, basically.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think that this is a great idea for anyone who's ever sat around and thought,

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
man, I'd really like to ruin the song Bridge Over Troubled Waters forever and ever for me.

259
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Forever for me and everyone around me.

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Every time it comes on the radio, and you're the passenger in your car, it's like, oh, I love it, and you're like, no, turn it off.

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Turn it off.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is the pee pants diaper song.

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Here's the real question.

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The reason I wanted to read this question, because it's not typically the kind of question that we would get into,

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
is what song do you want to come out of your pants whenever you pee in them?

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I want this.

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Whenever you urinate on yourself.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I want whoop, whoop.

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's the sound of the police.

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's good.

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think that would be awesome.

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And people, when they hear that, they'd be like, oh, you did it again.

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think mine would be Don't Stop Me Now by Queen.

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That'd be good.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Because some would be like, stop peeing, please, Scott.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
They listen to the tunes.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I would go with Something in Red.

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That would really upset a lot of people, I think.

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I would really like Thunderstruck, but I want it to start out really quiet and slowly over the course of a minute,

280
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
fade up to a point where anybody can hear it.

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's like at the beginning.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So people would be sitting around watching TV with me, and I would have this big smirk on my face.

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And they would hear, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And they'd be like, do I hear grandpa?

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I love this, because now I want to change the mind to Rocky Like a Hurricane.

286
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And so it's just epic and triumphant.

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I want it to be big and proud, like everything else I do.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If I'm pooping in my pants, I want it to be bright eyes so everybody else can enjoy my emotional state.

289
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's where I'm at.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey, everybody, come on down here with me.

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm pooping my pants.

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
How about Anything by Puddle of Mud?

293
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, sir.

294
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No, sir.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I do not like it.

296
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Something they like.

297
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What kind of music do old people like?

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Something with 23 Skidoo in it.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Something with Glenn Miller.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He seems to be very popular with the old people.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think that if I dropped a totally ferocious deuce in my pants as a grownup adult man,

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and Hoobastank started playing, I feel like people would be angrier about the Hoobastank.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What if it was just like Tubthumper?

304
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What?

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Tubthumper by Chumbawumba.

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You mean Tubthumping?

307
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Tubthumper is their ballad.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I like Tubdub.

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Tubbed again.

311
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Isn't that nice?

312
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Classic.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I have a question here.

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah?

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't you get a questioner?

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, the person writing this Yahoo Answers question says it's their, what, father-in-law?

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah.

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Stepfather?

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Stepfather.

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And the stepfather is 92?

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
92 next month.

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So even at like a lowest point estimation, the person asking this question is like 50-something.

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, he's a grownass man.

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm looking at his picture in the profile.

325
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He wants this tech to be in place.

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He is a grownass man who's, I would guess, between the ages of 50 and 60, who's like,

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
this is a totally great idea.

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

329
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm thinking that this guy just got his very first musical birthday card, and he's like,

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
you know what would be great is if that only played if I peed on it.

331
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh wait, diapers, moon river.

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But he also uses the word mantis.

333
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah.

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I have a pretty good detection system.

335
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you walk into a room and it smells like the urine of the elderly, maybe change your

336
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
dad's diaper.

337
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If your house so smells like the urine of the elderly that you can no longer detect

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
a fresh cloud of that, a fresh system, a high-pressure elderly urine system moving into your living

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
room, maybe you should move.

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But what he is saying is he wants music to come out of his steppapa's loins so that

341
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
his steppapa can't say, not my piss.

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm going to take this idea and tweak it slightly.

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay.

344
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Have you ever seen those cards where you can record your own message in them?

345
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So you tricked your stepdad into saying, I just pissed my pants.

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah.

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And so then when it plays, like, well, you admitted it.

348
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah.

349
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And I heard it come from your pants mouth.

350
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think it might be time to put old dad out to pasture.

351
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Put him on the ice floe.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's time to put him on the ice floe.

353
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's had a good run.

354
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's not fun.

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know, Eskimos have 86 words for snow and no words for singing underpants.

356
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't think you should put your pop peepums out on the ice floe.

357
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He's a revered elder in the community.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
His pants sing when he poops them.

359
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, Christ.

360
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What are we doing to the elderly?

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Can't they just poop in their pants?

362
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is the greatest generation.

363
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
If they can poop in their pants in quiet.

364
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They can poop in their pants.

365
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Your step peepums was in World War II.

366
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
His pants don't deserve to play Mambo No. 5 when he makes pees in them.

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Your peepaw pooped in Hitler's pants.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And now you want him.

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Come on.

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, that's the perfect song.

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
When Johnny Combs is watching Home Again.

372
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, fuck.

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Poor old people.

374
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They're trying.

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Hey, I'm a guy who's been happily dating my girlfriend for a little over four years.

376
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I work with a girl who started calling me pumpkin in a borderline flirty way.

377
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
To make things worse, that's a nickname my girlfriend has for me.

378
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
To make matters worse, I'm a pumpkin.

379
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The girl I work with is cute and we are friends, but I have no interest in her, obviously.

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But I am afraid she's going to do it in front of my girlfriend.

381
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Put it on my Facebook wall or something like that.

382
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
How do I gently ask her to stop doing that without sounding whipped or mean?

383
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And that is from the not so great pumpkin.

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I have an opinion.

385
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Here is how you stop her from doing that.

386
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You do not.

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Now, bear with me.

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
She's not hurting anything right now.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You have to respect that if it's a situation where it could be bad, it could be, you know, embarrassing for her to call you that.

390
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
She will not call you that.

391
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
There's nothing wrong with her calling you pumpkin at work just because you have a girlfriend who happens to also really enjoy squash.

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Just roll with it.

393
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And maybe do like a preemptive thing and say to your girlfriend, like, there's this girl at work.

394
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
She won't stop calling me pumpkin.

395
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It makes me kind of uncomfortable.

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And then if it ever happens in front of your girlfriend, you can just look at your girlfriend and go, hey, hey.

397
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And this just in your significant other be a boy or girl being a little bit jealous.

398
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Not the worst thing in the world can have its benefits.

399
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Is it possible that this girl that you work with is calling you pumpkin in a non flirtatious way?

400
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Maybe are you extremely fat and jaundiced?

401
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Is that a possibility?

402
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Be honest with me.

403
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Are you fat and jaundiced?

404
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Because if so, she might just be calling you pumpkin in a descriptive way.

405
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Maybe it's a mean nickname.

406
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Hey, pumpkin.

407
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Maybe your girlfriend's calling you that in a mean way, too, and you just never picked up on it.

408
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She's slimmed down.

409
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It used to be her little spaghetti squash.

410
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, fix your keypens.

411
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Here's the thing.

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't think there's any way to say it to this girl at work that doesn't sound mean because, like Justin said, she's not hurting anything.

413
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And two, what if she comes back and goes, I call everyone pumpkin.

414
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And now you just look like a dick.

415
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't know anyone's name.

416
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hey, pumpkin.

417
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Listen, bitch.

418
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah, that's how you'll sound.

419
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't do that.

420
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, because she's doing something that's nice and, you know, in her mind, probably just a friendly, you know, jokingly flirting kind of thing, and you're going to come back at her and make her feel like a jerk.

421
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, and if you do that, here is every interaction we're going to have with her again.

422
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Here are those clothes you asked for.

423
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Kyle.

424
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

425
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Just let it go.

426
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let it fly.

427
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
All right, isn't it nice?

428
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And plus, if she was really flirting with you, she wouldn't be calling you pumpkin.

429
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Like, that's not how girl flirting works.

430
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's not that overt and just really smacking you upside the face with it.

431
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's probably the way she interacts with everyone.

432
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Let me ask you guys something.

433
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It is good to get called a pet name by a stranger.

434
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Now listen, if you go to a bank, if I go to a bank and I make a deposit in the bank and the bank tailor, like, calls me sweetie or something like that, that just makes me feel nice.

435
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're walking on sunshine.

436
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I am walking on sunshine and clouds and rainbows.

437
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Day is made.

438
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Man, I love that.

439
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
When I go to, like, a restaurant, the waitress is like, and what are you having, darling?

440
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I'm like, oh, I would like some hash browns, please.

441
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm disarmed.

442
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I think everybody should start calling everyone by nicknames all the time.

443
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Especially police officers.

445
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, hey, baby.

446
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
No, wait, are we talking to the police officer or are they talking to us?

447
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I think it's funnier if you are talking to the police officer.

448
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Hey, baby.

449
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you know why I pulled you over?

450
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
No, baby, why?

451
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No, baby, baby.

452
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey, baby, baby, baby, tell me what's up.

453
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What'd I do?

454
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Hey, girl.

455
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Did I do something naughty, sweet girl?

456
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, sweet girl, I'm so sorry, baby.

457
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Let me see that ticket.

458
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Was Daddy speeding?

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Did Daddy sign that ticket, girl?

460
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let me give you an autograph, baby.

461
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Sir, I'm a 50-year-old man.

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Hey, pumpkin, get me a sugar, sugar.

463
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Give me that ticket.

464
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Come on, little lady.

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let me see that ticket.

466
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Let me just blot my lipstick with that.

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Come here.

468
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm being mad.

469
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm being squeezed.

470
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Come here, baby.

471
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm blotted.

472
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Let me get that.

473
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Put that pepper spray down, sugar.

474
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sugar?

475
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Come on.

476
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't you tase me.

477
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, sugar.

478
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't tase me, sugar.

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Hey, baby sugar.

480
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't want to go to jail.

481
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Hey, open that door.

482
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Go ahead, open.

483
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Stop my head.

484
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Take these cuffs off, girl.

485
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're...

486
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh.

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh.

488
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, you're tasing me now.

489
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You are beating me, sweetness.

490
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm being tased.

491
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh, this is electric.

492
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Do you feel this between us, baby, baby?

493
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I am on the ground convulsing, sugar.

494
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, girl, I just threw up on the ground a little bit.

495
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Come on, baby.

496
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, baby, look at my throw up.

497
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Uh-oh.

498
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I know you got a wet nap, girl.

499
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Come on.

500
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Come on, give me that wet nap.

501
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
People are starting to stare.

502
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
People are staring at me.

503
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm pissing my pants literally as you watch.

504
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Me flail about.

505
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Come on, girl.

506
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
How many more charges you got in that thing?

507
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Damn.

508
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Damn.

509
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I bet I got a charge for you.

510
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
A little electric kiss.

511
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Come here, let me kiss you.

512
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
A little police brutality, girl.

513
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh, yeah.

514
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I got some brutality for you.

515
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I tell you what.

516
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I need some you-tality.

517
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Come here.

518
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I need some of that.

519
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh, I'm in the car.

520
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You shot me.

521
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You shot me in the...

522
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm dying.

523
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm dying.

524
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm dying.

525
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Damn, girl.

526
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You got me dying on the ground right now.

527
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Look at all that blood, girl.

528
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, girl, I'm bleeding out.

529
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Girl, it's getting hot.

530
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm dying, girl.

531
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Damn, girl.

532
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, my extremities are so cold, girl.

533
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Girl, I can't feel my fingertips, girl.

534
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
This ain't right.

535
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Come here.

536
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Why don't you blow on them a little bit?

537
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Come warm me on them.

538
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Tell my mama I love her, girl.

539
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Damn, girl.

540
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Damn.

541
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I want you to meet my mama, girl.

542
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Damn.

543
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
By the way, I literally want you to carry my remains to my mama for a nice service.

544
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Damn.

545
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
God, those pants look good on you, girl.

546
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Damn.

547
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I think we just sexually harassed the internet.

548
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm in heaven.

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Damn, St. Peter.

550
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You looking good, girl.

551
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Damn.

552
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Tune in next week.

553
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Tune in next week when not a girl cop.

554
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Why is that?

555
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I feel bad for the police officer.

556
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He just shoot a man in cold blood, didn't he?

557
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, for speeding.

558
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
For speeding.

559
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
He was violently sexually harassing him.

560
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
He was provoked, honestly.

561
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The funerals are so expensive, so I think that... No, let's just get the money done.

562
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh, a special one.

563
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
This is a tender moment right now.

564
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay.

565
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So everybody just chill out for a second.

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Travis, I'm going to give the honors to you, Travis.

567
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, thank you very much.

568
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This is from Alex to his girlfriend, Mitchell.

569
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Happy late birthday.

570
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Your birthday was September 29th, and we missed it.

571
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That was our bad.

572
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
We fucked up.

573
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That's on us.

574
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah, we ruined it.

575
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Alex put this in for your birthday and stuff, and we blew it.

576
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So happy late birthday.

577
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Right now, we're giving Alex time to... Well, Alex, go ahead and grab a... You know.

578
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And so just real quick, one more thing.

579
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Alex wants to know, will you marry him?

580
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
What?

581
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What?

582
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
She never saw this coming.

583
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Look, she's crying.

584
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm crying, and now she's running away.

585
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Uh-oh.

586
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Come back.

587
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Damn.

588
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Wait, girl.

589
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Come on.

590
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Hey, girl.

591
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Hey, girl.

592
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No, this is a... I shouldn't try to... I shouldn't turn this into a bit.

593
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is the most magical moment of their lives.

594
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
They're kissing.

595
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
They're smooching.

596
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So I'm going to assume that she has said yes.

597
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Look at them.

598
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Now, look.

599
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
She said yes.

600
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
They're so touched.

601
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Look, they're buying... They're buying My Brother, My Brother and Me T-shirts from MaxFunStore.com.

602
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh, they're exchanging them.

603
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, it's so sweet.

604
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
They bought each other...

605
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's better than rings.

606
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's better than rings.

607
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's better than rings.

608
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's better than rings.

609
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's better than rings.

610
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's better than rings.

611
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's better than rings.

612
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's better than rings.

613
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Congratulations to you guys.

614
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We hope your blessed day was all the more blessed.

615
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,680
Oh, and now when you wear your T-shirt, and people say, do you listen to My Brother, My

616
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Brother and Me?

617
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,920
And you could say, I do.

618
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,480
I love it.

619
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Thanks, you guys.

620
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Congratulations.

621
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Sorry we were late.

622
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,640
We totally... we postponed your engagement.

623
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,480
That's the power.

624
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
That's the kind of power we wield.

625
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Oh, man.

626
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
I'm drunk on it.

627
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,040
But, congratulations, you two.

628
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,600
love you very much. I love you. I love you more than they do.

629
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,280
Guys, go ahead, Griffin, what were you saying? I was just thinking maybe a Yahoo would be

630
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,240
appropriate to come off of that sweet, sweet wedding moment.

631
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,320
I love it. I love this plan. By which I mean, let me pick the most inappropriate

632
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,320
one I have in my quiver. Just pull one out, knock it.

633
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,720
This one was sent in by Johnny Wags, but he said that he found it thanks to his friend

634
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,520
neverlikethat. Those are both Twitter handles. Okay.

635
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,200
I hope those aren't given names. It's Yahoo Answers user Pistocker who wants

636
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:33,200
to know, how can I overcome my fear of Bruce Willis?

637
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,400
I have an acute phobia of Bruce Willis. Every time I see him on the television screen, I

638
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,640
become nauseated and clammy. My skin crawls, and I feel like I will die soon thereafter.

639
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,960
How can I get over this? Now, what I love about that question is there

640
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,080
are three different things I can think of, that either his fear of Bruce Willis is that

641
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:02,880
he's afraid Bruce Willis is going to come get him, or two, there is nothing he's afraid

642
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,600
of in particular, just Bruce Willis in general puts him on edge, or three, he's afraid of

643
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,400
what Bruce Willis might become. Of what he represents, you mean?

644
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,120
Yeah. He's like, I was such a huge fan of him in Die Hard, but I don't know what's

645
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,360
going on now, and I'm afraid. You don't know what his next career move is

646
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
going to be. Exactly.

647
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,060
Is that what you mean? He's shifty.

648
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,560
He is transformative. He's like Clayface.

649
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,880
Or Clay Aiken. Or Clay Aiken.

650
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,180
You never know what he's going to do next. He's mutable. I feel what you're saying.

651
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:44,640
He is going to make a Dwayne The Rock Johnson jump into comedy soon, and I'm worried about

652
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,480
it too. Yeah. Well, he already started. What was the

653
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,880
one with Tracy Morgan? Cop Buddies?

654
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,560
Cop Friends. Cop Friends? Cop Friends in 3D?

655
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:02,640
Soon he'll be able to take, he'll get into that classic Harrison Ford Clint Eastwood

656
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,080
phase of the action hero's life when he's like, everyone regards him as the biggest

657
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,680
badass in town, but he rarely moves at more than four or five miles per hour. He's like

658
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,320
a really scary tank without guns and a nice hat.

659
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,080
Yeah. Oh, don't cross him. People say back in the

660
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,920
mid-70s he killed 30 kids. He will glare at you and just make you feel

661
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,120
real bad. I remember seeing pictures of him attempting

662
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:37,760
to keep a civil relationship with Ashton Kutcher as he fully knew that Kutcher was just slobbin'

663
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,160
all over his wife. Thanks for that, by the way, paparazzo.

664
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,340
Much obliged. That picture of Bruce is one of the most intense

665
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,040
faces I've ever seen on a human being before, and if it's that image, I am also terrified

666
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,480
because now to me he's back on the prowl. Sure.

667
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,120
What if I- Can we get those two back together?

668
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,520
What if I run into her at Central Market and we both drop our groceries and while I'm

669
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,680
helping her pick up her groceries, Bruce Willis fucking garrotes me.

670
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,280
No, I think he's totally cool with you, Griffin. Yeah, that's pretty cool.

671
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,120
Totally cool. I think it's great, Ashto.

672
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:31,800
I'm saying he is Demi's private Batman. Oh. He's not the husband she needs.

673
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,520
He's the husband that will choke out any man who ever looks at her.

674
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,280
I don't understand why you're drawing these conclusions about Bruce's relationship with

675
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,480
Demi's complex. Have you met Bruce Willis?

676
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,920
I have not. Have you? Okay. I haven't either, so doesn't it make

677
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:55,240
more sense that he would be incredibly just unnaturally violent?

678
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,360
I actually think that I bet that Bruce Willis in real life is- The best parallel I can draw

679
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,600
is a dad whose daughter has just brought in her first homecoming date, and so he's being

680
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:15,040
very smiley and civil, but it's a thin veneer over just troubled waters. He will kill you

681
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,320
as soon as your daughter leaves the room. He pulls you close and goes, now you know

682
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,960
that's my special girl. Hey.

683
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,800
I'm going to go ahead and say Bruce Willis has definitely killed a man before.

684
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,280
You think? I think he's almost certainly killed a man.

685
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,320
You know what I think the problem here is? I think the problem is that I am only familiar

686
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:42,920
with Bruce Willis through his music, so the problem is, of course, that you guys know

687
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,560
Bruce Willis, I know Bruno from The Return of Bruno.

688
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:53,600
Oh, fuck. You understand? I see him as a musician and

689
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,960
a provocateur, I guess. I mean, a singer, songwriter, and performer.

690
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,000
Poet. Poet, really.

691
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,880
And I think that that's where this disconnect is coming from, because I only know his music.

692
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,920
Let's- So you've seen the softer side of Bruce.

693
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,120
I've seen the softer side of Bruce, yeah. Exactly.

694
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Let's get to the heart of it, though. What can we do to get over this fear, this

695
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,840
Bruce-ophobia? Is it possible that we could start selling

696
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,440
amulets to ward him away? Yeah, these are Bruce-proof.

697
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,480
Can you make an amulet out of good career choices? Because he seems pretty averse to

698
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,480
those. I think we're big proponents of immersion

699
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,360
therapy. Is there a movie where you can watch Bruce

700
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,560
Willis not be intimidated? Because I don't think that-

701
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:50,880
Hudson Hawk. Hudson Hawk's a good one, Daddy Daycare.

702
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,120
I don't think he's intimidated. You may have confused him with Eddie Murphy,

703
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:02,080
which I totally, totally understand, because of Eddie Murphy's prolific action career,

704
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,400
Pluto Nash. I do not think Bruce Willis is Eddie Daycare.

705
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,920
I recommend watching that to all my patients. Have you ever seen Cop Buddies?

706
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,480
You may or may not be intimidated in that. I tell you what, I wasn't intimidated by

707
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,400
him in Die Hard 4. It was basically just him looking at helicopters

708
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,280
for two hours. It's not that bad.

709
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,080
Have you seen Crazy Cops? Wacky Cops. Wacky Cop Buddies.

710
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,400
Which one was Wacky Cops? I get Wacky Cops and Cop Buddies confused.

711
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,480
Wacky Cops was the one with the 15-minute-long chase scene where he was just on the hood

712
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,180
of the car saying, slow down, over and over again for 15 minutes.

713
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:53,280
What was the one where he's a cop with a heart of gold, but also one of the scary movie

714
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,600
brothers is in it? Oh, yeah. What's that one, Griff?

715
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,680
That one is- Last Boy Scout.

716
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,440
Last Boy Scout. There it is. Have you seen To Protect and Chuckle?

717
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,720
I don't- You Just Got Served.

718
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,000
You Just Got Served is one that is very popular. It's him and Gerard Depardieu hit one of

719
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,840
them from across the Atlantic trying to get his green card. They fall in love.

720
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:27,280
Isn't he in Rush Hour? He was in Russia when he tore down that cold

721
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,760
wall. Mr. Willis.

722
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,040
Mr. Willis? Tear down this wall.

723
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,360
Help me tear down this wall with scary movie Gerard Depardieu. This is the weirdest film

724
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:46,040
promotional event we've ever done, but let's tear down this wall. The wall I'm talking

725
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,600
about is in Russia, basically. Can you find Bruce Willis and have a candid

726
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,120
discussion with him about your fear of him? Separated by bulletproof glasses.

727
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,120
No, no, no. I want you to really get in there and say,

728
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,600
hey, Bruce, I want you to know this has nothing to do with your career. I think you're a fine

729
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:14,840
actor, a fine thespian, but I am fucking terrified of you. What can I do to get over that?

730
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,440
Have you ever seen Last Man Standing? No.

731
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,360
It's a Bruce Willis movie where he's basically a gangster cowboy. Basically, the movie is

732
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:34,080
a solid two hours of him shooting dudes constantly. What are you suggesting with this, Travis?

733
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,720
Nothing. I just really love that movie. Fuck you.

734
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,440
You're not even helping anymore. No, I'm saying if you watch that movie, it's

735
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,720
good. It's a good movie to watch. Wait, hold on.

736
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,280
You know what, guys? I just watched What Dreams May Come on Netflix Instant Q the other day.

737
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,400
What a just sterling film. Bruce isn't in it. It's Robin Williams, but nevertheless,

738
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,760
this is movie talk. I'm just saying it's much better than surrogates.

739
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,400
I'm saying you're a jerk. Agreed or disagreed?

740
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,080
I actually don't think the two are mutually exclusive. I think you could dislike surrogates

741
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,160
and hate Travis all at the same time. Did you guys watch Top Shot last night?

742
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,760
Did you guys watch Top Chef? They used the music of Bruce Willis the entire episode.

743
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,680
It really highlighted it. Hey, I used to think setting my phone to vibrate

744
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,560
was much less annoying than having an obnoxious ringtone going off all the time. However,

745
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,960
seems like with newer phones, the vibrating is just as loud or louder. Heaven forbid your

746
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,660
phone is sitting on a coffee table and it vibrates.

747
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,320
So I've come to you to ask, which is worse? A moderately loud ringtone that you have to

748
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,480
hear all the time or having it sound like there's a sex toy in your pocket every time

749
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,400
you get a message. That's from Grant and Granger.

750
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:07,240
I would like to throw out what I have been doing lately, which is if I am in a group

751
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,400
of people, say we were going out to dinner, hanging out at a bar after a shower or something,

752
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,280
I turn my phone off. Wait, you don't mean power it down.

753
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,960
Yeah, I turn it straight off. Do you know why? Tell me.

754
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,880
Well, I'm of the belief, and I was actually just listening to an episode of Stuff You

755
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,840
Should Know, for instance, Stuff You Should Know, and they talked about the future of

756
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:34,960
the internet. One of the things they talked about is that smartphones are literally reprogramming

757
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,160
our brains to think differently. So those conversations of who was that guy in that

758
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,240
thing with that girl, those conversations are disappearing because now everybody just

759
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,160
takes a second and looks it up on their smartphone. So I turn off my phone so that I can continue

760
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,720
to have those conversations about who is that guy? What was that movie? Do you remember

761
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,880
that thing?

762
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,040
You are a proponent of returning to the caveman days where you couldn't remember the name

763
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,280
of the movie? Only in social situations. Like if I'm by myself, my phone is on all the

764
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,840
time and it's my outreach to the world.

765
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,560
But it sounds like you're a Luddite though.

766
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,880
Well, one of the things they said on this episode that I really agree with is if you

767
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,960
wouldn't pull out a crossword puzzle and start doing it, you shouldn't pull out your

768
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,000
phone and start tapping away. I think that it is rude in a social situation.

769
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,160
One of the guys from Stuff You Should Know gets a judgmental.

770
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,920
I know, right? But I think that, man, just turn your phone off. If you're in a situation

771
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,600
where you worry about the sound bothering people, like if you're in a movie or at a

772
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,940
play or at dinner or something, just turn it off. You'll be fine for two hours.

773
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,720
I don't agree.

774
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,640
Unless your whole family dies in a house fire.

775
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,720
Yeah, right. Unless someone needs to ask you a question about the My Brother and Me episode.

776
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,880
For hundreds and hundreds of years, we lived in worlds without cell phones.

777
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,400
But we also didn't- the three of us couldn't have hosted a podcast then. We have new technology

778
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,320
demands and I need your attention 24 hours a day. What if I need to ask you a question

779
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,480
about our technology show that we have?

780
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
We have a technology-

781
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
This is a tech cast.

782
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,640
This is a tech and movie cast. Now what I'm saying is, like, okay, I'm trying to express

783
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,840
this to you in a way that you'll understand because you are a Luddite. You've revealed

784
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,640
yourself. You love bacon and you hate technology. What I'm saying to you is-

785
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,600
I don't hate technology. I fear it.

786
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,360
There are facets of this technology that have changed our daily life so much that we need

787
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,040
the technology to navigate them.

788
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Or we'll die.

789
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,840
Which I mean. We have a show on the internet, right?

790
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Uh-huh.

791
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,740
You can't have a show on the internet and also say, like, phones are rude because I

792
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,760
didn't need to talk to you all the time before we had a show on the internet. So, like, the

793
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,080
technology has perpetuated the need for itself. You can't just put the genie back in the bottle,

794
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,200
I guess is what I'm saying.

795
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,480
All I'm saying is moderation is always the best way to go. I'm not saying get rid of

796
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,800
cell phones. I'm just saying maybe you don't need to have one, like, surgically attached

797
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,720
to your hand all the time.

798
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,880
I am cutting the rope right now while you guys are having this conversation because

799
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,160
I got bored by it and I instinctively reached into my pocket and got my cell phone out and

800
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,840
I said, oh, there are some ropes that need to get cut and cut the rope. And so I started

801
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
cutting ropes.

802
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,600
I thought you were playing cut the rope. You're not cutting the rope from your cell phone.

803
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I thought you were cutting the tether.

804
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
No, no, no.

805
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Cutting the cord.

806
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:37,520
No, no. If I could put more ropes onto it. I think it's phenomenal that there is a thing

807
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,960
that I have in my hand that 30 years ago, it would be the size of a small library.

808
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,200
And it also, from to someone 30 years ago, would seem like one of the tricorders from

809
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Star Trek.

810
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,640
Goddamn, it's a fucking, it's a motherfucking lightsaber.

811
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
My eyes.

812
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
Right, it has a lightsaber in it.

813
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,360
I am a tech wizard. I can't shake the feeling that I'm a tech wizard. I'm a steampunk.

814
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,520
I have to have it in my hands at all times.

815
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,320
On a completely different note, just make sure that your ringtone isn't the same song

816
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,200
that plays when grandpa pees his pants.

817
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Oh, yeah.

818
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Or else it gets really confusing.

819
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,520
Or maybe do. Maybe that would be a fun goof. Like, grandpa, I do it too.

820
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,160
Just kidding. Oh, there I go again on my own.

821
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,360
Just kidding. This is a young girl that I'm gonna go have a good time with. And you rub

822
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,400
that in his face.

823
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,800
We're gonna go find Glenn Miller and spit on him. I think that Travis actually has a

824
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,000
point that if it's in a situation where it's gonna be bad, I say go ahead and turn it off.

825
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,280
Think of all the internet you'll have waiting for you stored up for when you finally do

826
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
turn it back on.

827
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,080
Especially, and I can't stress this enough just because I'm in theater, if you go to

828
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,160
a theater event, turn off your phone.

829
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,260
Turn off your goddamn cell phone.

830
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,480
It ruins it for everybody. Because there's always that one dude who doesn't do it and

831
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,920
right in the middle of a really emotional scene, it starts playing some CeeLo Green

832
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,480
and everybody's looking around and you've ruined it for everybody. And you're just

833
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
a turd.

834
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,840
Don't ruin the play. Come on.

835
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:16,000
I feel like every theater in the country should adopt the rules of the Alamo Drafthouse here

836
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,160
in Austin where if your phone goes off or you talk at all, they kick you out and then

837
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,920
they shoot you in the mouth in the street with a gun, which I think is a little excessive.

838
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,360
Yeah, it's a little much. Hey, I've come to you in some need of some sage advice.

839
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,040
I got out of a five-year-long relationship nearly a year ago and have recently started

840
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,380
dating again. Good for you.

841
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,920
The woman I'm seeing now is great. We have a wonderful time together whenever we go out.

842
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,960
So the issue isn't really with the relationship itself. It's when she's on the phone with

843
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,760
me. When we're on the phone, a conversation usually runs upward of an hour before she

844
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,800
feels like she's ready to hang up. And I'm not always in the mood for such extended conversations.

845
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,960
So tell me brothers, is there a way I can get across to her that I don't always feel

846
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,020
like talking on the phone without hurting her feelings or making it seem like I'm making

847
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:06,720
excuses not to connect? Silent in St. Louis. Oh God, I'm having like a little, I'm having

848
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,920
a panic attack thinking about talking on the phone for an hour. Like I'm, I'm, I'm physically,

849
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,320
I don't know if it's still this way with you guys, but I know that for a while, like the

850
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:24,320
three of us are incapable of talking on the cell phone, on any phone. I'm so bad at it.

851
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:30,200
With my ADD, if it goes longer than like 10 seconds, I'm staring at so many other things

852
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,800
and I'm out. I'm gone. I've turned on the TV and I'm, I'm watching SpongeBob. Well, you

853
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,080
also have raging ADD. Like, yeah, I know that's what I'm saying. Like I'm out. I'm impressed

854
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,560
we've managed to keep your attention for this hour. I've been playing fetch with my cat

855
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,560
the whole time. I like that honesty. Yeah, man. Like I hate the phone. My wife knows she'll

856
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,760
call me. Sit'll call like on her way home from work or whatever, just to let me know

857
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,760
she's, she's coming and I'll instantly like, I'll just be quiet. Like I won't talk. And

858
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,080
she'll say, you, you want to wait till I get home, don't you? And I was like, yeah, I do.

859
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,240
I don't want to talk on the phone anymore, please. And when she gets home, like we'll

860
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,160
talk, like I love talking to her and I'll talk as much as she wants to. I, I, I, and

861
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,560
we'll have long conversations. It's the, it's the phone. I can't talk into it. I hate, and

862
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,520
I used to, and I didn't used to be this way. Cause I can remember being in high school

863
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,320
and being on the phone for long periods of time. Well, when I was in high school and

864
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,160
I was, cause I remember doing the same thing and I hated every single second of it, but

865
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,720
I did it because that's what I thought I was supposed to do. But then you get a car and

866
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,000
then you learn how to drive and you can just go to that person. And so now like I established

867
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,680
with Teresa very early on. I was like, listen, I don't like the phone. I'm not good at it,

868
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,620
but I love text messaging and I love long conversations. So if we can meet like somewhere

869
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,280
in the middle and do both of those two things in, you know, either talk in person or just

870
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,320
text message me one question and let me answer it. That's great. Cause in my life, that's

871
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,480
usually what it is. It's like, what are you doing tonight? I'm doing this. Great.

872
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,880
Talking on the phone is like sitting in a room with a person and talking to them. Only

873
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,880
you're not allowed to touch them and your eyes are closed.

874
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Who wants to do that?

875
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,880
It's like a scene out of saw. It's like a challenge. I hate it.

876
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,560
It is a challenge because there's so many things going on right in the periphery. What

877
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,440
are you not doing that you could be doing? I don't know. For me talking to someone is

878
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,360
a full, and this is part of it. I like to get in there. I like to get into that psyche.

879
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,320
I like to look in the eyes. I like some occasional touching of the shoulder. I like to get in

880
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
there.

881
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
I grabbed the head.

882
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
It is intense.

883
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,320
I grabbed the head with both hands.

884
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,320
I said, Hey, look at me.

885
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Look at me.

886
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,800
Basically it's like a Vulcan mind melt kind of thing.

887
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,440
Look at me. Did you watch Totshot last night?

888
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,480
And here's, so here's my, here's my advice. I think you need to tell her that because

889
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,440
what's going to happen and what may already be happening is like you see her call and

890
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,660
you think, man, I do not have the time or patience for an hour long conversation right

891
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:07,040
now and you don't answer the phone and like that's already planted a bad seed right there.

892
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,400
Shine comes off the apple.

893
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,180
Yeah. So I think that you need to say like, listen, I think you're great. I really love

894
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,760
talking to you, but if you know, why don't we just hang out instead of talking on the

895
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,280
phone or you know, let's save all this up because what you don't want to do is get to

896
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,440
a point where when you hang out in person, you have nothing to talk about because of

897
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,360
your marathon phone conversation.

898
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,880
Yeah. You use it all up.

899
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,320
Yeah. And then be like, so what did you do today? And it's like, well, it's nine o'clock.

900
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,120
So I woke up and that was it.

901
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,080
That was it. I, you know what? I realized sitting here thinking about it while you talked

902
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,500
about whatever it was you're talking about. I, I don't like casual conversations in any

903
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:51,280
respect. If I see someone, I'll sit down and talk with somebody, but if I see someone that

904
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,840
I know in a public setting, I consider it a loss. If I stop, I like exactly as much

905
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:04,840
time as I can talk. I've actually caught myself walking in slow motion so I don't lose, like

906
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,200
once I've lost momentum, I've committed myself to a casual conversation. I can't stand it.

907
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,440
See, I always say I, I, I'm terrible at small talk and I'm really great at big talk. Like

908
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
I'm great at epic.

909
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,480
Hey, what are you guys going to use about life and stuff?

910
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,600
Yeah, like that, I can carry on that conversation for six hours, but if someone's like, how's

911
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,720
work? How's, how's Teresa doing? I have nothing. I'm like, she's great. It's, it's going fine.

912
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,680
Do you guys ever get, you guys ever get into a conversation with a, a, a casual conversation

913
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,200
in public with, with someone maybe you don't know them that well or you don't see them

914
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,040
that often. They'll go through the whole conversation and they'll ask you these questions being

915
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,280
polite and then you'll end the conversation and you'll realize about 30 seconds later,

916
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,840
like, man, I didn't ask them anything. What a monster I am. Like I, I will do that to

917
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,240
a higher extent where I'll realize I never made eye contact with them once. I did. Yeah.

918
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,640
I did not look at them. I was bad at that one. That one was on me. That's, that's a

919
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,200
loss. We're going to put that in the L column. Do you guys think that we might be sociopaths?

920
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,960
Possibly. We got a touch of it. No, I mean, I'm not saying like we're Bruce Willis level,

921
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,840
but we're, we're so, maybe a little bit. Man, what a bastard that guy is. He's terrifying,

922
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:25,080
frankly. Um, Griffin. Yeah. How about it? You want a Yahoo? You know I do. Well, I've

923
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,920
got five. Jesus Christ. Just read them all back to back to back. Yeah. Just cram it in.

924
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:38,920
Yeah, I'll do that. No, don't do that. Um. No, this one's gross. All right, it's, this

925
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,760
one was sent in by Josh Becker. Thank you, Josh. It's by Yahoo. And it's user Seth Wolf

926
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:49,680
who asks, how can I get my friend to kick me? Hi, I have a foot fetish. Okay. And I

927
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,320
kind of like my friend's feet. We are good friends. And if he kicks me while he is in

928
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,000
this action, I plan to grab his foot, take his shoe off in a playful, friendly way. Like

929
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
saying you can't kick me now because I have your shoes. Then he will say something like,

930
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,520
well, I don't need shoes to kick. And then I take off and then I take off and then I

931
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,480
take off his socks and I'll be closer. So I need to know how I, to get my friend to

932
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,880
kick me by saying something to make him playfully kick me or something to get me to see and

933
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,520
touch his feet without him thinking I have a foot fetish. So what do you think? I can

934
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,840
either get him to kick me, but not be mad or take, or me to touch his feet and take

935
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,240
off his socks. I really want to take off his socks, but just touch his feet. So any ideas,

936
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:37,720
but please no mean or useless ideas, please. Can everyone for a week stop raping their

937
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:44,920
friends, please? Can we just stop like tricking people into fucking them? Like, and this is

938
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,320
what this is. This person is tricking their friend into raping their feet and I'm done.

939
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:56,760
I can't do it. That's for them, for in the, in the lens of their perversion. That's what

940
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:02,160
they're doing and they're killing me. The problem with this kind of question is it makes

941
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,380
me go, which of my friends really like my feet? Is this about me? Who is this person

942
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,680
that I know that once they touch my feet, it changes your whole perception. It's like

943
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,920
when you were in the matrix, like everything changes after this. These are all mean and

944
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,820
useless ideas, guys. How can we get this guy back before the internet? This kind of person

945
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,240
would have just been that lonely person down at the end of the block that everyone would

946
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,600
be like, Oh, Oh, don't worry about old Mr. Jenkins, but no one would have known that

947
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,720
his real thing was he wanted to rape his friends. We are going to sit down in this room, 12

948
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,520
angry men style, and we are not going to get up until we figure out a way for this man

949
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:45,040
to kiss his friend's naked feet. You try to convince me to help this gentleman. I, the,

950
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,760
the, the, the adjournment is in session. I am sitting here and I'm not going to help

951
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:58,680
this fucker unless you convince me that I need to. What if he just did it? No. Now Travis,

952
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:04,120
you're- Give me that foot. Just did it. You're like the Judd Hirsch juror who flips right

953
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:09,200
away. Like you just gave in. I'm staying strong. I'm not helping this weird beard. And I know

954
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,080
this isn't like the furries thing where I got mad at them for no reason. This guy is

955
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,400
being aggressive and I don't like that. I don't care if you're a foot fetishist who

956
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,560
has a willing partner. This is not good. This is assault is what this is. This is assault.

957
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:31,440
Can you rub him? You can't rub his foot. Without permission. No, I mean, hey, you, you could

958
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,600
get permission. Who doesn't like a good foot rub? Me. Well, me too. Yeah. I like a good

959
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:45,840
foot rub. From your buddy? From my friends. Hey buddy. One joke. I got a good way to trick

960
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:50,720
your friend into kicking him. Tell him you'd secretly like to steal his socks and rub his

961
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,560
feet and put it in your mouth. That's a pretty good kick trigger, I think. This whole scenario

962
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,720
seems so unlikely. I doubt your friend would say anything like, I don't need shoes to kick.

963
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,960
What about socks? That's not a good singer. You don't hear Spider-Man say that after his

964
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,480
shoes have been stolen. Maybe tell him you want to play shoeless Chuck Norris. I have

965
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,080
this theory. We've had a few questions like this, and I think that we have probably, no,

966
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:26,960
I mean, I like the show in this genre of like people talking about specific situations that

967
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,680
they'd like to get into. And like, like the skull one is another, is another example.

968
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:38,960
I think that there are people who, for whom have a fetish, but you know, it, it only,

969
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:46,000
this is how it manifests. But by typing in this specific scenario into a public forum,

970
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,120
they are living it out rather than looking for actual advice on how to do this. So you're

971
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:55,120
saying if this person listened to our podcast, it would be like a double, double jizzaroo

972
00:53:55,120 --> 00:54:00,800
for them. So you're saying like they're writing like erotic fan fiction, and we are reading

973
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:08,400
it out loud. I am slam-poeting this person's erotic fan fiction. Can I just say, now that

974
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:15,200
I said that out loud, I really like the idea of writing like erotic fan fiction about yourself.

975
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,720
Like this is a Travis story by Travis. This is Travis and Harry Potter. I write slash

976
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,920
Vic, but it's always me slash someone. Me. I tried me slash me for a while, but that

977
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:34,320
was really depressing. It was really sad. Me and Metroid. One day Justin and King of

978
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:39,840
Queens were at the ice cream store. I love pie, said King of Queens. So do I, said Justin.

979
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:50,560
And then they blasted each other in the butts. Sex was had by all. Oh man. Great sex, King

980
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,560
of Queens. That's also my favorite Aesop's fable. Here's, here's the moral, here's the

981
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:04,920
moral of the story. Neither a borrower nor a lender be. Oh fuck. I want to hear Griffin's

982
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,680
last question, but first few housekeeping things. This is of course my brother, my brother,

983
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:17,480
me. You listen again, so I blame you. I appreciate so much everyone taking the time to tweet

984
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,120
about the show with the my brother, my brother, my brother, my brother, my brother, my brother.

985
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,440
Tons of people on Friday tweeted about the, tweeted out our sampler link. We gave one

986
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:35,400
of them an FF as they say, a follow Friday to our buddy Brian Minsker. So next Friday

987
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:43,400
do that again. Tweet the link to our show. It's bit.ly forward slash it's M-B-M-B-A-M.

988
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,360
And Justin, may I say real quick, just because I don't think we've talked about it yet.

989
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,160
I really enjoy Losing the Sheen. Yeah. Well what's Losing the Sheen? Losing the Sheen

990
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,280
is a podcast about two and a half men by two people who have never watched two and a half

991
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,080
men till after Charlie Sheen left. And it's starring our very own Justin McElroy and

992
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,520
his wonderful wife, Sydney McElroy. If you haven't checked it out yet, go to iTunes

993
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,280
and search Losing the Sheen. It's hilarious. Thanks. And yes, Garvin Wright and review.

994
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:19,040
I appreciate that. The whole bit. People tweeting about Kimbo 2042, jam collie. Who else? Who's

995
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:28,640
been tweeting about our show this week? Joanna 11. Joanna 11. LGW Green. Anybody else? I

996
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:34,760
stayed off the grid this week, mostly. Jeff Paulson. You're not feeling good. That's understandable.

997
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:40,560
Duck Lips 5 for 13, obviously, always. Super Side Guy. James' Wife. Sean MD. Cheesecake

998
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:46,240
Jones. Austin Man Morico. Always. So many awesome people tweeting about the show. It

999
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,440
makes me really happy. And I would like to personally thank all the people who encouraged

1000
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,640
me through Endless Shrimp 2011. I couldn't have done it without your support. Hey, guys.

1001
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,120
I look forward to Endless Shrimp 2012. You realize we need three people to do this show,

1002
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:08,320
right? It's funny to watch Travis hurt himself with shellfish, but if he dies from it, the

1003
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:14,080
show's pretty much done. Yeah, it'll pretty much be the end of the show. So stop being

1004
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:21,400
so shellfish. I want to thank Bob Ball for doing our introductory warning, and I want

1005
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,000
to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of their song, It's a Departure

1006
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,880
Off the Album, Putting the Days to Bed, which every week, I could get more people saying,

1007
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,640
like, oh, I'm listening to The Long Winters now. They're fucking great. Yeah, they are

1008
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,000
fucking great. Guys, I told you that. Pay attention. We've been telling you that for

1009
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,520
how long now? For forever. Just go listen to The Long Winters. You're going to love

1010
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:49,120
them. They're the best band. Actually, if you go to eMusic, our buddy Tracy Wilson found

1011
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,520
that on eMusic, that album, Putting the Days to Bed, or no, no, I'm sorry, The Long Winters

1012
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,560
Going to Pretend to Fall is five dollars. Five whole dollars, guys. Go buy it. Five

1013
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,840
whole dollars. Go get it. That's not the one with It's a Departure, our theme song, but

1014
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:08,880
it's so good. It's still worth it. Jesus Christ. Okay, so that's our show. Thanks for listening

1015
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:18,400
again. I love you. I love you, Griffin. This final question was sent in by Jacob Locker

1016
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:28,120
as well. Thank you, Jacob. It's by Yahoo Answers user Gishal, who asks, are there Juggalo animals?

1017
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,320
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. This has been my brother,

1018
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:50,280
me. Kiss your dad. Squirt on the lips.
