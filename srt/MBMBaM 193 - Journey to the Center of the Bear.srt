1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,520
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me. It's an advice show for the

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,280
modern era, and I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,240
McElroy. They call me the baby, Griffin McElroy. They don't use my name, they just say, hey look

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:08,160
at that baby. He's a grown baby. I'm a grown-ass dude. They call me tater salad. Oh boy. Ladies

9
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,440
and gentlemen, our special guest Ron White. What a treat to have you on the program. We said we

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,480
were gonna have a guest-pert this week, and he is a guest-pert in tater salad? In tater salad. I know

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm here for all your tater salad needs. Can I hear some more of your great material tato salad?

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,920
You might be a redneck if you eat tater salad. Oh shit, they fused together, Akira style.

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,440
He's enveloping Neo Tokyo. In Russia, salad taters you. Oh no,

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:51,680
he's in the mix. Get him out of there. Funky boy. Oh god, he's crushing everybody to death

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:02,080
with his body. My wife. Oh no. So this is our all-star comedy special. Our all-star comedy

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,760
special where we celebrate the fact that you have donated to the Max Fund Drive going on this week.

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,840
This is really sort of a victory lap for us and you at home. It's a courtesy week because we know

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,000
you already done, Gabe. We know you already done, Gabe, but if you want to share this episode with

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,160
somebody who hasn't because some people may not have, but you guys have just been amazing with the

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
support. So fantastic. I mean, I feel like we probably should have had, since all of you have

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
already donated, I feel like we should have already got more by now, but like I said,

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,880
more by now, but like I'm sure that's just like kind of a number. Accounting error possibly. Yeah,

23
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,920
so there's some hanging chad on those on those figures. There's a bit of the old hanging chad,

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,560
but we're going to talk about the Max Fund Drive a lot more coming up this episode.

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,240
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, thank you so much. Here's our first question. It's my birthday today.

26
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,320
This is that is unlikely. It says it's my birthday today and at some point during the afternoon,

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,800
a bar of fancy birthday chocolate appeared on my desk. The problem is I don't know who in the

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
office it's from. When I asked the primary suspects, they denied it being from them.

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
The question is this. Do I have to wait until I identify who the gift is from before I begin

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,240
enjoying the chocolate? That's from Sweet Tooth in San Francisco. That's a great question.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,960
Yeah, right. It's the it's the what's the order of operations vis-a-vis this birthday chocolate

32
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,040
because you got I think you do have to find the person say this is from you. Oh, thanks.

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
And that's a yes. Do you have to say thank you before the enjoyment? Or can you thank

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,600
him for the enjoyment that you had already? Thank you for the chocolate. It was delicious.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,400
It was delicious. But then anybody can fucking claim that they gave you that chocolate. You

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,240
have to ask him to describe it. Describe the chocolate bar that was left on my desk, please.

37
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,360
Nope, wasn't you. Why did you even fucking try to caramel? If you knew it wasn't you,

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,520
why did you even try and do that? That's who I do. You've been playing along.

39
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,560
Caramel. What are you getting out of there was a caramel in the pistachio shells.

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,240
Like, stop it. No, it clearly would just say you didn't give it to me.

41
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,520
Maybe they're thinking that you found a golden ticket in there and they want to get their cut

42
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,720
of the winnings. They want to be your Grandpa Jerry that comes along with you.

43
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,840
Sorry. Sorry, Grandpa Jerry. Yeah. Pardon? You remember. And his wife, Grandma Geraldine.

44
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm pretty sure it's Grandpa Joe, but thank you so much for playing along. Grandpa Joe is a joiner

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,400
and he fucking pisses me off every time I watch that movie. Oh, yeah, he is fully like he fully

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,800
does sort of just hop on to Charlie's bandwagon, right? There's very little discussion. And he

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,440
starts singing a song about how he's got a golden ticket. No, you don't. No, you don't.

48
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:03,120
You're your illegitimate grandson. A PS, super duper, triple cool that you've been faking being

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,240
a paraplegic for like a decade. And then the wafting of chocolate, like the aroma tickles

50
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,520
your nostrils is how we're supposed to see. I thought it was just that their family was so

51
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,880
poor. They couldn't afford to walk that they just there was no reason to. Why the fuck would I

52
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,200
where am I going to go? He was impoverished into immobility. Well, here's the other thing,

53
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,040
too, is like Charlie gets a golden ticket and he's like, Grandpa Joe, go with me.

54
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,960
Hey, dude, you've got three other grandparents just like chilling literally two feet away.

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,640
And you're like, fuck you. Fuck you. You're cool. How about your mom's? Like,

56
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,120
it doesn't seem like things are super cool for her. And she's been working really hard to feed

57
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,200
you and your 80 grandparents. And also, she hasn't been faking being paralyzed. So maybe

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,600
like she could use a break today. But she'd love to go.

59
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:11,200
So this is weird. I wouldn't eat this. Was he just lying in his mess? Oh, yeah.

60
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,120
Lying in his man. You don't see that. You can actually know what they don't show. What they

61
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
don't show is that it's just like a weird orgy between the four grandparents.

62
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,320
There is going to just wailing on each other. They're so poor. What else are they going to do

63
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,480
for enjoyment? That's the thing, though. At night, it's like old person toy story. The lights go off.

64
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,080
The parents leave the room. Charlie goes to bed. The grownups just wake up and start walking around

65
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,800
like, Oh, I love walking. It's so hard to pretend. Would you eat chocolate that you didn't know?

66
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,480
Fuck that. Would you eat a food that you didn't know the source for?

67
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
This is actually happening. Yes, this has happened to me before because I work,

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,760
you know, imagine my surprise because I work in a sort of office. And when we open a show,

69
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,040
everybody does like, you know, occasionally thank you things like a note or, you know,

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,520
there's something where like the director for like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead because

71
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,440
it's about flipping coins. Jeremy Dubin, the director, bought everybody like chocolate coins,

72
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,760
right? But occasionally, people do that. Yep. Everybody just assumes that you will know it's

73
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,200
from them. And people will just like leave stuff on the desk. And then it becomes this awful,

74
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,840
like, hunt of like, Did you do this? Did you do this? I mean, I appreciate it. I know my tone

75
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,440
of voice does not convey that. Did you do this? Did you do this? How could you do that? You fucked

76
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:41,040
my wife. That's not a very good opening night present. I would say I would rather have the

77
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,840
chocolate coins, I think. Yeah, if we're voting, we're voting, which I guess we're not. Um,

78
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,040
y'all want to Yahoo? Please, yes. This Yahoo is sent in by Adam Doyle. Thank you, Adam. It's by

79
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Yahoo Answers user. Man, fucking Yahoo done updated their shit. And now I can't see who

80
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,760
the Yahoo Answers user is. Quit fucking updating your user end user experience, Yahoo. Hey, Yahoo,

81
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,280
while we're on the subject of Yahoo Answers, if everybody could just stop using Yahoo Answers as

82
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,360
a source of comedy, that would be like, super great. The Tonight Show got up on it this time.

83
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,920
They had Audra McDonald sing Yahoo Answers. And, uh, uh, uh, Midnight's been up on it too.

84
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,160
And it's just like, if everybody could just chill on that. Nah, listen, we can't fucking, we can't

85
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,360
rain this night. No, midnight, fair trade. Listen, that first app that we published, and I don't like

86
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,760
tooting our own horn, but here it goes. That was the Gutenberg Bible of comedy. Yeah, that's fair.

87
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,760
That first app, where I was like, hey, you know what might be fun? Let's look at Yahoo Answers

88
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,920
and see if there's anything cool going on in there. Little did I know, I was changing the fucking

89
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,560
course of history. That's why Sid Caesar died, because he didn't think of it. No, that's why

90
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,000
he died, because he was willing to pass the torch. He said, finally, another. There's a new comedy

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,160
king. And also, midnight, if you want to keep using Yahoo Answers, if you could just have us

92
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,720
on your show. Yep. There's like a three person thing going on there, like a vibe there, where

93
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,400
three people compete. That would be super great if you could just get us on there. If everybody

94
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,720
could just tell at midnight. People have been doing the Lord's work already. Yeah, you guys

95
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,800
have been really trying to get us on there. We would be so happy to, with just the merest of

96
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,080
travel considerations on their end, just totally get out there. Let's not go crazy. We're going to

97
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,440
need some per diem. Yeah, if I could get some per diem guarantees, I would just love to get out

98
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:46,640
there. Okay, so I dug through this inscrutable new Yahoo user interface. They got like a new logo.

99
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,800
It looks like a seven. What the fuck are you guys doing? Anyway, it's asked by Yahoo Answers user

100
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:02,720
Strawberry, who asks, I am too slow at work. How do I move my hands faster? Fast food Wendy's.

101
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,680
What? So this is my first job and it's only my fourth day. Yet I got told I have to be faster,

102
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,440
but sadly that's as fast as I can go since I have never worked. So I was wondering, is there

103
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,440
something I can do to move faster? Hamburger and then parentheses, hamburger, fry and fire,

104
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,360
nugget lines. Sometimes I have to go to the BK to restock. I guess that means back and not that

105
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:36,080
this person scoots to Burger King to get Wendy's dark secrets to reveal. So please help me, like

106
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:43,120
advice on how to move faster. Update one, I was told to go faster too. Update two, like I got in

107
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,320
trouble because I was going slow. I think it was Malcolm Gladwell who said that when you work at

108
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,680
the Wendy's, you got to put in 10,000 hours before you're an expert at it. So you're going to have

109
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,520
to work there for like 10 years before you move any faster than you do now. That is what 10,000

110
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,160
hours works out to. Man, I just thought about spending 10,000 hours at a Wendy's and it bummed

111
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:18,960
me out. I'm kind of impressed by anybody that gets really good at anything. If you work 10,000 hours

112
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,440
at Wendy's and you turn into like the best Wendy's, like if you're the best person to work the fryer,

113
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,000
and you know, I'm always impressed. I don't care what it is you do. I don't think we have enough

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,200
value on work in this country. I am impressed by you, guy who fries the fries better than anybody

115
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,640
else because once you get to be an expert, I'm always impressed. But here's my question.

116
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
Going along those lines, wouldn't you agree then that there are certain people that have a natural

117
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,640
proclivity towards the fryer and some don't? So maybe this gentleman or a woman asking this question

118
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,480
can only move this fast because they were not one who was born to fry.

119
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,560
I think that with repetition, anybody could get good at it. I'm saying that some people are going

120
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,200
to come out of the some some you're you are going to have that wonder. You're saying that you're

121
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,360
going to have that one who just dips the fries in, takes it out and the other employees like have

122
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,280
gathered into a semicircle just watching with mouths agape. The perfect crisp. They're creating

123
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,760
like a Giro dreams of Frosty's scenario, where somebody spends their whole life mastering their

124
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,240
craft. Is it a particularly fancy craft? Absolutely not. Absolutely it is not.

125
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,120
I don't know if you could make me perfect fries and chicken nugs every time. It's pretty great.

126
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,400
That's pretty fancy. I get what this person's saying too about like, have you guys ever worked

127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:49,760
a job where like your your like success at the end of the day is determined by how much product

128
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,560
you manage to process in some way and then that number was like like quantitatively compared

129
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,440
against your your peers because like how many dog buttholes I could squeeze when I worked at the

130
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,160
kennel that's I mean you're goofing but yes that's when I when I worked for Justin's father-in-law

131
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,240
at a file scanning company there was a fucking leaderboard at the end of the day that would

132
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:26,160
measure how many documents you would scan turning them into digi docs and I thought I was hot shit

133
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,960
just because I would put on my headphones and just like go and then at the end of the day

134
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:38,960
it was like a quarter of what the people who were who who the the pros the vets the numbers

135
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:46,320
that they were turning in um did not last super long at that job didn't did not could not could

136
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,680
not did not hold that one down especially long time do you guys think if you need to physically

137
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:00,320
do something faster does it make more sense to start slow and then like go slow and then

138
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,720
like just get the muscle memory or to just push yourself to be faster and like correct whatever

139
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
errors you have on the back end in movies that you always see like when someone gains super speed

140
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,160
or something that they always like do the first thing and then the second thing and then it's a

141
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,920
little bit faster than a little bit and then suddenly they're just flying through it so I

142
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,520
guess that way like in movies yeah like in movies get struck by lightning on arrow when arrow gets

143
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,920
good at arrows the first thing he does is that he has to smack water wait slow down i'm writing

144
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,400
this down okay he has to smack water with the palm of his hand over and over again right

145
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,720
because it's been a bad boy no because it's like the first step in becoming arrow an error man can

146
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,800
you imagine if he just like could not get good at arrows what they would have had to change the

147
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,360
title of the show to water slapper well do you watch water slap yeah i fucking love that show

148
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,680
i understand that might be the first part of his training but i don't understand why i have to

149
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,280
watch it i've been watching this show for a year and a half he's just slapping water just give him

150
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:20,160
on arrow with a bow see how his progress how can you rate the efficacy of the water slap training

151
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,760
technique if every once in a while you don't toss him a bow and just like even that's not even one

152
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,520
to one in terms of like physical motion there's no there's no fucking drawstring on water it's all

153
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:40,160
about the control of arrows wait are the arrows made of water i zoned out the watering arrows

154
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:47,520
oh he's a water bender and that well the worst part of it is then he takes on uh a little trainee

155
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,040
there who's made of water a little no he takes on a trainee and he's like i'm gonna teach you to

156
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,160

183
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,760

184
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,840
added but i mean it was it was uh this past january we added four new shows like the goose

185
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,520
down and oh no ross and carrie and lady the lady and song exploder and got got a new host up on

187
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,040
we had saw bones join it that hit program uh and then cindy got pregnant justin cindy got pregnant

188
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,800
i'm not saying that was exactly because of your donations but it probably was uh an investment

189
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,520
because 20 years from now that kid will have a show and you'll love it yeah wham bam pow was

190
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,280
added this past year i'm getting that kiddish podcast as soon as he can talk as soon as the

191
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:07,760
vocal cords have formed he's he is here he or she well it's she uh so travis um sort of brutalized

192
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,880
this list but i'll give you like an english version for i thought i really sold it for five

193
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,360
dollars if you can pledge us five dollars a month you're going to get an insane amount of bonus

194
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,320
content that's episodes from every max fun show uh and all the years prior which means that if you

195
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,600
give five dollars a month you're going to get the ticket to 44 hours over 44 hours of bonus i mean

196
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,840
think about this way five dollars a month that's like for those that play video games that's 60

197
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,160
dollars that's like a brand new video game and you could pay to get 44 dollars of content

198
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,880
60 for 44 dollars of content is not very it doesn't seem like a good deal

199
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,760
if you can give us ten dollars a month you're gonna get all the bonus content these these

200
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,520
stacks so you get everything prior right with each level but for ten dollars a month you're

that they hadn't realized that they weren't supporting it anymore and so now they've gone

236
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,920
fun.org first i should donate that is the end here's another question my brother and i whoa

237
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:30,560
nope no incorrect my husband and i oh yeah hachi my brother and me have a toddler together is that

238
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,400
we just found it should we start a podcast uh and we occasionally like to go out on date nights

239
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,080
while she is asleep we pay a long time friend and neighbor to basically just watch tv on our couch

240
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,240
while the baby sleeps the problem is when we get home we are generally feeling ready to settle in

241
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,640
for the night and the babysitter's ready to chat for you left out the winky emoticon in there which

242
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:59,840
implies that they come home from this date ready to shag baby yeah uh we are in a bind because we

243
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,480
don't trust any people to stay with the baby and we need to get out occasionally any advice for how

244
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,280
to encourage her speedy departure upon our return and that's from trying to avoid lingering in los

245
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,440
angeles i'm gonna throw something out that both of you are gonna cringe at okay you gotta tell

246
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,400
her that you want a bone yeah when you said you're both going to cringe at you're talking about me

247
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,160
and justin right because i definitely winced yes but i think the idea is like if she's a long time

248
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,000
friend and like you guys have anything more than a passing acquaintance not when you get home but

249
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,960
probably i'm like yeah we're going on the date night and then god it hurts to say but like you

250
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,600
gotta bite the bullet and be like and then we're hoping to come home and and have some alone time

251
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,120
and then like make it don't say have some alone time what don't say have some have some alone

252
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,560
time is a grosser it's like that pat and oswalt bit on clean filth like that's grosser than like

253
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,880
we are going to come home and engage in coitus uh this is all lay with one another in the marital

254
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:10,080
bed oh god yeah we're gonna make some we're gonna make some uh some sloppy we're going

255
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,480
sloppy joe's we're gonna make some sloppy joe's unless your husband's name is joe that doesn't

256
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,120
work i um i i think that okay so i'm as an introvert i've become common expert at getting

257
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,680
people to leave and one one of the things you can do is pay the lights off turn the lights off no

258
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,720
one of the things you can do is pay attention to your body language okay here's step one do not sit

259
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,200
down no you sit down that says let's chat don't take your coat off okay that says get comfortable

260
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,240
with me three don't close the door when you walk in leave the door open and then hold it open with

261
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,600
your hand and then every few seconds go maybe wave a candy bar in front of the door and throw

262
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,600
it outside and hope they follow i don't have a lot of friends but uh anymore uh but i think that

263
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:08,160
those are three great steps that you can take how do you get anyone to leave your abode under any

264
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,320
circumstance this is what freaks me out like when i have friends over and it's like i am just like

265
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:23,600
so ready to to chill um i'm incapable of letting them know that so when i think about if i had

266
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:32,640
a dangerous intruder in my house my ability to repel somebody who wants who like doesn't owe me

267
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,480

291
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,120
that dogs can sense ghosts right let's i guess just cover our bases before we get started are

292
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:41,680
are ghosts real yes yes yes are dogs real in the right light i watch cosmos and as it turns out

293
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:48,880
dogs are just shitty wolves hey cosmos can we talk about you for like a second just real quick

294
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,200
and then we'll get right back to the advice i watched that episode and it talked about how

295
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,960
animals reproduce and then uh who's that dude neil degrasse tyson neil degrasse tyson hopped

296
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,800
in his fucking magic razor ship and then he flew into a bear's fallopian tubes and ovaries and

297
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,720
shit and just like cruised around in his razor ship grass tyson i'm cruising i'm careful i'm

298
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,000
going on a fucking magic school bus adventure inside it's like an episode that we would like

299
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,280
like make up like and then the neil degrasse tyson just like cruises into a bear pussy

300
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:31,840
no that happened definitely did happen on cosmos um i'm not gonna lie i did learn a lot while i

301
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:42,400
was inside that bear pussy thank you neil i'm not sure why like the name of the show is cosmos not

302
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,600
ursine vagina so i guess i'm a little bit confused on why you took this fucking detour

303
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,000
i guess i get oh no i guess you did cover all of space the infinite expanse of the universe

304
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,040
in the first three eps um i it was rough for me because i i uh i got distracted when he was

305
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,360
introducing that segment and all i knew was inside a uterus and then when i found out it was a bear

306
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,240
i felt really sheepish for getting so turned on yeah and that bit opens up with him talking about

307
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880
how dogs came from wolves and he's talking about that by a campfire and a wolf attacks him and he

308
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:30,640
has to fight him off with a fiery log cosmos you have lost the plot my friend you have cruised off

309
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:39,600
the fucking rails course correct look up there's infinity space i can check i can scope a bear pussy

310
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,440
whenever i want on the internet tell me about the fucking the orbs god damn what you're probably

311
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:55,440
wanting is to take out imaginary journey to the center of venus but instead let's go dig on that

312
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,920
sheep's pussy on the next episode we're gonna go check out a sheep pussy this is cosmos and we just

313
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:14,960
go to space neil secretly punishing everyone you know sheep pussies in the spiral galaxy have a

314
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,800
lot in common they don't have anything in common take me to space get me out of this pussy neil

315
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:28,160
you have an infinitely powerful starship called imagination and you're using the power of

316
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:36,640
imagination to climb inside vaginas can we just go to space once you know there's a lot out there

317
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,720
probably we don't really know we're making all this up you know what i know stone cold goat pussy

318
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,720
is

319
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,560
i don't want to hop in your ship but your ship can travel through the fucking imagisphere and i don't

320
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:01,600
want to get in it because i know where that road is i promise this time what if he what if he took

321
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,560
you took you in you're looking like i'm not going to tell you where we're going but i promise it's

322
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,520

326
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:36,000
have sold me yeah it's really good uh can ghosts hurt dogs though no but for real though can go

327
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,520
sir no but really can ghosts hurt dogs i feel like there'd be more beef between ghosts and cats

328
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,440
why do you think and i say that not as a joke i think that's a legitimate belief they seem like

329
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,760
they would be more sensitive to spectral presences it also seems like cats would be less cool with

330
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,080
having them around like cats would be like get the fuck out where dogs would be like okay cool

331
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:05,840
this is all right all right i'm spooked later got me again i'm gonna go in the next room um i got

332
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:14,480
some good yahoo responses to this please uh princess says no a ghost cannot hurt you nor

333
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,880
can it speak to you nor does it even know who that you are there a ghost is just a person's energy

334
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,560
that's left behind when they die a spirit princess a dog isn't asking this question a spirit on the

335
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,560
other hand is different uh spirit is a soul that is left behind spirits can do all of those things

336
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,200
if they are strong enough so no ghost cannot but spirit sure can it's been a while since we've

337
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:43,440
addressed how yahoo answers users sort of classify the undead right it's this is there's there's

338
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:52,160
spooks there's ghosts specters specters phantasmagorias spirits if ghosts aren't real

339
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,080
why do we have so many words for them hmm haven't thought about that huh makes you wonder doesn't

340
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:05,920
it illuminati uh ghosts can apparently i'm just gonna fucking summarize some of this crazy

341
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,120
bullshit ghosts can't hurt the dogs but they can scare the dogs into hurting themselves

342
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,080
right that's a common vein they'll scare they can also ruin the dog's credit

343
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:26,560
it no no like they get it they get a credit card in the dog's name they max it out oh okay um yahoo

344
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,480
answers user europa i'm sorry rex it says here i would love i would love to get it says here you're

345
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:42,080
like 514 um europa objective says there's no such thing as ghosts all right good answer oh wait oh

346
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,960
hold on i'm sorry there's more they're demons fallen amble angels sent by satan and given

347
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,480
figures of someone who once walked on earth thereby confusing the people into thinking god

348
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,720
does not exist because this person isn't in heaven or hell he is on earth do not be deceived

349
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,200
to answer your question physically no although they can sometimes poses dogs and then hurt

350
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,040
themselves so a different way that ghosts can make a dog hurt himself okay so just to be clear

351
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,240
here ghosts are a shell game invented by satan yeah is that that's the it's a fallen demon

352
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:21,920
or angel i guess a risen demon hmm hmm um yeah and then they take the form of ghosts and people

353
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,200
see a ghost and goes well like if he's not in heaven or hell i guess god doesn't exist

354
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,480
and then satan's like yes here's the question that i keep coming back to in this whole situation

355
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,680
and i don't think the question is whether or not a ghost can hurt a dog why would they what is the

356
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,360
what's their end game in this maybe the dog's being a dick and like barking while we're trying

357
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:51,360
to record an episode oh i see he's coming back at my dog yay uh one more yahoo answers user garrett

358
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,960
says they can scare them and make them hurt yourself keep a cat the cat will absorb the ghosties

359
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:05,280
okay that's true it's like baking soda they have to snort them though i just did a line of ghosts

360
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,560
man i'm tweaking again remember if you hear your cat sniff that's a ghost disappearing

361
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,960
mm-hmm it's true i am still having okay i want to circle back i'm still having trouble with this idea

362
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:27,920
that satan is is making ghosts to make people think god is this i have a question for you atheists

363
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,760
atheist friends i know there are many of you that enjoy this program if you see a fucking ghost is

364
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,840
that going to reaffirm your book like are you like i knew it i knew it all along tell you didn't i

365
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:46,720
tell you are there a contingent of people that are like god is not real ghosts are ghosts definitely

366
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,120
are and that i do not believe in the soul unless i mean it's not a soul though is it travis it's a

367
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,760
fallen angel demon since we'll see but yeah but that's what i think what you're supposed to assume

368
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:06,720
is that you know the atheist sees the the ghost and goes ah a soul not in heaven i knew it i knew

369
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,120
that souls and all that were legit i just knew that there wasn't a god that was like there's not

370
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:20,240
like a place for those souls to just hang out and do whatever but here's the thing the logic of that

371
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,040
is like saying kids belong in disneyland if i see a kid not in disneyland it means disneyland does

372
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,160
not exist whoa it's exactly like that you're right travis so why couldn't there be a ghost

373
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,200
that's just not in heaven guys we're big do you realize that the three of us are becoming yahoo

374
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:50,000
answers this conversation that we're having is yahoo answers we have created a a physical form

375
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,920
of yahoo answers the three winter yahoo answers we have become that which we most loathe i do i

376
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,360
fear the day when we cross the line and start like commenting back on these on these questions

377
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,520
and we're like well hold on let me help yeah let me just answer this one wait we don't have any

378
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,720
yahoo answers because we actually answered them all because we're basically experts

379
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,680
we solved them we solved all the problems we fixed yahoo answers i just started a new job

380
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,240
and i love it it's in a small office and i can already tell that i will soon become quite close

381
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,280
with my co-workers here's the problem i'm getting married in september normally we wouldn't consider

382
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,960
inviting people i met only a few weeks ago but by the time the wedding comes around i will have

383
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,800
spent quite a lot of time with my co-workers and i worry they'll be offended if the nuptials come

384
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,120
and go without me asking them to join us should i invite them and add to an already bloated guest

385
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,760
list or guest list or risk becoming the office pariah that's from nervous in nashville

386
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,280
i mean you have a fine excuse yeah you you obviously have to plan these things

387
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,960
quite a while in advance um this is one of those questions where like there's two different it's

388
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,600
like the the real situation and the perceived situation the real situation is you are perfectly

389
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,040
fine to not invite them because you know you say that the guest list is full you did it a long time

390
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,840
in advance whatever right but then the perceived situation is always going to be that you snubbed

391
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,880
them i feel like that site is almost always perceived because like i do not think i have ever

392
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:35,040
not been invited to a wedding and i was like oh for real oh okay i guess i uh guess i just assumed

393
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,360
well because the benefit here is that what you get is like when you get closer to the date

394
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,200
if you have become super close with like six or seven of your co-workers you've gotten the rsvp

395
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,480
backs and you know there's going to be open spots then you are like hey i'm getting married in a

396
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,200
month i'm getting married in a month do you guys want to come yeah if you think about the solution

397
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,040
that you're you're sort of conceiving for this problem it's to go to people you barely know

398
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,480
and say hey listen i can tell there's something really special i know i we've only just met but

399
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,600
i can just sense can you feel it the person's gonna stare at you dead-eyed and just wait for

400
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,280
you to leave the room so they can call the cops i'm gonna give you what i'm calling a preliminary

401
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,640
and this is going to be a very special kind of wedding invitation that i can either activate or

402
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,520
revoke in four months time i will rsvp to you whether or not you're allowed to come i will hand

403
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,360
you a rose i'm telling you you've made the first wave you've made it through the wedding invitation

404
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,680
primaries with flying colors because you seem super cool you gave me that small bag of fritos

405
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,800
that you got from subway that you did not want to eat and that planted a seed in my mind that i want

406
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,920
you to share the most special day in my life with you maybe let's see where we are four months down

407
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:06,240
the line i will send the activation code to your rsvp what you want to do is scratch off below the

408
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,360
foil here and you're gonna find a 38 digit confirmation code i'm gonna need you to put that

409
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:20,720
into the internet every every single day i need you to put that 38 digit code into the internet

410
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,200
uh and if you miss a day unfortunately it the invitation will be canceled immediately

411
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,240
and this will be my test to see if you actually do want to come now the other thing i do have to

412
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,320
make you aware of is that every time you apply this confirmation code you're gonna need 100

413
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,720
pepsi points and you can find those just on the labels of 20 ounce to two liter pepsi products

414
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:54,880
from 1996 1996 and you can hopefully you save those cubes yeah there are also on this web this

415
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,000
bespoke uh temporary wedding invitation web page that i made for you to input all of this metadata

442
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,120
and help make other great shows uh get made if you also think about like how much time you've

spent listening to to the shows on this network and how much time you spend like on a fucking

a weekend no questions asked no questions absolutely fantastic just go ahead do you you

536
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:41,440
ps that to me is it kosher to sing musical theater at karaoke i imagine it's more nuanced

537
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,600
than yes no what sorts of musical theater work at karaoke i wonder if it's about some sort of irony

538
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,640
like a step of removal from just belting a ballad sometimes lame is group numbers have worked well

539
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,760
but like oklahoma that seems like bad news what are your desperate thoughts and that's from an

540
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:03,600
alto who can't belt for shit wow justin that's really fucking harsh i like that's the self

541
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:09,200
described as his own moniker his or her own moniker it's probably a her yeah well maybe

542
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:15,120
could be a dude out though i don't know um you know i i think that this is a i i think it's

543
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:21,120
absolutely acceptable but as in all karaoke you gotta read the room you know there's you know

544
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:26,560
there's fun meatloaf singing like paradise by the dashboard light where everyone can get involved

545
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,720
because there's lots of parts of everybody and then there's like singing heaven can wait really

546
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,880
slowly to yourself sadly and everyone's just but sometimes a crowd wants it sometimes a crowd just

547
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:43,360
came there to put some tears in their beers and that's when you do summer loving yeah that's

548
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,080
summer loving's pretty good anything from greece will get everyone involved if you're doing well

549
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,520
involved you gotta do beauty school dropout on repeat i feel when i hear something from greece

550
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:00,240
i do feel emotionally involved but not necessarily like a heart pounding smile generating sort of

551
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,920
way that's true um you know if you're doing soliloquy from carousel you fucked up you're

552
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:12,560
doing it wrong i want to find out what karaoke bar this person is going to that has lay miz in the

553
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:18,480
book oh man there's i feel like since the movie everyone's got hathaway dreams yeah

554
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,160
oh boy i will now be performing poor judd is dead

555
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,480
all right i actually this is like the worst thing is when you get someone you do a thing like it's

556
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,400
like got too many parts like you're doing your fault from into the woods it's like look all

557
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:41,520
the parts yeah you need nine nine talented singers i went to a karaoke place once and i saw uh sit

558
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,840
down you're rocking the boat in the book and i was like this is a jam this is gonna get the people

559
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:51,440
going maybe i'll do it so good that people will do like the sit down you're rocking rocking the

560
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,600
boat and just move to it and i got up there and i grabbed the mic and i took a swig of beer for

561
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:04,800
courage and then i heard ting ting ting ting ting and i was like oh no i just got don henley because

562
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:13,360
it was definitely the don henley version it was the kids you got henley nightmares and hathaway

563
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:19,200
dreams exactly the other thing that can happen with musical theaters the the accompaniment

564
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:27,040
could be real shitty oh yeah so then you get the like ting ting ting now my selection from floyd

565
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:33,600
collins won't won't feel good at all don henley was was exclusively backed up by midi files during

566
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:40,320
his solo career not a lot of people know that uh i i think that you're the the thing that i get

567
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,560
stuck on here is the irony because i feel like the important thing about good karaoke is that

568
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:52,880
at some point if you're going to sing something that some people might consider an ironic choice

569
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,400
it has to be bolstered by sincerity you have to make that's uh what the justin mccoroy story

570
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:05,920
literally every jam you've got is delivered with a stoicism that that is just like completely

571
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,880
inappropriate i don't keep lori morgan's something in red at arm's length i love you become let it in

572
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,920
you you dress yourself in something in red and then you perform you're the vessel you're the

573
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,800
vessel for that song it is important to know no joke when i was uh leaving huntington and

574
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:28,800
moving to cincinnati justin saying that to me at karaoke and i believe made his mother-in-law cry

575
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,640
i don't think she quote unquote got it she was touched by my performance

576
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:42,480
uh of a woman of a woman struggling to regain her body after the birth of her child

577
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,160
just touched her i i was yet i was just a mere conduit for the work of miss lori morgan

578
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,680
that reminds me i was at a wedding once and the mother son dance was helen reddy's you and me

579
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,200
against the world and it and it was like oh she's not she's not ready to let go of it she's holding

580
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:07,920
them too tight that's the most on the nose song choice that you could pick uh here's another

581
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,640
question uh sir do you have any advice for an actor trying to keep his voice healthy and working

582
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:20,240
on stage i get so much conflicting information that i'm not sure what is and is not good for

583
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,640
my singing for instance i have a professor that swears by milk and a voice teacher who says not

584
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,080
to touch any dairy near our performance date what rituals have you done to keep in working order

585
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:36,640
and that's from singing the blues at swine palace oh man okay so there's everyone will tell you

586
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,320
something different the only things that can that just are fail safes are you have to sleep eight

587
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:48,320
hours a night and you have to drink like so much water but then find the balance that you're not

588
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:55,920
peeing your pants on stage when i started doing in the heights i i had no idea how like about

589
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:03,120
nutrition i used to eat just personal pan pizzas for three meals a day in my head this is what i

590
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:09,680
knew about nutrition i was like oh it's the exact same size as my stomach there's a hole it fills

591
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,720
the hole it's done you turn those little pizzas into tony's that's that's the most incredible

592
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,960
alchemical transformation i've ever heard of but then off broadway i would i just running on fumes

593
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,040
i would think i'll have coffee and a muffin then i'll do a two and a half hour show and then i go

594
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,920
hey why is everything gray and why am i gonna fall down dead in front of all these people

595
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:37,280
um so nutrition like just like getting your food in like and and having digested like an

596
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:44,400
hour before showtime is clutch because you know i was i was rapping on stage and i just became like

597
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,600
the burping monster if i ate too close to the thing so that's that's one of those things you

598
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:54,880
don't think about unless you're doing it um you have to like eat way before and and drink lots

599
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,360
of water so that you're not going through the things humans go through when you're actually

600
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:06,320
on stage you could do what our dad swears by what's that hot dr pepper hot dr pepper that's

601
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:14,400
that's hot that's a real thing tea and coffee hot and he's like our dad doesn't drink coffee or tea

602
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,960
or alcohol he drinks hot dr pepper because he's a robot sent from the future to kill all of us

603
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:28,560
he also used a you know uh maxi pad to i'm so glad i'm so glad that you know that story to tend

604
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:33,120
to a wound on his butt he's gonna hear that and be honored that you know that i know that you've

605
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,760
got your hands full with a lot of projects right now but would you consider your next project being

606
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:45,280
the story of our dad's maxi pad makeshift survivor bandage yes i think that's i think that's rife to

607
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:52,160
not a lot of meat on those bones maybe for like a one-act competition or something here's yeah

608
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,360
absolutely here's the plan you star in the tv series of it and we turn it into a movie

609
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,840
all of a sudden you got the egot for our dad's lacerated butt cheek

610
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,200
although i really feel like that's more of a brandy quade

611
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,400
sorry lynn listen i'm sorry to be the one to break this to you we have to remove you from the

612
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:18,720
project it's uh listen randy k quay just came out and just like fucking knocked it out of the park

613
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,560
he wrote some songs on spec yeah performed them himself he was so fucking realistic i

614
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:29,360
asked him to borrow 20 dollars okay well you know what he did another question he cut his

615
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:35,520
own butt cheek open in front of us it was like the scene in fame he was just cutting us is this

616
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,960
what you want it is what we wanted god i have another question what would be the worst hollywood

617
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,840
hit to adapt into a musical i would have said rocky but it looks like that's mood that's from

618
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,320
thomas yeah it already happened i i think the the the general rule is it's got to be something

619
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:58,560
that's not dependent on the star like one of the biggest flops of all time was big the musical

620
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:06,800
uh because hey that whole movie is tom hanks his face being charming um but elf has hung in there

621
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:14,640
yeah elvis elvis that's true it's a holiday angle maybe yeah yeah it's got like a a season to wrap

622
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,720
around and it comes out every christmas like it kind of wraps around that but i don't know when i

623
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,160
see a movie adaptation even some of the best ones like i'm just kind of waiting for the scene i like

624
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,200
yeah to happen right and that that becomes uh i don't know that becomes kind of a tough thing

625
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,640
that's why producers really worked because that really was like a thing about the theater whereas

626
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,960
young frankenstein's a movie genre parody so you're just waiting for gene hackman to show up

627
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,800
i remember i also think i also think that it's uh it has to do with character thing and that's the

628
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:48,880
difference between like elf and big is elf is the character buddy the elf that was played very well

629
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,800
it's like shrek the musical you know i mean you're going to see shrek you're going to see tom hanks

630
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,360
in big he's not doing a character he's just being tom hanks i remember when i went to our local

631
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:03,280
community theater's production of uh titanic the adaptation of the film titanic i was just like

632
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,800
where's the jugs just waiting for i checked the where's that french girl i checked the playbill

633
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:14,960
just like looking for a clue of where the jugs might be um they weren't there it's mostly just

634
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,440
like singing and some hydraulics in case anyone's wondering what the main difference between like

635
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,200
having a guspert and just like recording with my brothers is earlier when manuel said that gene

636
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,840
hackman was in young frankenstein and i didn't say anything and i've been sitting on it for the last

637
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:39,200
five minutes i'm sorry is g wilder then is g wilder oh man you just lost a tony you got forwarded

638
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,880
i'll do it gene gene hackman's the blind man in the blind man scene oh damn it oh my

639
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:54,480
oh give me my

640
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,840
so oh my god i took my headphones off because it got so awkward and then i put them back on just

641
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:14,320
in oh fellas fucking hey man listen that's literally the first time in history not just

642
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,280
this podcast the history of the world that travis got schooled on some sort of mel brooks movie

643
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:25,760
minutia well done it was amazing can i counter with a musical question okay so there's a musical

644
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:30,640
being made of your life who plays you oh fuck between brothers are you actually asking the

645
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,640
three of us or is this i'm actually asking the three of you oh my god i would get griffin to

646
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:41,440
play me i mean he knows me pretty well i've heard him saying he does well yeah uh i always thought

647
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:47,840
i was kind of a peter o'toole okay you can't really yeah i'm sorry to tell you you can't

648
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:56,080
really say that out loud you know i get a lot of um i get a lot of people who uh i guess when they

649
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,080
see me for the first time or something they say i look like elijah wood and i don't fucking get

650
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,600
it like at all i think it's literally just like dudes with brown hair and glasses that aren't

651
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:12,320
super tall um maybe we have the same frame the same sort of physical we cast the same uh the

652
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,840
same silhouette um i don't know how he is as a singer though i don't know that i've ever heard

653
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:24,080
him sing for a long time i got krista tan well yeah fucking yeah well yeah dead ringer the

654
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,760
problem is i've always been compared to people that like are older than me no one says you look

655
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:35,920
like this 16 year old kid i know so can i cast someone who's like 15 years my senior to play me

656
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,400
if the musical is set 15 years from now yeah absolutely to you in the future i just wonder

657
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,440
how these scribes are going to write so many songs for my musical about looking up low calorie recipes

658
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,520
on the internet and trying to make them because that's pretty much what my life is these days

659
01:09:51,520 --> 01:10:00,240
okay here's how i cast you gentlemen okay justin peter gallagher fucking what that's bullshit i

660
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,640
wanted peter gallagher so bad you don't want to be the gallagher he's my favorite living man it's

661
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,480
me justin mcelroy listen you'll get him next time don't salt lind manuel's game let me give you a

662
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:21,760
smear okay griffin also peter um gallagher too the gallagher it'll be like that frankenstein show

663
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:28,800
where they switch roles every night justin gets gallagher monday wednesday friday well i would say

664
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,680
in keeping with the with the young brown haired man with glasses i would have daniel radcliffe

665
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:39,280
play okay i love it can i tell you a problem though yeah basically everyone's seen his dick

666
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:46,320
haven't they yeah oh my god i've seen it i like reminded me i saw it i like to okay i have a lot

667
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,440
of questions let me just say i a i like to keep my stuff mysterious um so that wouldn't that

668
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,760
casting really wouldn't work for me let's send it back maybe we can get quayne the picture um

669
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:04,000
b how was that tech though because i haven't actually seen it it was actually it was fine

670
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:11,440
but here's my counter proposal okay we rewrite equus the musical it stars but the main character's

671
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,400
name is griffin okay and he likes to fucking blind fantastic and that way daniel here's the

672
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:22,560
other issue though is that equus the musical uh is basically our podcast for the past three and a

673
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,920
half years we have to put some music to the words we've been saying but i think the content's all

674
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:38,160
there who's travis who's travis um uh yeah either krista tan or michael gambon and we said it way in

675
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,480
the future i love it oh my god if there is ever i don't know why i picked so many british guys

676
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,160
for you but that's just what i love that michael gambon plays older travis he's looking back at

677
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:52,560
younger travis and then i get cast in it so i can be yeah i also want to tony let me into your club

678
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,480
land if there was ever a movie with peter gallagher daniel racliff and travis mcelroy i would invent

679
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:05,040
a new format that's better than blu-rays so i and have that be the only film in the format because

680
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,320
that's how i would want to that way you could really clearly see my facial expressions because

681
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,280
i had no idea what to do acting with the two of them hey hey harry potter and the dude from the

682
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:19,280
oc it's really remember hey remember when you were sandy cohen i love assault my game uh i got

683
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:24,880
another question for you lynn all right this is a little this is a little more serious this is

684
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,840
the theater is my passion but my passion does not pay the bills i have found some success in stage

685
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,760
managing locally it's not enough to support my lifestyle namely eating and having a roof over

686
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,680
my head i have a full-time career so selfish not not not fulfilling and often prevents me from doing

687
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:45,920
more theater projects learn to forage uh how do i find balance between needing money to live

688
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,960
and living for the arts and that's from it's a hard knock life in north cornwall township pa

689
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:58,640
oh that's theater hotspot yes hotbed uh timeout i mean we shouldn't we shouldn't hate because

690
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,720
like we did theater for christ like decades in huntington west virginia the great white way

691
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:12,240
which i say because it's only white people there dude their production of saigon did not work

692
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:17,520
travis was that this is no shit travis was i think you're joking travis was in a production

693
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:24,640
of uh fame where oh christ what was the role now forget oh okay well griffin more strike you're

694
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:31,280
right in that we did have there's a uh a tyrone show named tyrone who is a young african american

695
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:37,600
man who sings a song about being black that includes lines like you know i don't want no

696
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,520

01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:20,240
was tanning um every day for 25 minutes a day that's what that's the you know i'm getting those

702
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,920
stories now with heights because heights is getting done all over the country and they're

703
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:32,400

706
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:51,920
uh that's where it came from uh god i wish somebody would write plays for white people

707
01:14:52,640 --> 01:15:01,200
for once lind said should this person move you know well i mean if this person well listen

708
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,640
everyone's trying to find that balance right of of doing what you love and still having a roof over

709
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:12,000
your head i was a professional substitute teacher for eight years when i was telling everyone i was

710
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,520
a writer um i was in fact telling my kids when i was subbing and they would just yell and throw

711
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:23,440
things at me i'd be like i've got big dreams let's turn to chapter three i don't know i don't know

712
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:32,240
maths yes but i'm workshopping this kids tell me what you think um so you know that's that's the

713
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:37,120
hard thing it's like finding jobs that that give you flexibility that's why a lot of actors or

714
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:42,160
waiters i was a sub i was like a professional sub uh forever i used to dance at bar mitzvahs

715
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:46,000
like and not even like that's something they came that's something they hire out

716
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:55,920
yeah and it's really weirdly pimpish it's like they hire you to be a guy to encourage kids to

717
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:02,080
dance so you feel you're literally asking 13 year olds like hey rachel you're a woman now why don't

718
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:08,880
you get your friends to come dance oh my god lynn i did this exact job at gino's pub and family fun

719
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:16,960
center except i put on a hawaiian shirt and got people to do ymca same thing right oh basically

720
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,000
yeah it's it's tough it's tough that's that's did you do i could have used you at like a couple

721
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,560
homecomings i see i feel like you could like run hey griffin get up and dance with me yeah

722
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,320
yeah and literally be like hey sweet caroline i know this one to you guys oh jesus christ that's

723
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,800
incredible why didn't you go out of dignity obviously i'm out of dignity obviously you've

724
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,840
done very well for yourself in the in the the acting circuit but did you ever consider going

725
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:50,640
pro at the dance band circuit i'm i'm so scared one day a video is going to emerge and and it'll

726
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:59,200
all be over just be dancing with like a 13 year old girl doing the macarena everything will end

727
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,040
that'll be the clip for your in memoriam

728
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:13,120
i saw a great tweet for rob low after the uh during the oscars he said that uh every time uh

729
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:18,160
they get a shot of him opening a door and smiling he wonders if it'll that's the one they'll use for

730
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:26,880
it okay i was at a function i didn't really want to be at recently everyone was wearing ties and

731
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,400
fresh haircuts the subject of musicals was brought up whereupon i mentioned that i love them when

732
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,600
asked what i like i said that singing in the rain and phantom of the opera are two of my favorites

733
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,600
these selections were met with a certain amount of eye rolling and dismissal obviously i've seen

734
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,480
other musicals but i feel that these are famous and frequent favorites for a reason still i was

735
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:51,280
phased out of a conversation where musicals were discussed almost exclusively uh by lyricists

736
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,000
slash composer brothers gespert what is the most obnoxiously obscure broadway musical i could

737
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:02,160
spring on snooty theater know it at all that's from petty prospective playbill pedant that's

738
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:08,160
fun oh these friends sound like the worst like the pits right one appreciate the class is there

739
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:13,840
yeah singing the rain is like the best movie musical ever it's very good and phantom how old

740
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,480
are you griffin phantom's older than griffin it's been running on broadway longer than i am 14 years

741
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:26,240
old and he owns a house and i own a house and that fucked up yeah no it's literally been running uh

742
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:32,880
two thirds of my life and you know why this is i always wonder at it i think it's because it gets

743
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:41,040
at like your most emo teenager thing it's like about like a guy who's like i'm hideously ugly

744
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:48,560
but secretly i'm a genius christ they are gonna remake this and it's gonna be called friend zone

745
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,600
and instead of a mask and horrible facial disfiguration it'll be a fedora and horrible

746
01:18:53,600 --> 01:19:02,320
facial disfiguration um but you know uh if you want i mean if you want to say if you want to

747
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:08,240
like be really like highbrow you just say uh floyd collins floyd collins is like this really great

748
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:13,040
musical by adam gettle about a guy who was stuck in a well and it didn't run that long so no one

749
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,360
actually saw it but everyone pretends to have seen it and they go oh well i saw floyd collins

750
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:24,880
is there a is there a sort of relationship that sort of exists in uh in in in music where

751
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:33,120
if your show can make it to broadway it is no longer you know underground is there sort of

752
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:39,760
that same sort of indie dichotomy of like once a band becomes so popular that like like pitchfork

753
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,720
reviews them or features them as best new music that they're not underground anymore like once

754
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:50,640
you won your tony did people just write you off they're like oh he's bullshit i know i know him

755
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:56,800
before he was i saw heights before it was cool i saw dancing on a 13 year old girl i liked this

756
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:02,800
old stuff when he was dancing with the macarena at bar mitzvahs yeah yeah i liked his early stuff

757
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:10,960
with rachel um no but uh you know the the thing that happens with musical theater snobs is they

758
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:16,400
like the thing that ran 10 performances or 11 performances and like flopped because no one went

759
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,800
to see it and they're like oh well i saw because they're the only weird they're the only ones in

760
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:26,880
the room who saw that that like sort of experience is fossilized in amber that's kind of like a weird

761
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:32,560
uh i i've never really thought about three repercussions of like the the the potential for

762
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,560
being a snooty fan of theater because people can't seek out like they literally can't seek out this

763
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:44,480
thing that you saw like you they they can lay no claim to it whatsoever because it's so right

764
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:50,080
from forever the holy grail like i don't know seeing nirvana when it was in the garage was

765
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:55,280
seeing carry the musical because it was like the biggest bomb of all time and there was like a

766
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:01,680
crazy hip-hop gym number and so like if you saw carry when it was running like way more people

767
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,920
claim to have seen it than actually saw it that's great well that's the crazy thing about it right

768
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,800
because almost by definition is if something is really fantastic and like something you have to

769
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:18,640
see then it will be around for longer right yeah i saw i saw the original actor in the spider-man

770
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:26,400
musical before he broke every bone below his penis he shattered every bone below his penis

771
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,240
in the greatest fall i've ever seen you know you joke but it's funny there's like a whole like

772
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:36,560
movement of people who are like i saw the tamer version before they recut it and it was so much

773
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:41,680
better like there's totally that that's the that's the corollary to the like hipster i saw it before

774
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:49,360
it was popular thing um i was like i saw it when it was bad it was great um is there are the room

775
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:58,960
of of of musicals i guess um yes and it's called dance of the vampires and it was um i'm already so

776
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:05,280
fucking on board of this rock it was a huge hit in germany of course it fucking was ran

777
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:11,280
14 performances on broadway and it was all jim steinman music and he's the guy who wrote all of

778
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:21,040
like meatloaf's tunes right okay yes and so it was vampire porn mixed with you know uh i would do

779
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,920
anything for love fucking fan so it was it was like basically every movie johnny depp's ever been

780
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:32,000
in it was a three hour musical with four songs in it is what you're telling me and and lots of

781
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,680
emoting and feelings yeah terrific i am so do you know how i wake up angry that jim steinman never

782
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:43,040
got to make his batman musical i wake up angry and go to bed angry about it i love me some jim

783
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:48,240
steinman my favorite rumor about jim steinman i've never met him i'm sure he's awesome uh but

784
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,320
my favorite rumor about jim steinman is if he goes into restaurants and goes i will take everything

785
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:58,320
on the menu thank you that's like a thing i've heard people who have eaten with him say he goes
