1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,680
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's my brother, my brother, and me at Advice

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,200
Show for the modern era, our special Labor Day edition of our program.

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,440
Yeah, that means- We didn't stop working. What's that?

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,000
It's Labor Day, baby. It's time to split those giant giants wide open and get some babies out

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,960
of them. Let's induce this Labor Day. Let's induce this Labor Day and give birth to a new day for

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,040
our nation. I don't think it's both ethically and morally dubious Labor Day, because I don't

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,480
think it's right to induce the labor just so that you can participate in the holiday. I don't think

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,440
it's right to plan your conception nine months ahead of time, which would be, that's like what,

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,920
early December or something like that. Who the fuck wants to have sex in early December?

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Not this time. Well, you do it and you stay warm and you don't die in the cold.

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
True love waits until February. You have all those necessity babies.

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,360
Yeah, sure, sure. Boy, if you have your baby on Labor Day and your first words to your baby are,

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,720
get it, that baby's going to grow up with a really, really, really great sense of humor.

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,440
Well, the problem is, if you have a baby on Labor Day, it's instantly in a union.

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,040
Yeah, that's true. And let me tell you, the baby union, their strikes are unscabable.

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Can't be done. You cannot scab a baby union. Everyone will know the difference.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
How are you going to cross a baby picket line? They're adorable.

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
It's quite easy. I mean, they're fucking knee high. You can just-

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
Well, that's what I'm saying. You got to be careful. You'll trip right over them.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,600
Yeah, it is a tripping hazard. And they can bite you. That's babies. And their picket

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,080
signs are incoherent. They're nothing. They're just prints of their hands in paint. It's not

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
even making a really great statement. Unless they're hyper religious or

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
super politically active parents make them hold the signs. I hate that shit.

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,920
That kid does not actually think that God hates fags. I know that as a fact.

29
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,440
That kid, God loves Pogs is what that kid wants to hold up. God, give me more Pokemon cards,

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,040
please. I pray every day for them and nothing. Dear God, Yu-Gi-Oh. Signed, Dave. David, the kid.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,840
That's what happens.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,120
He's like Yu-Gi-Oh?

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,560
You pray for Jesus to bring you Yu-Gi-Oh cards. And when he doesn't,

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
you blame the homosexuals. And that's how Fred Phelps was born.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
Okay. So he is the ultimate Yu-Gi-Oh master.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,760
No, he would be. He would be if Jesus had brought him some Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,240
Jesus won't bring him any Yu-Gi-Ohs, so he hates gays. I mean, that's canon at this point, I think.

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,960
I guess everything that we've said so far makes sense.

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,200
I bet when this episode started that my brother, my brother and me historians weren't ready that

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,280
they're going to have to crack open the hall of fame vault to put the baby union bit in.

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,240
Protesting babies, Salah Gold.

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,800
So soon after they just dipped in last week to put in a...

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,200
What hilarious bit from last week did they put in? I forget.

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,800
Romney Calatis.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,280
Romney Calatis. They dipped in to put in Romney Calatis,

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,440
now they're going to have to trek right back to the hall of fame to put baby unions in.

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,160
Guys, let's spread it wide. Let's use our kegels.

48
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Let's not belabor the day.

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,480
Let's push this six pound, four ounce. Is that small?

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
I feel like that's normal. Let's just get this baby of humor out of us.

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Let's just get this humor baby out.

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,880
The humor is crowning, let's go.

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,120
Okay.

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
These jokes are six centimeters dilating. I can see the top of its goofs.

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,760
Hall of fame.

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,800
I always have the... Oh, on this show we answer questions, but not...

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,560
But usually we just make fun of people, but it's like a question show,

58
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
and we'll answer something. Here we go.

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
I always have the same problem when I'm at a party or out with friends.

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,200
For whatever reason, I'm always introduced to new people just after I come out of the bathroom.

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,440
My hands are still a little wet from washing,

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,680
so now I'm stuck stepping out of a bathroom and immediately giving a damp handshake.

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
It doesn't make for a good first impression.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
So what's the proper response to a handshake request when you have wet hands?

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,600
That's washed in Wisconsin. Well washed.

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
There's so many options.

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,840
There's literally dozens, if not hundreds of options.

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,960
Can I help you with just like the top one? Just dry your fucking hands.

69
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
Dry your fucking hands. That's what your jeans are for.

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
That's why you have like... That's why they have his and hers.

71
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
You know what? That's a new good adult rule.

72
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960
Don't go to parties unless they have fucking guest towels.

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,640
Yeah, if they don't have a guest towel, you need to depart.

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,680
You need to walk out of the bathroom with your hands aloft and say,

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
I am leaving to go home to dry my hands.

76
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't meet your new girlfriend right now.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,720
My hands are damp because this party is bullshit.

78
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,640
Why are you shaking anybody's hand? That's a germ factory.

79
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,840
You got to give them elbow bumps, which is the new thing.

80
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,160
I'll do that at a trade show where I don't want to...

81
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
Hi, I've never met you. You're from a different country.

82
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,920
Let's just elbow bump because I don't want contagion happening to me.

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,720
Sometimes, though, people will get overzealous with the bump

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,160
and they'll want to prove to you that they've got some juice in the tip.

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,440
Oh, that's the worst.

86
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
And it'll turn into a forearm shiver.

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
Oh, my God.

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
That's brutal.

89
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah, because your forearm is just like a... It's just a big petri dish.

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,520
My... Well, mine is brittle.

91
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
Yeah. Your elbow?

92
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,920
It's practically avian. And when people give me a big bash,

93
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,720
it's like, ugh, it really hurts.

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,280
What I do in this situation whenever I have not washed or not dried my hands properly...

95
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
Okay, so a little bit of Freudian truth in there, but go on.

96
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
When I have not dried my hands, I just come out and someone tries to introduce me

97
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,040
and I say, we're not going to shake. We're going to hug.

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,240
And then I just hug them and I wipe my hands on their back.

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,440
Well, that's a good point because isn't your whole body a little damp?

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Excuse me?

101
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,360
Excuse me? Excuse me?

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,440
Like when you wash it, you really... You guys just get your hands, huh?

103
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,320
So you're saying like when you're at a party and you use the bathroom,

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,440
you take a shower?

105
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
You take a quick shower.

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
I mean, I use the sink. It's not like a full production.

107
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
Oh, you take a hobo bath.

108
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,720
Every part of me does. Yeah, I take a library bath.

109
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
Every part of me does get wet.

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,040
Sure, you get in there.

111
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,520
Let's break this down because we've never really... We've talked about,

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,000
I think, probably the politics of hand washing 20 times, but you're not touching...

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,480
You're not actually touching like your butthole or your poopy or your pee-pee or your wee.

114
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,280
You know what I'm saying?

115
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,200
Like there's paper there.

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,920
So it's all in your head anyway.

117
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,960
So like, I guess it's just that you're getting like poop particles from the air up on it,

118
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,840
up on your hands.

119
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,400
And if that's the case, then your whole body is contaminated.

120
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
That's... I mean, that's a fair point.

121
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
We're all contaminated.

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,680
Honestly, your immune system could do well to get some...

123
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,880
So, hold on.

124
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,360
I'm sorry, Justin, but Griffin, are you saying that you don't believe hand washing in any way helps?

125
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm saying... I'm saying you go to a different country.

126
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Throw a dartboard at it.

127
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,000
Throw a whole dartboard at a map.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,760
Throw a dartboard at the wall.

129
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,360
Okay, and then get a dart.

130
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,920
And then leave their house because you will be asked to leave their house.

131
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,440
Throw a dart at a map.

132
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,880
Flip a pool table.

133
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,920
And chances are, whatever country it lands in, they don't even bother.

134
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,840
It's just not a cultural thing for them.

135
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,880
And so you're saying that any other country other than America

136
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,000
not only doesn't wash their hands, but it's far healthier than America?

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,560
There's a few.

138
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,520
Greenland washes.

139
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,360
Australia.

140
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,120
Well, West Australia washes.

141
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,480
East Australia, they don't give a fuck.

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,040
They wash their hands backwards.

143
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,720
The water flows upwards.

144
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,320
Griffin goes to two countries and suddenly he's seeing everything from a global perspective.

145
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm just saying you have to... everything is connected, you guys.

146
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
The world is getting smaller.

147
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
Are you a citizen of the world yet?

148
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,360
I am a citizen of the Northern Hemisphere.

149
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm still working on getting my credentials for the Southern Hemisphere.

150
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
But really, what do they have for us down there?

151
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
That's the... it's the party hemisphere.

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,680
Yeah.

153
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,280
I think we probably got all the gold.

154
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,520
Yeah, it's true.

155
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
That's all they had.

156
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,800
We got all the gold out of there, so...

157
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
Thanks, Cortez.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,880
You're the best.

159
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,960
I don't... I don't know.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
What if you just, like, as you were shaking their hand,

161
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
you just leaned in and said, it's not pee, don't worry.

162
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,200
You have to say that.

163
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
That you're joking, but you do...

164
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
I think the pee on my hands are nothing.

165
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,440
If your hands are wet, if their hand, when they pull it away, is wet from your wetness,

166
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,000
guess what?

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
You gotta bring it up.

168
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
Or you just assert your dominance in the situation.

169
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
I mean, that is a power move.

170
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,680
Yeah, that's my hand now.

171
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
It may or may not be pee.

172
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,880
You may or may not have my pee on there.

173
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
How is that?

174
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
I'll be able to find that hand later, because I marked it.

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,840
No one else better touch that hand.

176
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,880
Somebody give me a UV light, that's mine.

177
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,400
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

178
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,960
I'm just saying, either dry your hands or possibly,

179
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,720
as soon as you show up to the party,

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,040
as soon as you feel that you have to go to the bathroom,

181
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
look around the room in like a panic state,

182
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
like, fuck, I've gotta meet everybody real quick.

183
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
Assuming you're at a private party,

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,640
like, why are you even washing your hands in a private bathroom?

185
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
The only reason to wash your hands is because somebody walks in there

186
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
who looks kinda judgy, or you know him.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,280
Yeah, or you just gotta turn the water on for like 10 seconds.

188
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,960
You don't have to, don't even bother getting wet.

189
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,320
That's a good thing.

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
Just turn the water on, somebody will hear you outside.

191
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,320
Count to four.

192
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
He's a good, good washer boy.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,400
And then you walk out, and they think you're a good, good washer boy,

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,440
and they say, hey, you sound like a great washer.

195
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
My name is Dennis.

196
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,720
My name is Dennis.

197
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,080
And then you shake his hand.

198
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,760
He said, oh, you're a good dryer boy too,

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
because it is bone dry down there.

200
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,920
So dry.

201
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,200
You say, yeah, I've really got pretty much every concept mastered.

202
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
It's nice to meet you.

203
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,600
Listen, this may seem forward, but my name is Dennis Gulper,

204
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,480
and I'm the head of the Washing Hands Institute.

205
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
And I want to bring you in as the greatest ever.

206
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,080
I think you could be my champion.

207
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,160
But then suddenly you're living a lie.

208
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,160
And they're like, please tell us how you got so bone dry and so clean.

209
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
And you're like, uh, buh.

210
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
They're trying to study, because it's like impossible.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,760
He promises he washed his hands.

212
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,240
Yeah.

213
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
I don't see how he got them.

214
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,960
Why would he lie to me?

215
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,280
A lot of people tell you to sing Row, Row, Row Your Boat to keep track.

216
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,840
That's a lie.

217
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,840
I do the chorus from Hold On.

218
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,280
Just one go of the chorus from Hold On by Wilson Pickett.

219
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,680
Who is it?

220
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,840
It's Wilson Phillips.

221
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,120
I think it's Genius Phillips.

222
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
And what people never tell you is when you do it to a certain song,

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,680
you have to sing at the top of your lungs so that everyone outside knows

224
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,120
that you're doing it for the right amount of time.

225
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
It's good.

226
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
It's good at a party to just be like, or how about awake?

227
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,920
Just like total silence and condolence and crying.

228
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,240
And then someday somebody's going to tell you to go around and wash your hands.

229
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,160
Get the germs off there.

230
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,840
Someone's a good washer boy.

231
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,600
If you guys were to guess what percentage wise, if 100% is all.

232
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,360
Yeah, that's typically how it works.

233
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,520
Seems mathematically correct.

234
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,680
It sounds so far.

235
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,560
What percent would you say wash their hands when somebody enters a room

236
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,640
and is in there with them versus wash their hands when they're alone?

237
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
100%.

238
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,960
There's a lot of politics that we're going over again here.

239
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,200
Like if it's a bathroom with stalls and then you're in the stall

240
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
and someone else comes in and sits in the stall next to you,

241
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,960
but doesn't see your face, you're free to walk out.

242
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,480
Okay.

243
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
I'm talking percentages though.

244
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,320
Do you think no one is doing it for their own edificate?

245
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,120
Like, are you guys suggesting that if you are by yourself,

246
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,880
no one is washing their hands in the bathroom?

247
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,080
I don't know.

248
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,280
Since I have tightened up my hand washing habits,

249
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,520
I have found myself getting sick less,

250
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,920
which I think there's some science to that probably.

251
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
What I do every time I go to the bathroom,

252
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,160
I wash my hands and then brush my teeth and then comb my hair every time.

253
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
Three times.

254
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,720
Travis is an 80 year old man.

255
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,720
And then I hand the towel back to the attendant

256
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,280
and I say thank you so much and I can give him a dollar.

257
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,200
Speaking of the attendant,

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
I wanted to talk about bathroom attendants for a second.

259
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,480
Okay.

260
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
As far as I know, they're only in airports.

261
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
Maybe in strip clubs I've seen twice.

262
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,960
And I don't understand why they are in the airport.

263
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,400
And I don't understand why I see shoe shiners in the airport

264
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,280
and only, only there.

265
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,080
So this is my question.

266
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,640
Because we have to have jobs for our poetry majors.

267
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,440
That is very funny, but it doesn't answer my question.

268
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,920
Is the airport, is there another rich person world

269
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,880
that is going on in parallel to ours

270
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,880
that we only have access to at the airport

271
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,080
because I mean, that's why like-

272
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,680
So are you asking like, is the airport a great equalizer?

273
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,000
Where you get a peek into-

274
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,840
Is that the only place where our two sort of realities crossover?

275
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,760
Because just the logistics of building a rich person airport

276
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
is just beyond the pale.

277
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,040
Sure.

278
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,360
It is the only place where you see sort of what's going,

279
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
like $40 for headphones at Brookstone.

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,720
Sure.

281
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
Chili's to go.

282
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,880
I've got an alternate theory

283
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
and it is from my time in my recent time in Germany,

284
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,840
every single restaurant, every single one,

285
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,120
every single place we went to,

286
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
their bathroom had an attendant

287
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,480
and they sat outside between the men and women's room

288
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,160
and would offer you toiletries or anything that you wanted.

289
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,600
So my theory is they're all German immigrants

290
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
who came to America with stars in their eyes

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
and then they just kind of got to the airport

292
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,400
and they're like, ah, fuck it.

293
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,440
This is fine.

294
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
This is fine.

295
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,640
I've always wanted to like when I was at a restaurant

296
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,240
because I've been to several restaurants

297
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,080
that had a bathroom attendant.

298
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,960
I know.

299
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,760
Count it.

300
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
And I've always, I've been to several restaurants.

301
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,840
I was hoping you were going to stop there.

302
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,440
And every time I've seen an attendant,

303
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,960
I've always wanted to walk up to like,

304
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,000
you know, the maitre d' or the host or somebody and be like,

305
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
hey, a bathroom attendant was really nice

306
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,840
and have them go bathroom attendant.

307
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,240
Yeah.

308
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
What are you, oh no.

309
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,720
We had a bathroom attendant,

310
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,840
but he's been dead for 15 years.

311
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,480
Ghost poop face.

312
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,120
Okay.

313
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
Well, that's the end of the bit.

314
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,800
Can you edit that part out?

315
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,280
No, I can't.

316
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,600
I was hoping something funnier would come after face.

317
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:27,920
Okay.

318
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
I'm going to remember to do that,

319
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,880
but there might be a dog outside or something

320
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,680
while I'm editing.

321
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,840
So it's okay.

322
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,640
Don't worry about it.

323
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,440
You want a yahoo?

324
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,320
Give me a yahoo.

325
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,960
That feel better?

326
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,880
Ghost peeper?

327
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,760
Nope.

328
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
That's what I was hoping I would say.

329
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,480
Yeah, it's not, it's not much better.

330
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,320
Here's a, let's just go.

331
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,360
This one was sent in by, by Slimer.

332
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,400
That's how Slimer was born.

333
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,280
Thank you.

334
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,720
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

335
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,360
Thank you, Krista.

336
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,840
It's by yahoo answers user Kevin who asks,

337
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,440
if your celebrity crush says he or she will go out with you

338
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,600
if you eat just a little bit of his or her poop,

339
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,240
would you do it?

340
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,720
Oh God.

341
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,800
Yes.

342
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes.

343
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:29,840
No.

344
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,520
Can you reread the question?

345
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,640
If your celebrity crush says he or she will go out with you

346
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,880
if-

347
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,520
Stop right there.

348
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,080
Stop right there.

349
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,320
Okay.

350
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,640
Go out with you?

351
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,120
Listen, if you're talking about an ongoing relationship with my celebrity crush,

352
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
this isn't just a one-off situation, okay?

353
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,920
Anybody who begins the tenor of the relationship with,

354
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,280
just eat a little bit of my poop.

355
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,560
So how did you guys meet?

356
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,200
Well, funny story.

357
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,840
How did you guys meet?

358
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,400
It's a terrible-

359
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,120
What if that's, what if that's how I met your mother ends?

360
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:16,000
That whole time is the last shot of the show.

361
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,080
Is the two kids on the couch horrifying?

362
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,520
Yeah, the series finale, the episode is 30 seconds long

363
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
and Bob Saget's like, all right, here it comes.

364
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,280
Are you ready?

365
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,640
It's Penelope Cruz.

366
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
And she said, how do you feel about scat?

367
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,360
And I said, not great.

368
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,000
She said, well, tough, and then I ate just a little bit.

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,040
The end.

370
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,480
And then the camera pans around and Bob Saget is wearing a ball gag

371
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
or he's in chains.

372
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,920
Any other questions?

373
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,280
Now get out of here so your mom can poop on me.

374
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,680
And that is the story.

375
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,120
Now your mom says her little whore has done enough storytelling.

376
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,680
It's time to get upstairs and do my whore job.

377
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,520
Like a good little slut that I am, the dad from How I Met Your Mother.

378
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,240
I have to go.

379
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,240
Oh God.

380
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,040
Oh God.

381
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,160
Oh shit, that'd be great.

382
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,520
Those kids would be so angry.

383
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
Like we've been sitting here for seven years.

384
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,360
And that's how it ends?

385
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,480
The end of it is you eat a little bit of poop?

386
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
And he just looks and it goes, the aristocrats.

387
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,280
Yeah.

388
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,680
Really?

389
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
So you think it might be a celebrity mother?

390
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,360
And that's how I met your mother, Geena Davis.

391
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,760
Known archer and scat enthusiast and star of Cutthroat Island, Geena Davis.

392
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,800
Earth girls may be easy, but earth boys will eat your poopy.

393
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,720
It's science.

394
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
I also feel like this revealed too much

395
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
and letting people know that my celebrity crush is Geena Davis.

396
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,320
Now Geena Davis or earth girls are easy era Geena Davis?

397
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,560
Commander in chief, Geena Davis.

398
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,760
Like 1988 circa, Geena Davis.

399
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,480
Sure.

400
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
But also circa 1988, Annie McDowell.

401
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,520
Oh my God, yes.

402
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,040
I got some weird standards.

403
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
And it includes time travel.

404
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,640
I guess.

405
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,200
And being eight.

406
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,520
I don't want to talk about it.

407
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,000
There isn't, we're not equipped to, we're all in very happy relationships.

408
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,000
I feel like if this question was to hang out with a celebrity

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
you think you'd be best friends with.

410
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
Would you eat a little bit of Alton Brown's poopy?

411
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,680
Just to like hang out with him.

412
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,160
Yes.

413
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
Have you seen how well he eats?

414
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah, he would prepare it.

415
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
He got way healthy.

416
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Yeah, I was saying like, if you said like,

417
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,880
eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop, all over it.

418
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,560
Can we not have this conversation at all?

419
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,040
Travis would probably eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop

420
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,640
even if it meant not hanging.

421
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,280
Just cause.

422
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
Like just showed up in a FedEx box.

423
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
Even if I just ran into a dude on the street and luncheon

424
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
who said, hey, you want a bit of David Tennant's poop?

425
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
I would ask the price.

426
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Can this not happen?

427
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,280
Let me just ask, listen, I know you want to get off the subject

428
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,040
but I have like 75 more questions.

429
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,040
Do you think there are people out there,

430
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,000
and I really, I don't fancy myself a celebrity,

431
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,760
but do you think there are people out there

432
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
who would eat a little bit of our poop just to hang out with us?

433
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,940
Yeah.

434
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
I really hope not.

435
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,360
Like I super, super, super hope not.

436
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
Okay, let me rephrase.

437
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
I bet there are people out there that would just eat our poop.

438
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
I don't think it has anything to do with hanging out with us.

439
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
We're not Tennant level, but I think we have a little bit-

440
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,280
No, no, no.

441
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,040
I'm saying just because I think there are people out there

442
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,080
that like to eat poop.

443
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
Oh, sure, sure.

444
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,860
Okay.

445
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Guys, everything that's happening right now

446
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

447
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,500
Okay.

448
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Justin, there's not a single celebrity

449
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,640
whose poop you would eat to hang out with them?

450
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,280
There is not a single person whose poop-

451
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,480
Antonio Banderas.

452
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,540
Okay.

453
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,340
You got me.

454
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,620
Shit.

455
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,220
You got a cut to the core of me, Travis.

456
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,780
Let's, yeah, we gotta go.

457
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,100
I need to talk about like something like humans talk about.

458
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,500
I need to take like a big gulp of water and just-

459
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,000
Ugh.

460
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,020
Ugh.

461
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,060
Not a big gulp.

462
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,660
I hate this stupid podcast.

463
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,780
I just moved into an apartment for the new semester of my college year.

464
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,060
While my room looks good, I have an issue.

465
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,740
There is nothing on my walls.

466
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,300
I thought this wouldn't be an issue,

467
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
but staring at the void of nothing surrounding me

468
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,660
is starting to make me edgy.

469
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,580
So what should I put up there?

470
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,740
That's from Good Idealists in Georgia.

471
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,940
If you came to my brother, my brother and me live show,

472
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,900
you could buy a hip poster to put up there.

473
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,400
Yeah.

474
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,860
How about a poster featuring Antonio Banderas?

475
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,260
Yeah.

476
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,980
Well.

477
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,180
Star of stage and screen.

478
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,940
Concert posters are good.

479
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,340
God, did we really just make the jump from

480
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,140
scat cooking to interior design?

481
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

482
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,180
We never said it was cooked poop.

483
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,680
Sorry.

484
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,540
Yeah, concert poster.

485
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,940
Anything that you can have a story for.

486
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,900
Those are always fun.

487
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,260
You know what I've always wanted to do?

488
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,220
What's that, Travis?

489
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,020
And I don't know.

490
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,060
Like, it would depend on-

491
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,460
Can I guess Gina Davis's poop?

492
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,300
No, I haven't always wanted to do that.

493
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,860
Not until I saw Earth, Girls, or Easy.

494
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,540
No, like to have a bare wall and it would depend on your lease,

495
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,820
but to like draw or paint like your own mural or something,

496
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,420
and then you probably have to paint over it.

497
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:16,660
Sure.

498
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,620
That's going to look real good.

499
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,500
I mean, if you're artsy in any way.

500
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:20,900
No, no, no.

501
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,460
I know.

502
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm saying I've seen your watercolors.

503
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,580
I can actually draw and paint very well, Griffin.

504
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:26,900
I know.

505
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
I'm saying I've seen your watercolors.

506
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,740
Because it sounds insincere.

507
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,980
You're not coming across as a sincere person.

508
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,940
Can I try again?

509
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,540
Oh, I've seen your watercolors.

510
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,940
No, fuck.

511
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,900
Not helping.

512
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,860
That's going the wrong way.

513
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,580
I've seen your watercolors.

514
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,860
Nah, that's better.

515
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,340
Okay.

516
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,460
Well, it's like Michael Manny.

517
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,980
Do you remember his bedroom when he was a kid?

518
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,140
Sure, sure.

519
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,260
And it was just like on the wall.

520
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,780
His parents would let him just like draw.

521
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,580
Illustrator.

522
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,180
Illustrator of the My Brother, My Brother, and Me comic book origin story.

523
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
Now, the difference is that he is very good.

524
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,220
Yeah, but he was eight at the time.

525
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,780
Like, I'm saying if mom and dad let me draw on the wall when I was eight,

526
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,260
maybe I would be a very talented illustrator.

527
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,100
If mom and dad had let me drive a car at eight years old,

528
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,540
I would be a NASCAR driver right now.

529
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,300
I'm saying.

530
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,180
Is that the way it works?

531
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,140
That is basically it.

532
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,540
Yeah.

533
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,780
Eight is basically the cutoff for any career aspiration.

534
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,620
Just like Travis stopped aspiring to make love to women at the age of five.

535
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:17,860
Yeah.

536
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,460
Apparently.

537
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,420
It's frozen in time.

538
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,380
Yeah, it is.

539
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,420
In sexual amber.

540
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,420
After I met my five-year-old girlfriend, sexual amber.

541
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,740
Yeah.

542
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:28,980
Yeah.

543
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,940
I'm bad about that.

544
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,580
I don't think, in my apartment in Chicago,

545
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,180
my walls were completely bare in my bedroom.

546
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,300
And it was depressing.

547
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
It was like sleeping in a jail cell.

548
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,780
So you got to have something.

549
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,380
Don't go just like posters just like taped up bare.

550
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,540
If you don't put your fucking posters in a frame,

551
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,900
hang up this podcast.

552
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,500
You don't deserve to hear the words from our mouths

553
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,540
because you're a caveman.

554
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,700
I'm just going to use sticky tack.

555
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,780
Oh, that's going to look really great on the walls.

556
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,020
Oh, and the poster will be real bumpy afterwards.

557
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,740
Good.

558
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,700
I love it.

559
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,580
And probably rip.

560
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,220
What do you guys have hanging right now?

561
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,340
What's surrounding you right now?

562
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,660
Right now?

563
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,460
In the room.

564
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,700
Sorry.

565
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,980
In the room you're in. I'm going to start with Travis.

566
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,460
Okay.

567
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,180
Okay, great.

568
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,100
I'm sitting in my living room.

569
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,100
I've got lots of pictures of friends and family on the walls.

570
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,060
Why are you in the living room?

571
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,820
Because this is where I record, man.

572
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,620
It's where I live.

573
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:19,940
Okay.

574
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,180
Sorry.

575
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,820
Go ahead.

576
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,100
And I've got a painting that Teresa's sister did that's lovely.

577
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,460
A welcome sign from our old house.

578
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,060
And some shelves with candles on them.

579
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,180
Shelves is a fucking great way to go.

580
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,940
Get like standalone shelves.

581
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,260
You put all kinds of shit on there.

582
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
Man, what can't you put on a shelf?

583
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,180
You can put anything on a shelf.

584
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,380
That is our new-

585
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,900
My brother and my brother and me.

586
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,660
Shelves is fucking great.

587
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,700
Travis McElroy.

588
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,980
These shelves damn nice.

589
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,580
When we put our shelves up, it changed the way our house looks.

590
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,060
Knives, shot glasses, butter dishes.

591
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,580
Little like skulls with candles on them.

592
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,780
You know, just whatever.

593
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,500
Masking tape.

594
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,020
Dead animals.

595
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,980
Tar pics.

596
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,540
Everything.

597
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,180
Everything goes up there.

598
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,140
I've got a little-

599
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,580
I've got my Harvey Danger poster from the concert we went to in Chicago.

600
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Their next to last performance.

601
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
I've got a life well wasted poster.

602
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,540
And I've got one of those little height meters to show how much I've grown.

603
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,020
That's my special boy.

604
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,460
A lot of people think it's weird.

605
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,460
A lot of people think it's weird to do that to yourself.

606
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:37,380
For yourself when you move to a new apartment every single year since you were 19 years old.

607
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,340
But I want to know just how my bones are doing.

608
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,860
How my skeleton's doing.

609
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,260
You know?

610
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,940
Okay, so you're keeping track of how much you're shrinking year to year.

611
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
No, it's pretty much plateaued.

612
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,540
So it's really just one line that I keep drawing over and over again.

613
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,020
Also I should mention in different apartments every single year.

614
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,220
That part's important.

615
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,660
Right now I have no metric to measure against, I guess.

616
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,900
It's just nice for people to know.

617
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,820
Because maybe I'm getting robbed and they start in my office, which is where it is.

618
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,260
And then they go into the office and say,

619
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,860
Oh shit, this guy's five foot ten.

620
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,700
Let's get the fuck out of here.

621
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,020
You know?

622
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,140
You know what you should do?

623
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,540
What's that?

624
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,980
Take it one step further.

625
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,300
Okay.

626
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,660
And have somebody outline you on the wall.

627
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,460
Oh, that's fun.

628
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,740
And then just keep outlining you to see if you're getting fatter.

629
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:32,020
Somebody, the last person who owned my home measured their daughter's height on the inside

630
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,380
of my kitchen cupboard.

631
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,500
I discovered that.

632
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Why do they keep their daughter in the cupboard?

633
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,740
It was just written on there.

634
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,260
Oh, yeah.

635
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,020
Hey, so in my room, there's a...

636
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,380
This is going to take a half hour.

637
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,460
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

638
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,020
It's boring.

639
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,500
Yeah.

640
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,860
I don't want to talk about this anymore. It's boring.

641
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,100
Yeah.

642
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,420
I recently started a new job, but I got a problem.

643
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,420
My manager burps constantly, never excuses himself.

644
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,500
He mentioned once that he burps when he is hungry,

645
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,380
but that would mean he's hungry all the time.

646
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,180
The other day, your boss is Yogi Bear.

647
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,100
The other day, I think he burped in front of a customer and didn't say anything.

648
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,740
Also, these are not little burps.

649
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,940
Should I say something to him?

650
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,980
If so, what should I say?

651
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,700
Hey, is this just a guy trying the...

652
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,220
Is this just a guy thing that girls just have to deal with?

653
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,540
I was bullied by a burper in elementary school, so maybe I'm more sensitive to burps.

654
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,420
Please help me out.

655
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,540
Grossed out in Greenwich, who works for Travis.

656
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,340
I'm pretty sure it's Greenwich.

657
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,180
No, Greenwich.

658
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,620
I don't know why I said Greenwich.

659
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,340
I'm so sorry.

660
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,580
You edited that, so I said it.

661
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,300
Oh, a dog.

662
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,180
A, burps are completely natural.

663
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,820
Travis burps.

664
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,900
B, this gentleman needs to learn to excuse himself.

665
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,620
Travis burps.

666
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,380
Did you say, egg burps are completely natural?

667
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,780
Because I'm here to tell you, egg burps are the pits if they are the most unnatural thing.

668
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,140
I said the letter A.

669
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,180
Okay, it sounded like egg, so are you hungry right now?

670
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,300
Is that a burp?

671
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,660
I actually am very hungry.

672
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,780
I have not eaten all day.

673
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,260
Okay.

674
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,540
The first time God smelled an egg burp, he was like, I did not make that.

675
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,820
That one sounded like egg burp.

676
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,380
I'm hungry.

677
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,020
I did not make that, I blew it.

678
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,100
This is not of my creation.

679
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,060
That one's on seitan.

680
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,580
That was a seitan burp.

681
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,620
I have not eaten in the last three days to avoid burping.

682
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm trying to cut back.

683
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,300
I appreciate that.

684
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,300
No, Travis burps a lot.

685
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,740
Travis has the dyspepsia.

686
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,580
I have a disease.

687
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,140
You have a disease.

688
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,300
He tries to blame it on a disease, but it's really just rude.

689
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,860
I don't know what the-

690
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,220
It's not rude.

691
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,540
The disease doesn't make you open your fucking mouth when you burp like you do.

692
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,620
If I don't burp, I'll vomit.

693
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,100
The disease doesn't make you go to the trophy store and buy one every time.

694
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,100
I'm just saying.

695
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
I had one once that was like three minutes long.

696
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,500
It sounded like a demon was coming out of me and it was epic.

697
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:50,900
That's fine, but-

698
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,860
How does the disease prevent you from covering your goddamn mouth every time?

699
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,820
Or not buying a t-shirt.

700
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,940
Because I'm not a child.

701
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,500
I'll burp when I want to in my own goddamn house.

702
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,820
But you're often not in your house.

703
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,020
I'll burp in your house.

704
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,700
I'll burp in anyone's house.

705
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,100
I would not, could not in a house.

706
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,460
One time I actually heard Travis burp out the words Cincinnati King of Burps, which-

707
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,940
To be fair, that was during a job interview and I nailed it.

708
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,300
And now I'm this person's boss.

709
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,660
So I'm climbing up the ladder.

710
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,260
I'm afraid I might have-

711
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,100
This past year, I've been burping a lot.

712
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,580
And it's really not from a place of pride like Travis.

713
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,020
I'm deeply ashamed every time I do it.

714
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,620
And I live with my girlfriend now.

715
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,980
So she has to like-

716
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,100
I always try to be dainty about it.

717
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,460
So that's a sin trying to come out.

718
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,220
I try to be dainty, probably.

719
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,500
I try to be dainty about it, but there's just nothing doing.

720
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,020
And I always feel this need to just apologize profusely every time it happens.

721
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,700
You should just hide it behind a lace fan.

722
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,340
Put your gloved hand to the back of your hand, to your mouth.

723
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,180
And hide it.

724
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,660
Because apparently you're a Victorian person.

725
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,260
Just burp like an American.

726
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,820
I faint every time too, which is nice.

727
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,060
Ah, that's the vapors.

728
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,620
No, it's horrible.

729
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,260
It's disgusting.

730
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,460
You're farting with your mouth.

731
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,340
And like you wouldn't-

732
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,380
In all seriousness, you should not-

733
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,300
Like this dude is wrong burping at a professional workplace

734
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,140
in front of customers as your boss.

735
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,900
Like don't get me wrong.

736
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,100
I celebrate my burps at home with friends where it's safe.

737
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,300
It's not, but go on.

738
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,780
But I'm saying, I think that you're perfectly in the right

739
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,900
to the next time he does it, be like, hey Chet, cut it out.

740
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,020
You realize that like when I'm like staying over at your house

741
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,580
on a trip or something like that and you burp,

742
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,220
the first thing I don't think is,

743
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,460
oh, this is a really safe environment for me to be in.

744
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,380
You don't think, well, I'm a guest in his house.

745
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,820
No, I think, are you fucking kidding me?

746
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,580
I'm holding a burp right now, you guys,

747
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
because I love you and I love our listeners.

748
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,740
When I know Griffin's coming to my house,

749
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,860
I turn on a nice scentsy.

750
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,220
I'll maybe select a scent cake to put in,

751
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,740
something I know he'll enjoy.

752
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,260
When Griffin goes to Travis's house,

753
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,900
Travis just burps in his face and shouts dominance.

754
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,780
Listen, I will not be bullied, all right?

755
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,660
Burp as you might, stand up.

756
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,060
I think it's an old fashioned,

757
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,340
you might as well be telling me about

758
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,900
how you're gonna get a phosphate down the soda fountain

759
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,900
and then pin a girl and go steady.

760
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,140
We're adults, it's 2012.

761
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,300
Burp if you want to, it shouldn't be offensive.

762
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,940
It's an archaic rule.

763
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,140
How does it upset anyone?

764
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,100
You burp so hard once my beer fell over.

765
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,500
How does it affect anyone

766
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,660
other than being children and giggling at it

767
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,620
because it's burping?

768
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,340
Because it smells like all the food you've eaten.

769
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,020
Burp loud, burp proud.

770
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,540
How far do you extend this?

771
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,580
Like do you shit in your hands and throw it at people?

772
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,180
No, of course not.

773
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,700
Gobble that up, pretend I'm Geena Davis.

774
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,860
No, because that has,

775
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,940
I also don't burp in people's faces.

776
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,620
I don't sneak up behind them while they're napping

777
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
and burping their ears as loud as I can.

778
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,140
So that would be hilarious.

779
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,260
You would excuse yourself to the corner to defecate it.

780
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,940
Like some sort of beast.

781
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,380
Is that what you're saying to me?

782
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,620
Listen, one step at a time.

783
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,180
Travis, some of us are trying to live in a society.

784
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,300
Right, over here.

785
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,380
Yeah, and I'm trying to make this society safer

786
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,740
with people with my disease.

787
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,900
You're saying, you're saying when you make it sound

788
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,020
like you're throwing up invisible vomit,

789
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,620
it's because it's for a fucking cause?

790
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,860
You're making a point?

791
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,380
Well, no, it's because I enjoy burping.

792
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,940
It's the, Travis is on the march of Grimes.

793
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
Oh man.

794
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,740
You are horrible.

795
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,860
Eat better.

796
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,220
Yeah, dude.

797
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,860
Just eat better.

798
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,940
Just treat yourself better food-wise.

799
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,740
Are you me?

800
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,060
Yeah.

801
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,260
Okay.

802
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,940
Do you know what's gonna help you

803
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,940
afford all the organic free range stuff that you need

804
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,260
to keep your tummy gurgles under control?

805
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,380
What's that?

806
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,620
The money zone.

807
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,460
I got this message.

808
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,460
It's from...

809
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,500
Urgent message, sir.

810
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,460
Urgent message for Across the Wires from boyfriend Dan.

811
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,140
This one's going out to Becky.

812
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,740
He says, happy birthday Becky.

813
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,420
Here's a slow jam for Becky.

814
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,100
Here's a slow jam for Becky.

815
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,820
I'll make love to you, my boys to men.

816
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,580
So you got me hooked on my bim-bim from the first time we talk.

817
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,060
So I figured there's no better way to wish you a happy birthday

818
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,780
than a shout out from the McElroy brothers.

819
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,260
The last three months have been the best ever

820
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,700
and I've got to, got to, got to.

821
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,460
You get the idea.

822
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
He says, and here's to more ahead.

823
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,420
Love you.

824
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,300
They're in love.

825
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,940
You get it.

826
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,740
Blah, blah, blah.

827
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,820
Listen, listen, listen.

828
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,660
Either you're in love and you feel intimidated

829
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,180
or you're not in love and you feel lonely.

830
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,820
Nobody needs to get in love.

831
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,820
How did we, how did we serve as the inception of a romance?

832
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,780
How did, how did that?

833
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,540
I don't want to know.

834
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,020
I don't know.

835
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,180
Yeah.

836
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,260
I don't know how you connect it to, you know,

837
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,540
there's this great show with three real ass brothers

838
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,180
talking about eating celebrity defecation.

839
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,100
Do you want to go out again or what's up?

840
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,260
Are we, am I good?

841
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,620
To be fair, I want to make it clear

842
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,740
that we're not talking about eating their poop recreationally.

843
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
I can't talk about it again.

844
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,220
I'm sorry.

845
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,740
I keep bringing it up.

846
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,380
It's like a scab that I can't pick at, but I can't eat.

847
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,140
Thank you, Billy Crystal, for your scab.

848
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Scott Braggen.

849
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,020
This is from Britty.

850
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,940
This is the message.

851
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,060
Travis, read it.

852
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,340
Scott is turning 26, he's an amazing drummer,

853
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,220
but also incredibly multi-talented.

854
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,900
He has mad art skills and is returning to school to get his BFA.

855
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,300
He skydives on the weekends and his fourth cue in Aikido.

856
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,260
But first and foremost, Scott is one of my closest friends

857
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,100
and it's very fun to be around.

858
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,740
Lots of love.

859
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,660
Well, that's nice.

860
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,300
I'm glad you guys are our pals and, and Scott.

861
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,460
I'm glad that Scott is doing sky Aikido.

862
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,220
And Scott kind of makes me feel a little self-conscious, honestly.

863
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,260
There's doing a lot of...

864
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,460
He's doing too much?

865
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,220
You got a lot going on, you know?

866
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,580
I don't really enjoy that.

867
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,260
Scott, you should stop drumming.

868
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,620
Stop drumming and maybe with the martial arts.

869
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,260
I want to feel better.

870
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,980
Just get cut back.

871
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,420
Go to like second cue.

872
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,660
Yeah.

873
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,620
There's one way for me and Scott to settle who's the best.

874
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,580
By the way, it's Scott.

875
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,140
And we're going to play Outlast.

876
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,500
Now here's Outlast.

877
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,060
I talked with Thomas who built Outlast

878
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,700
and it is my new favorite idea for a iPhone game.

879
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,140
So you guys know, you guys know hands on a hard body?

880
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,180
You know that idea where it's a...

881
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,740
Go on.

882
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,060
Oh yeah.

883
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,460
Do tell.

884
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,860
Where a bunch of people put their hands on a truck or car.

885
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,140
Oh yeah.

886
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,540
And then the car drives off and then...

887
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,700
The car drives off and they're like, wait, my hand!

888
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,620
No, the last person to leave their hand out with.

889
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,780
So Outlast is a game like that.

890
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,820
It splits your iPhone screen into a red half and a blue half.

891
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,060
Both people put a finger or thumb on the screen on their half

892
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,260
and then the game starts.

893
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,340
And the game is only who leaves their finger or thumb on the longest.

894
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,900
If you try to jostle it, you both lose.

895
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,180
Now I know...

896
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,660
So you could like do it and then like burp in their face.

897
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,140
Burp in their face and they're like, oh, I gotta get out of here.

898
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,980
And if they leave it, take it off, they'll lose.

899
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,820
Now here's where it gets really fantastic.

900
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,500
If they...

901
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,220
If they... before the game starts, each person logs into their Twitter account.

902
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,420
If they have Twitter.

903
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,620
Each person logs into their Twitter account and writes a tweet for the other person.

904
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,700
And if that person loses, that tweet is instantly deployed.

905
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,100
With no...

906
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,220
Oh, shit.

907
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,500
Right.

908
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
So Griffin wants to lose Twitter account.

909
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,820
I log into mine and then I write something that Griffin will tweet if he loses.

910
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,900
Like can't wait to eat Gina Davis's poop.

911
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,140
Yeah.

912
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,180
Yeah, something like that.

913
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,900
Spoiler alert, we're both writing that.

914
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:09,940
Yeah.

915
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,740
So yeah, and you...

916
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,220
Or you can, you know, you can play for whatever stakes you want.

917
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,700
But I think the idea of Twitter stakes are pretty fantastic.

918
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,940
You can get it on the App Store to search for Outlast.

919
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,180
It's 99 cents.

920
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,620
But what I would also recommend is that you follow CantOutlast on Twitter.

921
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,540
Because it retweets messages from people who lost the game.

922
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:38,260
And hey, if you want, put MBMBAM in your penalty tweet so we can see that you punished somebody.

923
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,540
And then we can celebrate.

924
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,140
Because what we like more than anything is people antagonizing in their name.

925
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,300
And also people crushing people.

926
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,420
Yeah, and really, really tearing them down.

927
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,420
Whatever sort of artifice of pride or ego they've built up just to really dismantle that.

928
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,740
Just make them as small as possible.

929
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:04,420
Now, Griffin, if you and Travis went up in this game in Outlast, let's say you're buying it right now, who would win?

930
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,380
Between Travis...

931
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,820
And be clear, there's just one iPhone.

932
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,500
Only one person needs this on their...

933
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,580
And two people play it in person.

934
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
I've been kind of quiet while we talked about this.

935
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:17,140
And it's actually because when Travis said I could burp in their face, then they have to quit.

936
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,420
And I couldn't stop thinking about just how miserable an experience that would be.

937
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,980
So I think he would have the psychological edge over me.

938
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,100
Are you saying you maybe wouldn't even enter into this particular Thunderdome?

939
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,020
Because for fear of...

940
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,820
I would do it.

941
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,260
Just a matter of pride.

942
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,620
But I think I would have him physically because I can go longer without eating sewage.

943
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,140
But Travis can turn that sewage into power, you know?

944
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,060
But I'm also very easily distracted.

945
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,020
That is true.

946
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,900
That's true.

947
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,340
If he gets bored with it, you know, if he's like, oh, a butterfly, then you could have the win.

948
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,740
He's out.

949
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:54,980
Sure.

950
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,660
Because I'm going to try to catch that butterfly.

951
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,300
Yeah.

952
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,420
You need two hands to do that.

953
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,020
What would your tweet be, Griffin, for Travis if you beat him?

954
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,620
Oh, man.

955
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
It'd probably just be a bunch of racial slurs.

956
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,100
Just one after the other.

957
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,820
Just one after the other.

958
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,420
And a nonsensical chain.

959
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,260
I really want to paint with a broad brush and make sure that he really offends every

960
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,620
people group on the planet.

961
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,060
Do you know 140 characters worth of racial slurs?

962
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:26,900
Do you?

963
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,940
You think you could do it?

964
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,340
Go ahead.

965
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,780
Oh, let's see.

966
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,660
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

967
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,500
No, I'm going to stop Griffin from doing that.

968
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,460
By the way, that's outlast.

969
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,820
It's 99 cents.

970
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,140
Get it.

971
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,100
I'm going to stop Griffin from listing all these racial slurs with a ball gag I bought

972
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,020
at extremistremes.com for exactly this scenario.

973
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,500
Extremistremes.com-

974
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,420
Now, which ball gag are you going to go with, Justin?

975
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,260
Because I've been researching this, because I might buy a bunch of them for a play I'm

976
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,580
doing.

977
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,620
And you can get a training ball gag, which is smaller than the normal ball gag, just

978
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,660
to get you used to it.

979
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,700
And it's got a little bit of strawberry flavor, just to make it a little more-

980
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,500
Is that-

981
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,660
Well, and it's breathable, so it's got the holes in it.

982
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,940
Well, that's against the elbow.

983
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,180
That's-

984
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:06,980
What are you doing?

985
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,860
Well, it's just for training.

986
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,820
It's to get you used to it.

987
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,180
And then there's one that, you know, expands and you can pump it up.

988
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,740
And then one that's like more of a leather wrap kind of deal.

989
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,380
Sure.

990
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,060
There's a huge variety of ball gags at extremistremes.com.

991
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,980
There's a huge variety of pretty much every the fuck thing at extremistremes.com.

992
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,380
Masturbation toys?

993
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,420
They got them.

994
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,460
Penis pumps?

995
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,340
They are there.

996
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,260
It's their bag, baby.

997
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,500
Yeah.

998
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,540
It's their bag, baby.

999
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,020
Yeah.

1000
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,900
You guys remember that?

1001
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,340
You remember that game from Austin Powers?

1002
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,740
Awesome.

1003
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,540
Austin Powers?

1004
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,740
Man, that was a good one.

1005
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,220
You want to-

1006
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,020
Very nice.

1007
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,660
Great success.

1008
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,660
Yes, peanut butter jelly time.

1009
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,860
Where you at?

1010
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,060
Where you at?

1011
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,740
They got sex age.

1012
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,540
They got swings.

1013
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:49,860
Sex age?

1014
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,340
They got mis- sex aids.

1015
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,860
Oh, I don't want that.

1016
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,580
That sounds horrible.

1017
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,260
They have the fun kind of sex aids.

1018
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,740
Oh, okay.

1019
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,620
They have basically everything you could ever want.

1020
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,820
And you should-

1021
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,540
And some stuff you might not even realize you want yet.

1022
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,100
And some stuff, let's be honest, terrifies the shit out of you.

1023
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,500
Yeah.

1024
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,780
It'll make whatever weird thing you're into seem like comparatively super, super regs.

1025
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,020
It's a fun environment.

1026
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,060
Go over there and experiment.

1027
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,860
And when you do, use the coupon code.

1028
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,740
What's the coupon code?

1029
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,100
It's MIDDLEST.

1030
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,660
MIDDLEST.

1031
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,740
Use the coupon code MIDDLEST to get 20% off.

1032
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,460
M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T.

1033
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,220
I think that's part of the fun is going on that roller coaster ride to realize just what

1034
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,500
your limits are, you know?

1035
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,980
And you go in and you say, oh, scented flavored lube.

1036
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,780
That sounds cool.

1037
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,300
Uh, uh, you know, a vibrator.

1038
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,700
That, oh, that seems pretty fun.

1039
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
The Showstopper dildo.

1040
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,260
Okay.

1041
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,740
I think I've, I passed it a little bit.

1042
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,940
Let's backpedal a little bit and get back to territories where we feel-

1043
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,300
Find exactly where I'm comfortable.

1044
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,860
We feel fun.

1045
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,420
So that-

1046
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,540
A dildo and a candelabra-

1047
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,020
I guarantee there will be something there that you're comfortable with.

1048
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,300
A dildo candelabra.

1049
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,660
I think I-

1050
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,380
No, thank you.

1051
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,180
I think we can hang.

1052
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,340
And after you check it out, when you find a product you really like, go back to the

1053
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,100
site and write a review for it, you know?

1054
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,420
Make sure that you say, this was awesome.

1055
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,860
I love the dildo.

1056
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,780
Unless, unless you can't because you're too busy getting stuff.

1057
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,300
Oh, man.

1058
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,780
My lady friend's sister got knocked up by a questionable suitor from your hometown.

1059
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,060
That's Huntington, West Virginia.

1060
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,940
We're headed to the wedding next month and seek your guidance for things to do in Huntington

1061
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,180
that don't involve feigning confidence in the unholiest of unions.

1062
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,860
That's from Andy and Kindle.

1063
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,980
God, I think the better question is, what can't you do?

1064
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,480
Yeah.

1065
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,820
We've prepared a musical number for just this situation.

1066
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,300
Here we go.

1067
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,780
You ready?

1068
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,740
Get drunk.

1069
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,460
Griffin is correct.

1070
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,340
There are quite a few drinking establishments in Huntington.

1071
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,740
Just to name a few, you got our favorite Stumblers 2 still stumbling.

1072
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,300
Real bar.

1073
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,800
Google it.

1074
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,700
There's Peckers.

1075
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,820
Is Peckers still around?

1076
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,980
No, Peckers is now a teen nightclub.

1077
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,480
Is it?

1078
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:03,980
What?

1079
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,000
It is.

1080
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,580
Because it was, it was, this is the God's honest truth.

1081
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:13,220
It was a Christian-themed nightclub, right, called, like, Lamb of, oh, fuck, what was

1082
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,720
it called?

1083
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,220
David?

1084
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,860
No, Lamb of Babylon?

1085
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,140
No, Lamb of Fun?

1086
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,640
Fuck.

1087
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:27,380
No, there was Club Babylon City of Sin, which was an adjunct of the Pearl Ultra Lounge.

1088
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,860
Those were, those were the clubs that were there.

1089
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,660
Those were both in the same building, but two different names.

1090
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,660
And that was the former Renaissance Bookstore.

1091
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,380
Former Renaissance Bookstore and, for a short time, Jazz Club.

1092
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:45,300
You got the Thirsty Whale, which you, and the Off the Shoulder Gentleman's Club.

1093
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,360
Of course.

1094
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,180
You could go to Hank's.

1095
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,060
Hank's, Mark's, Dave's.

1096
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,780
St. Mark's Place.

1097
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,500
I've recently been informed by Google that there's a place called Jackhammer's.

1098
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,140
Oh, man.

1099
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,300
On Route 60, so make sure you get out there.

1100
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,540
You go to Driftwood or Stonewall.

1101
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,100
Yeah, those are great.

1102
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,460
Huntington's Two Gay Bars.

1103
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,940
Jackhammer's, maybe a third of them.

1104
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,460
For Huntington's Two Gay People.

1105
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,580
It's a perfect fit.

1106
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,900
They each have all the space they could want.

1107
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,420
No, they're, they're populous.

1108
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:14,920
What else?

1109
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,360
Hyphy.

1110
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,740
You got Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

1111
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,380
Just get yourself a Snuffy Doll with cheese or-

1112
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,100
Huntington Prime, if you're looking for something a little fancier.

1113
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,980
A little fancier.

1114
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,620
You could go stare in the windows of the Closedown Theater.

1115
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,820
He found me.

1116
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,780
Which one, you ask?

1117
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,660
Ah, take your pick.

1118
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,420
Take your pick.

1119
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,140
You could visit the burial place of Soupy Sales.

1120
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,380
Is he dead?

1121
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,020
Is he dead?

1122
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,020
He is dead.

1123
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,020
You could go stare at the river for hours.

1124
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,060
Also, you're on a lot of meth at the time.

1125
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,940
Yeah, right.

1126
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,660
You could buy meth.

1127
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,420
Yeah, sure.

1128
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,260
You can fight the urge to jump in that river.

1129
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,260
Because you'll die.

1130
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,420
Just let it take you, let it take you down.

1131
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,460
Um, and um, I think those are all the things.

1132
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:57,960
Mm-hmm.

1133
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,400
So...

1134
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,420
Enjoy!

1135
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,140
Have a great trip.

1136
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,100
Make sure to look me up.

1137
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,660
Uh, there are tours by my home.

1138
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,340
Ghost tours?

1139
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,780
Ghost tours, uh, by my home three times daily.

1140
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,180
Justin was near a hospital, so a lot, a lot of spectral activity up there.

1141
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:19,460
Yeah, I will take you on a ghost tour of some of Huntington's number one most haunted places.

1142
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,980
You, you-

1143
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,500
Ever tell you guys that story?

1144
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:31,460
I was, uh, I took a ghost tour in, in, uh, Savannah, uh, where, where, you know, you go around the local locations.

1145
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:45,780
And really, it's just an excuse to stop by local bars, and you drive around in a giant hearse, and you stop at local bars, and you get out, and you buy some, uh, even if they're not haunted, or supposedly haunted, you can still buy alcohol, because Savannah has open containers.

1146
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,860
And you get all the spirits.

1147
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,740
You get all the spirits you want, right, so you can get to travel.

1148
00:45:50,740 --> 00:46:04,340
And, uh, travel around, and, uh, at one of these breaks, at one of these, uh, these, these, uh, you know, beer, beer breaks, uh, the driver is talking to my father-in-law, and he said, where are you guys from?

1149
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,460
And we said, West Virginia.

1150
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:15,060
And, uh, and he said, uh, yeah, the, the, there's a, a prison there in, in West Virginia, uh, that, that is supposedly haunted, right?

1151
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:20,500
And, uh, my father-in-law, Tommy, says, yeah, uh, apparently it's, it's, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1152
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,260
One of the most haunted, uh, places in America.

1153
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:31,300
And the guy, I shit you not, says, well, most haunted is difficult to quantify.

1154
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,820
Oh, my God.

1155
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,060
Is it, is it, sir?

1156
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,300
Is it, is it difficult?

1157
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,020
If a place, if a place had a ghost in it, it would become the most haunted place in the world.

1158
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,220
Yeah.

1159
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,380
One, one very, like, bold ghost that was just like, I'm here.

1160
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,100
They stop by anytime.

1161
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,780
They will trot that out though.

1162
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,460
Oh, yeah, this is the most haunted.

1163
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,900
This is the most haunted cap.

1164
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,860
Per, per square foot, we got a thousand ghosts a foot.

1165
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,900
A thousand, yeah.

1166
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,300
They're all real crammed in like sardines.

1167
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,620
Can't walk from one end to the other without hitting a ghost.

1168
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,940
It's really tricky to, sorry.

1169
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,500
Got a little ghost, got a little ghost in my throat.

1170
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:08,980
Sorry.

1171
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,260
Sucked up some ghosts.

1172
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,940
Sucked up some, oh, I'm going to have some real bad Rio tomorrow, but that's tomorrow's problem.

1173
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,740
Eating ghost gets-

1174
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,420
We actually had to build an annex onto the prison, uh, just to house all the ghosts.

1175
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,180
You don't even know where they're coming from at this point.

1176
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,260
Do you know what I love about this fucking podcast?

1177
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,620
What's that?

1178
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:30,100
I can say things like eating ghosts give you diarrhea and nobody will even notice or comment

1179
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,420
on it.

1180
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,620
That is the 53rd craziest, most awful thing that has been said in this episode.

1181
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:38,980
Right.

1182
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,620
It's like no big deal.

1183
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,580
I, sometimes I feel like we've put enough material out into the world because there

1184
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:52,100
are so many layers of it of where people will have to sort of absorb, peel apart the onion

1185
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,700
of upsettingness and they will never really notice how upsetting each episode is.

1186
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,180
I think we've upset things enough, basically.

1187
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,820
Whenever somebody like tweets about like that they're just like slam jamming episodes and

1188
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,940
they're going to watch like, listen to like a hundred episodes in two weeks.

1189
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,460
I have to imagine they've got to be having just the fucking trippiest dreams.

1190
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:11,700
Yeah.

1191
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:19,780
It's just got to be a weird couple of weeks of a very leaving Las Vegas sort of experience.

1192
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,580
Let's do-

1193
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,420
That's the one with the cage, right?

1194
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,020
Yeah, they put the kid in the cage and then they-

1195
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,020
No, Nick Cage.

1196
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,180
They dip him into the big containers of ghosts.

1197
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,220
Sorry Griffin, you were going to say?

1198
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,460
I was just saying it had the kid and the cage and the-

1199
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,980
No, I got it.

1200
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,420
So how about one more Yahoo?

1201
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,620
Yeah, let's do it.

1202
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,820
It was sent in by Josh Dykes.

1203
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,300
Thanks Josh.

1204
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,940
It's by Yahoo answers user Anon21 who says,

1205
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,020
would you love your child if they turned into a snake?

1206
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,620
No, I think if a child-

1207
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,420
Wait, wait, wait.

1208
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,700
Your child-

1209
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,220
Can the child turn back?

1210
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,460
Yeah.

1211
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,180
Is it permanent or is he like an Asian animal?

1212
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,500
See, I think that, that not-

1213
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,420
Well, first off, everybody knows that if an animal stays in his animal for longer than 60 minutes,

1214
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,020
they're stuck as that animal forever anyway.

1215
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,100
I'm not saying he would remain the snake, Griffin.

1216
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,860
I'm saying that he becomes a snake-

1217
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,700
In that one hour window, would you still love him?

1218
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:12,980
That's true.

1219
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,580
I feel like the uncertainty of not, of knowing, you know,

1220
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,140
is my kid ever going to be a kid, a human kid again?

1221
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,660
Does he still have the mind of a human or is he all snake?

1222
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,380
Oh my God.

1223
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,820
Can you imagine?

1224
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,220
Snake.

1225
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,620
If he's got mind of a human, yes, of course you still love him.

1226
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,020
But if he's all snake, he's going to bite you if you try to love him.

1227
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,580
Oh my God.

1228
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,500
But it's even worse if he has the mind of a human.

1229
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,620
That's what I'm saying.

1230
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,820
Snake body, snake teeth and venom, but the brain of a human being?

1231
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,220
But then we're getting into fucking Kafka shit.

1232
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,060
And if he's got the mind of a human, then he's still like your boy.

1233
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:43,460
I wouldn't-

1234
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,380
But if he's got the mind of a snake-

1235
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,860
He spirals himself around your arm and it's like,

1236
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,380
oh, nice, you're trying to give me a hug.

1237
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,580
That's really grody.

1238
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,620
Can you please get off me?

1239
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,340
I realize you're my child.

1240
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,900
Can he still speak English or is he only speak snake?

1241
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,940
Is he a parcel tongue?

1242
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,420
I think it might.

1243
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,340
What's worse, the people who do that are people who do treat their snakes like their children.

1244
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,420
Because there are those people too.

1245
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,420
And I don't want to be mistaken for one of them.

1246
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,900
I think I would rather have a snake that was always a snake.

1247
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,660
Because if I had a snake that used to be a child-

1248
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,180
Well, yes, Travis, that is not an option that has been afforded to these poor parents.

1249
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,860
I wish you were a snake all along.

1250
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,500
That's not it.

1251
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,300
The gypsy's curse-

1252
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,820
No, I'm saying that given there is a difference.

1253
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,300
Because if it was always a snake-

1254
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,820
There's a difference between a snake that's been a snake-

1255
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,060
If Travis was a snake, it might have ghost memories.

1256
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,540
Ah, shit.

1257
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,620
There's the biggest difference, Travis.

1258
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,580
You're talking about the difference between buying something at the pet store

1259
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,540
and seeing your progeny transformed into a reptile.

1260
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,980
You asked what's the difference between the-

1261
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,300
Which worse? Those people are like-

1262
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,260
There's nothing worse.

1263
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,580
It's not even up for grabs.

1264
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,340
You have to watch your child become scaly and cylindrical.

1265
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,220
That's the worst.

1266
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,300
Well, what about the people that have monkey babies?

1267
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,180
Which one's worse?

1268
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,540
Getting a monkey and treating it like a baby

1269
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,620
or having a baby and have it turn into a monkey?

1270
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,380
Wait, are you saying people who have monkey babies

1271
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,980
buy monkeys and then treat them like the babies

1272
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,260
and put them in diapers and shit?

1273
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:56,980
Yes.

1274
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,180
Those people are the pets.

1275
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:58,740
They are the worst.

1276
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,220
Okay.

1277
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,180
I want both of you to imagine you have a son or a daughter.

1278
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,740
Okay.

1279
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,620
All right.

1280
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,220
No, let's go with a son.

1281
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,540
Okay.

1282
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,660
And it turned into a snake.

1283
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,620
Let's cut the abstraction.

1284
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:10,900
Okay.

1285
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,060
Hey, cut the abstraction, you guys.

1286
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,820
Your kid just turned into a snake.

1287
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,020
Step one.

1288
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,740
What do you do?

1289
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,300
How big?

1290
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,100
How big a snake?

1291
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,580
Up to you.

1292
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,540
Could be a corn snake.

1293
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,660
Could be a king rattler.

1294
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,860
I'm going to go with a bow constrictor.

1295
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,660
Okay.

1296
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,700
Travis, what would you do first?

1297
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,660
What's the first thing you do?

1298
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,340
I'd probably kill it.

1299
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,540
Okay.

1300
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,460
It's abomination against man and God.

1301
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,580
Okay.

1302
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,380
On the next episode of True Blood, it's short.

1303
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,140
It's a short ep.

1304
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,900
Well, here's what I need to know.

1305
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,220
Okay.

1306
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,740
And I bet this is one of those things I just couldn't know beforehand.

1307
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,860
When I kill it, does it turn back into a kid?

1308
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,500
Oh, that's bad.

1309
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,660
Because then I got to deal with the cops.

1310
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,220
Yeah.

1311
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:53,460
Yeah.

1312
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,140
Just real quick, I want to back up to True Blood.

1313
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,380
Would that show be as popular if instead of vampires, they were snakes?

1314
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,740
I think it would still be a pretty good show.

1315
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,220
Yeah, it's just-

1316
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,780
Suck it.

1317
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,180
That one sustains you.

1318
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,180
Sustains me.

1319
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,060
Suck it.

1320
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:19,220
Because everybody does know when you get bit by a snake, you do turn into one.

1321
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,260
Yeah, but it's the slowest fucking process.

1322
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,540
The slowest fucking process.

1323
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,820
That is the plot of the Bible.

1324
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,500
You may recognize that as the Bible, what the Bible's about.

1325
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,860
Thank you guys so much for listening to our podcast.

1326
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,700
It's called My Brother, My Brother, Me, and it's in theory an advice show.

1327
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:46,740
Thank you to people who wrote into us in physical space.

1328
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,460
We got one from-

1329
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,740
Really?

1330
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,220
Yeah.

1331
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:49,620
Yeah, I know.

1332
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,340
We got a postcard from Zena.

1333
00:52:53,060 --> 00:53:01,620
We got another postcard from Janelle and Jen, and we got a letter from Eric Bailey that just says,

1334
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,180
he enjoys our work and is grateful for our talent.

1335
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:10,020
I also got another postcard that had a delightful picture of three mountaineer men

1336
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,180
that compared us to them that I thought was very funny, but it's not.

1337
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,620
My fingertips right now.

1338
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:22,420
If you want to write us, it is PO Box, just do Justin McElroy, PO Box 54,

1339
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:28,980
Huntington, West Virginia, 25706, and we will check that out,

1340
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,580
and it makes my day to have something.

1341
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,380
Send anything you want.

1342
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,820
When you go to the post office to get your mail,

1343
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,980
do the people there look at you like you're a big deal?

1344
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,940
Yeah, they say like, wow, this guy looks kind of famous.

1345
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,540
How long do you think before they hand you a big canvas sack that says fan mail?

1346
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,740
Mm-hmm.

1347
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,740
Or how long before you walk in there and they're like,

1348
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,900
hey, something of yours set off the anthrax alarm.

1349
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,860
Your box exploded.

1350
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,020
Yeah.

1351
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,620
Thank you to people.

1352
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,700
Now, hey, man, I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

1353
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,980
It looks like your box exploded.

1354
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,460
Yeah, someone sent something in a big box,

1355
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,380
said cookies on it, but I don't think it had cookies in it,

1356
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,060
because goddamn box exploded, man.

1357
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,940
Poor Larry the cable guy.

1358
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,060
He's had a bad run, man.

1359
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,180
Hey, man, that box of cookies really got her done.

1360
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,740
Boy ain't right.

1361
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,240
What?

1362
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,940
Amersman, people who tweeted about the show.

1363
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:28,420
Jordan Snyder, Joey Blanton, Kat, Tyler Matheson, Oscar Gomez,

1364
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:35,780
Mondrial, D McRitt, Evanis Awesome, Indie Mike.

1365
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,540
Thank you guys so much for tweeting about the show.

1366
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:43,140
Use the NBNBAM hashtag if you do that,

1367
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,740
and we'll be sure that we read all those pretty obsessively.

1368
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,820
Also, might I suggest following,

1369
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,900
and maybe this is gauche of me to suggest following it,

1370
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:56,740
but I would suggest following NBNBAM wisdom at NBNBAM wisdom.

1371
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,100
That account retweets quotes from our show,

1372
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,700
and they make us sound funny.

1373
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,740
They very nicely tweeted at me to say that after I accused them

1374
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,940
of stealing all of our jokes,

1375
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,460
I think I called them the Carlos Mencia of Twitter.

1376
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,500
They tweeted at me to inform me that that is not what they were doing,

1377
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,900
which I guess nullifies the crime.

1378
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,740
I guess we're all okay now.

1379
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,700
So thank you to everybody who tweets about the show,

1380
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,660
and thank you to everyone.

1381
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,900
Griffin, are you certain it's not Carlos Mencia?

1382
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,500
It may be, in fact, Carlos Mencia.

1383
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,340
The email address for our show is NBNBAM at maximumfun.org.

1384
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,420
While you're typing those letters in,

1385
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,980
why not copy and paste the maximumfun.org part?

1386
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,140
Go listen to other shows like Throwing Shades.

1387
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,980
Cast yourself, Jordan Jesse Goebelzai,

1388
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,060
Judge John Hodgman, and go to the forums.

1389
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:47,700
And Memory Palace.

1390
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,620
And Memory Palace.

1391
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,020
It's there.

1392
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,740
It's in the family.

1393
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,980
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1394
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,780
for the use of our theme song,

1395
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,020
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1396
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,100
You know, when I edit the episode, I just sort of drop it in.

1397
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,940
I don't really listen to it, but I gave a listen to the episode.

1398
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,300
I think maybe the last one we did.

1399
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,580
Uh, man, god damn, that song's so good.

1400
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,540
It's a good song.

1401
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,700
It's such a high energy way to start the show.

1402
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,700
And just thank you guys for letting us use it.

1403
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,300
Our show wouldn't be the same with any other song.

1404
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,780
And also release another album.

1405
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,020
Yeah.

1406
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,380
What the fuck, guys?

1407
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,260
What the fuck?

1408
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,780
And put us in the liner notes.

1409
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,780
This final Yahoo was sent in by Emily Gual.

1410
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,420
Thank you, Emily.

1411
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,020
Our picture, just a tasteful picture.

1412
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,820
Yahoo answers user.

1413
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,380
Like a full size, like one whole cover, you know, just us.

1414
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,900
Our face is on the record,

1415
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,300
so when it spins around in the record player, you'll see our faces.

1416
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,500
Change the name of the band.

1417
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Call the record My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1418
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,220
Change the name of the band to The Long McElroys.

1419
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:44,180
This final Yahoo was sent in by Emily Gual.

1420
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,660
Thank you, Emily.

1421
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,660
It's by Yahoo answers user Jonathan, who asks,

1422
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,460
help my computer is playing Jackie Chan Adventures and I don't know why.

1423
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,940
I'm Justin McElroy.

1424
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,820
I'm Travis McElroy.

1425
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,100
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1426
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,460
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1427
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:05,700
Me kiss your dads, go away on the lips.

1428
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,460
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1429
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,980
Keep your heart, hey.

1430
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,580
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1431
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,940
Keep your heart, man.

1432
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,620
These girls are smart, three stacks.

1433
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,740
These girls are smart.

1434
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:29,620
Play your part, play your part.
