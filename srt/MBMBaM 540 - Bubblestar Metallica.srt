1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,920
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,120
Just hear those T-R-A-V-E-I-S bells. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
I'm your sweet baby brother, Dash for the reindeer McElroy.

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,200
Hold on, I'll be right back. What?

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,600
I don't know if this is for the show or not. I don't know either.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,280
I think he might have just flown off to take Santa and all his crazy reindeer.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,080
But we're still making show. Yeah?

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,880
Just works just fine without Griffin. Yeah, have you noticed?

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,280
I think it flows better. I think the chemistry is there.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
Same show, basically, without Griffin. A lot of, it feels like a lot of dead air

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,400
is gone. This is all 100% usable content. Salvageable content. Well, you know what?

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,800
I could go ahead and tell people this is our candle night special.

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,120
Indeed it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're celebrating our fake holiday.

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,040
Hey. Hey, Griff, you okay?

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,560
Yeah, I've been waiting on a gift for Rachel that I would need to sign for that I needed to

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,520
intercept. Oh, was it from Santa?

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
I tried to do that because I got Sydney a rug to replace the rug that the cat pissed on.

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,680
And there was no cool way to do it because we're both at the house all the time.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,760
I got her a nursery rocker, too, and that one showed up in a big box from Wayfair that was

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:13,360
like, hey, Rachel, here's your nursery rocker. Griffin got it for you. Merry Christmas.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
There was no- Did Carrie Carrie do it?

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,320
I hope she's not a listener because this- This isn't the show.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,600
Oh, my mistake. Oh, how embarrassing.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Justin and I thought it was the show this whole time.

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,280
Yeah, the show was continuing. Some really choice stuff.

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,320
So this is Candlelightz. It is our- And I'm Griffin McElroy.

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,280
Let's start. What do you guys think about starting over?

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
No, no. Are you kidding me? There's three minutes of quality stuff there.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Well, I was going to say salvageable. Okay.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,560
This is exciting for so many reasons. One, it is our Candlelightz Spectacular.

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Of course. That means no cursing in this one.

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
Oh, beans. Can we just- It's our second Candlelightz Spectacular,

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,160
really, if you think about it. Yes. The other one is a video that you can

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,960
still watch if you go to bit.ly forward slash Candlelightz 2020.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,120
It's available until January 4th. It's a two-hour long Spectacular full of tons of

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,840
great bits and skits and goofs and songs and dances and celebrity cameos and holiday festivities and

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:25,040
and cocktails and it's got everything and it's $6.25 to get it and proceeds are going to Harmony

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
House, which is a shelter for people experiencing homelessness in our area.

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
So my area, I should say. Although we still claim the voice.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
So please go do that if you have not already done it.

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,120
You got until January 4th to watch it. Okay. But that's just a video.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
This is still the podcast Candlelightz. This is the one that counts.

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
This is the- No, they both count. No, this is the one.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
That one? This one counts less because it's free.

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
Oh, man. Yeah, it's not as valuable.

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
This one's free? We're going to not be using swear words.

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,320
So if you want to gather your family around the radio, Victrola,

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,880
we're just going to be doing a show without swears.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,080
Now, can we use alternate swears? Sorry, just like beans and butterscotch.

55
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,880
You guys remember like frack, like from- Frack it.

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Frack, yeah. From Bubble Star. H-E double hockey six.

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Sorry, did you say Bubble Star? Bubble Star Galactica.

58
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,040
Bubble Star Galactica. Bubble Star Metallica.

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
Oh, frack, I miss Bubble Star Metallica.

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,200
We also always mention this and it is a fact that just because it doesn't have bad words

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,040
doesn't mean a lot of challenging ideas. Yeah.

62
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, boy. And just to reinforce that,

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,600
I would like to start with an anecdote. Two nights ago, or two days ago, rather,

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,880
I was in the shower getting rid of all my filth and my two-year-old,

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,040
as she is what to do, just sort of barges in and because she wanted me to do something,

66
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,720
I don't know what it was, probably to do something to one of her dolls,

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,680
like wrap it up in toilet paper or throw it into the toilet.

68
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,520
Could she not do that last one? From what I understand,

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,560
toddlers excel at throwing things into toilets. Yeah, but if I do it, she can't get in trouble.

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,640
So she barges in- And you and I both know

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,200
Cooper likes making people do things, but like she has her whims

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:32,160
and she likes them to be acknowledged. So she barges in and while I'm mid-shower,

73
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm just wrapping up. Where are you at in this point?

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,840
In the shower? Yeah, what stage of the process?

75
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm rinsed, I'm ready to go. The shower's over, basically.

76
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,720
She barges in and I am, of course, caught unawares and I rush to turn the water off

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,600
so I can reach out and grab a towel, but in the way that little children want to do,

78
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
she was already taking notice of my privates and started scowling at them

79
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
and pointing in a very angry way as if to say,

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,720
what do you do with those and why do you have those? And so I cover myself up

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,720
and I go to see with the towel and before I could say anything,

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,520
she points at my now covered crotch and says, Daddy, I'm sorry about your little jumble.

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
Oh, great. How would she know

84
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,160
the worst imaginable thing to say? Every word of that is the sickest burn I've ever heard.

85
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry is not what you want to hear about your little, I don't know, jumble?

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Jumble suggests that there's things where they ought not be.

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:55,040
Which, from her perspective, all right, fair. But she said sorry about your little jumble.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:04,400
And then she went on to inquire more and I said, no, it's 6.15 in the morning.

89
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not doing this with you. We're not doing this. I'll put the doll in the toilet. You win.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,280
But we're not talking about my little jumble. Sorry about your little jumble.

91
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Real quick, I just wanted to say like-

92
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Yet another interruption before the show can begin.

93
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,600
Well, I just know like this year is pretty different for people.

94
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,840
And this Candle Nights, people aren't traveling as much.

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
Not sad, not sad libs, right?

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,760
No, it's been a rough year for everybody. And, you know, people are like, what can we do at home?

97
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,360
We had a lot of questions about what kind of traditions they could do at home.

98
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
And so I thought maybe we could play along at home.

99
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,720
All right.

100
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,840
Oh, my gosh.

101
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,960
Dutch Sinterklaas is believed to originate where?

102
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Norway.

103
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,760
Where does he come from to come visit the Dutch?

104
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,400
Heaven.

105
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,240
Dressen?

106
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Iceland.

107
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,360
It is believed he comes from Spain and also believes that he travels with a group of elves

108
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,560
who will take bad children back with them to Spain.

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,520
Rad. Oh, God, please. Take me, please. Get down to Barcelona, please.

110
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:11,920
Korea.

111
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,880
Yeah, wouldn't mind. Take me away. I've been really bad, Mr. Elf.

112
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,320
The first artificial Christmas tree developed in the 19th century in Germany

113
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,800
was made from what material?

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Asbestos.

115
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Well, come on.

116
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,080
Human hair.

117
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,920
Cat hair.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,680
It was goose feathers.

119
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,240
Dang!

120
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,800
Died green, but you were in the right realm.

121
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,360
Man. This is so festive.

122
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,280
Associated British Foods.

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,320
And funny!

124
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,160
Associated British Foods did a study and found that the average American consumes

125
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,720
how many calories on Christmas day?

126
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,760
Oof. I mean, am I trying to stay in Keto?

127
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,200
Because, uh, 3,500.

128
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say 2,200.

129
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
7,000.

130
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,520
Shut up.

131
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,000
Shush.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,960
No, I mean, shut up.

133
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,440
How do you get that? I mean, uh, I mean, how much, how much calories is in cinnamon rolls?

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
Because I kind of just eat one of those every half hour.

135
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
I mean, you get a pud.

136
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
You get a pud.

137
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,960
You get a little bit of pudding.

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Oh, I'm going to eat a pudding.

139
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,560
Some custard.

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
Cream with the pudding?

141
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
Oh, I love a custard and cream on the pudding.

142
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,520
There's always a pud.

143
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
Um, one more.

144
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
With, it's a two parter.

145
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,200
In 1950, the record holder for world's tallest cut Christmas tree was erected in the middle of Seattle.

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,360
In feet, how tall was it?

147
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,440
And, for another point, adjusted for inflation, how much would the tree cost in the year 2020?

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,760
I'm more envious than those uncut trees.

149
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
You know how I do it?

150
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
It's more natural if you know what I'm saying.

151
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,320
I'll say, here's, and here's a problem that I feel like we are put up against from time

152
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,600
and time on this show, which is my complete lack of sort of spatial imagination.

153
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,880
Because the first thing that came to mind, like I wanted to say like 1500 feet,

154
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,560
but then I was like, no, that would be 150 stories.

155
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,520
Here, I'm going to say, I'm going to say 225 feet.

156
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,800
I'm going to say, I'm going to say 690 feet.

157
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,920
Is that still a lot?

158
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,280
It still feels like a lot.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm going to give that point to Justin because it was 221 feet.

160
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
No, give the point to Justin.

161
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,240
I was four feet off.

162
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Yeah, but you weren't right.

163
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
Crescent over here.

164
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,600
Still wrong.

165
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
If you kicked a field goal that was four feet to the left,

166
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
the referee wouldn't be like, I'll give it to you.

167
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,400
What if it was, but unless it was near the right post, in which case,

168
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
it'd be even better.

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,160
So the price.

170
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,040
The price in 2020 dollars.

171
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,000
When was the tree built?

172
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240
This was 1950.

173
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,120
1950?

174
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,280
But we're adjusting for inflation now.

175
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,320
I'm going to give it a rate of, which is pretty typical for home cut trees.

176
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,440
Heard this on Planet Money.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,400
It's like 10 bucks per feet.

178
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,960
So I'm going to put it at $2,210.

179
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,160
I'm going to say $750,000.

180
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,240
Wow.

181
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
You were both wildly incorrect.

182
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,400
It was $185,000.

183
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,000
Wow.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,280
At the time, it was like $19,000, but all right.

185
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,920
Yeah, I say give that one to him so we can move on.

186
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,040
Okay, it's tied.

187
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,080
One, one.

188
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,960
All right.

189
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,560
Okay, but that was the last one, right?

190
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,800
Well, I guess the time breaker will be, who's been the best boy this year?

191
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,360
I mean, not me.

192
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm trying to get to Spain.

193
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,360
I've been real dirty.

194
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,920
That's true.

195
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,640
All right, Justin wins because Justin was the best boy this year.

196
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:48,960
Yeah.

197
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,400
This is an advice show.

198
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,920
I burned down a Whole Foods.

199
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Stole a cab.

200
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,240
Did take an Uber.

201
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
Drove into a river.

202
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,560
Smashed it all up.

203
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,520
The Uber drove into the river.

204
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,020
Yep.

205
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,640
After burning down the Whole Foods?

206
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,920
Yeah, it was on my way back home.

207
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,360
His car was in the Whole Foods.

208
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
He drove his car into the Whole Foods, burned the Whole Foods down, didn't have a ride home.

210
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
It was embarrassing.

211
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
Called an Uber, took an Uber, drove it into the river.

212
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,960
Well, I asked the driver to please drive it into the river, and I was very convincing.

213
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,280
Yeah, it was a fun day.

214
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:30,160
I did want to, we didn't have a traditional candlelight live show performance.

215
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,000
We did have our Sawbones Christmas special that's part of the video.

216
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,040
But I did want to just tell you guys about a lifetime Christmas movie I watched last night.

217
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,440
Okay.

218
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,320
If I have a moment.

219
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,400
Because it was called Dear Christmas, and I thought it would really speak to you guys

220
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,240
because it is about a podcaster.

221
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,040
Ooh, all right.

222
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,360
So they really got into our territory.

223
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,120
Melissa Joan Hart is up in the mix, and she is the best podcaster.

224
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,080
Now, what do I mean by that?

225
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,920
How can you, she has, her show is the number one podcast in America.

226
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,400
Oh, wait, why, what rating?

227
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,920
Well, Trevor, that's never specified, but it's the number one.

228
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,880
It's on the Earmuffs Network, and it's the number one podcast in America, guys.

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,760
And here's what it is.

230
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
It's called Holiday Love.

231
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,040
Oh, boy.

232
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,680
And in each episode of the number one podcast in America, she, it's called like Dear,

233
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
and then inputs the holiday there.

234
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
So it's like Dear Halloween.

235
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,280
And then it's about like real love stories from that holiday, right?

236
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,840
Oh, boy.

237
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay.

238
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,920
Okay, but so this, so in this movie, Dear Christmas, she is doing, people keep asking,

239
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
so what's the next episode about?

240
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,240
She's like, well, Christmas.

241
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,920
And in my head, I'm thinking, this is the number one podcast.

242
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,560
It's called Holiday Love, and you are just now hitting Christmas.

243
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,200
So I don't believe there's like a Dear Arbor Day.

244
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,920
Me and him both love trees, and we were like, let's do it.

245
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:12,160
I mean, it definitely means that roundabout, let's say March to like July, real dry spell

246
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,840
in there, real stretching for material.

247
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,960
I love my dad, and he loves her dad, so whatever.

248
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,280
We're in love.

249
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,640
That's the whole bit.

250
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,800
Okay, but the thing about this movie is that makes it really special, besides the fact

251
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:37,760
that her love interest, played by Jason Priestley, his name is, well, I should tell you first

252
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
off, he's a volunteer firefighter and an amateur glass blower.

253
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,200
Those two should cancel each other out, by the way.

254
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,560
And an accomplished baker, and at the firehouse, they make the best fried chicken in town.

255
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,920
And also, he hangs Christmas lights and decorations on the side.

256
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,600
So this is a lot of side jobs that he does, and his name is Chris Massey.

257
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,720
That rolls.

258
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,200
He would call him Mr. Christmas, which would have been a better name for the movie than

259
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,680
Dear Christmas.

260
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
So Melissa Genhart and Jason Priestley.

261
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,440
They should have just called the movie, is that Jason Priestley?

262
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,400
Is that Jason Priestley?

263
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
I think that's Jason Priestley.

264
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,120
He's 51 years old.

265
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,840
He looks great.

266
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,840
Okay, the weird thing about this movie-

267
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,520
Hey, what's his, Justin?

268
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,200
What's his core job?

269
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,360
He's a volunteer firefighter and amateur-

270
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
He does all the side gigs to support his glass blowing, which is germane to what I'm about

271
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,840
to talk to you about.

272
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,080
Okay.

273
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,320
The thing that is fascinating about this film is its relationship to the ongoing COVID-19

274
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,520
pandemic.

275
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,160
Which is, it's an interesting relationship.

276
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,040
So he makes these little, he blows these little glass hearts and puts them up all around town,

277
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,760
and it's a way to thank our first responders, right?

278
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,360
And his sister is an ICU nurse in New York, right?

279
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,840
So it is happening.

280
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,640
We can appreciate this, right?

281
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,520
I just want to say real quick, because I had a very loud sigh there.

282
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,080
If you're trying to make a living as a glass blower, hanging up your product for free around

283
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,520
town is not the way to do it.

284
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,200
He might, no, he does the other jobs to support the glass blowing.

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,280
But he's doing it gratis?

286
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,320
He is not attempting-

287
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,960
It's art.

288
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,760
It doesn't matter.

289
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,560
Listen, so the interesting thing about this is, so that is happening.

290
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,920
But also in this film, in like the first five minutes of this film, her boss at earmuffs

291
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,400
is like, are you coming to the holiday party or not?

292
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,080
And it's like, okay, so what?

293
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,720
Sorry?

294
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,920
We're having a holiday party?

295
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,400
We're in the same universe, right?

296
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay, that's fine.

297
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,880
And then later in the movie, there is a ugly Christmas sweater party full of people, but

298
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,520
they're just on the outside of it doing something else.

299
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,560
All right.

300
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,280
Yeah.

301
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,960
And they don't actually talk about, you don't see it.

302
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,080
And then later there's a fireman's ball that she shows up too late to.

303
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,160
So it's just her and Jason Priestley.

304
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,880
And that is the thing I wanted to talk to you about, really, is that this movie really

305
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,120
is, it was filmed during, it's not just set in a world that is sort of doing the COVID

306
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,600
thing, but not really doing the COVID thing.

307
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,280
It's also filmed in a world that definitely does have the COVID thing going on.

308
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,640
As such, Jason Priestley, Melissa Joan Hart, Ed Begley Jr.

309
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:47,200
as her dad, Faith Prince as her mom, two other, her sister and her boss, end of cast in movie.

310
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:55,520
There are six people in this movie, which you don't really notice until like they're

311
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,840
having, they're at like a restaurant and they're the only ones there because they can only

312
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,480
get, I guess, enough COVID tests for these two and nobody else.

313
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,720
So every once in a while, you'll see someone 30 feet in the distance, just sort of walking

314
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,760
through the shot.

315
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,120
But there are no extras, no zany neighbor.

316
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,720
There's no zany neighbor.

317
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,200
There's no waitress at the restaurant.

318
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
They're like getting their own drinks.

319
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,440
And it's this in the wild thing is she doesn't hate Christmas.

320
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,240
So if you know anything about these movies, that's the thing that has to be overcome.

321
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
They both like Christmas fine.

322
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
So there's no movie either.

323
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,840
It's literally, I said it's literally Melissa Joan Hart to Ed Begley Jr.

324
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
just shouting about how much they love candy canes.

325
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
It's like waiting for a good toe.

326
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,800
It's madness.

327
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,080
Justin, is it possible that there's a deeper underlying thing going on here in which the

328
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,360
six of them are not just the only people in this movie, but in this movie, the only people

329
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,640
left on Earth?

330
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Well, no, because there is a brother.

331
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,320
The sister, her job is that she's pregnant.

332
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,640
And the other job she has is her husband got stuck in like traffic or something.

333
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
So he hasn't been able to come to where she's about to have a baby.

334
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,400
She does eventually have a baby, and it is 100% a plastic doll that is completely, obviously

335
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,680
a plastic doll and really ratchets up the full blown panic attack that this film is

336
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,400
where they're just passing around this beautiful plastic baby and making Google ads at it.

337
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
But he makes it just in time.

338
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,320
But he doesn't talk because I guess maybe it's particles.

339
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,960
Maybe it's somebody just not wanting to give him his after card because I'm pretty sure

340
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,560
he's the cinematographer.

341
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,640
I was looking at pictures trying to figure it out.

342
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,840
I'm pretty sure the cinematographer doesn't say anything when he finally makes it.

343
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,680
Doesn't say anything to his plastic baby.

344
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,400
Just falls asleep and he's asleep on the couch.

345
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,440
He stumbles in with suitcases, lays them down, lays on the couch, goes to sleep for the rest

346
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
of the film, does all the speak.

347
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,800
Can I ask you guys something that's really twisted my noodle?

348
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,280
Sure.

349
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,920
Yeah, sure.

350
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,320
And it's something I've never thought about before, but only now this movie is making

351
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,880
me question.

352
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,440
Do volunteer firefighters get paid?

353
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,160
I think they're just in it for the love of the game.

354
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
Travis, they just hate fire so much.

355
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,560
They hate fire more than anything else at all.

356
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,680
It just seems like a really hard job to do.

357
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,160
For sure.

358
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,080
For no money.

359
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
So is fighting the Joker, but you don't hear Batman complain.

360
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,800
That's true.

361
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,200
Does that for free.

362
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,560
Batman doesn't get paid?

363
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,080
We're not cutting Batman a check, no.

364
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,920
No, somebody should.

365
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
You think Commissioner Gordon's got him on the payroll?

366
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,680
That would sort of go against the whole thing, huh?

367
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,760
No, I just assumed it was the mayor.

368
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
He gets advertisements.

369
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,120
That's why he has like, you know.

370
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,400
Oh, endorsements.

371
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,080
Yeah, he's got on his cape, he's got like the thing for Razer keyboards and a lot of

372
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,120
gaming chairs.

373
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,320
A lot of gamer fuel.

374
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,200
A lot of gamer fuel.

375
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,440
Do we want to try and sneak in a quick question before the break or?

376
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
Just one quick, quick.

377
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,440
Yeah.

378
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,240
One quick quick.

379
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
Quick question.

380
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,000
I bought my little brother his favorite candy online as a stocking stuffer, but accidentally

381
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
made it a bulk order.

382
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,480
I now have enough boxes of Swedish Fish to open my own old timey candy shop, and I can't

383
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
decide what's the best way to give him his candy.

384
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,680
If there was a candy shop in my town that only sold Swedish Fish, I'd be so gized about

385
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,400
that.

386
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Yeah, they have lots of different colors and shapes and sizes now.

387
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,280
Anyway, should I stuff his stocking to the brim, wrap them all up in a giant box, trim

388
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
the tree with them?

389
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,800
Any ideas are appreciated.

390
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,360
Happy candle nights, candy conundrum in California.

391
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,720
And what can I just say?

392
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,920
What a lovely problem to have.

393
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,240
Yeah.

394
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,200
Too many Swedish Fish.

395
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,920
Oh, now I need to Google shelf life of Swedish Fish.

396
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,600
Oh, forever.

397
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
There's, there's, yeah, they keep, man, this astronaut.

398
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
And I think they get better, honestly.

399
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
Like less fresh.

400
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,560
When they get that crust on it, like you got a kind of, yeah, I like that, I like that.

401
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,720
They do not spoil easily.

402
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, absolutely.

403
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,400
Okay.

404
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,680
The problem is box candy.

405
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,920
Candy in boxes is not great stocking stuffer material.

406
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,400
You know what I mean?

407
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,280
Because it's not an efficient use of stocking space.

408
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,400
You got to have a candy that can get down in the toes, fam.

409
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,000
That's why the chocolate orange is such a classic.

410
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,120
Perfect, perfect.

411
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,520
It's perfect.

412
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,840
By the way, weirdly sold out everywhere.

413
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,480
Chocolate orange?

414
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
Cannot find a chocolate, cannot get a beat.

415
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,000
I think I'm, folks, I may have to go to Cracker Barrel and I don't want to.

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,200
I've made a promise and I keep my promises.

417
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
But Swedish Fish, you're going to have to grip it, rip it and tip it into the stocking

418
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,880
so that it's just loose fishies in there.

419
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,920
Here's what you could do.

420
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,120
I think this would be fun.

421
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,480
This is a legit suggestion.

422
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,800
I want to preface that because sometimes it's hard to tell.

423
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,760
Every day, slap a stamp and an address on one of those boxes, drop it in the mail.

424
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,680
And eventually what will happen is every day your brother will receive one box of Swedish

425
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,560
Fish in the mail.

426
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,440
So good.

427
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,160
That's so good.

428
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,440
Better yet, when you're putting in the address, put mine in maybe sometimes.

429
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,200
That's fine.

430
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,240
Here's an idea.

431
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,160
Maybe your brother, you start doing this and then he starts not thanking you or stops thanking

432
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,720
you as a normal person would say it.

433
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,560
And when he gets sort of like that, to teach him a lesson, send it to me because I will

434
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,080
enjoy it quite a bit.

435
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,480
I won't thank you like your brother does, but I will still eat it and you'll know that.

436
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,280
The problem with Travis's idea is-

437
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,480
Oh, please.

438
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
There's a small one.

439
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,560
Is that, let's say 12 packages, right?

440
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,160
That's probably what we're talking about here.

441
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm looking at the bulk assortment on Amazon.

442
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
It looks like 12 packages.

443
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:03,440
So you get 12, he gets a fresh, delicious bag of Swedish Fish maybe once per week.

444
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,800
And then week 13, his mouth starts watering.

445
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,960
Oh, cherry.

446
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
Yellow.

447
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,200
And then he opens it and the bag's not there.

448
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,560
And then he has to start wondering, like, what did I do wrong?

449
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,480
Why did I- I've been enjoying every delicious fish-

450
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,520
I was a good boy this week.

451
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,560
I want my candy.

452
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,920
I want my candy.

453
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
I shared them.

454
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,080
I think that's worst- that's best case scenario, Justin, because worst case scenario is then

455
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,480
he gets that Swedish Fish hunger and he's out there, you know, like ripping up mailboxes

456
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,520
trying to find where his Swedish Fish went and it just becomes a real mess.

457
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,360
You got to trank him, you know, until the madness passes.

458
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,240
Or you get some more.

459
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,480
Or yeah, or you just, I guess, keep buying them.

460
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,280
I just feel like if you do this for 12 weeks, then you have to do it for at least, like,

461
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
the rest of the year.

462
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,000
Or it's like six- it's like when you have to pick the duration of a gift subscription,

463
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,120
which is always the worst.

464
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,640
It's like, I thought you might want this for three months and then not want it again.

465
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,600
So that's what I went with.

466
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,320
I might suggest, though, again, just to circle back to sending me some of your great candy,

467
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,840
that I think eating 12 boxes of Swedish Fish would make your brother pretty sick, even

468
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,920
if spaced out over a long period of time.

469
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,360
You're going to gum up the works so hard in there that he will become more gummy than

470
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
man at that point.

471
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
Then alternate between Swedish Fish and Metamucil.

472
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,680
Okay, just to clear out, just to make room for more Swedish Fish.

473
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,400
Just to keep the aisles clear, you know?

474
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,080
Maybe you dust the Swedish Fish with Metamucil, like it's the acid powder that they put on

475
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,800
Sour Patch Kids.

476
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,360
That's fun.

477
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,840
There you go.

478
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,560
Oh, what do Swedish Fish like to swim in?

479
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,880
Oh, that's a big drink of Metamucil, my friend.

480
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
Yeah.

481
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,920
And it'll treat your body like one of those tubes that they blast the salmon out of.

482
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,040
I have always...

483
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,440
I have very little interest in marine life.

484
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,640
I have always wanted to blast one of those salmon cannons.

485
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,040
Yeah.

486
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,680
You've seen those?

487
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,320
It's like, oh, we'll help you get up this waterfall of salmons.

488
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,440
Here's your salmon blaster.

489
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
And it's like, well, first of all, that's cheating.

490
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,840
But also, it looks like a lot of fun.

491
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,400
And I would love to just really launch these boys.

492
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,880
Now I just want to go down a deep rabbit hole of YouTube watching videos of that, Griffin.

493
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
Of salmon blasters?

494
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,800
Yeah, let's do that.

495
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,040
We'll do that together while Justin does the ads by himself.

496
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,280
Okay.

497
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,960
Fantastic.

498
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,200
Well, let's go to the money zone.

499
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:48,160
I googled salmon blasters.

500
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,960
Oh, boy.

501
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
That's not anything.

502
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,720
It does kind of sound like a new, like, appetizer at TGI Fridays.

503
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,040
Yeah.

504
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
Listen, this is perfect.

505
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
If you are planning on mailing any of your siblings

506
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,560
a piecemeal bulk order of Swedish fish, there is only one place that is going to let you do that

507
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,560
from the comfort of your own home, and that's stamps.com.

508
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,600
Last minute holiday gifts or holiday gifts that will go throughout January and February

509
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,960
and some of March that are fish shaped and cherry flavored.

510
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,280
Well, the post office is a little busy.

511
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,040
And, you know, with the ongoing unpleasantness, maybe not the best place to go hang out.

512
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,720
But you can do all the post office stuff from your house.

513
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,760
Stamps.com brings the services of the US Postal Service and UPS right to your computer wherever you are.

514
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,920
You can send out invoices to big warehouses, send out lots of packages every day,

515
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,440
or maybe smaller operations that's more focused on transporting Swedish fish around this great country.

516
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,920

We'll know. We'll know if you do.

528
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,040
We'll know. They track your phone.

529
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,480
To celebrate the holidays, you guys, I have a new invention.

530
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,880
Okay.

531
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,280
What's that?

532
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,640
I call it red apron.

533
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,400
And with red apron, you get, it's kind of a loose, really thin material plastic bag

534
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,160
full of just a random assortment of ingredients that don't really go together.

535
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,760
No clear instructions.

536
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,320
There's like snippets of instructions that I've included in there.

537
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,280
And oh, and I should be clear.

538
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,480
All the food is room temperature or worse.

539
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,440
Okay, worse.

540
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,400
And you get that at random times.

541
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,280
There's really no way to predict when it will come, what will be in it.

542
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,440
Sometimes you'll get two boxes on the same day and then not get another box for the next month and a half.

543
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,800
Right, but you'll still get charged.

544
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,440
Let's be clear, you'll still get charged at regular intervals.

545
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,160
And it's just kind of my, it's a dinner innovation, as I like to call it, a denovation.

546
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,040
What do you think?

547
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm sorry, y'all.

548
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,760
I've been watching the salmon cannon video for the last four minutes and it's entrancing.

549
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Can you imagine if a big giant man picked up your body and shoved it into a white tube

550
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,120
and then all of a sudden you were in Illinois and you were like, thanks, giant human-like being?

551
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
Well, then let's put it this way.

552
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,480
Blue Apron is like a salmon cannon for ingredients to your door.

553
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,040
Exactly.

554
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,800
Including, but not limited to.

555
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,680
Salmon.

556
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,480
Salmon, yeah.

557
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,200
You blast a bunch of salmon out of a can.

558
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,760
Maybe you want a nice little caper sauce with those.

559
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,680
Yep, they blast that too.

560
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,560
Yeah, it's a series of salmon tubes that run all over this beautiful country of ours

561
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,600
and you get it and you make a tasty home-cooked meal and they're really good.

562
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,480
And they come with super clear recipes that are easy to follow.

563
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,800
And yeah, they also have meal prep options now, which allows you to cook one time

564
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,800
and get eight servings of food that can all be prepared in under two hours

565
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,600
using one streamlined set of steps.

566
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,960
That sounds pretty convenient, if you ask me.

567
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,360
Don't miss out on all that Blue Apron has to offer this season.

568
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,120
See what's on this week's menu and get $30 off across your first two deliveries

569
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
when you visit blueapron.com slash my brother.

570
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,240
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

571
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
Okay, here's my new invention.

572
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,400
Blue Apron.

573
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,960
Never go to the post office again.

574
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
Here's my new invention.

575
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,720
It's a salmon cannon that as the salmon passes through the cannon,

576
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,480
it gets slowly roasted until it arrives at your door fully cooked and seasoned.

577
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,480
And then it lands right in your ears and you're like,

578
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
I cannot hear my music with these.

579
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,440
And someone's like, why are you putting cooked salmon in there?

580
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
You should be using Raycon.

581
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,880
Okay, I mean, I guess that's not really great for my pitch for Shark Tank, Justin,

582
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,520
but I guess...

583
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,000
No.

584
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,320
Okay.

585
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,640
Well, Raycon, if you want to get a gift and for somebody it's hard to shop for,

586
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,600
there's one that so many people would love to have and use and they're wireless earbuds.

587
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,240
And Raycon makes a great pair.

588
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,840
I've got a pair that I use.

589
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,920
They are my, like around the house, the kids are maybe still asleep

590
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,760
and I want to pop in a podcast or music.

591
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,360
Or the kids are talking about your jumble.

592
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,760
Okay, they fit my wife's weird, shameful ears,

593
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,520
which is a real feather in their proverbial cap.

594
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
They're great earbuds and you're not going to...

595
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,160
It's comparable quality to what you get from the other premium brands,

596
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,720
but Raycon started at half the price.

597
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,280
So that makes them a great gift in my book.

598
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,200
You can use them for calls, music, for work, for play, home,

599
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,080
or on the go.

600
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,400
It's a gift that keeps on giving.

601
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,600
Griffin, let's say I wanted to get a pair.

602
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,240
How would I do it?

603
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,320
Well, you can get a pair and you can also get them for 15% off.

604
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,120
If you go to buy...

605
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,680
What?

606
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah.

607
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,040
Griffin knows the guy.

608
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Yeah, I know Ray.

609
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,320
And so go to buyraycon.com slash my brother

610
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,640
and you're going to get 15% off your Raycon order.

611
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,040
That's buyraycon.com slash my brother.

612
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,240
Just one more time for good measure, buyraycon.com slash my brother.

613
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,800
And while you're there, if you need tires or a stereo or like,

614
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,120
I don't know, a new jacket, you let Ray know.

615
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
Just ask Ray.

616
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,200
Just ask Ray.

617
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,240
He'll take care of you.

618
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,800
But whatever you do, do not go to the post office.

619
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,160
Don't go in the post office.

620
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,880
Ray will know.

621
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,840
Hi, I'm Jo Firestone.

622
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,440
And I'm Manolo Moreno.

623
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,800
And we host After Game Show, a podcast where listeners submit games

624
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,040
and we play them regardless of quality with a dozen listeners from around the world.

625
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,320
We've had folks call in from as far as Sweden, South Africa, and the Philippines.

626
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,240
Here's an example.

627
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,040
This is the game we called Zooey Deschanel,

628
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,000
where you turn a celebrity's name into an animal pun.

629
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
You have an example, Manolo?

630
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,560
Brad Gorilla Pit.

631
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,520
Oh, that's a pun on Gorilla Pit?

632
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:21,760
Yep.

633
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,440
I don't know.

634
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,560
That's Brad Pit.

635
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,440
Oh, okay.

636
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,240
That's a high quality game that you could expect.

637
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,280
After Game Show has new episodes every other Wednesday on Maximum Fun.

638
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,480
Check us out, please.

639
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,000
How about a yahoo?

640
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:38,880
Yes.

641
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,320
Yeah, I love that.

642
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,560
Okay.

643
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,680
Are you going to interrupt me with a bit?

644
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:42,880
Okay.

645
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm not.

646
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,440
I'll miss the most sacred of days.

647
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,680
Sure.

648
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,600
I'm just saying if you were sucked up into a human-sized salmon cannon,

649
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,360
wouldn't you just be like, oh, I'm dead?

650
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,200
Like before you even got to the other end, you'd be like, now this is your own interruption.

651
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,440
Okay.

652
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,160
But that assumes that the salmon is aware of what's happening, Griffin.

653
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,360
Absolutely, they are not.

654
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,480
Absolutely, they are not.

655
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,920
Brian sent this one in.

656
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,960
Thank you, Brian.

657
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,160
It's from yahoo answers user Daddy Bear1964.

658
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,920
Who asks, how do you start a new city or town in Texas?

659
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,120
Would like to have the area where I live become a city.

660
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,200
What a city to have.

661
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,800
I have wondered about this for a good long time.

662
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,160
Yeah, gotta have.

663
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,240
Because there used to be a time in this great land of ours

664
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,840
where you just walk into a big empty space and you're like, all right, this is Traveston now.

665
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,720
This looks like a city.

666
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:32,960
Yep.

667
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,840
Colisepe Huntington did it, thank God.

668
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,120
Walked into, I don't know, Holderby Landing, correct?

669
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,200
It's like, hey, this place sucks.

670
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,080
I want to build a train right through the middle of this pit

671
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,920
and you're all going to love me for it and I'm going to call it Huntington after me.

672
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:54,400
Cities have mayor, city hall.

673
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,280
Mayor, that's you.

674
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,600
Yes.

675
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,160
I think if you start the town, you got to be the first mayor.

676
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,640
That's it.

677
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,720
Hey everybody, welcome to Coolville.

678
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,800
Order number one, I'm the mayor.

679
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,080
Order number two, we got to get a Chili's up in here.

680
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,360
Yeah.

681
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,600
Does anyone know how to start a Chili's franchise?

682
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,760
Because that's going to put Cooltown on the map.

683
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,600
Did I say Cooltown or Coolville?

684
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,160
I forgot.

685
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:22,640
I forgot how long you have to have an area that is separate from other town, right?

686
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,720
Real city will not take kindly to you sort of annexing.

687
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,240
Making a middle city in the city.

688
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,440
You know what I did?

689
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,680
What?

690
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,560
It's been long enough now that I think I can reveal this.

691
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,920
I started my own city here in the middle of Cincinnati,

692
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,800
but what I did was my city is also called Cincinnati,

693
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,200
but with one extra N in there and I won't tell you where.

694
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,080
Oh no.

695
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,640
And so like nobody knows yet.

696
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,600
And I've been slowly pushing the fence one inch every year.

697
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:55,280
Yeah, and Travis also has his own like pirate bootleg version of Babes in Toyland

698
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:13,840
where they sing I come from C-I-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-A-T-I, Cincinnati.

699
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,920
It's loose dry beans.

700
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,880
I call it the Chili that crunches.

701
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,840
It's Travis's crunchy garbanzo surprise.

702
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,640
Welcome to Cincinnati.

703
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,440
That's not where the inn is, Griffin.

704
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
You'll never guess.

705
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,440
And you wouldn't tell me if you got it right.

706
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
No, I wouldn't tell you, because that's how they get you.

707
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:47,440
If my town had an army, I feel like that would help me be respected by nearby towns that maybe wouldn't recognize my sovereignty.

708
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Justin's making a joke point that many a militia has actually made in this terrible world of ours that-

709
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,440
All right, now that I've backed into it myself, I can see the logic.

710
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,440
I'm sorry I've been so hard on militias.

711
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Thank you for defending us from the government.

712
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
You're all doing a great job.

713
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Now, let me say this.

714
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,440
Speaking of government, I think if your city immediately starts paying taxes to the government,

715
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,440
the federal government probably isn't going to do anything to stop-

716
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,440
The city that you are annexing from is going to be like,

717
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
hey, government, do something.

718
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
And they're like, we recognize it.

719
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,440
They're giving us money, and you're giving us money.

720
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
It's win-win.

721
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
It's double money.

722
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
That's a good point, Trav.

723
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
How big's the city got to be?

724
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Big enough for a Chili's and a Town Hall.

725
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
You start with a Hamlet.

726
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,440
You got to start with a Hamlet, and then you're a township.

727
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Then you're a town, and then you're a townburg, and then you're a burg city.

728
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,440
And then you're a city.

729
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Then you're a metropolis, and then you're a super metropolis.

730
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Right.

731
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
And then-

732
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
It's a kingdom.

733
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
I think kingdom comes after that.

734
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Yep.

735
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
That's right.

736
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,440
How are we going to get statehood, though, for my cool city that's just a Town Hall and Chili's,

737
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,440
so that we can get two senators there?

738
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
Hmm.

739
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
This is a good question.

740
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
I think we can really-

741
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I think first you need a professional sports team.

742
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Everybody's always fighting about the Senate, and we got to take it, and we absolutely do need to take it,

743
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,440
but gosh, that would be easier if Chili's Town could just put up two more.

744
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,440
And let's say Chili's Town is also the most progressive city on the map.

745
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,440
San Francisco seems like a very conservative city compared to Chili's Town.

746
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Could you get your city sponsored by Chili's and have them get you statehood?

747
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I bet someone at Chili's knows a guy.

748
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,440
I'm just saying, everyone eats at Chili's, probably including the Supreme Court justices.

749
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Yes.

750
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
You could probably make this happen.

751
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Yeah.

752
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,440
It's like how NBA players eat at Cheesecake Factory so much when they're on the road,

753
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,440
because they just know that Cheesecake Factory's going to- this is not a joke.

754
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Whenever- it's like a thing.

755
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,440
NBA players just like, when they're going to a city and they don't know what the food's like at that city,

756
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,440
they're like, I know what Cheesecake Factory has, and it's always there.

757
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,440
You're laughing, but that's also what we do.

758
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Yeah, we have stuff.

759
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,440
I'm laughing out of familiarity because we have stumbled into this exact practice where we're traveling.

760
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,440
I know they're going to have something that everyone will eat because it's Cheesecake Factory.

761
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,440
We have five children, six adults.

762
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Yeah, throw a cheesecake in there.

763
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
You ready for another question?

764
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Yeah, sure.

765
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Okay.

766
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Oh, wow.

767
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
What a surprise.

768
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
I interrupted myself, though.

769
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
It's a present to you.

770
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Thank you.

771
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
A holiday present.

772
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Welcome to Haunted Doll Watch.

773
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:49,440
It is a dip into the paranormal where we're going to talk about the hottest, sexiest paranormal items on eBay.

774
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Now, this week is very special, and of course it's special because this is Candle Nights, so...

775
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Ooh, do we have a holiday spirit?

776
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
We do, Travis.

777
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
We do have a holiday spirit, but you know what we don't have with this one?

778
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
What?

779
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
A doll.

780
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Huh.

781
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Okay.

782
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
So that begs the question.

783
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
What's the question?

784
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
What's the haunted thing?

785
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
What is it?

786
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
What are you talking about?

787
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,440
This is listed as haunted, not doll.

788
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,440
Christmas elf spirit will be sent to you.

789
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
New.

790
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Never before seen.

791
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,440
That part, I bet, is very accurate.

792
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Yes.

793
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,440
So it's a spirit of a Christmas elf.

794
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
I'm going to send it to you.

795
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Just wait.

796
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Sorry.

797
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Just a loose, loose, jingling around in that box spirit?

798
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Christmas elf special mystery spirit will be sent to you.

799
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Mystery spirit.

800
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
So it's like a slime bag.

801
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,440
It's like a chase elf.

802
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Ghosts actually hate it when you call them slime bags.

803
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
We're not all slimers, okay?

804
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Yeah.

805
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
New.

806
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
Never before seen.

807
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Very true.

808
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,440
This mystery spirit will travel on his or her own once you submit payment.

809
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Or there.

810
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
Come on.

811
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Or there once you submit payment.

812
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Wow.

813
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
About this mystery spirit.

814
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,440
These mystery spirits come from many creatures.

815
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Of course, the one we're talking about today is the ghost of a Christmas elf, I guess.

816
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,440
But we sell spirits from ancient unicorns, single-headed dragons, double-headed dragons,

817
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
wolves, centaurs, mermaids.

818
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Wow.

819
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Way to just drop wolves in the middle of those.

820
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Yeah.

821
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Like wolves are like, uh, hey.

822
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Hey, Debbie.

823
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,440
You know I'm real, right?

824
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Mermaids, mermen, chickens, giant moths, orcs.

825
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Chickens.

826
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Wait.

827
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Sorry.

828
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Back up.

829
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
Sorry.

830
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Did you say chickens?

831
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Was that really in there?

832
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Yeah, bud.

833
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Mermen, chickens, giant moths, orcs, fanguses, griffins.

834
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Oh, no.

835
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
No.

836
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Fawns.

837
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Niads.

838
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Centaurs.

839
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Centaurs.

840
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Cyclopses.

841
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
And more.

842
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Oh, boy.

843
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
I'll take one wolf and eight chickens.

844
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Or is this a grab bag thing?

845
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,440
They can't put them both in the same bag.

846
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Oh, god, no.

847
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
And I'll also take a spirit of a bag of grain, please.

848
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Yes.

849
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Oh, how do I get them across the river?

850
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Upon winning this auction, we will send you a message when mystery spirit will come to

851
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
you after you submit your payment.

852
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
They can't be more clear about that.

853
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Oh, boy.

854
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Different kinds of spirits travel at different times of days.

855
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,440
But each mystery spirit arrives within 24 hours.

856
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,440
These mystery spirits travel very quickly since they are only in spirit now and are

857
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
not weighted down by their bodies.

858
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,440
They do not need to travel in a box.

859
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Thank god.

860
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,440
But since they are in spirit form, they travel to you in spirit on their own.

861
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Hey, seller, I recognize that they don't need to travel in a box, but could they just so

862
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
I feel like-

863
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Could they just.

864
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
What will the kids open?

865
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Just so something is.

866
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,440
And maybe also you could put a little note in there that says definitely a spirit in

867
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
here.

868
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Something.

869
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Just put like some smoke in a box.

870
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
I don't know if it'll keep, but just something.

871
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,440
I need something to come out of a box or else my kids are going to be pretty ticked off.

872
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Warning.

873
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
These mystery spirits have different personalities.

874
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,440
We cannot guarantee one personality over another one.

875
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,440
However, we will let you know what kind of personality the mystery spirit you buy has

876
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
and any other information that would be helpful to you.

877
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
Wait, what?

878
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
We can't.

879
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
Wait.

880
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
You're going to buy one.

881
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,440
They can't guarantee a personality, but after they've shipped it, they'll be like, this

882
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
is a mean one.

883
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Hang on for the ride of your life.

884
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
It's a mean minotaur.

885
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
So, uh-oh.

886
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Hey, can I just real quick, I just want to put up some, just a curtain here real quick

887
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,440
and say, this is all made up.

888
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
Why don't you guarantee the spirit?

889
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Why don't you say like, they're going to be super nice.

890
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
I'll tell you exactly why, Travis.

891
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,440
Pretend that you are this mystical seller and I'm the recipient.

892
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Hi, I want a triple-headed dragon.

893
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Oh, you don't have those?

894
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Then I guess give me two-headed dragon and one-headed dragon at the same time, please.

895
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
You got it.

896
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
When will they be here?

897
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,440
They'll be here within 24 mystical hours.

898
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
Okay.

899
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,440
25 hours later, I'm partying with my ghost dragons and I call you up.

900
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Hey, I didn't get them.

901
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Are you sure?

902
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I didn't get them.

903
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
I want my money back.

904
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
I didn't get them.

905
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I hear a party going on in the background and I know that these were radical dudes.

906
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,440
It's my son's birthday and we got an entertainment dragon.

907
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,440
But I hear him saying I'm partying with a two-headed dragon and a one-headed dragon.

908
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,440
You can send me three more dragon heads arranged on as many bodies as you want or my money back.

909
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
I'll just keep sending you dragons.

910
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
All right.

911
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
25 hours later again.

912
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Hey, where are those dragons?

913
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,440
I sent the dragon.

914
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
You didn't get them?

915
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,440
No, but just send me a few centaurs, I guess.

916
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Oh, I'm fresh out.

917
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,440
I'm pretty sure I got my own fantasy ghost menagerie.

918
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:01,440
How will you know Mystery Spirit has started preparing to travel to you when we send message?

919
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,440
I'll just read it exactly word for word.

920
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,440
You will know your Mystery Spirit has started preparing to travel to you when we send you a message via the eBay messaging system.

921
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Your Mystery Spirit will arrive promptly within the next 24 hours.

922
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
Not prompt, by the way.

923
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,440
That flies in the face of the definition of prompt.

924
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Each Mystery Spirit has one or more feelings that come with it.

925
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
I can relate to that.

926
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
How are you, man?

927
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
Happy still.

928
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
Yeah.

929
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,440
You will know that your Mystery Spirit has arrived when you sense the feeling that is included in the message that we send you.

930
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,440
This feeling may start small and be hard to identify at first, but it will set in soon.

931
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Because some Mystery Spirits take longer than other to completely move in, and they like to make sure they are welcome.

932
00:45:51,440 --> 00:46:01,440
So make your special Mystery Spirit feel at home, and they will get more comfortable around you, and your feeling of will increase before long.

933
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,440
Finally, this is fascinating to learn, and I really appreciate them sharing this last tidbit.

934
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Most Mystery Spirits like to have the company of other Mystery Spirits, too.

935
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:19,440
So feel free to come back for more Mystery Spirits if you enjoy what you receive.

936
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Now, I have been dying to know, Justin.

937
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
How much?

938
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Ask me anything.

939
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
How much?

940
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,440
Okay.

941
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Okay.

942
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,440
Well, God, so much of this is not going to seem real to you.

943
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,440
Well, sir, it's $49.99 each.

944
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
All right, all right, all right.

945
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,440
But if you buy two, it's $49.49 each.

946
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Oh, boy, that's a discount.

947
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
That's awesome.

948
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,440
You buy three, well, friend, you're getting them for $48.99 a piece.

949
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
Wow.

950
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
That's a big savings, baby.

951
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,440
Just a quick sidebar.

952
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,440
Do you think in the Pokémon universe there's shady individuals who are like, hey, kid, you want to buy a Gastly?

953
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,440
Yeah, it'll be $20.

954
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
Okay, where is it?

955
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
It's right here in my hands.

956
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Can't see it?

957
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
Yeah, it's a dead person.

958
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,440
There's two more things I wanted to share.

959
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:23,440
First is that this is sold by a seller named Omar D Zero, and they have gotten a few complaints because they sell mystery boxes, and they don't tell you what's in them.

960
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,440
And then people are leaving reviews that say it's a ripoff.

961
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Huh.

962
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,440
And they say, well, I don't know, it's a mystery.

963
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,440
You solved it, though.

964
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:41,440
The listing specifically say they're worth more or less than you pay.

965
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
I didn't know you could just do that.

966
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
Don't buy this.

967
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,440
A flashlight for $25 is the only thing I got.

968
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Ripoff.

969
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,440
And it says, the response from Omar D Zero says, you paid $24.99 for electronics.

970
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,440
Please tell me how a $25 flashlight is a ripoff.

971
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
It makes light.

972
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,440
Got them.

973
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
That's a miracle.

974
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
You travel back in time, you pull out that flashlight, you're a king.

975
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
Yeah, you're in charge.

976
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,440
The last thing I wanted to tell you guys about this Christmas elf.

977
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,440
They, this Christmas elf spirit, sorry.

978
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,440
They can't guarantee delivery before Christmas.

979
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,440
Huh.

980
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:24,440
28th is the, December 28th is what we're looking at.

981
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
Right.

982
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,440
This one.

983
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:36,440
We know it might make it a bit more appealing if you could get your Christmas elf before Christmas, that's the ideal, but they cannot guarantee Christmas arrival of this spirit.

984
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,440
December 28th is the best they can do.

985
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Now, does that make sense?

986
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:51,440
Judging from what I know about these mystery spirits, I'm not sure I'd have the sort of emotional bandwidth to be able to focus on them in the way that they need in their run up.

987
00:48:51,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Well, and also they're booked up right now trying to convince old jerks, old rich jerks to be nicer.

988
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,440
And as you might know, that isn't an easy thing to do.

989
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,440
So maybe we can cut them a little bit of slack.

990
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,440
And maybe after Christmas Santa kills a bunch of them to cut down on food costs.

991
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
There it is.

992
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
Well, that's it.

993
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,440
In order for a new elf to be born, it has to rest in a pool of blood from an old Christmas elf.

994
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:25,440
They don't talk about this, but every year the workforce is replenished or else we'd run out of magical elf spirits pretty quickly.

995
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
Pretty fast, yeah.

996
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,440
You want to do one more question?

997
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
I'd love that.

998
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,440
My girlfriend and I are celebrating our first holiday season living together and have loved decorating and getting into the holiday spirit.

999
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
But there's one very obvious hole in our decorations.

1000
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,440
What should we put on the top of our Christmas tree?

1001
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,440
Should we stick with the classics?

1002
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,440
Should it reflect 2020?

1003
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,440
Or should we be thinking outside the box?

1004
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,440
And that's from Hatless Tree from down in DC.

1005
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
What do you guys put on the top of your trees?

1006
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,440
I mean a bow.

1007
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
A bow.

1008
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,440
It's so easy.

1009
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,440
You don't have to balance a big heavy.

1010
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,440
We used to put a big heavy metal star.

1011
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,440
What was I thinking?

1012
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,440
Dangerous is what that is.

1013
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
A bow.

1014
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
You just kind of throw it up there.

1015
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
Whatever.

1016
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,440
It's at a crooked angle.

1017
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,440
It's a bow.

1018
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,440
It's a bow.

1019
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,440
I put a picture of myself up there.

1020
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
Of course.

1021
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,440
Yeah.

1022
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,440
But it's me.

1023
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
It's me.

1024
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,440
It's very tastefully done.

1025
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,440
It's me as an angel fully nude.

1026
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,440
Every year we, for the past 10 years.

1027
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Yeah, Justin, I know you're wondering.

1028
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,440
My jumble is out.

1029
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Every year for the past 10 years we've put our little Yoda up there.

1030
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
And we've had this Yoda tree topping for 10 years.

1031
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
You plug him in and his little lightsaber lights up.

1032
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
It's fantastic.

1033
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,440
And then I see on Twitter trending topic yesterday.

1034
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Millennials are going wild about putting baby Yoda at the top of their tree.

1035
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
And it was infuriating to me because I got here first.

1036
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,440
Well, they're all putting Go-Gurt up there.

1037
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
And it makes you look like a real boob.

1038
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,440
They're putting TikTok up there.

1039
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:57,440
It should make you angry, Justin, because now you've got an old, busted, ugly, dirty adult Yoda up there.

1040
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,440
Yep.

1041
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,440
Gross.

1042
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
I want to-

1043
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
He said gross.

1044
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
I've been watching some Star Wars stuff here at the house.

1045
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,440
And whenever I see old adult Yoda, it makes me want to freaking barf.

1046
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,440
That dude makes me sick because-

1047
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
He looks like a green prune.

1048
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Yeah.

1049
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,440
And now I know what he could look like, which is the baby Yoda.

1050
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,440
And it's not even close.

1051
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,440
It makes me sick.

1052
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,440
So I don't want to come to your house.

1053
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
I'm not going to be able to anyway.

1054
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,440
But even if I could, I wouldn't because of how gross your old Yoda is.

1055
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
You know what would be cool up there?

1056
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Go the next step.

1057
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,440
Right?

1058
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,440
You got old Yoda.

1059
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,440
And then you got baby Yoda.

1060
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,440
Put some Yoda sperm up there.

1061
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
All right.

1062
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,440
So that's it.

1063
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,440
And here's the weird thing that we don't know about the-

1064
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,440
Well, I do.

1065
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,440
And I'm going to tell you about the Yoda species.

1066
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,440
It's just one big sperm.

1067
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Not a bunch of little ones.

1068
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
Just one big sperm.

1069
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
All right.

1070
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,440
Hey, can I tell you?

1071
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,440
It's adorable.

1072
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,440
One shot I will have.

1073
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,440
You better start swimming.

1074
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Here comes my blast.

1075
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,440
No, no, no.

1076
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,440
Don't move.

1077
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,440
I only have one blast.

1078
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,440
We're getting dangerously close to infringing on Magic Tavern territory.

1079
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,440
What would be sick is a full-sized basketball hoop.

1080
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,440
And then you could just do some powerful dunks and drain some threes.

1081
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,440
I like that.

1082
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,440
What about a live owl?

1083
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,440
That's pretty good.

1084
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Can he be perched on the basketball hoop just blocking shots?

1085
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,440
Don't bring that weak stuff here.

1086
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,440
To Kimbe Matumbowl.

1087
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,440
Another tree?

1088
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,440
Huh.

1089
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
What about...

1090
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,440
This isn't weird, it's just a funny cowboy hat.

1091
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,440
And then on the bottom, what's that?

1092
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,440
Spurs.

1093
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,440
That's cool.

1094
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,440
That is funny.

1095
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
I'm glad you told me that was going to be funny before you said it.

1096
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,440
Or else I wouldn't have known.

1097
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,440
If you hadn't said it, I wouldn't have known.

1098
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,440
Huh.

1099
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,440
Well, sometimes things just get sillier and sillier on the show.

1100
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,440
And I wanted to bring it back in to a possible actual answer.

1101
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,440
And sure, we de-escalated from Yoda sperm back to...

1102
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,440
That was the obvious off-ramp.

1103
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
Thank you so much for listening.

1104
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
Very quick, just to reiterate.

1105
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,440
Our fundraiser special is still available until January 4th.

1106
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,440
It's bit.ly forward slash candle nights 2020.

1107
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,440
Wonderful is doing a live fundraiser for the Austin Bat Cave.

1108
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,440
Which is about books and not bats.

1109
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Tickets are five bucks.

1110
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
It's December 29th at 9pm.

1111
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,440
More info and tickets available at bit.ly forward slash wonderful ABC.

1112
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,440
We've got a book launch event for our book.

1113
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,440
Everybody has a podcast except you.

1114
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,440
January 26th at 9pm.

1115
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,440
It's free.

1116
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
We partner with a bunch of independent booksellers.

1117
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,440
If you preorder from them, then you'll get an exclusively designed book plate

1118
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,440
signed by one of us with your copy while supplies last.

1119
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,440
Go to bit.ly forward slash McElroy podcast book event

1120
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,440
for bookstore links and more event info.

1121
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Travis, take over.

1122
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,440
You got it.

1123
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,440
We got lots of cool merch over at McElroymerch.com

1124
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,440
including a Festo pin of the month from the Adventure Zone graduation

1125
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,440
that benefits the Transgender Law Center as well as a Thunderman LLC patch.

1126
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Candle nights merch, which you need to get on now.

1127
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,440
And proceeds for those items go to Harmony House for all sales through January 1st.

1128
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
Once again, McElroymerch.com.

1129
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,440
You can preorder the Adventure Zone graphic novel book for Crystal Kingdom

1130
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,440
over at the Adventure Zone comic.com.

1131
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,440
Also, the Sawbones book is out in paperback on December 29th.

1132
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,440
It's new and revised for 2020.

1133
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,440
And that's at bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

1134
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,440
And MBMBAMANGELS is back.

1135
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,440
Go to MBMBAMANGELS.com to claim a stocking.

1136
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
I want to give a quick plug for that.

1137
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,440
That's a program that has been going for a long time

1138
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,440
and we sort of got the ball rolling, but we've had a lot of amazing fans

1139
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,440
pick it up since then.

1140
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,440
Every year people in our area have this list called the empty stockings

1141
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,440
that is published in the newspaper.

1142
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,440
And it's for people that aren't going to have a Christmas without some help.

1143
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,440
And every year our listeners take that list and they demolish it.

1144
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,440
They burn it down with generosity.

1145
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Yeah, in a good way.

1146
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
In a good way.

1147
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,440
And if you can join in with them, it's not a big push this year

1148
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,440
because honestly it's been a hard year for people

1149
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,440
and it seems weird to force it really hard.

1150
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,440
But if you can, it looks like they're, judging by the progress bar,

1151
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,440
it looks like they're about 75% of the way there.

1152
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
So Christmas is coming soon.

1153
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,440
Please, please, please go to MBMBAMANGELS.com.

1154
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,440
You can just donate money if you don't feel like calling,

1155
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
but there's specific stockings.

1156
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,440
You can claim one and help people out.

1157
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,440
And there's a lot of really deserving folks in there.

1158
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,440
So please go help out.

1159
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song

1160
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,440
It's a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1161
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,440
It's getting me through this long winter if you know what I'm saying.

1162
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,440
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1163
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,440
Go to MaximumFun.org.

1164
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,440
Check out all the great shows there.

1165
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
They got shows like Triple Click.

1166
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,440
They got shows like Mission to ZX.

1167
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,440
They got all kinds of fun stuff all at MaximumFun.org.

1168
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,440
Do you want the final?

1169
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,440
Yes.

1170
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
This one's actually holiday themed.

1171
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,440
I know the other Yahoo wasn't, but this one is.

1172
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,440
It was sent in by Graham Robot.

1173
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,440
Thank you, Graham.

1174
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,440
It's from Yahoo Answers user Brian who asks,

1175
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:24,440
Is it weird to find the Monty Python foot crushing thing sexy?

1176
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
My name is Justin McElroy.

1177
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,440
I'm Travis McElroy.

1178
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1179
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,440
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1180
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,440
Kiss your dad.

1181
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:56,440
Score on the lips.
