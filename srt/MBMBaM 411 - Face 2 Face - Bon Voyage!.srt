1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,960
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:01:04,080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:14,800
in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, Griffin Andrew McElroy. Justin's fucking kick flip over the

8
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,200
monitor there in the middle is the most righteous thing I've ever seen on a stage. Do you want to

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,920
hear something really sad? Yeah, I did it for the vine. Man, I still do a lot of stuff for the vine,

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,720
but it doesn't seem to be ending up on the platform. Yeah, not yet. I'm doing stuff all

11
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,480
the time where I think in my head after I do it like, certainly that's gonna be on the line.

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,920
That's that was for the vine. They didn't they didn't send their folks that day to capture your

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:55,040
sick stunt. Oh, boy. Hi, everybody. A lot of you said hi at the same time, which I which I

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,160
appreciated. We're very happy to be here in San Francisco. And we're very happy to be doing a

15
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:07,120
show show didn't almost it almost didn't happen. Yeah, because earlier today, we were so hungry.

16
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,640
Yeah, that we almost killed each other. We almost broke up. We almost broke up with us broke up. It

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,360
was almost the wedge. You don't know this, because you only think about it in like a, you know,

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,920
relationship. But if family gets together, sometimes they're like, I'm so hungry that I'm

19
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,160
angry at all of you. You want to break up. Here's how here's how hungry we were. And by we I mean

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,680
Griffin. We went back, we got some publicity photos taken of us for the first time in eight years

21
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,560
never happened before finally getting serious about this podcasting thing. It might just be a

22
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,960
thing. And if from now on, if you see a publicity photo of us, you can say to your friend, Hey,

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,240
I know I'm always telling you this whenever I see a publicity photo of the McElroy's,

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,840
but that was taken in San Francisco. And you can also say and I know we're back. One of them was

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,720
very hungry. One of them was super hungry. Here's how hungry we got back from taking the photos and

26
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,200
and Griffin says, hand to God direct quote, Oh, hell yeah, there's a bird King right there.

27
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:19,040
All right, Griffin, I, I was also very sleepy. All of my moodlets were in the red. And so my plan

28
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:28,560
was to slam some BK feel like big shit. Go sleep, which is like my that's like my best my favorite

29
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,840
state of being is drifting off to sleep. Like, I wonder if I'm gonna have diarrhea when I wake up.

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,760
That's not a bit for this show. Griffin's not doing it for the vine right now. He told us when

31
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,440
we went to eat lunch at a lovely Indian place called Punjab. I think it was Indian and Pakistani

32
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,480
food is delicious. It's fucking great. So good. Griffin told us while we're eating lunch like I

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,160
it wasn't that I want to Burger King. I just love feeling sick and taking a nap.

34
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,000
It was also great as we're I will back away from the mic for this moment. But as we were walking

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,080
to the restaurant, I said, Hmm, seems like some of us are hangry and Griffin went. Yeah. Yeah,

36
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:15,840
I yelled. I did yell. At that point, I was so angry. That my family didn't want to eat a Burger

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,360
King. He was mad at us. So mad. He sat down at the table when we finally got to the restaurant.

38
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,000
And he just kept saying like, This doesn't feel like real life. This feels like a dream.

39
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,880
And I told him I live in West Virginia, right? There's seven different places I can eat.

40
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,280
There's a Burger King and six Bojangles. And like, I'm not gonna eat at one of the places I

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
can eat at home. The Bojangles are organized around the Burger King like they're protecting

42
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,920
it. When the Bojangles open in Huntington, they became Knights of the Round. Thank you.

43
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,320
When the Bojangles opened in Huntington, they had to put up a road sign outside like to direct

44
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,600
traffic for Bojangles. This is the line for Bojangles. The Bojangles line took up this

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
entire lane of traffic. Can we tell one other anecdote? We're gonna get into the questions,

46
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,800
I promise. But can you? It's about the airport. They were at the airport. I don't want to brag.

47
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,920
But he's going to. When I travel, I fly Delta. And when I fly Delta, I hang out in the Delta

48
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Sky Club. It's not a big deal. And I overheard the best thing I've ever heard someone say

49
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,080
twice from the same person. The first thing they said was, I'm sorry to interrupt. I couldn't help

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,720
but overhearing you talking about chili. I love chili. And that made me so happy that I immediately

51
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,240
dropped everything. I think I looked at dad and said, shut up, shut up. And then about three

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,200
minutes later. Dad's very used to that. Yeah. And then about three minutes later, same person said,

53
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:57,840
well, I'd have to say that my favorite bean is... And at that point, I couldn't hear the rest of it

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,440
because my brain exploded. And I was just so happy. It's like, whoa, you're really putting me

55
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,880
on the spot here. My favorite bean. You know, it pushed. Was it one of us 30 years older time

56
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,680
traveling and recording an episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me? That's the only explanation.

57
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,160
I just love the idea of here's a person butting into a conversation that they were not a part of

58
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,160
and then thinking, you know what these people want to hear about? My bean thoughts. Quick poll.

59
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:38,720
It's black beans, right? Okay. The best beans. I prefer a red bean. I defer to the beanologist who

60
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
is Justin McElroy. Oh God. Now people can see that we've got some unpleasant aesthetic overlap.

61
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,200
I tried to keep the jacket on as long as I could. It's a little toasty.

62
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,880
It does pretty much naturally sum up our summer aesthetics,

63
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
which is you have the tropical shirt, I have a Hawaiian shirt and Griffin dresses like it's

64
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,040
winter. Also at the Delta Sky Club, I got to listen to my brother explain to a very nice lady

65
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,600
who was working there why he had a pin of himself on his lapel. She actually asked,

66
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,480
where did you get that done? Because my nephew would love that. I'm going to get a pin of him

67
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,240
for himself. And at first I thought, oh, this is good to put it in context. And then I thought,

68
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,000
no, actually it sounds worse to say, I thought people liked me enough to want to buy it.

69
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,520
So it's not like a vanity thing I did for just me. I thought people would want enough to want

70
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,840
to buy it. And also I got one and I'm wearing it now. You see this little face, check it up here.

71
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,760
I also think she did say, same face. Like, cause I made the face. She was like,

72
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,600
is that the same face as the pin? Yeah. How about we do the shit?

73
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,680
This is an advice show as you've almost certainly guessed. And here's our first question. How do I

74
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
get my friend to stop going through all my cabinets every time he comes to my house?

75
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,720
Is that seriously it? That's it. How do I get my, no context necessary.

76
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,120
Are you here? You're very close. Okay. Let me help. Your friend is here.

77
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,800
Oh, shit. Hold on. All right. So here's the thing. Your friend,

78
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,280
whether they'll admit to it or not. Can I get a name real quick?

79
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,880
This is going to be deeply uncomfortable. We are going to pretend like you're not here or else we

80
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,400
can't get it going. Or the whole show unravels. I'm going to look up here and I hope you don't

81
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,360
mind that, but I'm going to be at sort of balcony level with my eyesight. Oh yeah.

82
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,840
What's real quick. What's your, what's your name? I just heard Barfi because they blended in the

83
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:59,440
air in a. Okay. What's your name? Murphy and Tom. Okay. So Murphy, pretend your friend,

84
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,560
let's call him Greg. Greg is going through the cabinets. Here's what he's looking for. He's

85
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,920
looking for granny's treat drawer. Every granny's got one. Let me hear you real quick. Does your

86
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,840
granny have a treat drawer, everybody? Yes. Yes. It's got the fruit roll-ups. It's got the ring

87
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,920
pops. Whenever the grandkids come over, she wants to score some quick points. She pulls open this

88
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,160
special drawer and there's pixie six, pixie six, pixie six. Oh, that's great. Cause there's a bowl

89
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,480
of like bowl of fruit on the counter. So the parents are like, ah, fruit. Great. And then

90
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,640
they leave and granny's like, no, no. Let's party idiots. Granny fucking heavyweights it.

91
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,640
She pulls off the banister off the stairs. It's full of some, I can't think of a type of candy

92
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,280
guys. Her shoe laces are candy laces. I heard a wallpaper is candy dots. Nobody likes those.

93
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,760
There's so much work for so little payoff with a candy dot and you're getting at least 5% paper.

94
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,720
Your friend is looking for granny's treat drawer. So, but granny moves it sometimes because the

95
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,400
parents will get, the rents, if you'll allow, will get wise. So granny moves it. So your friend

96
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,240
is going through all your cabinets, looking for your treat drawer. And you know, you've got one

97
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,760
if you're a grandmother. I can't, it's fairly dark out there. I can't tell. And I wouldn't want

98
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,880
to make it. How many grandmothers do we have here tonight? Granny's in the house. Oh, so your friend

99
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,840
your friend is looking for that cookie crisp. Is your friend opening these cabinets in like a

100
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:35,680
fevered way or just very slowly like, hmm. Deeply hungry every time. Is your friend a raccoon? Once

101
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,120
again, assuming I can't see them. Half raccoon. Interesting. I've seen some pictures of that on

102
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:54,000
the internet. Daddy like. Usually they're dating Sonic. Yes. You got to leave your treats in an

103
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,400
easily accessible place. Take the box of cookie crisp, or if they're looking for weed, whatever

104
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,400
it is, leave it on the counter. Usually one of those leads to the other one. Yeah, there's

105
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,280
inextricably tied. Leave your treats on the counter. And then he's not gonna have to root

106
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,720
through. He'll just say, oh, your weed. It's right here. Oh, your cookie crisp is right. Oh,

107
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,640
you put the weed in the cookie crisp. Let me suggest I'm a parent now and I have a 19 month

108
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:34,160
old daughter who just. We all have kids. She doesn't understand boundaries. So we had to put

109
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,440
child locks on everything and child locks are great because don't let the name fool you.

110
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,240
They confound everyone. Yeah, it's great. It's great appetite control too, because sometimes

111
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,320
I'll want a loose fistful of cookie crisp at three 30 p.m. On a Wednesday and I'll walk up to

112
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,400
the drawer and pull it and get a chunk and I'll be like, fuck it. It's not. Hey, Griffin, would you

113
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:06,480
be so kind as to treat me to a Yahoo? I would love to. Yes. I know. Did you guys see when we

114
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,760
were driving to the photo shoot today? Yahoo HQ. We passed it and they were like, thank you for

115
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,120
being the only people who use our website. There's probably employees here. Oh, shit. Shit.

116
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,600
Well, now we can't fucking ask because we spoiled the the waters of polling. But

117
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,120
we'll just got it. Who here isn't an employee of Yahoo? Jesus. So subtract that.

118
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,680
All right. This one was sent in by Grin Velesty. Thank you, Grin. It's Yahoo Answers user

119
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,760
Brandy who asks, are you allowed to put baby on board sticker when driving motorcycle in California?

120
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,720
Obviously, obviously you are not allowed to put baby and motorcycle in Cali.

121
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,040
But I thought it would be funny if I put fascists.

122
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,240
But I thought it would be funny if I put a sticker on the back of my black

123
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,040
hellite vest. I am wearing that say baby on board. It is a it's a little giggly joke.

124
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,760
Oh, okay. But I think but I think it would make me more visible and safer while having some quick

125
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,640
laugh. On top of that, ever since I put the sticker, no. Okay, so you already pulled the

126
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:39,280
trigger on this one. No one no one is tailgating me on my street bike. I'm not sure what the

127
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,880
psychology behind it, but people seem to be more careful around me. They are keeping distance.

128
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,320
People that wants to pass over me will make a lot of room to switch to my lane. You can't.

129
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,920
It minimize people that are having road rage as well. And then and then

130
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,760
and then baby on board. End of sentence.

131
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,560
So is this illegal to put this last thing I want is some random out you. I have so much.

132
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,720
Last thing I want is some random law that people can find a loop to do something crazy.

133
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:32,320
Easy. You can't. You can't say that you don't understand the psychology

134
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,920
of why people might be more cautious. Even if there's a 1% chance there's a baby on your

135
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:48,080
motorcycle. Yeah, for me, even if the Vegas odds trend heavily towards there's not a baby on that

136
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:56,400
moving object. If I if I see a motorcyclist, which is the proper term with a baby on board sticker

137
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,520
on the back of their jacket, I'm going to assume two things are possible. One is a person with a

138
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,480
baby stuffed into their jacket or two. It's a person with nothing left to lose. Either way,

139
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,520
I'm going to give them their space. The I would have also gone three three babies in a coat.

140
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,840
Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I do like that this question asker make sure to

141
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,120
denote that you can't put a baby on a motorcycle in California. Thank you. Are there states? Oh,

142
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,560
for sure. For sure. For sure. For sure. For sure. Wait, hold on. I'm sorry. I didn't.

143
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,800
If there's a sidecar, I get it. God, that I would be willing to bet dollars to

144
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,520
donuts. There are states where you don't even need one of those. There's some wild state laws

145
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,880
out there, man. In fucking like in fucking Florida, you can like shoot a whale from a moving

146
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,680
helicopter. There's a law somewhere that's like, go for it. We got lots of babies.

147
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:08,640
I think that this could be applicable in lots of arenas. If you have a shirt that just says

148
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,920
baby on board, I think you're going to avoid a lot of conflict because you're going to buy

149
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,320
yourself an extra half second where the person's like, is there? I don't see a baby on board,

150
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,120
but I guess it could be in a satchel. Just let them have their fun. You know, it's just a little

151
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:35,200
giggle. It's just a giggle joke. Just one giggly joke. Could you think if you were the person

152
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:44,560
behind that wheel? I would think they had a motorcycle basket with a baby. Yeah. On the

153
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:53,760
front side of it. That's fun to think about. I love my imagination. You all are so lucky to even

154
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,920
be exposed to it. To even get a ray of light from my beautiful imagination sun shining down on you.

155
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:14,160
Damn. Why are we not giving all motorcyclists a little room? You've seen what they are working

156
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,800
with. Why are you up on them? It will not pan out well for them. Give them all a little bit of space.

157
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:29,200
I actually think one of you. And that one goes for non-motor cycle. How about what if we just

158
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,120
all don't crash? That's like a coin. Bicycles, motorcycles, penny-farthing bicycles. Yes.

159
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,240
That's the one with the big wheel and the little wheel. Oh, Travis, this is San Francisco. They

160
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,280
know what a penny-farthing bicycle is. That's why I didn't get a laugh because everyone's like,

161
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:55,840
yes. Yes. Yes. And unicycles. I'm moving back home to Australia tomorrow after a year studying in New

162
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,000
York. I have promised a lot of people that I'll stay in touch with them. I know that I almost

163
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,760
certainly won't do this. And honesty is so important. How soon until I can let them down?

164
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,520
Should I tell them that actually I lied when saying goodbye? That's from Sam. Sam, are you here?

165
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:28,560
Nice. Okay, I heard a few people cheering with Sam. That could be Sam and Sam's friends,

166
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:37,920
in which case, bad news. Enjoy these final moments with Sam. Drinking the Sam. You've

167
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,480
only got so much left. Justin, I would like you to say to me, let's keep in touch and I will

168
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:51,200
demonstrate how Sam should have handled this situation. Okay. Hey, let's keep in touch.

169
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,400
The old mouth full of peanut butter gag. The old Mr. Ed. I love it. Well, that way,

170
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,920
three years later, when they realized, I haven't heard from Sam in a while, like, wait, did he say

171
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:09,120
yes? By definition, you don't have to worry about this. Here's what is so charming to me,

172
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,320
and perhaps this speaks to the Australian sensibility. I don't know a lot of your people,

173
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,920
but I do want to know, I think it's so rad that you have a notch of caring that is caring what

174
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,360
they think about me, not caring to see whether they live or die. That is just, you are right

175
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,360
there and you have a setting for that, which I think is so lovely. If it were me, I'd just be

176
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:45,120
like, yeah, okay, bye. All right. Sounds good. Dead to me. They are as dust. You gave too

177
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,080
concrete of a response, Sam. Next time, you got to be more mysterious with the other people.

178
00:19:50,080 --> 00:20:01,600
Just look up and say, shh, it is in the wind. Bon voyage. It is important that you be on a boat.

179
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,160
That is pulling out. I have gathered you all here for an announcement. It is in the wind.

180
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Bon voyage. All of your friends gathered. The size of the boat doesn't matter, but I recommend

181
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,920
bigger the better. Bigger the better. Yeah, that's true. Gather everyone you've met that you've told

182
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:26,640
you to keep in contact and say, friends, I have sad news. I know we have promised to keep in touch,

183
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:36,480
but I am Sam. It is in the wind. Bon voyage. Then maybe do that thing where you put one foot up on

184
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,200
the prow of the ship as you look out over the ocean. Then they think, who knows where Sam's

185
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,200
going to end up? You could say, haven't you seen Before Sunrise? It's way more romantic. If we

186
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,720
don't make any firm plans, if we get back together. Here's the thing, Sam, here's the problem. You are

187
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,640
the one leaving, right? When they say keep in touch, what they're saying is you keep in touch

188
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,200
with me. How about when they say keep in touch, you say, you touch me, and then you leave.

189
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,640
I got a lot of people who want Sam to touch them. Nothing else beyond you touch me. In that tone of

190
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,440
voice, like I was speaking to my family when they turned me down for Burger King, around that,

191
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,360
sort of like, you touch me, and then you leave. Then you're gone. Have you considered a monthly

192
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:29,920
newsletter? The Samsung Times. About your new products that you're putting out. How about a

193
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:39,760
Yahoo? Yep. Here's one we got from a few folks. It's from Yahoo Answers user, Bunny W. We are on

194
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,480
a streak of two Yahoos with usernames I can read, which is a new high score. It's because you're in

195
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,600
San Francisco. We're so close. I'm getting the direct feed. He just ran over and handed,

196
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,680
oh, hot off the presses. I'm connected to Yahoo through Bluetooth right now.

197
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:07,200
Bunny says, how do I breed my carpet python? A vet recommended we bred our carpet python.

198
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,400
Any advice? Update. I have a female carpet python, and our vet recommended we bred her.

199
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:24,880
Carpet python sounds like a euphemism that I can't parse. Yeah. Sounds like what you'd

200
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:36,960
call like a couch's dick. Hey, did you check out the carpet python on that couch? Yeah. Yeah,

201
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,040
dude. Yeah, man. Gnarly stuff. Wayfair does got just what I need.

202
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
There is no place- Talk about love scenes.

203
00:22:51,760 --> 00:23:07,120
I submit there is no place that you could put a dick on a couch where it would continue to

204
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,520
be a functional couch, right? Where would it even go? Where would it go? Don't tell me between

205
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,880
the cushions because that's the mouth. That's the mouth of the couch. If you're wild about

206
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,000
couch dick, I'm not here to yuck any yums, but I just like to sit down. So you just slap

207
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,080
the two snakes together is what I understand. Well, you got to get them hard first. Yeah.

208
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,560
You get them hard and horny. Like thunder sticks at a football game.

209
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
You give one of them the old boo-boo-zela.

210
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,960
And then you turn it into a poodle. And then it's hard as hell and ready to

211
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,080
and then you just slap those two snakes together. Come hell or high water. And they put on some

212
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,280
sexy snake music. White snake. Thank you. And you just slap them together.

213
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,640
Also could have gone with poison. Sorry, everybody.

214
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Here's the thing. There is a percentage of this room of people who have in the last two minutes

215
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,720
thought about what it would look like for two snakes to have sex. Is it front to front? Is it

216
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,000
front to back? Is it curled into a pretzel? We do not know. Is there a position that doesn't look

217
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,080
like one snake killing the other? Because I can't think of it. Is a caduceus just some rad snake

218
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,920
69-ing? They're wrapped around a snake dildo and they're and they're losing it. They're loving it.

219
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:47,200
The Ouroboros. The Ouroboros is definitely snake 69. The symbol from the never-ending storybook.

220
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,600
And was potentially what I was thinking of when I said the wrong thing and fucked up.

221
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,840
Here's the thing that bothers me. It still worked, Griffin. Huh? It would still work. It's fine. I

222
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,400
just did the sex toy thing with the staff. It worked fine. Don't beat yourself up. I have seen a lot of

223
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:13,840
snakes in my life. I don't want to brag. I cannot imagine a quality a snake would have that would

224
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,280
cause me to think that's like a carpet. Because the only thing I can think is a furry snake. Yeah.

225
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Nope. We've got those already. They're called ferrets. Thanks, snakes.

226
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,600
You're a ferret now. We're all full up here, snakes. Wait, hold on. Is that what they're talking about?

227
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Yeah, it's, yeah. I'm looking at it now. Yeah, they're talking about ferrets. That's slang. That's ferret owner slang.

228
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,840
Are they big? Are they small? What's the story with carpet snakes? We could have googled this, I guess.

229
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,960
They're pretty big. No, I did. All right. They're pretty big. Any videos of people slapping them together?

230
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:58,080
Oh, they got Net Nanny at this venue. They won't let me. But you googled slapping two snakes together.

231
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:14,320
Hey, baby of your list. I'm so sorry for everything. I googled carpet snakes sex.

232
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:32,080
Google, in 0.46 seconds, provided me with 10,500,000 results. In less than half a second, Google was like,

233
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:45,840
Carpet snakes sex, huh? There's videos. There's pictures. There's helpful tips. There's websites. There's a website called ReptileSex.co.uk.

234
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Hey, hold on. There's an urban dictionary for carpet python. Click it. Okay. Griffin is now going to read the urban dictionary definition for carpet python.

235
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,520
Oh, no, I'm not. It's horrible. He's going to read it, and whether or not he says it out loud or not, you can kind of...

236
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:14,880
No, no, no, no. Don't you look either. Please. No, don't. Please. I love you too much. Please, no.

237
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,080
Oh, okay. If you're listening later. Oh, my God. Look, it's me from the future. I'm coming out on stage.

238
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Hey, listen. Make sure you delete the part where you talk about the urban dictionary. It goes so bad for everybody.

239
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,080
One more question. Yeah. We're going to do an intermission, but we didn't mention this at the top.

240
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,080
We're going to do an intermission here in a little bit, and when we come back, we're going to do your questions.

241
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Go ahead and email us at, what is it? Live at bim-bam.com. During intermission, go buy pins of our face and a misprinted poster.

242
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Oh, Travis, I'm sure. Yeah, by the way, there will be W's for sale that you can just glue on there. They'll be $18.

243
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:04,080
We need to explain it because this place is called the Warfield. It's beautiful. It's lovely. Thank you to the Warfield.

244
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:14,080
It may be the situation that Paul, our beloved tour manager's computer, autocorrected that to another word.

245
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,080
That other word could be an orange cat who gets up to no good sometimes.

246
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,080
Here's the thing. Let me tell you right now. The Warfield loves Mondays, hates lasagna.

247
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
True. It's a different thing.

248
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:36,080
This will be Paul's last show with us. If you would all join me in saying goodbye, Paul.

249
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Goodbye, Paul. Bon voyage.

250
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,080
Paul, can you come out real quick? Just a quick bow. Thanks for all the hard work, Paul.

251
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Paul's last show.

252
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Go ahead and settle up now. There's your five bucks.

253
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Yeah, we do need change.

254
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Change from that. Thank you, Paul. Perfect. Thank you, Paul.

255
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Paul Seborn, everybody.

256
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Paul Seborn. He'll never work in this town again.

257
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,080
If any of you out there would like to be Paul, make sure you drop us a line.

258
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
We'll be holding Paul auditions tomorrow.

259
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
We'll be holding Paul auditions.

260
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Can we do one more? I think we can solve this one really quickly.

261
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Sure, sure.

262
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I've been playing Dance Dance Revolution competitively for more than 15 years.

263
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Fuck yes.

264
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
The newest version is only available near me at an arcade slash sports bar establishment.

265
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Dave and Buster's.

266
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Does it say that?

267
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
In parentheses it says Dave and Buster's.

268
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Just say fucking Dave and Buster's.

269
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
It's the little mom and pop local joint.

270
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,080
It's owned by my friends Dave and Buster.

271
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,080
So often there will be drunk dude bros who mock me while I'm playing.

272
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,080
Or will jump around on the other pad while I'm trying to focus on the game.

273
00:29:50,080 --> 00:30:00,080
How do I deal with these jerks who are distracting and taunting me when I'm just trying to get some exercise and improve my scores?

274
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,080
That's from Distracted Dancer in... Daily City?

275
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Are you here?

276
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Why the fuck are you all sitting so close?

277
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Here's the thing Justin, until we made the joke about the mom and pop thing, I never thought maybe these dude bros are Dave Jr. and Buster Jr.

278
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Shit.

279
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
This is my dad's place.

280
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,080
This is my dad's place. They said I could hassle whoever I want.

281
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
And I chose you.

282
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
What are they doing there?

283
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,080
What are the dude bros doing that they think they're so cool and high and mighty and above DDR but they're still at Dave and Buster's?

284
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
Sure.

285
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
They're also here?

286
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Yeah.

287
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,080
It's like opening your eyes when you pray and you see someone else opening their eyes and you're like, gotcha.

288
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
It's like, no idiot.

289
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
You're opening your eyes too.

290
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,080
You didn't accidentally go to Dave and Buster's because you read about the food on Yelp.

291
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,080
And you got there like, oh it turns out they have video games here too.

292
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,080
I love sweet potatoes and I love when they're made into fries.

293
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Don't mind if I do.

294
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
Here's what you do, you go to every fucking golden tea machine in that place.

295
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
The jock games.

296
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
The jock games.

297
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
Like golden tea golf.

298
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Go to all the golden tea, go to all the hunting games.

299
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
You get a jar of jelly.

300
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,080
You put the jelly on the golden tea roller ball.

301
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Oh, dude.

302
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
I'm going to top my best score in golden tea.

303
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Oh no.

304
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,080
I got jelly all over my ding-dang hair.

305
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,080
What's great about that one is if they still touch it, you take a picture of it, put it on Facebook.

306
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
And you say, look at these perverts touching the jelly ball.

307
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Upload that to nastyboys.tumblr.com.

308
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Also, they're not going to be able to get the traction they need for all their great chickens.

309
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
They go to roll and it sticks.

310
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
Oh no, the ball rolls backwards.

311
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
And they're like, look at these amateurs.

312
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
And then you make fun of them.

313
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
They're not going to have any reason to want to stick around to Dave and Buster's.

314
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Hey, let's go guys.

315
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
All the machines here have jelly on them.

316
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Let's scram, T-birds.

317
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
And they walk out snapping.

318
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Let's go, guys.

319
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
This place is the pits.

320
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
All right, folks, that's going to do it for us.

321
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
We will be back with you. Email us your questions.

322
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
And we will help you through all of it.

323
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
We love you. Buy some things. Get some pee done.

324
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
And we will see you in a few minutes.

325
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:40,080
We love you.

326
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
Hey everybody, it's Griffin and Travis.

327
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Justin's not here because he fell in a big toilet.

328
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
But we're going to tell you all about our sponsors this week.

329
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
No bullshit. No guff.

330
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
And don't worry about Justin.

331
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
He's fine. He's just in the toilet.

332
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
Yeah, he said he texted us.

333
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
He said, I fell in the toilet. Please send 911.

334
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
And he said, are you serious, dog?

335
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
And he said, never mind. It's totally cool in here.

336
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
So I guess he found some friends.

337
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Sort of a whole labyrinth situation.

338
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
But damn it, Travis, I said no bullshit.

339
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
No guff.

340
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Okay, sorry. Go on.

341
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
Tell me about Squarespace as quickly as you possibly can

342
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
while being respectful of the fact that Squarespace paid us to talk about them.

343
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
Okay, here's the thing.

344
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
I love Squarespace very much.

345
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
In this day and age, everybody's got...

346
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Well, why didn't you marry it?

347
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
I have.

348
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
Well, I was kind of building up to it,

349
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
but the word is out.

350
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Yeah, congratulations, I guess.

351
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Thank you very much.

352
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
I made a website on Squarespace,

353
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
which is what I consider marriage.

354
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Oh, okay.

355
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
And it's called McRoyShows.com,

356
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
and it was incredibly easy to make.

357
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
Squarespace is so intuitive,

358
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
and you don't have to know anything about coding.

359
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
You don't have to know anything about making a website.

360
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
You just go to Squarespace.

361
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
You're like, I want to do this,

362
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
and it's really easy, it's super great.

363
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
They have beautiful templates,

364
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
and they have powerful e-commerce functionality,

365
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
so you can sell things on your website.

366
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
It's free and secure hosting,

367
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
and there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

368
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
So how do I get this dang thing?

369
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Well, you head to squarespace.com slash mybrother

370
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080

to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

That's squarespace.com slash mybrother

375
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
and then enter the code

376
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
mybrother, all one word, mybrother.

377
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
Travis mentioned McElroy Shows.

378
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
Quick plug, go to McElroyShows.com slash tours.

379
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
Travis has updated it with a bunch of stuff.

380
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,080
All of our upcoming announced shows

381
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,080
from Bim Bam and Taz,

382
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,080
including some Bim Bam shows in Orlando and Atlanta

383
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
coming up later this summer.

384
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,080
We got links to the book tour that we're doing

385
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
for the Taz graphic novel in July.

386
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
I think there's still some tickets available.

387
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
It'll be fun. It'll be like a Q&A

388
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
and a little reading of parts of the book,

389
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
and your ticket covers the price of a graphic novel.

390
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
And then, Travis, you got tickets for,

391
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
oh, we're also doing some book signing events

392
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
that just got added there. You can find it, all that.

393
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
And, Travis, you have tickets for

394
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
the next CUS that's coming up very soon, right?

395
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Yes, so this Sunday,

396
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Sunday the 24th, June 24th,

397
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
at 8pm, we're doing another

398
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Cincinnati Underground Society Show,

399
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
which is my Secret Society

400
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
style comedy show.

401
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
I've brought in five amazing surprise

402
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
guests that I cannot tell you now, but I can

403
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
tell you they're some of my favorite people in the world.

404
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
It's going to be a hell of a good time.

405
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
$15. It's a comedy show,

406
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
but it's got a whole

407
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Secret Society veneer.

408
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
It's really fun. It's one of my favorite

409
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
things I get to do now, and

410
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,080
I want you to come and have a great time

411
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
in Cincinnati, Ohio, June 24th,

412
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
8pm. You can find that on

2018. I want to tell you about

419
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Stamps.com. Stamps.com is the

420
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
best, because these days you can

421
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
get pretty much anything on demand, like our

422
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
podcast, which you listen to whenever

423
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
you want, whenever it's convenient for you,

424
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
or whenever we make unreasonable demands

425
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
of you. But

426
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Stamps.com can do the same thing for

427
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
you, but for Stamps. You don't have to

428
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
take a trip to the post office to mail your letters

429
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
and your packages. You can get your postage

430
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
on demand with Stamps.com.

431
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Ah, Stamps. I was

432
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,080
misreading it the whole time. With Stamps.com

433
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
you can access all the amazing services

434
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
of the post office right from your desk 24-7.

435
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
You can buy and print official U.S. postage

436
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
for any letter, any package, using your own

437
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
computer and printer. This is very

438
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
convenient for me. Me and Rachel recently

439
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
moved. Now we're a bit further away from the

440
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
post office that we use.

441
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
And now I can just do all this shit at home from my

442
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
desk and not have to go to the scary outside

443
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
my house. Right now you can use

444
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080

Enter MyBrother. Travis,

452
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
this Jumbotron. What's the fuckin' deal?

453
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Well, Griffin,

454
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
thank you for asking. This is for

455
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Craig from

456
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Mike, if you can

457
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
believe it. I don't...

458
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
It's out of this world. And Mike says

459
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
to Craig,

460
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
I know there's nothing you want more in life

461
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
than the McRoy's congratulating you on getting married.

462
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
So I bought a Jumbotron so they can

463
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
tell you how happy they are for you.

464
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Congratulations, Craig!

465
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
We're so happy you found someone as great

466
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
as Sosi to spend your

467
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
life with. We hope you have

468
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
a great wedding day and a great

469
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
weekend in Boulder. I do love,

470
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
I noticed here, that what Mike has

471
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
done switched from

472
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
I to we

473
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
to make it seem like we,

474
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
the McRoy brothers, are saying this.

475
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
That's bullshit,

476
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Craig. Don't fall for it. Mike wrote

477
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
that. I was just reading it.

478
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
This is a trick. I mean, I am...

479
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
It's a trick. I am

480
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
psyched out of my mind, though.

481
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Fuckin' losing it. And I hope

482
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
you have a great wedding day. And has anybody

483
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
ever had a bad weekend in Boulder?

484
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Probably. Yeah,

485
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
probably. It's the city and people going through

486
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
a lot of stuff everywhere. I got a message here for

487
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
John and it's from Mark who says, Thanks for

488
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
being such a great friend. I'm sad that you are going

489
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,080
to be moving away or have already moved.

490
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I had to write this message way before a date was

491
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
set. I either miss you or I'm going to miss

492
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
you. Who knows what's already happened by the time

493
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
you hear this. Happy birthday wherever you

494
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,080
are, whether you're in Phoenix, Milwaukee,

495
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
or anywhere else.

496
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
This is one of the more abstract messages

497
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
that we've ever had on the show, which

498
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
is sort of the nature of the Jumbotron.

499
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
It's applicable,

500
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
I guess, to all

501
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Johns, wherever you are, whatever your

502
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,080
heart is telling you tonight,

503
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
if you feel your heart telling you something, why don't

504
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
you come on down and talk to us

505
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
about Jesus. That one

506
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
got a little twisted up

507
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
a little bit. Hey, what's

508
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,080
up with this last Jumbotron? Yeah,

509
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
we got one last one here. I'm going to shoot

510
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
straight from the hip with this one. Say it's from

511
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Shelby to Jordan.

512
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Happy birthday, JoJo.

513
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Thank you for being the best

514
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
husband, D&D partner,

515
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,080
and all around hard worker boy.

516
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
It's been amazing to watch you grow

517
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
into the person you are today. You

518
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
are my inspiration.

519
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
I love you the

520
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
mostest. I love

521
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
this one. It doesn't make us say a bunch of bullshit.

522
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Doesn't hijack our

523
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
brains, mouths, and voices. It's just

524
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
a message about a sweet love.

525
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
A good, sweet love.

526
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Yeah, this isn't like a funny like,

527
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
I'm going to make Griffin say doody noodles

528
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
with his mouth or whatever. This is

529
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,080
just like, hey, JoJo.

530
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
You're great. Just

531
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
stand and deliver that good,

532
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
sweet, sweet love.

533
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
That's it for the

534
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Jumbotrons. We're going to get back to the

535
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
rest of the episode. If you're in San Francisco,

536
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
hope you had a good time, and we'll be back

537
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
with another regular episode next Monday.

538
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
We'll see you then.

539
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Don't forget to check out macroshows.com

540
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
slash tours. Yes,

541
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
do it. Then we'll see you

542
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:58,080
then. Bye.

543
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Okay, so

544
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
I guess let's just get

545
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:54,080
I'm having some interference.

546
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Time.

547
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
He's got it.

548
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:20,080
That sound I've been looking for.

549
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Still going.

550
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I want a much.

551
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Welcome to Munch Squad.

552
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,080
I was

553
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
within a podcast.

554
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Let me finish. It's a podcast

555
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
within a podcast about

556
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,080
ladies grace in quick service restaurant

557
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
innovations. My name is Justin

558
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
McElroy, and I'll be your host this week.

559
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
It's the first

560
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
time that the audience interaction part

561
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:02,080
of that has hurt my ears.

562
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,080
It's not pleasant.

563
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,080
Paul, that was a generous pour.

564
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
Whenever you get, if you find some Diet Coke

565
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
back there, you go ahead on

566
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
and just hit me with that because we're going to need to

567
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
slow things on down.

568
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
We're going to make it to the end of the show.

569
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,080
Munch Squad.

570
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Don't let

571
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
bad potholes ruin

572
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
good pizza.

573
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Domino's

574
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
starts paving for

575
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
pizza.

576
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Can I ask you a question right at the

577
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
beginning of the premise? Yes.

578
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Go ahead.

579
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Have potholes ruined good

580
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
pizza before this?

581
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,080
Yeah, you fucking idiot.

582
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
They were

583
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
one of the

584
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
main weapons

585
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
that he used in his fight.

586
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
I need everyone to

587
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,080
spiritually brace themselves. It'll

588
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
help if you've seen Handmaid's Tale, I think.

589
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
I haven't

590
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
seen it, but I'm assuming.

591
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
It's about this.

592
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,080
The largest

593
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,080
pizza company in the world

594
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
based on global retail

595
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
sales, which seems like a good metric

596
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
for that. No need to

597
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
specify. Really? Is saving

598
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
pizza one pothole

599
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
at a time.

600
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
Cracks, bumps, potholes,

601
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,080
and other road conditions

602
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
can put good pizzas at risk after

603
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
they leave the store.

604
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Now Domino's is helping

605
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
to smooth the ride home for our

606
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,080
freshly made pizzas.

607
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Starting today, Domino's is

608
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
asking customers to nominate their town

609
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
for pothole repairs at pavingforpizza.com.

610
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Are they filling these

611
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,080
things in with cheese bread

612
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
sauce, pepperonis?

613
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,080
No. As much as it may feel like cement

614
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,080
once it's entered your body, no.

615
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
They're using actual cement.

616
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,080
Quote from Russell

617
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Weiner, president of Domino's

618
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,080
USA. They got

619
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
Russell for this one.

620
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,080
The president of Domino's.

621
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Have you ever hit a pothole

622
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,080
and instantly cringed?

623
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,080
We know that feeling is

624
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
heightened when you're bringing home a

625
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
carry out order from your local Domino's

626
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,080
store. I got my

627
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
kid in the back seat, but I'm way more concerned

628
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,080
about the 12 inch

629
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
sausage. I have

630
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
an automatic thing on my

631
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
passenger seat where if the passenger is sitting there

632
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
it reminds you to buckle their seatbelt.

633
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
And a few weeks ago I bought enough

634
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
pizza that it activated that.

635
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,080
And in

636
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
my car's defense

637
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
I paid a lot for that

638
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,080
pizza. I probably should buckle it in.

639
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,080
Fair enough.

640
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Fair enough, car.

641
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,080
We don't want to lose any

642
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,080
great tasting pizza to a pothole

643
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,080
ruining a wonderful meal.

644
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Said Russell Weiner, president

645
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,080
of Domino's USA.

646
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,080
How bad does a pothole have to fuck

647
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,080
up your pizza that you throw it away?

648
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,080
You hit the pothole, the pizza

649
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,080
flips end over end

650
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,080
because you live in Roger Rabbit.

651
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,080
But okay, it might affect the pizza aesthetically

652
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,080
but you can still

653
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,080
consume it. Daniel Tiger says that

654
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,080
even if it's mushy it still tastes good.

655
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Right. Domino's cares too

656
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,080
much about its customers and pizza

657
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,080
to let that happen. That is not true.

658
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,080
If they care about me

659
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,080
they have a funny way of showing

660
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,080
it.

661
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Domino's has already worked alongside

662
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,080
four municipalities to help prepare roads.

663
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,080
Jesus Christ!

664
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,080
Those include Bartonville, Texas

665
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,080
Milford, Delaware, Athens, Georgia,

666
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,080
and Burbank, California.

667
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Customers

668
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,080
interested in nominating their town

669
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,080
for a paving grant from Domino's

670
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
can enter the zip code at pavingforpizza.com

671
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,080
If their

672
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,080
town is selected their customer will be

673
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,080
notified and the city will receive funds

674
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,080
to help prepare roads so pizzas

675
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,080
can make it home safely.

676
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Customers

677
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,080
can celebrate smooth roads

678
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,080
with Domino's carryout special

679
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,080
featuring large three topping pizzas

680
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
for $7. Okay.

681
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,080
It's 2018

682
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
and

683
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,080
this is where we're at. Yeah.

684
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,080
Our infrastructure

685
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,080
relies on Domino's.

686
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,080
You know how

687
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,080
like the

688
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,080
final season of Lost

689
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,080
took some

690
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,080
weird twists and turns

691
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,080
and that happened on a lot of shows like

692
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Felicity.

693
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,080
Original

694
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,080
probably only

695
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,080
just kind of racist

696
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,080
Roseanne.

697
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,080
Weird twists and turns.

698
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,080
I feel like here

699
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,080
in the final season of Capitalism

700
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,080
we're getting some like weird

701
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,080
like whoa.

702
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,080
Yeah. Like you all know that

703
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,080
like there's a point at which Domino's is

704
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,080
like we fixed all the

705
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,080
roads we should probably govern.

706
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,080
Yeah. Don't you

707
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,080
think that we did a better job than your

708
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,080
city. Do you want to just be a

709
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,080
Domino's city.

710
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,080
So you have to decide whether

711
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,080
or not you want to vote Republican or

712
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,080
pizza crap.

713
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,080
And Taco Bell is like we

714
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,080
could open up a traffic court if you

715
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,080
guys want that. Would that

716
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,080
be cool.

717
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,080
The wheels are just way off

718
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,080
the thing at this point. The thing is that

719
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,080
the wheels are off but they're

720
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,080
not because they fixed the bottles.

721
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,080
Thank you Travis. Okay so

722
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,080
we are going to.

723
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Thank you Paul.

724
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,080
Thank you.

725
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,080
Thank you. Paul you've saved

726
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,080
the show. You're back on.

727
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,080
Yay. Welcome back Paul Saborin.

728
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,080
All right. You saved the rec center.

729
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,080
Yeah that's good Paul. That's real good.

730
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,080
Can we get some house lights up

731
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,080
because I have no fucking clue where the

732
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,080
microphone is in the audience.

733
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
If you would like to give us your pronouns

734
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,080
we would of course welcome that. Do not goof

735
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,080
about it though because you will be ejected from the theater.

736
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,080
Sarah. The

737
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,080
sentence that Sarah sent us was

738
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,080
to say the least

739
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
tantalizing.

740
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,080
Sarah asked how do I

741
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,080
get my friends to stop using their

742
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,080
dog's dick to promote their furniture

743
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,080
line.

744
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,080
And all I can

745
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,080
say is go off. Yes.

746
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,080
Sarah

747
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,080
has stepped 30 feet away from the microphone

748
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,080
recoiling. She did not

749
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,080
think this was going to make it. I did not.

750
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,080
And yet here we all are

751
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,080
Sarah. You did walk down to the

752
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
microphone Sarah. Kind of a fun

753
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,080
cautionary tale for everyone.

754
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,080
My friend volunteered

755
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,080
to come for me and I wish I had let

756
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,080
her do that. Oh my god so much happened in

757
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,080
the span of just a few seconds. Yeah and it's also

758
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,080
worth noting that we called three people

759
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,080
a few minutes ago and only two have come down.

760
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,080
So one of those people is like actually fuck

761
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,080
that.

762
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,080
No way. They're sitting on the stairs.

763
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,080
Sarah.

764
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,080
Dog dick furniture

765
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,080
line. Curious how that's germane

766
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,080
even a little bit. Is it tied in? Is it a

767
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,080
celebrity endorsement?

768
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,080
A famous dog Taco Bell dog.

769
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Spud's McKenzie showing his dick.

770
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,080
So I

771
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,080
have some friends of some friends who

772
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,080
have a furniture store

773
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,080
and they constantly

774
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,080
promote their furniture with their two

775
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,080
dogs that are very cute

776
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,080
on Instagram. Yes. OK.

777
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,080
And they always

778
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,080
like zoom in on their

779
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,080
dogs dick. They do

780
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,080
or you do?

781
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,080
So

782
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,080
as you're scrolling it's like five pictures.

783
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,080
Oh cute dogs. Oh it's closer.

784
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,080
Cute furniture. Oh there's a

785
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,080
dog's dick and they highlight it

786
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,080
by using the lipstick emoji.

787
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,080
No.

788
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,080
No.

789
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,080
So it's not on accident.

790
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,080
It's not. It's very

791
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,080
on purpose. Well maybe they're

792
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,080
showing that their couches are

793
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,080
lipstick proof.

794
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,080
No it's probably

795
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
the dick.

796
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,080
Why? Well why? Did you ever

797
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,080
ask? Hey Sarah why? Sarah why though?

798
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,080
Well no. No.

799
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,080
I don't know. I need to

800
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,080
communicate to them that this is

801
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,080
horrifying and haunts my dreams. Yeah

802
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,080
haunts the dreams but what's the name of

803
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,080
the store? No. No. No.

804
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
No.

805
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,080
They would hate it if they got any advertising

806
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
for their thing that didn't involve

807
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,080
a dog penis

808
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
in it. They use a lipstick

809
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,080
emoji so they might like it. It's

810
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,080
Fresh Kills there in Brooklyn. Okay.

811
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,080
Okay. So.

812
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,080
We'll edit that out.

813
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,080
Here's the thing I'll say. It's working.

814
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Yeah you're talking about it on our

815
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,080
podcast right now. You can't stop thinking

816
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,080
about these dog dicks on the

817
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,080
Shays Lounge. Here's the thing

818
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,080
Sarah. What you are in right now is a circumstance.

819
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,080
You can't say to them like

820
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,080
hey your dog's

821
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,080
penis is present in there. Because they're

822
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,080
going to say yeah.

823
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,080
There's nothing wrong with it

824
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,080
I guess. But it's the

825
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,080
it's the

826
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,080
We don't. We're

827
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,080
not here to mutt shame.

828
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,080
Yeah. Jeez.

829
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Come on it's something.

830
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,080
Come on. I'm not safe

831
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,080
anywhere at this table. I'm doing my

832
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,080
best up here. She probably made a very

833
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,080
strong drink.

834
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,080
How do I.

835
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,080
Dog got it.

836
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,080
How do you convince them not to

837
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,080
do it. Here's

838
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,080
the Schrodinger's box of this situation.

839
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,080
If you had gone

840
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,080
to them and talked to them about this

841
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,080
they may have changed it. The fact

842
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,080
that you've come on this podcast now and

843
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
made it observed

844
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,080
and promoted

845
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,080
their brand on our show

846
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,080
means they will never change it.

847
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,080
It's working.

848
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,080
The hard truth of the matter. Let me offer

849
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,080
an option. If you

850
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,080
If you

851
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,080
tried to like pull them

852
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,080
away from it I think that they will resist

853
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,080
so you have to push them towards them like

854
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,080
I think it's great the way you're using your

855
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,080
dog's boner to promote the furniture

856
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,080
and they'll be like what.

857
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,080
Yeah I think it's great. I think dog boners really

858
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,080
sell chairs and make them

859
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,080
uncomfortable with how into it you are.

860
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,080
If that doesn't work nothing will.

861
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,080
Does that help Sarah.

862
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
Does that help.

863
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,080
Okay fair enough.

864
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,080
Hey what's up. Hi I'm

865
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,080
Manny. Hi Manny. I use she her

866
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,080
pronouns. Hi Manny.

867
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,080
Your question.

868
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
Oh man.

869
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,080
How do I

870
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,080
convince children that I'm not a time

871
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,080
traveler.

872
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,080
Curious.

873
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Curious about this one.

874
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,080
So I work at a living

875
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,080
history museum.

876
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,080
So

877
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,080
so my

878
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,080
job is to dress up like I'm in the

879
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,080
1920s and then people come

880
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,080
to the park and I teach them about

881
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,080
what it was like to live in my hometown in the 1920s.

882
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,080
But

883
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,080
like at least once

884
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,080
a week children will come up

885
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,080
to me and try to explain to me

886
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,080
modern technologies.

887
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Yes. Yes.

888
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,080
So. Yes.

889
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,080
So I'll get kids that

890
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,080
come up to me and are like

891
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,080
do you know what rap music is.

892
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,080
Okay.

893
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,080
But why would you want to stop.

894
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,080
Yeah Manny I have to say if

895
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,080
I could get young people to explain shit

896
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,080
to me I would pay any fucking price.

897
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,080
Yeah rules.

898
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,080
If one of them is like

899
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,080
if one of them is like hey

900
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,080
let me explain Snapchat I'll fucking put on

901
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,080
a handlebar mustache whatever the fuck

902
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,080
I'll put in a monocle if you'll explain

903
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,080
to me how Instagram works.

904
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
It would be funny at first and then be like

905
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,080
this is what a fence is.

906
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
No but yes.

907
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,080
Manny fuck this rule

908
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,080
so bad. Here's the thing

909
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,080
all you have to do is keep going what?

910
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,080
This is a great

911
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,080
do you walk all the way back to electricity

912
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,080
like make it like. How deep does

913
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,080
the LARP go. Do you have to

914
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,080
they'll go back they'll say do you know

915
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,080
they'll hold up their cell phone they'll say

916
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,080
do you know what this is. Okay but do you

917
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,080
have to play along as part of the job.

918
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,080
Yes. Awesome.

919
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,080
I have to

920
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,080
I have to be historically accurate that's

921
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,080
part of my job.

922
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,080
Can we just

923
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,080
if you're uncomfortable with

924
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,080
this please say so I just want to

925
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,080
know what this looks like with my eyes

926
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,080
if I like make believe

927
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,080
I'm a teen.

928
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
Yeah can you like Manny can you like take a second and get into

929
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,080
character.

930
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,080
If you're uncomfortable seriously it is not a big deal.

931
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,080
If you don't want to just say now it's fine.

932
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,080
This

933
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,080
this is an iPad.

934
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,080
No no no no Manny has to agree to

935
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,080
it. Yes. Okay.

936
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,080
Well

937
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,080
let Griffin let Griffin interact.

938
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,080
This is

939
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,080
you ever seen one of these it's called a fortnight.

940
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,080
That's a fidget

941
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,080
spinner. You ever seen one of these before.

942
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,080
I don't know what that is. What

943
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,080
is that. Okay let me

944
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,080
I don't know. I want to hear Griffin. Griffin

945
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,080
open this.

946
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,080
There's a problem. I'm 31. I don't really know.

947
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,080
Travis you pretend

948
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,080
to be a teen and explain it to me so I can

949
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,080
then continue. Oh shit.

950
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,080
I don't know what a fortnight is.

951
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,080
It's two weeks.

952
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,080
Do you play a specific character

953
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,080
from history or are you just kind of an

954
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,080
extra from the 1920s. I'm an extra

955
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,080
from the 90s. Okay. Okay. Can I try

956
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,080
it. Griffin display your computer to me.

957
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,080
Okay. Yeah this is a laptop

958
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,080
that's

959
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,080
sucked so bad.

960
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,080
There is no amount of

961
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,080
editing I can do to that to make it

962
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,080
good for a podcast.

963
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,080
The only thing you can realistically do

964
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,080
is steal it and sell it to

965
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,080
1920s scientists.

966
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,080
Like that's what you would do. Oh fascinating.

967
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,080
Next time they come back everyone

968
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,080
has cell phones.

969
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,080
You changed everything.

970
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,080
You polluted the timeline.

971
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,080
Oh my god.

972
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,080
Can this park

973
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,080
hire time cops

974
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,080
to like bust people

975
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,080
who are upsetting the

976
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,080
flow of history. There are multiple

977
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,080
eras in the park and we're not allowed

978
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,080
to go into other eras in our

979
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,080
future costumes. It's called time warping

980
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,080
and it's against the law in the park.

981
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,080
Yes.

982
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,080
This is the greatest day of my life.

983
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,080
Is there a sign present

984
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
in the break room that says no

985
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,080
time warping on it.

986
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,080
No but they drill it into you during

987
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,080
training. Fuck that's awesome. When you watch

988
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,080
Rocky Horror Picture Show are you just like no

989
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,080
no no.

990
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,080
I don't see any of you idiots jump to the left

991
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,080
or step to the right. You're done.

992
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,080
Do you watch Westworld like yeah

993
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,080
that's right. That's exactly

994
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,080
it. Next time the kid shows you and talks about

995
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,080
a different era have them take you there.

996
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,080
Oh shit.

997
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,080
Ziggy Piggy.

998
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,080
Nuked food.

999
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,080
That's the only two things I can remember from

1000
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,080
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

1001
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,080
Party on dudes.

1002
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Yeah they said that. So great.

1003
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,080
Does that.

1004
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,080
I'm just so fucking jealous of your cool

1005
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,080
job in life.

1006
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,080
What's the park called. Can we get there

1007
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,080
in like a day. It's in Canada.

1008
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,080
So no.

1009
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,080
We're not allowed back there

1010
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,080
anymore.

1011
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,080
Yeah we did our best. Anyway

1012
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,080
thanks Manny. Hope that helps. Thank you. Thanks so much.

1013
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,080
I don't know if we helped at all.

1014
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,080
So there are two people

1015
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,080
we've called who have decided. No no no.

1016
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,080
Okay. Hey hey. Hey hello hello hello.

1017
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,080
Hi what's what's your

1018
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,080
I almost said which one are you.

1019
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,080
What's your name.

1020
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,080
Hi Liz. Okay Liz do you

1021
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,080
want to call the next person so they can start moving.

1022
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,080
Not you Liz.

1023
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,080
Oh I was confused by the construction

1024
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,080
of that sentence. Liz pick a person at random.

1025
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Caesar row

1026
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,080
FF seat eight.

1027
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,080
Yeah seat eight.

1028
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,080
So come on down there

1029
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,080
and we're going to talk to Liz for a second.

1030
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,080
Liz

1031
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,080
asked. Oh it's another

1032
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
one of these.

1033
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,080
I work in a time travel park.

1034
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,080
No.

1035
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,080
No the other one.

1036
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,080
My friend's dick will

1037
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,080
be on TV. Should I look.

1038
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,080
It's tough. Go on.

1039
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,080
It's tough go on.

1040
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,080
Yeah he doesn't know that I

1041
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,080
know that it's going to be on TV.

1042
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Does he know that it's going to be on TV.

1043
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,080
Yes.

1044
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,080
Was he the Teen Wolf guy

1045
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,080
and it was an accident this whole time.

1046
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,080
You all know the Teen Wolf has a dick in it.

1047
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,080
Guess not. End of joke.

1048
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,080
So explain everything.

1049
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,080
He's an actor.

1050
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,080
Cool. And I want to support

1051
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,080
him and he was cast in a

1052
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,080
premium cable show.

1053
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,080
Oh yeah.

1054
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,080
I assume by the way there

1055
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,080
aren't many other TV

1056
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,080
dick opportunities except on.

1057
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,080
This is the weirdest

1058
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,080
episode of CSI New York I've ever

1059
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,080
seen. He was cast in an ABC

1060
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,080
family show.

1061
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,080
But he hasn't told

1062
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
anybody except for my friend who told me

1063
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,080
when she was drunk that he was going to

1064
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,080
do full frontal

1065
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,080
and he's just been working out

1066
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,080
and being like I'm preparing for a role.

1067
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,080
Working out

1068
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,080
what exactly.

1069
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,080
Well I want to

1070
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,080
support him but I

1071
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,080
but do I?

1072
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,080
No you want to

1073
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,080
I don't think there's any question about

1074
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,080
looking because you should

1075
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,080
enjoy you should enjoy the work

1076
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,080
and not stigmatize the

1077
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,080
work. But there's more

1078
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,080
questions that come after that

1079
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,080
answer.

1080
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,080
I feel like a lot of

1081
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,080
college students have probably pondered

1082
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,080
this when their friend was in a production of

1083
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,080
Hair.

1084
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,080
I feel like Equus

1085
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,080
or

1086
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,080
but of course if the question is

1087
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,080
should I look at Daniel Radcliffe's dick the answer

1088
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,080
is yeah. That's Harry Potter

1089
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,080
my friend.

1090
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,080
You ain't gonna see that again.

1091
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,080
I actually think

1092
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,080
not to take a question

1093
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,080
and make it too real but I actually think

1094
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,080
that you watching and saying like hey you did a great job

1095
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,080
and not making it a big deal.

1096
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,080
Oh yeah don't say anything about his penis

1097
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
you do that already.

1098
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,080
This is a comedy podcast you didn't

1099
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,080
Travis maybe thinks you thought

1100
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,080
that we needed to tell you to

1101
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,080
not say no.

1102
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,080
Very good acting and a nice hug.

1103
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,080
That's not

1104
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,080
expected or appreciated.

1105
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,080
You coming out of it in any

1106
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,080
kind of like awkward way where it's

1107
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
like well what do I say just saying like oh

1108
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
it was great it was a great job like

1109
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,080
normalizing that

1110
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,080
I think will go a long way for your friend who was

1111
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,080
probably a little bit nervous about doing it.

1112
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,080
Absolutely.

1113
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,080
I think being supportive is good

1114
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,080
absolutely do

1115
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,080
it and maybe we get more

1116
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,080
hogs on TV.

1117
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,080
We do need more thank you Griffin

1118
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,080
yes.

1119
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,080
We're going to need a lot of hogs to

1120
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,080
correct that imbalance over the years but I think

1121
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,080
we can do it.

1122
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,080
More hogs by the end of 2019.

1123
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,080
This is why we got to make season 2 of My Brother

1124
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,080
My Brother Invade.

1125
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,080
But yeah I

1126
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,080
think watch it your friends going to be on

1127
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,080
TV it's not like it's a secret thing.

1128
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,080
Watch it and tell them

1129
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,080
they did a great job. So Westworld or Game of Thrones?

1130
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,080
You don't have to say.

1131
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,080
I was going to say Chuck

1132
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,080
that's not a show anymore is it?

1133
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,080
Chuck?

1134
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,080
It popped into my head

1135
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,080
because of that one

1136
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,080
weird scene. Is it Sabrina the Teenage Witch

1137
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,080
or West Wing?

1138
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,080
Does

1139
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,080
that help? Yeah

1140
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,080
I'm going to look at it.

1141
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
That was very

1142
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,080
good. Cesar are you down here?

1143
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,080
I think we're good we got two more people

1144
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
Hey what's up?

1145
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,080
Hi. What's your name? Carly.

1146
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,080
Carly yes I may have forgotten that we called

1147
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,080
two people down and I got very scared but what's up?

1148
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,080
It's okay.

1149
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,080
Your question?

1150
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,080
It's a precautionary tale.

1151
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,080
Not handing your sister

1152
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,080
your phone and saying send whatever.

1153
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,080
Oh no.

1154
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,080
Do you still want to go through with it because if the answer is no.

1155
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,080
It's okay.

1156
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,080
She's

1157
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,080
furious so it's hilarious.

1158
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,080
Guys

1159
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,080
you are about to get the fucking

1160
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,080
Rosetta Stone to understand

1161
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,080
everything that we've been talking about

1162
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,080
for the past minute. Carly's question

1163
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,080
what's your sister's name?

1164
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,080
Kayla. Kayla? Yep.

1165
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
Kayla's question for Carly

1166
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,080
was

1167
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,080
I've never listened to your guys

1168
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,080
show before so I don't understand

1169
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,080
a lot of your references. Can you guys

1170
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,080
summarize your show for me?

1171
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,080
The sad thing Carly is there haven't

1172
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,080
been that many in jokes

1173
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,080
in this one. They've all

1174
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,080
just kind of been regular jokes

1175
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,080
you didn't like.

1176
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,080
And that's

1177
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,080
fine. That's totally

1178
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
fine.

1179
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,080
I do appreciate that you heard jokes that you

1180
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,080
didn't get and thought surely

1181
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,080
there's something more to this.

1182
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,080
No it's

1183
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,080
been good. Thank you.

1184
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,080
That's so cool. Thank you Carly.

1185
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,080
That means a lot. Do you like horses?

1186
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,080
Do I like horses?

1187
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,080
This is

1188
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,080
dope. Like we never get

1189
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,080
we never focus test.

1190
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,080
This is dope. You like horses?

1191
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,080
Now do you think it would be funny if

1192
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,080
three people were super into

1193
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,080
them?

1194
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,080
It was deeply ironic

1195
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,080
and everybody kind of knew it.

1196
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,080
Still know it looks like.

1197
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,080
How do you feel about ghosts?

1198
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,080
Ghosts are great.

1199
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,080
Yeah.

1200
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,080
Not anymore unfortunately.

1201
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,080
Is this

1202
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,080
whole thing a facade? This is a real breakfast

1203
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,080
at Tiffany's situation right now Carly.

1204
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,080
I like Dungeons and Dragons.

1205
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Hey.

1206
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,080
Are you coming tomorrow?

1207
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,080
I am coming tomorrow.

1208
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,080
Okay. Because Kayla had

1209
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,080
tickets for both and I said sure.

1210
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,080
Carly you could have stopped there.

1211
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,080
So we're brothers.

1212
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,080
Yeah. That's cool.

1213
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,080
We do.

1214
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,080
That's not real. That's not real. We used to tell people

1215
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,080
it was a comedy advice show and

1216
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,080
then we had someone who was opening for us

1217
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,080
say that they were disappointed that we didn't

1218
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,080
give more advice about how to do comedy

1219
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,080
better.

1220
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,080
So we don't say comedy advice show anymore.

1221
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,080
Then we start saying it's a bad advice

1222
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,080
show and that's

1223
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,080
I mean that just sounds bad.

1224
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,080
That sounds I mean it sounds like Dr.

1225
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,080
Oz but.

1226
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,080
Are we forgetting anything?

1227
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,080
And West Virginia right?

1228
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,080
Yeah. West by God Virginia.

1229
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,080
Carly does that help?

1230
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,080
It does and congratulations

1231
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,080
on Fallout 76.

1232
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,080
Thank you very much.

1233
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,080
We asked Todd

1234
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,080
very nicely.

1235
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,080
I appreciate

1236
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
everybody in the line to ask

1237
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,080
a question is giving the person in front of them a good

1238
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,080
45 feet.

1239
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,080
Do you want.

1240
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,080
Yes. I think this is this

1241
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,080
will probably be our last question. Caesar hello.

1242
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,080
Hi. Your fucking

1243
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,080
question. My dog.

1244
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,080
What should

1245
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,080
my wife's first cuss words

1246
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,080
be.

1247
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,080
Yes.

1248
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,080
We're waiting.

1249
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,080
So

1250
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,080
we just got married last week.

1251
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,080
Congratulations.

1252
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,080
Your wife

1253
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,080
is your wife here.

1254
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,080
Is your wife here. Yes she's up there.

1255
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,080
Hello.

1256
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,080
Everybody in the balcony at the same time.

1257
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,080
And now of course as tradition states

1258
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,080
once you are married you're finally allowed to curse.

1259
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,080
And she has never cursed before. Yes you are.

1260
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
Can you come down also.

1261
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,080
I know it's an imposition.

1262
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,080
It's going to be weird if we don't talk to you too.

1263
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,080
If you don't want to it's fine.

1264
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,080
It's completely fine. It's your choice.

1265
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,080
We'll talk to Caesar for a second let you think about it.

1266
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,080
What if you just

1267
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,080
from your seat yelled out a cuss word right now

1268
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,080
and completely negated.

1269
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,080
That'll be the end of it but we have

1270
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,080
some time to get there.

1271
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,080
How does something like that

1272
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,080
even fucking happen Caesar.

1273
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,080
So as she

1274
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,080
told me. Wait hold on.

1275
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080
Are you talking about this. Yeah.

1276
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,080
No she's good.

1277
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,080
Can I get a thumbs up confirmation

1278
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,080
from. Yeah we're good.

1279
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,080
Doesn't want to talk about it herself

1280
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,080
for sure. All right.

1281
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,080
So. So.

1282
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,080
Just didn't know any. Bible school.

1283
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,080
Oh.

1284
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,080
Told her

1285
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,080
Bible school teacher told her had a friend

1286
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,080
that she said that they once cursed

1287
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,080
and that when they sat down on the toilet

1288
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,080
a rat bit them. Yeah.

1289
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,080
No no no don't get it no don't get it twisted.

1290
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,080
That's why they're called curse words.

1291
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,080
And.

1292
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,080
She just never did it and then it was kind of

1293
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,080
just stuck. Holy

1294
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,080
shit. That's

1295
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,080
we're going to curse a lot I feel like during this one but

1296
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,080
not out of like a joke like

1297
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,080
we can curse but because

1298
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,080
everything that has been said so far

1299
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,080
is the most buck wild.

1300
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,080
I know what I said earlier I don't want you to yell

1301
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
it out here for the show because that's selfish of

1302
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,080
us. I do like if everyone closed

1303
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,080
their eyes maybe we turn the lights down

1304
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,080
and just from the darkness we just heard

1305
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,080
Piss. Yeah we did a little

1306
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,080
little piss in the graveyard

1307
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,080
game real quick.

1308
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,080
Does your wife

1309
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,080
use other. Sorry her name

1310
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,080
Lizzie.

1311
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,080
Still Lizzie use

1312
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,080
other. I'm sorry Paul made this

1313
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,080
drink so strong. I'm just

1314
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,080
fucking barely hanging on.

1315
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,080
Does Lizzie use

1316
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,080
substitute curse words like

1317
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,080
during it like Laura during

1318
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,080
it.

1319
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,080
Not really. No Lizzie

1320
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,080
is trying to hammer a nail into the wall. She

1321
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,080
fucks up hits her thumb. What

1322
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,080
sound does she produce.

1323
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,080
She kind of just I think would yell

1324
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,080
and collapse.

1325
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,080
Jesus how are you shot. So she's never

1326
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,080
cursed and she's got glass thumb.

1327
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,080
Great.

1328
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,080
And she would just like I said

1329
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,080
just yell.

1330
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,080
Does Lizzie want

1331
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,080
a curse. I think

1332
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,080
so. Yeah not here. He doesn't

1333
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,080
have to be here.

1334
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,080
OK.

1335
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,080
OK OK. We have

1336
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,080
a few minutes. We have to wait

1337
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,080
this Travis says piss. I think

1338
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,080
bastard could be good.

1339
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,080
What

1340
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
about this all

1341
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,080
beans.

1342
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,080
I think I don't think this is

1343
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,080
up to us to decide. Lizzie it's your first

1344
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,080
cuss. Can we turn it. Would you like the lights

1345
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,080
down with that. Let's get

1346
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,080
yeah. We turn out

1347
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,080
literally. We take the house lights out

1348
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,080
so I want. I told Caesar

1349
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,080
this would be a wedding present for him.

1350
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,080
My first curse word.

1351
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
OK Lizzie so what I'm going to ask you

1352
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,080
for is five seconds of

1353
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,080
silence. I want

1354
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
all to be completely silent

1355
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,080
and then we'll hear a curse word from

1356
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
somebody. No. And it'll be

1357
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,080
Lizzie. I mean it's going to be safe from somebody

1358
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,080
and somebody else from the audience is going to yell it.

1359
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,080
Nobody else. You will be ejected from

1360
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,080
the theater. This is the most important thing to ever happen on this podcast.

1361
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,080
We all get to

1362
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,080
experience it together.

1363
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,080
So Lizzie I'll ask you for a few seconds of

1364
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,080
silence and then just drop it on us.

1365
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,080
Go ahead.

1366
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:22,080
Piss.

1367
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,080
Thank you.

1368
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,080
Thank you to our daddy.

1369
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,080
Thank you to you. Thank you

1370
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,080

1371
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,080
Wait. The final yahoo.
