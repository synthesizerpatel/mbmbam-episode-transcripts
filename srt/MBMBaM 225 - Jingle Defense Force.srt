1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,480
Hello everybody, and welcome. My brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm your baby-est brother, Griffin fucking McElroy.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,400
Alert, alert. We are the Jingle All The Way defense team, and we are here to warn you

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,920
that you or someone you love may at some point be exposed to Jingle All The Way 2.

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,200
You know what, I'm sorry to admit it. I didn't have my defenses up. I had lowered

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,400
the levels of my firewall on my computer, and I just found out that I've already been cast in

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,640
Jingle All The Way 2. Shit. Man, don't make me choose between my brother and my jingle,

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,760
because it's gonna be the jingle for sure. For sure, defo, 100%. Let's just say this,

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,160
looking at the IMDb page of Jingle 2, and I'm making a list, and I'm checking it twice.

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,760
Wait, Griffin, are you worried that they'll disrupt the canon of Jingle All The Way 1,

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,920
that they'll ruin the integrity, or is it like you just hate Jingle All The Way 1

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,120
so much you don't wanna see a sequel? Are you on fucking crystal meth?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,280
Jingle 1 is a fantastic film. It's my favorite Sinbad movie. And now these motherfuckers. I'm

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,080
actually a little hoarse. I'm a little gravely right now, because I literally watched the 30

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,440
second long trailer of Jingle 2, which shows Larry, the goddamn cable guy, which he hasn't

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,040
done cable for a long time, so maybe it's time to revisit that nom de plume. Larry,

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,400
the emeritus cable guy. The whole thing is the 30 second bit about how he plugs in crystal

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
lights and it shocks him and it shoots him backwards. Real great stuff. I'm gravely,

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
because I literally yelled, you motherfuckers, like that, and now I'm hoarse from it. So thanks

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,960
for that. I've got choir practice here in 30 minutes. That's shot. Just wanna take a quick

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:52,160
check on the description of this film. There's many good things about this, including the fact

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,240
that it co-stars WWE superstar Santino Marella, but in the description of the trailer, Larry,

28
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,840
the cable guy, is playing the role of Larry. Which I pointed out to Justin, he does in all

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,000
of his fucking movies. It's never Larry, the cable guy, as Dr. Kenneth Hardstone.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,400
It's listed here in his credits, Larry, played by Larry, the cable guy, from Cars 1 and Cars 2.

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,400
So you might see just from Cars and think, ah no, screw that guy. No, that's how deep they're

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,240
willing to go into his back catalog that they are not even going to put their finger on, oh,

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,840
I don't know, maybe Tooth Fairy 2? Another fucking disaster? Why not put him down as like,

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,800
one of the blue collar comedy tour, like the thing that he is most known for?

35
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,120
Red state hee haw boys. This motherfucker is trying to carve out a fucking earnest

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,920
sized niche for himself with his goddamn Larry versus the aliens and secret service Larry.

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,520
Griffin, when you said that Larry, the cable guy, is basically playing Larry,

38
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,160
the cable guy in every movie. Did you think I was fucking joking?

39
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,560
No, I mean, I know he is, but like, did you know that he's literally playing a character named Larry?

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
Yes.

41
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,360
2007, Delta Farce, Larry.

42
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,000
Yep.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
Witless Protection, Deputy Larry's-

44
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh my god, Tooth Fairy 2, Larry Guthrie. Doug, it's his fucking brand. It's his brand, but you know what, it's also-

45
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,360
He helps Tyler Perry for making him change it for a Madea Christmas. It might just be on the set,

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,400
someone's like, he's playing a character called Buddy in Larry, the Cable Guy. I have to imagine

47
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,120
on the set, someone's like, okay, now, Madea, now you're going to lean into Buddy. Wait a minute,

48
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
my name's Larry. Yeah, yeah, no.

49
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,320
Yeah, you are.

50
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,280
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm Larry. No, but you're playing the role of Buddy. My name's Larry.

51
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
This was such a mistake.

52
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,080
Is it the same character in all of your movies?

53
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Oh my god, he is-

54
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,480
Is it like an earnest level universe in which it's the Larry verse and he just exists as-

55
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:26,400
It's the Larry verse and he is the observer. He crosses all planes, but he cannot interact with

56
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
the human beings therein, and that's why he doesn't-

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,040
The fabric of time is nothing to Larry. He can move seamlessly between every different plane

58
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
of existence.

59
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,840
Larry the Cable Guy is basically just a coalsaw-suckin' black adder. That's Larry the

60
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
Cable Guy for you.

61
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,800
He is the beginning and the ending. Everything is Larry, and Larry is all things.

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,640
And now he's using his infinite power to fucking ruin Jingle 1.

63
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,920
He is the alpha and the omega-ter-don.

64
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,040
Oh, Jesus. I'm starting a Twitter campaign. I'm starting a Kickstarter campaign, a Patreon,

65
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,760
just fucking everything, trying to get Simbat on board, and he hasn't answered me at the time of

66
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,840
this recording, so I'm not going to call him a fucking coward, because maybe you will before

67
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,240
this thing gets published, but Simbat, you know what you need to do, and you have my information.

68
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,000
I reached out to Schwarzenegger, too, but I don't think he needs this as bad as Simbat,

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
and I do, which is to say very badly.

70
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
So we're going to continue to try to reach Simbat throughout the program, right?

71
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
Yeah, oh God, yeah. Listen, I fucking lost the Battle for a Christmas Story, too.

72
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,320
We all lost the Battle for a Christmas Story, too.

73
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,280
We all lost that one.

74
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120
This is it. This is the final fucking line in the sand.

75
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
This is our Normandy beach.

76
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,200
This is it. If we can't do this, then what the fuck are we doing here?

77
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,720
We're answering people's questions and turning them alchemy-like into wisdom.

78
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
That's what we're doing. That's what we came to do.

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,280
What's the right place to keep your ketchup? The pantry or the refrigerator?

80
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,200
America's not the best country on earth anymore.

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:10,480
The fucking fabric of our nation is eroding.

82
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,040
Larry the Cable Guy fucking erasing Christmas off the calendar,

83
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,480
and this fucking person even considering putting it in the pantry.

84
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,280
Okay, wait, hold on.

85
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,320
I just want to, for those of you not well versed in jingle all the way, too,

86
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:30,400
it is jingle all the way, except they've swapped out Arnold Schwarzenegger and Simbat

87
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
for two other people trying to find a gift.

88
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
It's all sold out.

89
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
Yeah, he wants to find it.

90
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,400
He's on an adventure to find it.

91
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
You're not calming me down.

92
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,520
I need two dads in a no holds barred battle to be the best father

93
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
and make this the best Christmas ever.

94
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,040
Justin, I need you to make some ocean sounds for me or something.

95
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,200
That's nice.

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
Do you want me to talk to you in the ASMR?

97
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,320
Yeah, no, nobody wants that ever again, actually, after last week.

98
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,720
Finish the question, please. I'm dying.

99
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,200
What are your mom and I wearing hockey pants?

100
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
That is pretty much that.

101
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,640
I mean, like you get it, Jess, but like his wife says helps to stay fresh longer.

102
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,680
In the fridge.

103
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,480
In the fridge, but he wants in the pantry because,

104
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,400
wow, I don't want cold ketchup on my hot food.

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,360
It's called contrast.

106
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,680
Look up.

107
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,160
You fucking eat in bulk.

108
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,880
It's wonderful.

109
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
It's the best.

110
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
Ketchup isn't cold at restaurants.

111
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,880
Why would I keep it cold at home?

112
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah, everything at restaurants is fucking gross.

113
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,520
Everything they have there for public, like sharing and consumption.

114
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,560
If you see butter, open butter on a tray or a dish and you think like,

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
ooh, they have exposed butter on a dish, that must mean this is a fancy restaurant.

116
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,600
No, that means that's dirty butter.

117
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,440
That means that's dirty two-year-old butter.

118
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,640
Old dusty butter.

119
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,360
Don't use that.

120
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,480
You can use salt, I guess.

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,720
I'm dusty butter.

122
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,560
Thanks for coming to my roundup.

123
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
Sing a few songs, maybe have a few good old gospel tunes

124
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,520
and you're going to meet my whole family.

125
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,320
Here's my little brother, Dusty Butters, and he's on the bench.

126
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,440
Take it away, Dusty.

127
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,840
What's it?

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,240
Dusty?

129
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,880
Just remember, here at Dusty Butters, the butter's been on the tables since 1958.

130
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
Actually, my grandpa did it.

131
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,520
Other than a few unpleasant races and outbursts, he's still my hero.

132
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,680
And you can throw the butter right on the floor.

133
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Throw the butter on the floor, Dusty Butters.

134
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,680
Don't let grandma slip.

135
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,120
You'll want to stick around for the peanut butter roundup.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,800
That's a dessert.

137
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
That also is served on the floor.

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,360
Here's the thing.

139
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,920
The restaurant's going to go through a bottle of ketchup a lot faster than you will.

140
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,840
Especially if I roll around, because I'll turn that shit into dunkables.

141
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,600
Yeah, I would love to see a scientific survey on the extent to which people

142
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,240
will demolish a restaurant ketchup bottle, like just completely bathing their dish in

143
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,560
ketchup versus at home when you're like, I don't know, I don't need that much.

144
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,680
Right.

145
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
I buy one of those giant Heinzers from the Costco, and I use it at a pace that is so

146
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,080
slow that I could collect enough of that ketchup skin from the top of the bottle to form a child.

147
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,960
I take this conundrum one step farther.

148
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,560
And you know, those things that say how basically like every jar of everything says refrigerate

149
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,320
after opening, I do not understand why you wouldn't just refrigerate it to begin with

150
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,280
so that the first time you use it, it is also cold.

151
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
Like if you don't refrigerate it till the first time you use it, it means the first

152
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
time you use it, it's bad.

153
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,120
So I'm weird about this.

154
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:37,680
I will keep ketchup and mustard in the fridge, but like hot sauce, like a Buffalo sauce or

155
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,840
a like a hot sauce I'll keep in the pantry except for sriracha, which I keep in the refrigerator.

156
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm just making it up.

157
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
We're all playing Calvin ball with our fucking dippers, aren't we?

158
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,720
No, I can justify that, Justin.

159
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
Do you want to hear my theory on why you do that?

160
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,280
Go.

161
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,680
The mustard and the ketchup and the sriracha, they're all for dipping and topping.

162
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,920
The hot sauce is for mixing into sauce that you put onto food and therefore bake it so

163
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,040
it doesn't matter if it's cold.

164
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,480
That's not true.

165
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,680
I use Buffalo sauce for-

166
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,480
Well then fuck.

167
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
I don't know what you want me to do here, Justin.

168
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
I'm trying to justify your weird behavior.

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,840
Just put everything in the fridge.

170
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Just you spend a lot of money on that refrigerator.

171
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,680
People spend a lot of time inventing it and it was designed to keep shit fresh.

172
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,560
You know, Teresa and I in moving to L.A., we took like a refrigerator size downgrade

173
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,680
and now we have to like it's a very like Sophie's Choice, like what goes in the fridge.

174
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,840
It's not at all like Sophie's Choice.

175
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,440
Well, I did just lose a full jar of pickles the other day because it got pushed off the

176
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,120
top shelf by some leftovers.

177
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
It made me real sad and it took 45 minutes to clean.

178
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,840
But that made quite a mess.

179
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,640
We were in quite a mess.

180
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,360
Quite a pickle.

181
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,040
Stop it.

182
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
Are you also are you also writing jingle all the way too?

183
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,200
I am.

184
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
They gave me a good dill.

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,280
Son of a bitch.

186
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,800
You guys want a yahoo?

187
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,000
Hold on.

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,360
Wait, that joke wasn't kosher.

189
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,480
Now do you guys want yahoo?

190
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,800
Yeah, sure.

191
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,280
Yes, please.

192
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,440
Let me relish this for one second.

193
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

194
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
This yahoo was sent in.

195
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,680
This is going to be a Vlasic episode.

196
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,480
I can already tell.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,840
This yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

198
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,880
Thank you, Rachel.

199
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,720
It's by yahoo answers user Devin, who asks, Can you give me step?

200
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,280
Oh, sorry.

201
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,880
Can you gov me step by step instructions on smoking weed?

202
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
I have no clue what to do.

203
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,280
This is in general health care.

204
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm starting to, I'm starting to really get into how people categorize their yahoo barf.

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,920
I mean, here's the thing.

206
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,440
We laugh, but I kind of get where this dude is coming from.

207
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,840
I mean, you got to be a bag of weed right now.

208
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
I would not know what to do.

209
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
I would probably end up making it in edibles because I would not know.

210
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,080
You'd fuck that up too.

211
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,760
That is an intense process, right?

212
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,520
Yeah, because you got like boil it in olive oil and you got to extract it and you got

213
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,920
to perform the sacred ritual.

214
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,400
Wait, quick note for my nanny.

215
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,200
I bet or so I'm told by the TV.

216
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,400
It just seems to me like in this day and age, like I've never been, I, I, I just as I would

217
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,080
not know how to raise chickens, I just know how to eat them.

218
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,560
Sure.

219
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
That is very much how I feel about marijuana.

220
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,520
You bet.

221
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,400
But like, I think it has, I think I've heard people say that you're only supposed to have

222
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:36,160
the buds in air and not have the nugs buds or, well, then you take the nug and you turn

223
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,200
it into a bud and by, by pruning it.

224
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,240
So not all nugs are buds, but all buds are nugs.

225
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,120
I, I, from what I understand, I bet it's like a broccoli, but you're not supposed to eat

226
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,360
the tree trunk part.

227
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,520
Um, only the leafy, uh, NugBuds, NugBuds.

228
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,640
Well, it's all clear now.

229
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
And then you first grind your nugs.

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,120
You're going to need a food processor with a very fine settings and you got to do like,

231
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,200
I don't know, man, like two cups at a time.

232
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,960
And what most people don't know you is there's not a very good like ratio to this.

233
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,480
So you start with like a pound and you end up with like half an ounce.

234
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
Yeah.

235
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,880
There's a lot of like leftovers.

236
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
Yeah, there's a lot of like leftovers you throw.

237
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,960
It's like cotton candy basically.

238
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,460
Yeah.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
Justin, you have that cotton candy machine.

240
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,080
Would you think about, I don't know, that form of distillation?

241
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
Uh, I'd give it a try.

242
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,800
I'd have to add some sugar just to get a pleasant mouthfeel.

243
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
I think.

244
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,880
I don't think that weed would necessarily make great cotton candy by itself.

245
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
Well, not unless you got that, um, that sweet grass.

246
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,640
The last time I smoked weed.

247
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,640
You bet.

248
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,920
I watched riding the bus with my sister.

249
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,520
Oh Justin, no.

250
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,280
The movie, if you ever watched is wildly, wildly offensive.

251
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,680
Um, I thought with the help of my friend weed, I thought that it was fucking touching.

252
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
So I don't know if I could smoke weed again,

253
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,440
because how do you top riding the bus with my sister?

254
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
If someone told me that like the best potency you get from weed is to like,

255
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,000
put it straight up your nose without any processing.

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,040
I'd probably buy it.

257
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,840
Especially if this were like nine, if I was like 21 and they were like,

258
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,560
Oh no, no, no.

259
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,760
You just, you sit on it and that's how you, then you'll get high.

260
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,920
I'll be like, Oh, okay.

261
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,560
Yeah.

262
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,240
Are you guys secretly hoping that marijuana does not become legal on a,

263
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,120
on a national level?

264
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,560
Because then you'll be like, Oh yeah, guys, did you, uh, did you hear the great news?

265
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,520
I can't wait to get all of those, uh, nugs and then tear them up and then put them in

266
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,880
paper and smoke them like a cigarette.

267
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm, I mostly don't want it to become legal because it's the one thing I'll have to tell

268
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,360
my kids about that might make me seem cool a little bit.

269
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,600
Yeah.

270
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,800
Yeah.

271
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,280
It's like the only taboo thing I've ever done.

272
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
That's like, well, you know, I was like, fuck it.

273
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,080
And I did it.

274
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,520
And like in 20 years, my kids would be like, yeah, I'm doing it right now.

275
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,680
Yeah.

276
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm doing it.

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
Hey, open your eyes, old man.

278
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,680
I just got home from school and I'm going to four 20 blaze it.

279
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,840
So graham crackers and orange juice and some nugs for snack time.

280
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,480
I don't get it.

281
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,280
What's the big deal?

282
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,480
I don't understand.

283
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,360
My guidance counselor said it might help show me out.

284
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
And he gave me some cool records.

285
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,360
There's another question.

286
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,640
How do you politely ask someone to stop using your Netflix account?

287
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,920
When I first signed up, I let my friend who was very vocal about her financial difficulties

288
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,640
user for free.

289
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:49,840
I had no problem with it since we were in college and she ended up becoming my roommate

290
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,800
slash best friend.

291
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,840
Four years later, we both have full time jobs.

292
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,440
Yet she still uses my account and even jokes about how she's mooching off me.

293
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,880
I know it's a really small amount of money, but it still bothers me.

294
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,760
She has no plans to get her account.

295
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,040
Now that we're both adults, am I just being selfish and stingy?

296
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,120
That's from the Scrooge McDuck of Netflix streaming.

297
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,560
I mean, on the one hand, it's not like she's using it up.

298
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,960
Yeah, I mean, does Netflix have that thing where only one person can be using it on one

299
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,000
platform at a time or?

300
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,440
I don't think so.

301
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,720
I don't think so.

302
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,320
I have.

303
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,720
Okay, I share my Netflix account with Sydney's family.

304
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,160
I do get a lot of like, did you want to watch some more Glee?

305
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,040
No, thank you.

306
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,280
Here's some recommendations for things that are likely.

307
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,840
I'm fine.

308
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,160
Thanks.

309
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,800
But in this day and age, you can create different profiles like Teresa and I have separate profiles

310
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,880
that we don't get that we are crossover.

311
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,640
That's a new development like watching weird British horror movies and also animated children's

312
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,520
features.

313
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,800
I'm worried about you.

314
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,320
I've already been contaminated, though.

315
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
It already has that in its files for me.

316
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,200
You could watch all five seasons of The Wire and it would still be like, I listen.

317
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,160
Are you ever going to get back on that singing high schooler tip?

318
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,440
Could you?

319
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,400
Hi, I have it.

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:21,040
You need to harness the power of your Netflix by watching the most reprehensible content

321
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,800
you possibly can until your friend no longer wants to be associated with you.

322
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,880
I noticed that you watched all five seasons of my strange eating addiction.

323
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,920
Maybe this isn't working out.

324
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
Maybe we can't share this anymore.

325
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,920
Oh, my shit.

326
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,160
I just figured out how we use this to get famous.

327
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,520
More like more like the snuff films you've been watching, looking for something goofy

328
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,240
and where somebody gets murdered for real in real life.

329
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,200
And they filmed it.

330
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
You might like this.

331
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,240
We need to make a movie titled How to Tell Your Roommate Your Former Roommate Not to

332
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,520
Use Your Netflix Anymore.

333
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
And then how to tell.

334
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,600
Yeah, just looking at it going, hey, stop it.

335
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
And you only watch that repeatedly for a year.

336
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,720
So that's the only thing showing up on your recently.

337
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,240
How to murder somebody who is watching your Netflix.

338
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
That might be too on the nose.

339
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
The only person I know.

340
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
You quit it.

341
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,640
The only person I know that got something on Netflix is Hodgman got his special Ragnarok

342
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,520
on there.

343
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,440
So if you haven't watched that, go watch that.

344
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
It's great.

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,520
Ask him how he did it.

346
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:35,680
I mean, there is some there is some poopy garbage on that fucking jingle to guaranteed

347
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,560
going to be on the flicks this holiday season.

348
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,920
I do not think it's that hard.

349
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,440
I think we could probably swing this.

350
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,720
Do you guys remember when we used to go into borders and we would go to the computers or

351
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,000
search for things and we would search for like how to blow up a border and then leave?

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,680
That was a simpler time.

353
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,320
Oh, God, that was really impact shenanigans.

354
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,760
That was a whoof.

355
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
That was that was the 90s, folks.

356
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,320
It was the 90s.

357
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,360
It was different.

358
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,880
It was a different time.

359
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,120
It was a different it was very different.

360
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,800
I think it was the main thing I could say.

361
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,040
Why you change your password and say you canceled it?

362
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,560
No, that's pretty good, too.

363
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,000
And then ask if you can use her Netflix that she starts because you are not you don't

364
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
have the finances for it.

365
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,760
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

366
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
This Yahoo was also sent in by Rachel Sperling.

367
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,560
Thank you, Rachel.

368
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

369
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,120
I think that they have been deleted.

370
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,880
They asked me and my boyfriend are both emo.

371
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,240
Does that mean our children will be emo, too?

372
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,040
I didn't know.

373
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,960
I didn't know that particular people group and no judgment still existed.

374
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,720
Still around.

375
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,680
If my grandfather was a quarter goth and my grant and my mean, my Meeps was straight edge.

376
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,120
They have four kids.

377
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
Two of them will definitely be emo.

378
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,840
One of them will be a straight edge goth, and one of them will be president of the United

379
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,640
States.

380
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,560
Guys, we just fucking invented an America's Next Top Model challenge right now.

381
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,920
I mean, maybe I listen genetics.

382
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,400
I listen to this really fascinating episode of Radio Lab on RNA and it makes you know.

383
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,900
Come on.

384
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,740
Hey, who am I?

385
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,260
Everybody.

386
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,560
I do actually listen to Radio Lab to fall asleep on long plane rides.

387
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,320
It's a great show, though.

388
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,160
And anyway, they're talking about RNA and how it just and just makes you feel like you're

389
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,600
and anyway, they're talking about RNA and how it just informs so many different parts

390
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,920
of your life.

391
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,800
And you probably have like a few TCAGs in there that are just like, hey, hey, hey, guess

392
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,200
what?

393
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,720
You like panic at the disco.

394
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,280
So I don't see why you couldn't pass that along to your spawn.

395
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,920
Can you picture 40 year old emo people?

396
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,420
Yes.

397
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,540
Yeah.

398
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,360
What do you think they look like?

399
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,000
Gene Simmons.

400
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,800
Robert Smith, right?

401
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,120
But he's like, yeah, I guess he's legit.

402
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,000
It's pro demo.

403
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,720
Yeah, I what is norm core?

404
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:24,800
That's like it's like people just like it's it's the razzle dazzle of cultural groups

405
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,640
of people that are just wearing some jeans.

406
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
OK, so wait, it's just like normal.

407
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,220
Yeah.

408
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,520
And then they put a label on it.

409
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
Maybe it's a little bit too normal.

410
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,760
And it's like, oh, yeah, I'm eating my oatmeal.

411
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,040
I might put some cinnamon on it because it's Saturday.

412
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,560
It's like we fucking all right.

413
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,600
We get it.

414
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Like John Green, right?

415
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,640
What's that guy up to?

416
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,320
What are you planning, John Green?

417
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,920
And your pleasant shirt and your affable, your affable personality.

418
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,880
What are you up to?

419
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,760
That's the problem.

420
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,320
He's he's actually just a pleasant affable person.

421
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,800
And he's just a little too likable, a little too likable.

422
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,360
The fact that you know his name means he's he's he's been pushed out only because I've

423
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
been keeping my eye on him.

424
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,460
Yeah.

425
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,520
The fact that there was something there's something there to keep an eye on.

426
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,080
Let me let me ask you if you've ever heard of this person, John Horkinson.

427
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,160
No, I don't.

428
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,880
I haven't.

429
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
You say you guys just don't know the fucking scene.

430
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
Here's why I don't trust John Green.

431
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,040
This is a multi-part point, but it's really just the one.

432
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,920
John Green wrote The Fault in Our Stars.

433
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,400
Before he wrote The Fault in Our Stars, he was making videos on YouTube.

434
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,120
After The Fault in Our Stars movie came out, he was still making videos on YouTube.

435
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,760
If I wrote The Fault in Our Stars, I would never be on YouTube again.

436
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,640
You would have to come find me.

437
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,080
Somebody in YouTube headquarters has dirt on John Green.

438
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
Somebody there had I would know what YouTube like on computers.

439
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:04,960
Sorry.

440
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,400
Call me back when you're Steven Spielberg because I wrote The Fault in Our Stars.

441
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,760
Oh, I'm actually rich and famous enough to use the rich and famous Internet that only

442
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,360
rich and famous people are allowed to use.

443
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,080
Yeah.

444
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,560
Yeah.

445
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,680
A true true American dog is still updated on it.

446
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,000
I've been watching new Strong Bad videos for years.

447
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,560
On the deep, the deep, deep John Green webs.

448
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,880
My girlfriend recently got a job as an administrative assistant at a financial firm.

449
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
At the end of the day, we always exchange stories about our day.

450
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,680
The problem is her days and those stories are now really, really boring.

451
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,280
She used to be a teacher and waitress and would have funny bits about students or goofy

452
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,080
customers.

453
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,240
Yesterday, on the other hand, I had to sit there 15 minute epic about some papers that

454
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
she misplaced and had to track down.

455
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,440
I love her very much, but office stories are even more boring than dreams.

456
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,720
How do I tell her?

457
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,000
And that's from Inattentive in Illinois.

458
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,120
I really liked Girlfriend, but I feel like it went downhill and like series three when

459
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,960
Aaron Sorkin left and everybody started working at a financial firm just didn't have the

460
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,520
same pop.

461
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,920
Oh, boy, you've misplaced the you've misplaced one report too many.

462
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,800
Shut it down.

463
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
What happened to this fucking show?

464
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
Here's the here's the facts, dude.

465
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,640
Like, she's not telling you her stories to entertain you like that.

466
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,680
She's telling you her stories to tell you about her dad.

467
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,280
And this is a universe.

468
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,760
Nobody ever tells work stories to entertain anyone unless you're like you have a fucking

469
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,360
super dope life and you're like you're like, I don't know, Steve Buscemi's personal

470
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,920
assistant.

471
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,440
I bet you get lots of delicious dirt pies from that.

472
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,120
And that's the thing.

473
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,320
Like, what's she going to do?

474
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,160
Come home and just be like, hey, how was your day?

475
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,800
You go, I've got nothing like she's going to tell you because this is what she did in

476
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,280
the day.

477
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
And it's your job to go, oh, really?

478
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,080
You found the papers.

479
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,880
Well, that's good.

480
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,040
Like, that's your that's what you're supposed to do.

481
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,360
You're not going to spice it up.

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,880
I I would say that my job is is very boring to tell stories from.

483
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,240
And but I have I generally attempt to spare Sidney.

484
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,720
I mean, yeah, I think I like I don't say like, well, I don't want to tell stories.

485
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:29,280
I don't say like, well, I stared at a collection of LEDs in a box for eight hours and got eight

486
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,000
hours older.

487
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,520
And then I pushed a series of buttons on that that changed things on that screen.

488
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
And I got probably doxxed.

489
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
But other than that, like that's been my day.

490
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,760
Well, there's an important thing here that he didn't say.

491
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
How recently did she get it?

492
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,560
Because if it's like three weeks, then she's going to now she's like six months, seven

493
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,060
months in.

494
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,160
Eventually, she'll go like, is it?

495
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,560
I don't know.

496
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,280
It was another day where, like, I was trying to find papers.

497
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,160
What did you do?

498
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,360
Like, if it's really early on, of course, she's going to talk about it.

499
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,520
She's got a new job and she's excited about it.

500
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,600
You could challenge yourself to try to learn more about The Office.

501
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,120
How many people in The Office can you learn their names and job titles and keep track

502
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,720
of their various storylines?

503
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
Ask for more info.

504
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,120
Get on board.

505
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,760
This could be your new season of The Office.

506
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,840
This could be your new season of The Office.

507
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,200
It's her office.

508
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
Here's another option for you that I just came up with.

509
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
Thank you, Brandy.

510
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,600
The new option-

511
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,480
The singer, Brandy?

512
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,920
Thank you, Brandy.

513
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,720
She's here in my office.

514
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
She just whispered this in my ear.

515
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,040
She said, what if the next time?

516
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,760
What if you stay so busy that you never have time for work stories again?

517
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,720
Maybe she starts on a work story and you're like, hold on.

518
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,200
Hold on, my queen.

519
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
My world, my everything.

520
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,440
Get in the back of this limousine.

521
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
We're going to the museum.

522
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
And you just like make memories.

523
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,840
So many memories together.

524
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,520
Okay, let me challenge you right now.

525
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,280
Every day you have something planned.

526
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,800
Let me challenge you right now to come up with three more memories on the spot.

527
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,120
Go.

528
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,640
You did limo to museum.

529
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:08,960
Go.

530
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,000
Limo to museum.

531
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
Because this guy's going to be feeling more pressure than this.

532
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,440
Go, Justin.

533
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,800
Go, go, go.

534
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,960
Laser tag with kids from the city mission.

535
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,440
Terrific.

536
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,080
Next, two.

537
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,880
Two.

538
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,280
Gift wrapping at the mall, raising money for charity.

539
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
You could talk during that.

540
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
You can't talk during laser tag.

541
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,480
We'll give you that one.

542
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
But over present wrapping, you could-

543
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,040
You also can't talk in the limousine to the museum.

544
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,320
Shh, it's quiet.

545
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,200
Skydiving.

546
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Skydiving?

547
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,320
Okay.

548
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,040
Are you just about to do the fucking lyrics to that goddamn song?

549
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,680
No, I don't know what song you're talking about.

550
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,520
You could go to a Tim McGraw concert.

551
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
You cocksucker.

552
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,320
Be too loud.

553
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
What is your job?

554
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,960
What do you do?

555
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,800
Yeah, what's your fucking gig?

556
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,600
What do you do?

557
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
He's a skydiving museum employee.

558
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,440
I work at the skydive museum.

559
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,400
Oh, Frederick Henderson was the first person that was like,

560
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm going to jump out one in some bitches.

561
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,960
If you look to your right, it's a plane door.

562
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,680
Let's go.

563
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:21,040
If you look to your right, it's a plane door, let's go.

564
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,200
All right, so Justin, this week we have a new sponsor.

565
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,040
Who's that?

566
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Well, it's a little company called Nature Box.

567
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,240
And, you know, we said, well, let's give them a try.

568
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,720
Well, they just put some twigs and some fucking dirt

569
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
and a couple of butterflies on a box and-

570
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,640
No, get this.

571
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,000
It's snacks.

572
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,480
Oh.

573
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,280
It's like natural-

574
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,640
You eat the butterflies?

575
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,920
That are like good for you.

576
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,760
You eat the butterflies?

577
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah, you eat the butterflies instead of chips.

578
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,600
It's a weird new thing that they're doing.

579
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,240
You get a box full of butterflies once a month.

580
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,440
They're offering a free box of them.

581
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,800
Like, not that impressive considering they're butterflies.

582
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,080
You could probably just go grab a-

583
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
Oh, like you want to go to the trouble of catching the butterflies

584
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
and making them into praline butterflies yourself.

585
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,200
And actually, you know something, my friend Justin Mincer

586
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
is getting married next week.

587
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,560
I could buy like four or five boxes of these things

588
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,080
and just like crack them open at the ceremony.

589
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
What a wonderful surprise that would be.

590
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
It's a multi-tasker.

591
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,960
There's no butterflies in these snacks.

592
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,720
They're delicious wholesome snacks,

593
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,880
but they're like actual people food.

594
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,480
They don't have added sugar in most of them,

595
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,600
or not in most of them,

596
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,120
but some of them don't have added sugar

597
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,800
and some of them are without gluten ingredients.

598
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,000
Most of them don't have butterflies.

599
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Nearly all of them.

600
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,680
You have to look really hard to find the butterflies category.

601
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,560
The sampler boxes that you can get for free

602
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
by starting your free trial at naturebox.com slash my brother

603
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,760
all in one word, naturebox.com slash my brother

604
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,480
guaranteed, this is a McElroy brothers guarantee,

605
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,760
won't have butterflies in them.

606
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,520
Just larvae.

607
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,880
Just let me feed you larvae.

608
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,800
If you want to try these out, they've got the actual snacks

609
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,280
like peanut butter nom noms, sweet potato fries.

610
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,600
I'm trying to think, you know what?

611
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,520
It's been a while since I've cracked open

612
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,040
a fresh box of snacks.

613
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,080
I need to re-up my list because I keep eating the same things.

614
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,000
I know fresh toast granola is delicious.

615
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,280
That's one that I very much enjoy.

616
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,720
But anyway, you can get a box of sampler snacks.

617
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,760
Just go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

618
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,680
Stay full, stay strong.

619
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,160
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

620
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,280
and get a free box of delicious snacks.

621
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,960
Travis, tell me about Prosper.

622
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,720
Prosper, well, they sponsored us before,

623
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
so you should already know plenty about them,

624
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,480
but they're a peer-to-peer lending group.

625
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,080
Prosper.com, and basically it's if you need a car loan

626
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,520
or you move across the country

627
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,880
or you've got expensive dental work

628
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,400
or something that you're looking for a loan for,

629
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,920
but you don't want to go through a bank,

630
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,960
Prosper is here to help.

631
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,280
Basically, you go to Prosper, you say,

632
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,160
I need anywhere between $2,500 and $35,000

633
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,800
and you get a low fixed rate

634
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,800
without ever sitting foot in a bank.

635
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,280
And other people, other users of the site say,

636
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,800
I'm going to invest in this person.

637
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,240
This seems like a good deal.

638
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,600
So some of their money goes to them

639
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,200
and then they make money off of it.

640
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
So it cuts off the middleman of the bank

641
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
and it's a convenient way.

642
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,000
It might be a more acceptable way for you.

643
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,120
Maybe you don't like banks.

644
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,040
Well, then Prosper.com is your option.

645
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,120
And right now for a limited time,

646
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,920
listeners of our show get a $50 visa gift card

647
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,640
when you get a loan.

648
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
So that's $50 free on top of your loan

649
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,280
that you never have to pay back.

650
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,040
Spend that on some nature boxes

651
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,920
and then sell the contents of those nature boxes.

652
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,760
And that's infinite money right there.

653
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,520
Yeah, you could get up to $35,000 in your account

654
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,480
in three days and a free $50 visa gift card

655
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,120

Prosper.com slash my brother,

657
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,000
get yourself a loan, get yourself a better life.

658
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,960
Justin, I'm nervous to ask you to read the legal disclaimer

659
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,040
because last time you did a Jimmy Buffett song.

660
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,280
I'm hoping you're maybe Jimmy Buffett songed out

661
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,720
after releasing your chart topping single on YouTube today.

662
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Yeah, I released a chart topping Jimmy Buffett cover.

663
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
I would be lying if I said I didn't deeply enjoy it.

664
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,880
Yeah, it's very good.

665
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,920
It's super good.

666
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,240
Thanks, I'm really glad you like it.

667
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,120
That's at YouTube.com slash M-B-N-B-A-M

668
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,080
if you wanna listen to it.

669
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,400
I've listened to it three times.

670
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,680
Here's the legal disclaimer.

671
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,880
Other restrictions apply.

672
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,520
See, cite for programming visa prepaid card details.

673
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,520
This card is issued by Center State Bank of Florida

674

It's amazing.

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,520
Like you made me feel it with your slam style.

681
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,600
And also I could tell that you understood

682
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,560
everything you were saying.

683
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,920

00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Thanks FDIC.

685
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
Danny Klein, I got a message for you.

686
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,320
We got a Danny Klein around here.

687
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,600
He's a lawyer.

688
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,800
He's got a theme song.

689
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
Danny Klein is the way to go.

690
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
Call 3-4-6-5-9-9-0.

691
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,920
How do you know it's not?

692
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,560
There's some free advertising for you, Danny Klein.

693
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
The Money Zone is brought to you by Huntington area lawyer,

694
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,320
Danny Klein.

695
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,880
So if you kill someone at a live show, you're covered.

696
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Oh, our live shows can be such a hoot nanny.

697
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
Can we say the name of the person who it's from?

698
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
Because I feel like we really buttfucked it.

699
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,240
Stephanie Vigiano.

700
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,040
Stephanie says, it's been a hilarious and wonderful four years

701
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,080
to the guy who has the utmost appreciation of the absurd.

702
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,760
Speaking of, Dan inserts his full name into any song

703
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,720
as he sings it.

704
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Seriously, guys, try it.

705
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,760
Rocket Man by Elton John particularly works.

706
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
Do you mean like, Danny Klein?

707
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,080
And is one of the best and most caring people I know.

708
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,600

00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,560
Here's to many more.

710
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
I miss my dog so much.

711
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm Danny Klein.

712
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,880
It does work.

713
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,600
It's a pretty good name.

714
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,200
I got a message for Lydia Lee, which is a really fun name to say.

715
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,560
It's from your brother, your sister-in-law, and your sister.

716
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,480
And he is Danny Klein.

717
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,720
He shall be a good man.

718
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,040
Here's the message.

719
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,120
Is it just Elton John songs that works?

720
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,320
Any Elton John song.

721
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,560
Goodbye, Danny Klein.

722
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,520
Hold me closer, Danny Klein.

723
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,280
Got a message for Lydia Lee.

724
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
Yeah, we're in it.

725
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,880
We're deep, deep in the Lydia Lee event.

726
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
Welcome to your message, Lydia Lee.

727
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,360
Welcome, Lydia Lee.

728
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,760
Hey, Lydia, have you heard of this Danny Klein fella?

729
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
A lot of buzz about this Danny Klein guy.

730
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
It's the Danny of Klein.

731
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
Lydia Lee, here's a message for you.

732
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
It's from your brother, your sister-in-law, and your sister.

733
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
They say, happy birthday, Lydia Lee.

734
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,440
We got you this message instead of Mueller Thurgauss,

735
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,840
because we don't know what those are.

736
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,320
Clearly, neither the fuck do I.

737
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,160
Grapes, maybe?

738
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,880
Whatever.

739
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,920
Enjoy your day.

740
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,120
Here's to many more years of one-stepping and asymmetrical

741
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,920
haircuts.

742
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,120
You're the best.

743
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,560
Do kind of sound like the best.

744
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,160
I very much enjoyed that Lydia said specifically what she

745
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,880
wanted, and these people said, I'm not going to Google that.

746
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,480
How about an ad on a podcast?

747
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,320
Hope she listens.

748
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,000
Hope she listens to it.

749
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Boy, I just Googled it, and it's a German, and so I can't tell.

750
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,360
But there's a picture of grapes, so I'm going to say grapes.

751
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,240
Yeah, good job.

752
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,720
Yeah.

753
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
You got it in one.

754
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,760
We have one more ad this week.

755
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,840
It's for my friend Bernie's show.

756
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,120
It's called The Kill Corporation.

757
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,080
You can go to www.thekillcorporation.com.

758
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,960
It's super cool.

759
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,360
So do you have a grievance?

760
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,640
Want that corner office?

761
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,880
Wish your neighbor would stop putting garbage in your can?

762
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,480
Contact The Kill Corporation today.

763
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,120
Basically, what it is is the concept of the show is in a

764
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,480
world where you can submit your grievance, then they

765
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,880
arbitrate, and the loser is killed.

766
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,160
Jesus Christ.

767
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,320
So that way, you don't have to ever deal with them again.

768
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,440
You win, and it's done.

769
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,040
On their web page, www.thekillcorporation, they have a bunch of people

770
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,440
submitted testimonials and that kind of thing.

771
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,600
And I submitted one, and it's on there.

772
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,680
And it's about me doing a podcast.

773
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,360
And go check it out.

774
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,320
Did you win?

775
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,840
Clearly, you won, or else you wouldn't be sitting here.

776
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,720
I mean, I did win.

777
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
So there's a spoiler.

778
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,320
But go listen to it or watch it.

779
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,200
It's very, very funny.

780
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,880
And then watch the show.

781
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,480
Watch all eight episodes.

782
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
It really is a super cool concept.

783
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,320
And they just need views.

784
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,560
You don't have to spend money or anything like that.

785
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,360
Just go watch it.

786
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,120
It's like the easiest thing in the world.

787
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
It's a really good name, too.

788
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,440
Yeah, right?

789
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,800
The Kill Corporation.

790
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,280
That's cool.

791
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,040
The website's neat, too.

792
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,760
I watched some of the first episode before we started here, and it is cool.

793
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,720
I'm going to go watch more.

794
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,800
So go check it out.

795
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Happy birthday, nature box, and prosper.

796
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,440
Rocket Man.

797
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
Everything.

798
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,360
Rocket Man.

799
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,800
Do you want to do one more before we get back to regular questions?

800
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,400
Goodbye, Danny Klein.

801
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,880
I'll do that one.

802
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,240
Did you do that one?

803
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,480
OK.

804
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,440
I sat on the roof.

805
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,920
I kicked off Danny Klein.

806
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,720
He's dead now.

807
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,080
Play us a song, you're the Danny Klein.

808
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,320
OK, well, that's William Joel.

809
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,600
That's Dr. William Joel.

810
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,720
Can't make a living as a Danny Klein anymore.

811
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:42,640
Don't let the Danny Klein go down on me.

812
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,080
Can you feel the Danny Klein?

813
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,120
It's really good.

814
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,680
I'm Danny Klein better than I ever did.

815
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,200
Don't go, Danny.

816
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,240
Danny Klein's all right.

817
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,680
Fight him.

818
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,400
OK, that's pretty good.

819
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,200
OK, we're pretty good.

820
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,520
We're done.

821
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,000
Now we're done.

822
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,640
Let's focus on it.

823
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,000

Join us every other Monday.

839
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,280
I'm a college student, which means I attend a lot of events and meetings.

840
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,240
Usually with those events, pizza is offered. My question is, is if there are three or four

841
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:13,200
boxes of pizza there, how many slices are acceptable to eat? Should I just go with one

842
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,080
or push the boundaries and eat three? That's from Munchen in Millageville.

843
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:29,280
My jam, and I don't know what y'all's jams is, your respective jams, but is to eat until I can't

844
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
anymore. And that goes for whatever.

845
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,800
You know, I was actually, I was thinking about this and I guess my response is, how many do

846
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,880
you want? Start there and then think about how many do you need and how many people there are.

847
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,640
Because if there's like four boxes of people and four boxes of people, oh shit, get them out of

848
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,160
there. If there's four boxes of pizza and a hundred people, maybe just take one.

849
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,080
I have never been to a meeting where pizza was offered. What the fuck? I've never had a pizza

850
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,440
meeting. You've never like done in college, like you get together a bunch of friends to study and

851
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,920
order some pizza? That's not a meeting. That's a study group. He also says events.

852
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,400
Okay, but not meetings. Guys, who's ever been like, listen, we really got to get these reports

853
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,560
filed today and here's some za party. Nobody's leaving this room until we figure out a way to

854
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:33,680
save this campaign. Who wants veggie? Pass that sweet daddy's ranch. Well, I, okay. So let's apply

855
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,000
it to like donuts or like- No, why do you want to fucking, why you think we've already solved

856
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,520
this conversation? We have to move on to donuts. Pizza is its own animal. Pizza ethics are a

857
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:52,000
completely separate issue. I have a thing and you wouldn't suspect it because I'm overweight,

858
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,800
but I have a thing that whenever there's like group food, like where people have to like line

859
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,920
up to get group food- No, no, you're not. Oh, yeah, a little bit delayed. Okay, thanks. I have

860
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,440
to hang back. Like I don't like to wait in line for food. I like to wait until everybody eats and

861
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,840
then go up and swoop afterwards. I used to think it was because like, it's awkward being an overweight

862
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,920
person lining up for food. Like I'm waiting for it. Like I just can't, I got to get in as soon as

863
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,360
I can. But now I think it's so I can like kind of get whatever I want and not have to worry too much

864
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,600
about it. Cause everybody else had their shot. But that's- You know, I used to just take extra.

865
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,360
You know, I used to just take extra because I was so worried that someone else was going to take

866
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:46,000
extra and not leave any like leftovers to go back to second. Oh, I'm that person. Oh, the whole time

867
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,960
the killer was me. Yeah. I'm an unreliable narrator. Travis's Twilight Zone is a world of Travis's.

868
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,520
That's his horrifying- I just assumed that everyone thought the same of me and said like,

869
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,040
oh, this is free. I'm going to take as much as I want. So that way I can make sure someone else

870
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,280
doesn't take it all. I'm actually coming to the realization. Oh my God, this is horrifying that

871
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:15,600
at parties and weddings and formal and informal events anywhere on the formality spectrum events

872
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,680
when the, when there's like a person who gets up and is like, okay guys, thanks for coming.

873
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,480
Dinner is served. So everybody have at it. And then they gesture at somebody as if to say, like,

874
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,520
you seem like the kind of person that's going to kick this thing off. It's almost, it's almost

875
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:40,080
always me. This literally happened at my friend Clint's wedding where his dad was like,

876
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,160
said led a short prayer and it was like, okay, everybody, thanks for coming to this great wedding.

877
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Let's get this party. And then he almost like winked at me, like started as if to say like,

878
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,920
Griffin, you deserve the first play or maybe Griffin, why don't you break the ice here?

879
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,880
Well, cause you're already standing in line. Am I like, do I just, I'm not,

880
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,600
but do I just have the face of like an eager, hunky boy?

881
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,600
You do have kind of a hunky boy face. I'm not like that. You just have an, in general,

882
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,800
like comfortable being the good time guy face. That's probably it. I'm not like a super big boy,

883
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,880
but I am. I guess I do like sort of give off a hunky vibe. Like I just,

884
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,160
hunky for life, hunky for life. Yeah. I just want to eat, eat, eat life right off the cob,

885
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,560
eat life right off the cob. Um, so you don't need anyone to cut your life off for you first

886
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,560
and then eat it with a fork. I'm saying that I'm saying that this is a valuable position that I

887
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,160
fill at a lot of parties, weddings and, and, um, brises and that like everybody feels uncomfortable.

888
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,920
Everybody is adjusting. Nobody wants to be the first person at the table. Everybody's waiting

889
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,680
for somebody to break the ice. And whenever that happens, do you ever really judge that person?

890
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,000
No, of course not. Unless they are a Travis, not you. Do you know what I do judge people when,

891
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,240
um, they are hovering when the announcement is made that food is now on offer. Like you look

892
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,400
at the table and there's some hoverables just like chilling. That is solidly pre-Theresa Travis.

893
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,440
Yeah. That is a no hand gently laid on the forearm by his loving wife, Travis.

894
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:23,760
As if to say, let's be third in line as a full blown tiny tunes to as Travis. Yes. Travis thinks

895
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,840
he was lucky to meet Theresa, but I assure you we are the lucky ones. The rest of us at the buffet.

896
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:35,440
You guys want to Yahoo? Hit me. This Yahoo was sent in by level. Oh man. I actually wrote his

897
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,400
name as Drew Davernport. That's a different guy. That's a different person, but now I have to go

898
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,520
back and check. Did Drew Davernport send this in? Drew Davernport. Drew Davernport. And there's a

899
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,680
couple oom louts in there. Thank you. Drew Davernport. It's by Yahoo answers user evening

900
00:45:51,680 --> 00:46:05,680
primrose who asks accidentally invented boyfriend. Danny and the clients. These girls at school kept

901
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:13,840
teasing me about talking to a boy and we're like, pull, pull, pull. What? What were they saying?

902
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:21,440
Pull or were they pulling at you? Well, I don't know. Ooh. And I got so asterisks off. I got so

903
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,640
dicked off that I said, shut up. I already have a boyfriend. I'm not the datey type. So they started

904
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,840
to ask all these questions. It was end of school. This happened as we were walking home. So I faked

905
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:40,720
a text from my mom and left real quick, but I won't get away so easy tomorrow to shit. I won't

906
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:48,960
get away so easy to Mo's at school. Help. No idea what to do. No idea what the question is. Is this

907
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:56,880
cyber bullying? Did we just get cyber bullied? Wait. So the, they were teasing and pulling

908
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,760
and then they were making taffy during a leisurely walk home from, from the academy.

909
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:10,400
And she said, leave me alone. I've already got a boyfriend. Right. And they went, Oh,

910
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,480
tell me anything about this boyfriend. And she went, did you guys hear that? It was my phone

911
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,400
as my mom's. I gotta go. She left real quick. I'm going to bet, but they didn't buy it.

912
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,840
Maybe it depends on how convincing that mom text was. If you, if you, if you reached in your pocket

913
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,000
and said, whoops, and then you grabbed onto the back of a garbage truck passing by and just

914
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,880
disappear and a puff of smoke. Has anyone ever done anything like that? And like the said to

915
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,960
the bullies, like, no, it's cool. I've already got a boyfriend or girlfriend or you wouldn't know

916
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,120
where or something like that. And they went, Oh, okay. Well, sorry. I'm sorry that we said anything

917
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,320
that fucking college football player. It was kind of that situation. I would say it was the exact

918
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,840
opposite of that situation, girlfriend. Cause he said, I've got a girlfriend. And then people

919
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:02,400
said, I don't think you do means that I'll prove it. And she was made up. Man, Titeo.

920
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:09,440
Whew. Oh, good call. Thanks Google. Um, what? Okay. Out of curiosity, what was that search string?

921
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,640
Uh, I searched for Hawaiian football girlfriend knew from the producers of Jingle all the way too.

922
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:25,440
Was he Hawaiian? Yeah, he was. Uh, God, thanks. Thanks again. Google really saving my

923
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,960
bacon. Um, how do you gingerly crab walk out of this situation? Tell him he died the night

924
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,960
after you told him about, oh, sorry. I'd love to, but he died. Can you stop talking about

925
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,640
it? Sorry. I'd love to, but he died. Can you stop teasing me? I, he, he, he, I got a real fault in

926
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,360
our stars situation on my hands. I told him they were teasing me and he felt so bad about it that

927
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,240
he went out to get me some flowers. And while he was out, he interrupted a robbery and saved a

928
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,800
little boy, but he was shot to death. He went, he felt so bad about it. He went out to get me

929
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,240
some ice cream, but on his way back, the ice cream fell off the cone onto the floor and he leaned

930
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,000
over to pick it up and he ran headlong into a car in the car. He in the car didn't make it.

931
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,360
You got decapitated. Treasure every moment. Cause you never know. Cause you never know.

932
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:19,120
Treasure each moment on this earth. Yolo. And then say, you can still feel his spirit near you

933
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,040
and then, and then just pretend to be haunted by him for the rest of your school career. And

934
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,720
you won't have to worry about having a boyfriend again. There you go. I can't, I can't risk being

935
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:35,120
hurt like that again. Now that fucking guy who catfished Tao could have pulled, could have,

936
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:40,400
could have saved him a lot of indecency, but I can't be your girlfriend anymore. I'm dead.

937
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,040
I'm dead. I died. I'm sorry. I died 50 years ago this very night. There's never been a Hawaiian

938
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:54,800
football girlfriend here. Not for 50 years. What's your Hawaiian girlfriend's name again?

939
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:06,480
Large March. That was your first clue. Let's end this show. Yeah. I think that's the only thing

940
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,320
to do here. Uh, you've been listening to my brother, my brother and me,

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,320
people, um, ask if we would do the, the switch I proposed last week to, um, some, some hot, uh,

963
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,520
Japanese electronica a la capsule. Um, but I think we're going to stick with the, the Long Winters

964
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,880
song cause it's really great, but I am still thinking about that for that forecast. Um,

weird, terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years. You know,

985
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,840
some light summer listening. Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas or why we tried

986
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,960
to eat mummies for a while or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

987
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,200
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday right here

988
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:53,440
on the maximum fun network with saw bones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.
