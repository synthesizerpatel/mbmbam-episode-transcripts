1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,960
Hello everybody and welcome to Birthday Boys, a special birthday podcast for the three birthday

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,760
boys of my brother and my brother and me. My name is Justin McElroy and it is my birthday

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,920
on Saturday. My name is Travis McElroy and it's my birthday on Saturday.

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:08,960
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy and my birthday is cancelled for just the rest of my life.

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,000
No more birthdays for me.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
Is it your birthday on Saturday, Griffin?

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,640
My birthday is on Saturday.

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
It's my birthday on Saturday. The McElroy brothers have their birthdays on Saturday.

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520
I like to think that when the two of you have birthdays, the world birthdays with you.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Well, yeah, except it's not actually their birthday so they don't get anything.

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,480
Like you don't, you aren't going to get gifts, right, Griffin?

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,960
I mean, it's a nice birthday.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,400
Daddy actually still sends me presents on your guy's joint birthday.

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,160
Really?

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm going to have to have my people talk to his people.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
My birthday people.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,800
Griffin, now I heard you, I heard you went to Japan and I think the question on everybody's

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,320
mind that everybody's been wondering about and has been asking about is,

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
did you get us any birthday presents there?

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,400
I got you travel presents.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Your birthday presents will be American made, American bought, and American owned.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,160
Oh my God, this is such a good transition into our first question.

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,600
Okay, we haven't said anything funny yet, so should we keep trying?

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,560
Why start now?

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Why start now?

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,440
Here's our first question.

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
I recently traveled to South America for a little over a month ago.

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
My family members some pretty nice gifts.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Normally when I travel, I give Suvies.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,400
Normally when I travel, I give Suvies.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh man.

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,400
Oh wow, I was not ready for that part with a little bit of neologism.

37
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,120
I give Suvies soon after I come back with candle nights fast approaching.

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm considering wrapping them and giving them as presents.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
Is this tacky?

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,200
This is from Classless in Canada.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Uh, I'm actually into it because it kind of feels like you were thinking about this so early.

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,680
Like I prepped early for your Christmas present.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,880
I was super prepared.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,400
I would say there's a caveat though.

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,400
And that caveat is it depends, like you can't, like I got you this $3 magnet,

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
but because I got it from out of the country, it pretty much covers Christmas.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,080
Has anybody ever gotten you an intercontinental, is that right?

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,320
Yeah.

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,400
A global gift that you were like, you just blew me away.

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
Or I feel like it's, I don't, I'm trying to couch your

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,520
guys expectations for the Japanese presents that I got you.

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
But it's, I always find it very difficult to buy things overseas.

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
And I think it's like, this is so dope.

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,480
They're going to love this.

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Because you have a lot more restrictions there.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,320
I mean, you're handing the person a thing and you're basically saying,

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,160
guess what fit in my suitcase?

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,880
Yeah, right.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,640
That's what didn't break.

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
I didn't bring you back like authentic samurai armor.

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,080
Right.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,520
You're trying to thread a lot of needles.

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,760
It depends on also how, how, how far apart your travel and candle nights is.

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,240
Cause if it's man, I don't know if it's like nine months, it's like,

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,640
you could just give me that nine months ago and then got me extra presents.

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
That's what I'm talking to you guys about.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,040
Do I ship you guys this shit now and then get you some, some real American,

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,520
true American presence or do you only want half of the presents?

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,360
Cause that seems like a pretty easy choice to me.

70
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,640
I mean, I want double the presence.

71
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,040
Right.

72
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you want to let me off the hook for having to figure out what the fuck you guys are into?

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
Like what stuff you desire as humans now?

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
Um, how about you just like start buying presents and we'll tell you when to stop.

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Open your wallet.

76
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
We'll, we'll wave you off.

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
In fact, you just want to give me your credit card information.

78
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
I've got a wishlist a mile long on Amazon and I will take care of it.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,120
Well, I mean, it is also your birthday, so I could just,

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
I mean, we're talking, we're getting into triple present territory and I'm not made of money.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm made of flesh.

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,280
Can't buy things with flesh.

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,640
This isn't Hellraiser.

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:02,400
I would say that like you can do a souvenirs as presents and, you know, if you're the

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,360
You're saying they're a supplement, a present dressing, a present condiment.

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,080
Exactly.

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
I'm a person who likes to do like three or four gifts per person for Christmas.

88
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
So like you can swap that out.

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,400
And as long as it's like a gift, you would normally give them.

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,000
Does that make sense?

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,080
Like if it's something where it's like, I didn't just get this because I got it from

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,800
another country.

93
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
I got it for you because it made me think of you.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,400
And it's like a specific present I bought for you.

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,680
Not just like, I buy you a Nova Scotian flag.

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,920
Like if it's like, well, it is Nova Scotia.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,320
Yeah, fine.

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,040
They don't have, they do not have a flag.

99
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm sure they have some sort of flag.

100
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,120
So like, welcome to Nova Scotia.

101
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,640
Nova Scotia is for lovers.

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,800
It's just Ellen Page giving a thumbs up.

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,840
I think that the nice thing about giving it during candle nights is that you spare yourself

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,800
the awkwardness of the person not having a reciprocal gift.

105
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
Like, oh, that's the worst.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
You got me this from China.

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,320
That's cool.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,640
I was in Logan County and I have half a Gatorade left from that trip.

109
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,680
That's not the scenario.

110
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,200
The scenario is next time you go on international travels, you know you got.

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,880
We have friends who spent the summer in Africa and when they came back, they brought us like

112
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
shirts that they had made for us.

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,440
Like out of these like beautiful fabrics that were like sized to fit and all looked super

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,240
dope on us.

115
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,240
And it's like, thanks guys, we will never ever be able to feel okay.

116
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,520
There's nowhere we could go.

117
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Now we have to stop being friends.

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,840
Right.

119
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,560
I got you a BMW.

120
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,760
I went to Germany and I got you an authentic, that's where those are made, right?

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,600
I got you an authentic Swiss Rolex.

122
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,640
I think this is why everyone before your friends leave for an international trip, you should

123
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,080
just remind them what kind of weird little tchotchkes you collect.

124
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,640
If you're like shot glasses, it's easy.

125
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,720
I'm going to take this weight off your shoulder, just to get me a shot glass.

126
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,600
I collect nail clippers from around the world.

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,880
Just that's it.

128
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,800
Having a collection is really a gift that you give to other people.

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,040
I mean, that is the most beautiful thing you could do is have a collection because now

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:38,160
anytime anybody is like hard up, let me just get Justin a full motion video Sega CD game

131
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
from wherever country I'm at and I'll just bring that home for him.

132
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,640
No problem.

133
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,920
That's their whole fucking trip.

134
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,600
It's like, what are we doing on Wednesday?

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,280
We're in Sydney, Australia.

136
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
What are we going to do on Wednesday?

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, we got to find a fucking video game store, a used video game store that is very

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,960
well stocked.

139
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
I hear there's a back alley vendor.

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
He's got the full motion videos right next to them.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,320
They've got to be NTSC format, which is going to be very difficult to find here.

142
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,280
And it looks like the only one he does not have is double switch.

143
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,680
So call it another shrimp on the Atari.

144
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,240
No, why would it?

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
It might do that.

146
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,040
This Yahoo was sent in by Ryan Berry.

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,680
Thank you, Ryan.

148
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
It's by Yahoo answers user G who asks, I had a wet dream.

149
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
I was being chased by a bear.

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,280
Wait, what?

151
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
There's no additional information.

152
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
That's all you get.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,680
Damn it.

154
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,400
Oh, God.

155
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
The bear is going to eat me.

156
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
And also, why am I coming?

157
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,320
Oh, God.

158
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,960
I love cake.

159
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,720
But you know what bears don't know?

160
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,840
Safe words.

161
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
That's no, I can't imagine.

162
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,720
It's a pretty good defense mechanism.

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,720
The bears like, whoa, whoa, I'm going to go.

164
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
You said DuckTales.

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
So I'm going to back up.

166
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,840
No, DuckTales can't be our parental password.

167
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,080
To know that an adult is down and also be safe for rough stuff.

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
Do you think it's possible that this person doesn't know what wet dream means?

169
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
And they got so scared that they wet the bed and then they woke up and like, I'm a man.

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,280
Or they woke up covered in honey.

171
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
It wasn't a dream.

172
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,200
It was a dream.

173
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,360
By the way, this is posted in Yahoo answers section titled dream interpretation.

174
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,920
So you know that's all that we're doing for the next episode.

175
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,240
Our special dream interpretation episode.

176
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,680
Did anyone try to interpret this particular nighttime journey?

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,080
Yahoo answers user Jamie did say, well, there's such a thing as an erotic nightmare,

178
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,080
which by the way, is the new subtitle of my brother, my brother and me.

179
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
An erotic nightmare for the modern era.

180
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,120
Even though I never had one.

181
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
What others are saying is correct.

182
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
Besides when you dream or have nightmares,

183
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
you're in REM sleep in which you will normally have an erection anyway.

184
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,000
No fucking way.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,280
Is that true, Jamie?

186
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,560
How were your Zs last night?

187
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,800
Good.

188
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,480
I got down to like REM level four was hard as a rock the whole time.

189
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
Hey, let me ask you guys.

190
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,120
Did you guys ever have wet dreams?

191
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,760
Is this a real?

192
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
I'm asking you too.

193
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,080
Did you ever have wet dreams growing up?

194
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,880
I was so worried about having a wet dream.

195
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,280
I was very proactive about making sure that would be a biological impossibility.

196
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,960
Wet dreams.

197
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,840
You guys ever have a wet dream?

198
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,520
I don't want to talk about this with you.

199
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,240
Brothers.

200
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,280
Hey, my brothers.

201
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Hey, my biological brothers.

202
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,280
Did you guys, when you were growing up, did you ever have a wet dream?

203
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,200
Do you ever have nocturnal emissions, brothers?

204
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
So mine.

205
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,720
I feel like the very idea of wet dreams should be a thing that like people surreptitiously

206
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
bury in their backyard and never speak about.

207
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,400
Like wet dreams is not a thing you post on Yahoo answers and say, like, I dreamed about

208
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,360
a bear eating me.

209
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
And also, apparently I was super into it.

210
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,680
Oh, see, I didn't even consider the possibility that the bear caught and ate you.

211
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
If that's the case, maybe you're into Vore.

212
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
You might be in a Vore.

213
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,320
You know what?

214
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,160
Something I learned last time we talked about Vore.

215
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,280
Our listeners really love it when I talk about Vore.

216
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,640
It's like listening to Conan O'Brien talk about video games.

217
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,040
It's like something you think that this person doesn't know about.

218
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
Guys, I know all about Vore.

219
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
Not that it's my particular cup of tea.

220
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
I just find it very fascinating.

221
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,200
And you know what else is weird?

222
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
When you talk about Vore, that's an ASMR trigger for me.

223
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,160
What is that?

224
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,660
ASMR?

225
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,080
Is it like this gentle speaking?

226
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,560
Yeah.

227
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,840
And like ASMR videos, I've gotten really into them lately, you guys.

228
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,560
Yeah, me too.

229
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,400
You have ASMR, you get tingles.

230
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
Like when people-

231
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
You know that, Griff, you ever get that tingle when like you're getting your haircut or like

232
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,920
you're getting measured maybe for clothes and you get that like tingle in the back of your head.

233
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
And then you wake up and you cum.

234
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,640
No, well, no.

235
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,800
No, it's not like that.

236
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
I just find it so fascinating the things that give people bonus.

237
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,880
Do you want to try- Hey, you know what we should do?

238
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,640
We should do an ASMR section.

239
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,600
Okay.

240
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Here's how you do it, right?

241
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,400
You just talk like this and you say like, hello and welcome to my clinic.

242
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,360
I'm going to be your pretend doctor.

243
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,920
Let me check.

244
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,960
Just lie back and I'm going to massage your scalp.

245
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
This is my partner.

246
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
What is your practice?

247
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,400
Why are you ASMR Batman?

248
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,520
My practice is, where's Falcone?

249
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,960
I find Falcone.

250
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,840
This is my partner, Dr. Travis Patrick McElroy.

251
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,160
Hey!

252
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Who's going to take me now?

253
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
Hey guys, we're here to talk to you.

254
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't think that was ASMR.

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm going to rub your head.

256
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,240
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.

257
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm rubbing it.

258
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
This is a gentleman rubbing your head.

259
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
Scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp, scalp.

260
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,160
Can I try it?

261
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
Can I try to do it?

262
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,240
Yeah, go for it, Griffin.

263
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey, everybody.

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,240
This is Griffin coming at you with my soothing ASMR.

265
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
I did an arm fart.

266
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:25,120
What age of person is appropriate to be listening to their ASMR video?

267
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,920
Sometimes when I'm on the ASMR creep, I find myself accidentally listening to a video

268
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,880
of a person that might not be 18 years old.

269
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,000
And then I have to say to myself, uh-oh, do I need to pump the brakes?

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,720
Is this the Yahoo Answers question you're reading or a Justin Answers question?

271
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,440
This is a Justin Answers special Justin Nights mystery for you guys at what age?

272
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
Because you know who has free time to talk quietly into a microphone?

273
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,040
15-year-olds.

274
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,640
So I'm saying, is it okay to listen to an underage ASMR video?

275
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,800
No, fucking of course not.

276
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
I didn't think so.

277
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm going to say right here that ASMR is not inherently sexual.

278
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
So yes, it's fine.

279
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,440
What is it?

280
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,840
What?

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,320
What?

282
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,600
Do you, it, yes.

283
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,400
Yeah.

284
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,840
You know what?

285
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,440
Actually the 100% is.

286
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,440
Because you're gleaning a very intimate sensation from those videos.

287
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,760
You did not know what ASMR was fucking, you just went zero to judgey in like three minutes

288
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,200
because you didn't know what ASMR was and now you decided it's sexual.

289
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,160
Classic.

290
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,640
What is it?

291
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,000
If not sexual, what is it?

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,840
It's just like a pleasant relaxing thing.

293
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,440
You know what else is?

294
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,800
Wet dreams.

295
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,600
Yeah.

296
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,640
Nice relaxing wet dream.

297
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
You ever wake up from a wet dream just feeling like you just like guzzled down a fresca?

298
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,240
I feel like a million bucks and also sticky.

299
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
Thank you very much subconscious.

300
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I enjoyed that quite a bit.

301
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,200
This seems like one of those segments that people are going to tweet at us and say like,

302
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,600
listen, I'm usually down with anything, but that prolonged segment where you asked your

303
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
brothers what wet dreams they had may have been too much even for me.

304
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,600
What's up you cool babies?

305
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,680
Well, we only have like six boundaries left and it's like sweeps week.

306
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,320
You know what I mean?

307
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,200
We're in the heat of fall pilot season.

308
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,440
We got to compete with the fucking flash somehow.

309
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
Tell me about your jizz nightmare.

310
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,640
Tune in this week.

311
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,760
Your jizz odysseys.

312
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,520
Look at fucking utopia.

313
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,000
Utopia is going to be canceled in two weeks and the world will mourn the loss of something

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,520
that they never knew that they should love.

315
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,080
We could fall down the same pit if we don't keep it spicy reality show utopia.

316
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,560
I'm talking about the shit reality show utopia that nobody but you and I are watching.

317
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
It's amazing, right?

318
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,400
We can't get started.

319
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Okay, I we probably can't go down a utopia rabbit hole, right?

320
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,120
No.

321
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,360
Okay, but did you watch the new episode and aren't they kind of ruining it with confessionals?

322
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,760
Um, I didn't watch this week's episode.

323
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,400
We have a special like topical like timely.

324
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,040
Are you ready?

325
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,360
This year Halloween falls on a Friday.

326
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,840
I'm excited to be able to celebrate the holiday on the weekend.

327
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,760
What the fuck are you doing?

328
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,800
I'm reading a question.

329
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm my own man now.

330
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,880
Don't hold me back, dad.

331
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,000
What are you?

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
You move out to fucking cal now you're hotshot.

333
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
L.A. Travis, we love it.

334
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm tired of this.

335
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm tired of you big timing so you can go to In-N-Out Burger whenever you want.

336
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,880
And I know it's so it's 10 o'clock there.

337
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
I'm done with this.

338
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,200
Do you want to go ahead?

339
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,040
Let's hear your L.A. infections.

340
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,160
You take the four or nine to Halloween falls on a Friday.

341
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
Californians, you guys remember?

342
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,800
Okay, you ready?

343
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Yeah, I guess I only do one thing on this show, but I guess I'll just slide it over.

344
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,080
This year Halloween falls on a Friday.

345
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm excited to be able to celebrate.

346
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,320
No, you.

347
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,040
Okay, you take it.

348
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,800
I don't wanna.

349
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,760
I'm done with that now.

350
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,880
I don't do that anymore.

351
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,040
Now Justin's doing Yahoo's and I just fucking kick it.

352
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
This year, Halloween falls on a Friday.

353
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,080
I'm excited to be able to celebrate the holiday on the weekend

354
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,760
as I love dressing up in costumes.

355
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,400
Would it be socially acceptable to go out on Saturday night in costume as well?

356
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,880
Oh, sure.

357
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
October, October 32nd.

358
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,120
Sounds good to me.

359
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,600
I don't want the party to end, but I also don't want to be the only person there in costume.

360
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,480
Trick or trouble.

361
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
Hey, good news.

362
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
You will be.

363
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,440
You will be the only person.

364
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,160
Although, I don't know.

365
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,200
I mean, October 32nd is becoming an increasingly popular day

366
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,400
for people to dress up in costume.

367
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,440
I don't know about you, Griffin.

368
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,880
I didn't understand a fucking word Travis just said.

369
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,600
I didn't understand.

370
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,880
Where was the inflection, the heart, the energy, the passion?

371
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,040
He didn't fuck up reading a word that was three syllables long,

372
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,680
which is, I don't know.

373
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,480
I've just become so accustomed to the sound of your voice, I guess.

374
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,520
There is no day that brings more of a tonal shift to your life.

375
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
Maybe January 1st rivals it.

376
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,640
But like, November 1st is such a momentous thing.

377
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,600
It's like, all right, we're done with those bullshit holidays.

378
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,040
Time to get down to that sweet stuff.

379
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
The temperature plummets like 30 degrees overnight.

380
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,520
The fall leaves start a falling.

381
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
All the pumpkins turn to ash.

382
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
And it's like, it's fucking go time.

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,360
It's fucking turkey time.

384
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
Have you guys, you guys think it's weird?

385
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
I was thinking about this for the first time this year.

386
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,760
I have a jack-o'-lantern on my porch now.

387
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,640
I still carve.

388
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,880
It seems like a lot of people aren't into that anymore.

389
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,440
I don't see a lot of those anymore, but I still carve.

390
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,960
And I have it there.

391
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,800
And I was thinking about how I need to get rid of that.

392
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,760
And then I was thinking like, don't pumpkins kind of weirdly straddle the line

393
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,920
between like Halloween and autumnal?

394
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,400
Like, if I turn this bad boy around,

395
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,520
can it just be an autumnal decoration to the rots, of course?

396
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,640
Well, and then it's just like a commentary on life.

397
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,080
Think about it.

398
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,040
Think about it, people.

399
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,280
I get, I get this question because like,

400
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,240
so we'll take 30 seconds to talk about the fact that Griffin

401
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,360
and I both dressed up as Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers.

402
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
What the fuck, by the way, what the fuck?

403
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm almost certain I told you that I was doing that before.

404
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,760
No, we haven't spoken in three weeks.

405
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,880
And our wives were both like, no, it was great.

406
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,520
And it was totally cute.

407
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,800
And our friend Bradberry dressed up too.

408
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,240
So we had this weird like, are you?

409
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,880
Yeah, I am.

410
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,440
Did you?

411
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah.

412
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,800
Yeah.

413
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,600
But so I've got a full beard and Bob has a mustache.

414
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,040
So I like debated all day, like, do I shave down for one night?

415
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,440
Like, and it seems like all of this work,

416
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,880
all this money you spend on costumes

417
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,240
and time spending costume together

418
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,440
and everything like that for maybe like six hours

419
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
of enjoyment and then you're just done.

420
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,960
Like, it's not a thing like you're investing in

421
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,000
for the rest of the year.

422
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,040
Like you're-

423
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,760
I beg to differ.

424
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
I actually bought a wig that I think I'm gonna get

425
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,040
a lot of use out of, sexually.

426
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,600
I didn't mean to say that last word again.

427
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,400
I keep doing that.

428
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
I keep adding in the meant to think the last words,

429
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,080
but then I say them out loud.

430
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,720
God damn it.

431
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,480
The mustache too.

432
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,000
God damn it.

433
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
I was kind of depressing.

434
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,280
This is the first year in like a long time

435
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,880
that I haven't gotten like a Halloween costume together.

436
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,720
It's always hugely stressful because Sydney and I burned

437
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,400
like Wayne and Garth way too early in our relationship.

438
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,440
And we should have hung on to it for a while longer.

439
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,360
So it's always hard trying to come up with-

440
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,600
Every seven years, you can do the costume over.

441
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,760
You think I can revisit it?

442
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,640
You think it's time?

443
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah, I'm looking forward to five years from now

444
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
when I can do Marty McFly again.

445
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,680
We all are.

446
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,440
I thought you were TMNT.

447
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,160
I was, but it was really just a t-shirt and a mask.

448
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,000
I mean, it was fine.

449
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,120
It just wasn't for a party.

450
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,040
Like a lot of times at the Halloween party,

451
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,640
I'm straddling that line between like,

452
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,800
are people gonna get this?

453
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,840
And does it bring-

454
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
Do I think it's personally entertaining?

455
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
One year I was six string samurai

456
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,280
from that hit indie film, Six Strings Samurai.

457
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
And I walked around the neighborhood

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,800
in just like a suit with a sword

459
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,160
because that's like the whole bit and nobody got that one.

460
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,760
So that was not a good costume.

461
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
I thought that was a failure on my part.

462
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,960
Yeah, I mean, we've all shot the cannon indoors like that.

463
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
This was actually the first year I think ever

464
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,560
where I was known for, well, I don't know.

465
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
The year the movie Kick-Ass came out,

466
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,600
I bought a Kick-Ass outfit, but it was really tight

467
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
and I had to wear jeans underneath it

468
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,080
because my dick was just like,

469
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,760
hey guys, happy Halloween.

470
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,880
Oh, cute costume.

471
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm Griffin's dick.

472
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
You could see me like I'm just out there

473
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
and the mask didn't fit over my giant head.

474
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,040
So I went maskless.

475
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,480
And so I just basically looked like a sex pervert

476
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,800
who was really dumpy from the waist down.

477
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,720
What were we talking about?

478
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,160
I did, I did, I did, yeah.

479
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,240
Speaking of this exact situation,

480
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,040
last year, right around Halloween time,

481
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,080
but it is not a Halloween-related story,

482
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,880
I was directing a production of

483
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,120
It's a Bird that's Playing Superman

484
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,160
and the young man who was playing Superman,

485
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,640
who also is a listener of this program, hi, Drew.

486
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,400
He was-

487
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,600
Drew Davenport?

488
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
No, Drew Edwards.

489
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,480
And he was playing Superman

490
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,000
and he was trying to figure out

491
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,480
how the situation down there

492
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,760
needed to be sort of curtailed

493
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
or restrained in some way.

494
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
And he tried several options

495
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,720
and was asking me for feedback.

496
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
And so I was in the unavailable position

497
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,800
of trying to tell a 17-year-old

498
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,480
how much of his dick could be showing.

499
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,840
Did you ask him to describe

500
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,720
his different experiments using ASMR?

501
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,840
You fucking weirdo.

502
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,480
Start again.

503
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,160
Whisper, please.

504
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,560
One of my friends asked me to ask you

505
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,680
what the best solution was.

506
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,040
One of my friends did that.

507
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,480
What was the best solution?

508
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,320
He asked, his name is George.

509
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,560
Some sort of weight belt, I think,

510
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,920
ended up being the thing.

511
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,320
It was like compression shorts

512
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
that you do for sports.

513
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,320
Compression shorts.

514
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,560
Was one of the options he had lean into it?

515
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,680
Yeah.

516
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,760
For the moms.

517
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,480
Tuck a few fake dicks down there

518
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
and they won't know which ones,

519
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,840
which ones, right?

520
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
The old decoy dick.

521
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,680
The old Cthulhu's beard.

522
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,120
You guys want a Yahoo?

523
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,600
Yes, please.

524
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,000
This Yahoo was sent in by level 45,000

525
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,200
Yahoo Answers shaman Drew Davenport.

526
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,000
Thank you, Drew.

527
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kelly 45712 who asks,

528
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,840
what are some cute Halloween names

529
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,720
for spaghetti, French bread, and salad?

530
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,120
What are some cute Halloween names

531
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,880
for spaghetti, French bread, and salad?

532
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
Okay, wait, so like she-

533
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,840
I'll give you an example.

534
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,080
This is Yahoo Answers, the best answer,

535
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,960
which I certainly will not debate.

536
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,800
Yahoo Answers user Double says,

537
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,040
for spaghetti, spoo-getty.

538
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,000
That's what I was gonna say.

539
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,000
That's really good.

540
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,560
It's really good.

541
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,680
What about witch's hair?

542
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,800
That's pretty good too.

543
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
That's what, are we talking about like,

544
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
you're trying to trigger like,

545
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,760
oh, put your hand in there.

546
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,720
It's like, it's our eyeballs.

547
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,200
It's grapes.

548
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,760
What is it?

549
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,920
It's grapes.

550
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,720
It's cool.

551
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,680
It's always grapes.

552
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,800
Some Medusa bush.

553
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,240
That was gross.

554
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
I'm sorry I said Medusa bush, everybody.

555
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
But you think about it,

556
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,720
there'll probably be snakes down there too, right?

557
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,160
Okay.

558
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,000
No, no, no.

559
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,440
Are you asking me right now?

560
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah.

561
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,000
If Medusa has snakes for hair,

562
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,680
that she would have tiny-

563
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,080
You asked me about my night jizz.

564
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,320
Working on my night jizz.

565
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,080
I'm asking you if Medusa-

566
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
Travis, you'll get one later in the show.

567
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
Justin, I'm specifically asking you

568
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
if Medusa has snakes down there.

569
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,840
If the carpet matches the snakes.

570
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,520
I have always thought of Medusa

571
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,160
as someone who's down to clown 24-7.

572
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,240
I'm assuming she keeps it short.

573
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Maybe just one strip of snakes

574
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,800
or maybe snakes in a-

575
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,760
Just snake blood.

576
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
Just one special-

577
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,680
Hi.

578
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,480
Maybe she shapes it into the shape of a plane

579
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,520
and is like, get it?

580
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,360
My name is Dennis.

581
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,800
Dennis, I made the cut, literally.

582
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm the one pubic snake who's here every year.

583
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm so lonely.

584
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,800
French bread, double says,

585
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
could be dead man's finger

586
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,880
or dead man's finger slices.

587
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,120
Not as good as-

588
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,480
It's too small for a finger.

589
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,560
It's more like a butt cheek that you cut off.

590
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,720
Maybe like a toasted butt cheek.

591
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
Dead man's loafer.

592
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,000
Cut a man's butt cheek off

593
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
and this is the butt cheek I toasted it.

594
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,680
Scarlet keys, Italian.

595
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,600
What if you called the French bread salad?

596
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,200
Cause that's spookier than bread is, I think.

597
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,480
Pretty good joke, Bazooka Joe.

598
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,960
Keep them coming.

599
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
What would the salad be then?

600
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
Cause what's worse than-

601
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,920
A spooky salad?

602
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
It's pretty good, I guess.

603
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,640
I mean, no, that wasn't my intent.

604
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
I'm just clarifying.

605
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,960
You mean a spooky name for a salad.

606
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
You just called it a salad with scare-its.

607
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,040
I like that.

608
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,840
Tom Scare-its?

609
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,120
Tom Scare-its.

610
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,680
What about with thousand dylan dressing?

611
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,600
And blue cheese.

612
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,680
Wait, did you say boochies?

613
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,800
Boochies, boochies.

614
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,760
Obviously, boochies.

615
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,280
Boochies, I meant boochies.

616
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,560
Boochies, of course, boochies.

617
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,800
So we got the money zone?

618
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:37,920
I think so, actually.

619
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,360
You guys have heard of TV, right?

620
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,880
Wait, what?

621
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,960
Have you guys heard of TV?

622
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,200
Like the shows episodic in nature.

623
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Like tuberculosis?

624
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
No, like short movies, TV.

625
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,480
I guess so.

626
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,840
I got something better than TV.

627
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,280
TV sucks, it's for old people.

628
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,240
Whoa.

629
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
You just found out TV existed.

630
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,160
Hold on.

631
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,080
Yeah, can you fucking slow your roll?

632
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
Sorry, I let it go already.

633
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,280
TV's last gen and next is Hulu.

634
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,360
But Hulu, you guys remember Hulu?

635
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,360
Forget Hulu, because now there's Hulu Plus.

636
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,680
God, you're asking us to forget a lot of shit right now

637
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,600
that we literally just heard about.

638
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,280
It is an internet streaming service.

639
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,560
It's got all the current season episodes

640
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,080
of favorite shows like Modern Family,

641
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,200
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,

642
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,240
and every episode of some shows like South Park,

643
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,360
which is just in Hulu Plus.

644
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,920
If you want to get that whole South Park canon,

645
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,880
that's the place to get it.

646
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,080
Now that you've brought up Hulu,

647
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,040
and I've done research on it in the last 0.5 seconds,

648
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,080
they also have lots of originals and exclusive content.

649
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,920
So the second season of East List High,

650
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,080
which season one and two are up,

651
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
so that's like a full two days, you're welcome.

652
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,920
You can also watch The Hot Wives of Orlando,

653
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,600
which is a parody of The Real Hot Wives,

654
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
starring Kacey Wilson, Kristen Schaal,

655
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,920
Angela, like pretty much the greatest.

656
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,040
Angela Kinsey, it's an amazing cast.

657
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,640
They just added all three seasons of Burning Love,

658
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,840
which is fucking the best and funniest show on television.

659
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,520
You should definitely be watching that.

660
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,840
Also, ANTM Cycle 21, Boys Still in the House, Booch Tooch.

661
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
Boys are not out of the house.

662
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
Boys, they cannot evict these boys.

663
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
They can, however, put all of the contestants

664
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,400
in a haunted asylum and take pictures of them

665
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,440
while people chase them with chainsaws and knives and shit.

666
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,840
Quick diversion to just wag my finger

667
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
at the producers of ANTM.

668
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,520
Some of us plan our weeks around it,

669
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,160
so when you drop a recap special,

670
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,520
and I have set an hour of my Friday night aside

671
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,400
for your program, not cool.

672
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,960
And when you fucking tease the week before

673
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,280
at the end of the episode that the next week's episode

674
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,120
is gonna be a very, very special episode

675
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,760
where they tackle Adam's unsafe drinking,

676
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,520
and then you follow that up with a fucking recap.

677
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm on ANTM recap, the only thing I can assume

678
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,360
is that one of the contestants they expected to die did not.

679
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,000
They budget for one to die every year,

680
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and it did not come to fruition.

681
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,720
I mean, they did get that one guy out who left.

682
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,600
And I said, you know what, I said good riddance.

683
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
I think we all know what guy I'm talking about,

684
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,840
and his behavior was unacceptable.

685
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,360
I do not accept it.

686
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,400
Get the fuck out of here.

687
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,520
Oh wait, you're already gone,

688
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
because you're a fucking joker.

689
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,680
For $8 a month, you could be having conversations

690
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
just like this, but you don't have to pony up

691
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,560
that eight bucks right now.

692
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,440
No, we're gonna give you a two week free trial of Hulu Plus.

693
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
Go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother,

694
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,000
that's all one word, HuluPlus.com slash my brother

695
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,960
and get two weeks free of Hulu Plus, go.

696
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,360
Tucking myself out with advertising.

697
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,840
Can I just say one last thing on the subject though?

698
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,160
Yeah, can you make it snack related?

699
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,520
Just really quick, I thought that that dude's beard weave

700
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,560
was looking a lot better.

701
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,360
I'm not, that's not a joke.

702
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,640
It started to look a lot more natural.

703
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't know what fucking witchcraft they used.

704
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,560
I too thought Denzel's beard weave

705
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,920
was starting to look better.

706
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,080
Two words, people, beard weave.

707
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
Two more words, free snacks.

708
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,720
We're gonna give you free snacks from Nature Box.

709
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,280
Those are delicious snacks that are wholesome.

710
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,880
Snacks that don't have a lot of weird stuff.

711
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,200
Powering has come and gone.

712
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,760
You've eaten your fun sized candy bars,

713
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,280
your Nerds, your Nerd ropes, your Nerd chains,

714
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,480
your Tootsie Roll Pops of all flavors.

715
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,600
Time to purify.

716
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,440
These snacks have no artificial flavors

717
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,560
or colors or sweeteners.

718
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,240
There's no trans fat.

719
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,680
There's no high for dose corn syrup.

720
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,320
They're wholesome.

721
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,800
You can feel good about giving them to your family

722
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,320
or to trick or treaters, loose.

723
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
Give them a handful.

724
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,360
Give them a handful of loose choco nom noms.

725
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
A handful of loose dark cocoa almonds

726
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,520
or loose mix sweet potato fries

727
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,040
or loose peanut butter nom noms

728
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,960
maybe slightly warmed from sitting

729
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
in the palm of your hand.

730
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,040
We got sweet and savory and spicy snacks.

731
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,880
We ran out of Halloween candy this year

732
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,480
because we completely under,

733
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,880
it's our first year Halloween in this new house

734
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,920
and we totally underestimated

735
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,040
how many trick or treats were gonna come.

736
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,160
We ran out of candy.

737
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,800
And so we started handing out these rice crackers

738
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,160
that we brought back from Japan.

739
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,000
Like enjoy kids, you're gonna have

740
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,920
a real multicultural experience.

741
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,680
You're welcome from the McElroy's.

742
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,480
So you can get a free box of these snacks

743
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
and really get in there and try them out.

744
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,440
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

745
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,760
and you'll get a free trial box of delicious snacks.

746
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,840
Stay full, stay strong.

747
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,280
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother

748
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,040
to get a free trial of delicious snacks.

749
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,720
Here is a message for Cory from Julia,

750
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,360
Tim, Imo, Kate, Trevor, Robert, Elijah,

751
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,680
Lydia, Jason, Mari, Will, Katie, Gary,

752
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Evan, Cole and Ev.

753
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,280
They may have run out of space

754
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,120
but I'm assuming there's another one.

755
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,560
Okay, here's the message for Cory.

756
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,680
Happy birthday, Cory.

757
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,360
Bazinga, you motherfuckers.

758
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,320
I think that's trademarked.

759
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,200
We're gonna go to prison.

760
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
We couldn't, Bazinga.

761
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,320
But June Joes, we couldn't afford

762
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,480
that adult teen baby costume you wanted.

763
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,320
So we got you the next best thing.

764
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
You're our favorite Cali boy

765
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,560
whose sexy swag will take him far.

766
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
We know you've gotta go fast

767
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,200
so we'll keep this short.

768
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,800
Grab yourself a boat drink

769
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,600
and give Buckaroo some of your fuzzy hugs.

770
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,240
Love ya, sad and grossest voice, Sugarloaf.

771
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,680
Oh, see, I thought it was gonna go more

772
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,840
like the direction of the dude from Men in Black.

773
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,200
I have a second message here

774
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,040
and this one's from Cory

775
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,800
and it's just from Buckaroo.

776
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,120
And Buckaroo says, that's right.

777
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,040
We love you so much.

778
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,920
We got you two messages from the brothers McElroy.

779
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,600
We got your back through thick and thin

780
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
through this entire commercial break, apparently.

781
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,920
From your woodworking to your cooking,

782
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,960
you've given us a lot.

783
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,760
So here's to you, m'lady, tip, tip, tip.

784
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,160
May the, I don't know what any of this means.

785
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm just hanging in there.

786
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,640
May the rest of your year be filled

787
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,920
with primo goofs, dog kisses, and good times.

788
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,040
And don't forget, Shrek is love, Shrek is life.

789
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,840
All hail Shrek.

790
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,280
All hail Shrek.

791
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,400
Thank you, Shrek.

792
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
Oh man, that's fantastic.

793
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,680
What a lucky boy that Cory is.

794
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,280
Probably the luckiest.

795
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,040
Can I just say one thing?

796
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:23,360
I do wonder how Buckaroo got their own message

797
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,760
while Julia, Tim, Emil, Kate, Trevor, Robert, Elijah,

798
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,720
Lydia, Jason, Mari, Will, Katie, Gary, Evan, Cole, and Ev

799
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,600
had to go fucking splitsies like 14 ways

800
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,840
on the first one.

801
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,200
Yeah, pretty hard to figure that one out.

802
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,280
Unless Buckaroo is their hive mind name,

803
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,680
in which case that's pretty sexy.

804
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,520
We are Buckaroo.

805
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,720
We are all Buckaroo.

806
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,120
I am Buckaroo.

807
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm gonna force Buckaroo into some sheep

808
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,240
and make him run off a cliff.

809
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,400
What's up?

810
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,400
My name is Jasper Redd, co-host of The Goose Down,

811
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,880
along with the lovely Kimberly Clark,

812
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,840
and we want to invite you into the comfort and groove

813
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,160
of our podcast that encompasses the arts and entertainment.

814
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,200
You can check us out at MaximalFun.org,

815
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,760
also available on iTunes.

816
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,260
See ya.

817
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,720
My brother is older than me by nine years,

818
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,760
and he has been my role model since I can remember,

819
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,840
as is typically the case with an older sibling.

820
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
He's a firefighter.

821
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,720
He was briefly a pro kayaker.

822
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,520
He's a carpenter.

823
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm feeling inferior as I read this.

824
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,120
He saved a dog from drowning.

825
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,200
He basically matches all the criteria

826
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,560
for being a true American hero,

827
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,880
except he told me yesterday after talking on the phone

828
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
that he's recently started sitting down to pee.

829
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,880
His reasoning is it's more sanitary

830
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,640
and you get to relax for a few seconds.

831
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,800
Should I still look up to him,

832
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,560
although I can't help but picture him

833
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,240
sitting on the toilet to number one?

834
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
Will this new image I have of him pass?

835
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,080
Should I be concerned?

836
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,040
That's from Standing Strong in Columbus.

837
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,320
While in Japan,

838
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,120
I sat down for every number, for any number,

839
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,040
because them turlets do some really great shit.

840
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,760
You can get a soothing spray,

841
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,960
which I always felt a very silent judgment from my wife

842
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,640
every time that I exercised that option,

843
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,920
because you know no door is thick enough

844
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,600
to keep that sound out.

845
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,080
That's true.

846
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,520
That's a very specific noise.

847
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,040
It's a very specific noise.

848
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
There's a motor involved,

849
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,680
but there's also deodorizers.

850
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,720
There's all kinds of great stuff

851
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,680
that you can get down there.

852
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,040
It's a wonderful device.

853
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,200
And I gotta say, I kinda dug it, kinda liked it.

854
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,840
There's very little guesswork involved.

855
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,960
There's very little triangulation that you gotta do.

856
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,440
If anyone else was in a career

857
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,400
where they had to target something,

858
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,240
if you had cut your finger as a chef

859
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,560
as many times as I have been caught peeing on the floor,

860
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,080
you would have lost your privileges by this point.

861
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,480
I have almost certainly lost my right to stand up to pee.

862
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,320
I think I've abused that privilege

863
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,160
to a point that is beyond the pale.

864
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,400
I feel like it's a weird stigma to be like,

865
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,440
oh, you sit down?

866
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,520
It's like, yeah, why?

867
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,880
Why is that?

868
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,600
I have a question for our question asker.

869
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,480
How did that conversation come up?

870
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,840
Do you record a podcast?

871
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,800
Because that's the only reason

872
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
I talk about peeing with my brother.

873
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,680
Hey, how was your day?

874
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,320
It was pretty great.

875
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,440
I went grocery shopping.

876
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
Did you stand up or sit down when you peed today?

877
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,080
I'm pretty sure that the person didn't mean

878
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,360
to phrase it this way,

879
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,800
but he told me yesterday after talking on the phone.

880
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,040
I know they meant that they learned this

881
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,840
while talking on the phone,

882
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,600
but I like to imagine they mean literally

883
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,560
after talking on the phone,

884
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,200
the brother was like, oh, oh, oh, facts coming in.

885
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,520
Check the facts.

886
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,440
One more addendum.

887
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
I always sit down to have wet dreams.

888
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,160
That's not true.

889
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,120
Do you guys want Yahoo?

890
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,900
Yes.

891
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
This Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Blocker.

892
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,520
Thank you, Jacob Blocker.

893
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Heartbroken Kid.

894
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Aw, jeez.

895
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,640
Heartbroken Kid asks in the etiquette subcategory,

896
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,600
flushing food in the toilet?

897
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,080
So my boyfriend was raised to flush food down the toilet,

898
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
and of course I wasn't.

899
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,600
I told him.

900
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Sounds like your parents are doing some A-B testing.

901
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,720
I told him I do not approve of flushing food

902
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,040
and I do not approve of that

903
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,840
and all the reasons why it is wrong and not safe,

904
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,000
but he continues to argue with me about it.

905
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,840
I told him if we move in together,

906
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,440
I do not want that going on

907
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,480
and says it's our place, I'm allowed to,

908
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,840
and I don't care.

909
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,640
What should I do?

910
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,600
I told him, Will, with all the petty stuff

911
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,720
I put up with you, you can't do that simple task.

912
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,520
Yes, I know, actually researching people do this,

913
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,720
but he is the first I met.

914
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Gross as bad as what's already going on in the toilet.

915
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,040
That's debatable.

916
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,200
You don't know what I'm capable of in there.

917
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,760
Sometimes when we do these Yahoo Answers,

918
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I upset myself because I don't just disregard it

919
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,840
immediately, I sit there and go, well, hold on.

920
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,960
Are we talking about such and such or such and such?

921
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,720
So I'm listening to this question saying,

922
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,160
are you talking about he finishes eating

923
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,800
and there's some leftovers on the plate

924
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,840
and rather than go to the kitchen,

925
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,920
he walks into the bathroom

926
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,640
and scrapes his plate in the toilet?

927
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,480
Or are you talking about like,

928
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,160
oh, he dropped some goldfish crackers on the ground

929
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,840
and rather than go to a trashcan,

930
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,680
he was next to the toilet and just threw them away?

931
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,880
I just Googled it as a thing, guys.

932
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,840
I'm reading a blog post now called

933
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,920
A Case for Not Throwing Food in the Toilet.

934
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,520
Why do we need a case?

935
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,280
Why do we have to get fucking litigious

936
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,200
about this thing?

937
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,840
It's against God's law.

938
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,880
So wait, Griffin, I hate to ask you

939
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,320
to sacrifice yourself like this,

940
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,440
but tell me more about what you found from Google.

941
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,880
Here's an argument for a case

942
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,600
for not flushing food in the toilet.

943
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,960
Flushing food creates clogs.

944
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,880
Yeah, dog, when you put your fucking heaps of spaghetti

945
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,440
in the toilet, it's not gonna work anymore

946
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
because it's not a garbage disposal, it's a toilet.

947
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,160
You also run a terrible risk of flushing food

948
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,600
down the toilet, walking out of the room,

949
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,640
it doesn't flush properly.

950
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,760
You come back in two hours later and think,

951
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,680
what the fuck did I do?

952
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,960
What in the whole fuck is stains full of dude fingers?

953
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,640
I have done that before with,

954
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,560
I'll empty out the last of a Coke or something

955
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,200
down into the toilet while I'm cleaning up,

956
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,920
and I won't flush it because that seems like a waste,

957
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
it's not pee-pee or anything,

958
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,420
and then I'll come back in an hour and think,

959
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,000
oh my God, what has happened to me?

960
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,480
Do you think that that's a gateway drug

961
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,160
to putting food in the toilet, Justin?

962
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,400
It might be the first step, so yes,

963
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,280
in terms of what a gateway drug is.

964
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,200
I also have to call out, on Friday I went to use

965
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,200
the bathroom and saw a giganto thing of hair

966
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,820
that had been pulled from the hairbrush

967
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,760
that my wife had tossed into the toilet

968
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,760
and not the trash can, which is right next to that option.

969
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,160
She had one thing that can definitely clog

970
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,680
if you put enough hair in it, and then a trash can,

971
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,920
and she went for the thing that you could definitely clog,

972
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,600
so I had to get into the pee water to fish the hair out

973
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,000
to put in the trash can,

974
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
because I can't afford a plumber right now, I got a baby.

975
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,880
My name's Dave Barry.

976
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,600
Yeah, Jesus Christ.

977
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,640
Thanks.

978
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,700
I've been Ray Romano, this has been my stand-up comedy

979
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,000
podcast mid-everbody loves, Raymond.

980
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,040
I guess I just don't understand,

981
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
unless you're eating in the bathroom,

982
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,760
why is this morgan, why is...

983
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,020
Nop, nop, nop, done, bloosh.

984
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,740
Is that what you're saying?

985
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,540
I couldn't possibly, I'm stuffed,

986
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,540
I couldn't possibly sploosh.

987
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,840
I can't understand why you sit there and go,

988
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,860
I know this is the best option, this is what I wanna do,

989
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,240
to the point where your girlfriend says like,

990
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,380
hey, when we move in together, don't do that anymore,

991
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,860
and he's like, don't try to change me.

992
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,740
I mean, what's the fucking, what is the fucking argument?

993
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,340
I pay rent here too, and if I wanna put my leftover steak

994
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,820
in the toilet, I will.

995
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,460
The craziest thing here is the pushback, really,

996
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,460
because I think we're all waiting to get busted

997
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,940
for whatever we're doing in the bathroom.

998
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,220
We're all assuming that we're doing it wrong anyway,

999
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,760
and if someone calls us on any specific thing,

1000
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,460
we will instantly change.

1001
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,180
If someone kicked in the door like,

1002
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,560
no, you're supposed to wipe side to side,

1003
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,400
I'd be like, fuck, 27 years I've been doing this wrong.

1004
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,300
God damn.

1005
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,220
I like that there's a part of this Yahoo Answers question

1006
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,900
that's like, and with everything else I've put up with,

1007
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,180
I ask for this one thing and get pushback.

1008
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,040
What else is this guy doing

1009
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,080
that this is the minor petty thing?

1010
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,420
He's cheated on me 96 times.

1011
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,620
He sold my dog for weed money.

1012
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,460
That's cool.

1013
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,740
I've made my peace with that.

1014
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,540
He sold my dog for dog money?

1015
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,580
He sold my weed for dog money

1016
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,940
and did not make a clean profit.

1017
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,100
Just stop putting Nabisco brand vanilla wafers

1018
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,220
into the toilet, that's all I'm asking.

1019
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,660
My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year now.

1020
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,460
Things are going great, but there's one issue

1021
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,820
that people keep bringing up to me.

1022
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,740
Only about three photos of myself

1023
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,000
and my girlfriend together currently exist.

1024
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,820
We just aren't big picture people

1025
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,540
and I don't even have a decent photo capable,

1026
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,300
decent photo capable camera or phone readily available.

1027
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,860
Should we be taking more photographs?

1028
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,460
I'm gonna assume they meant photo capable phone

1029
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,860
as opposed to a photo capable camera

1030
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,420
because I think that's pretty high on the list.

1031
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,660
I also wanna say you could probably

1032
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,580
have just a decent camera.

1033
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,420
Is this a camera?

1034
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,260
I'll get you, but anyway.

1035
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,020
Is a decent camera or photo capable phone readily available?

1036
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,140
Should we be taking more photographic evidence

1037
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,980
of our relationship's continued existence

1038
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,060
or am I getting worried over nothing?

1039
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,660
Pictureless in Pennsylvania.

1040
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,820
This is actually something I've been thinking about a lot

1041
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,700
with like the baby I've been taking.

1042
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,660
I don't know how many pictures

1043
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,820
you're supposed to take of your baby.

1044
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,960
I take a lot of pictures of my baby,

1045
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,500
but a lot of times recently I've been thinking

1046
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,460
about like stuff will show her as she gets older

1047
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,060
and like I don't have any pictures for my honeymoon,

1048
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,900
I don't think.

1049
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,580
Like I don't think we took any pictures.

1050
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,020
Here's the thing, it's also like Teresa and I,

1051
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,380
until we got married, there were only in existence

1052
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,820
like two printed out photos of us.

1053
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,100
And I think what it is is we live together

1054
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,060
and we've lived together for almost our entire relationship

1055
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,140
and like we see each other every day

1056
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,340
so it just never occurs to me like there's no photos of us

1057
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,420
because we're like together.

1058
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,500
But like my friends that like live all over the country,

1059
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,100
then I sit there and go, ah, it's nice to look

1060
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,900
on this picture of my brother so I don't see every day

1061
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,380
or my friend Justin who I don't see every day,

1062
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,220
my friend, you know.

1063
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,020
Do you look at a picture of us every day and just like?

1064
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,300
I have a picture of you two right by the front door

1065
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,500
so that every time I leave the house, I think about you guys.

1066
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,740
You just look and you think,

1067
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,140
you just think your thoughts about us?

1068
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:10,980
Yeah.

1069
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,800
What picture is it, Jeff?

1070
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,580
It's the you and Griffin, I think on like a subway

1071
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,940
or something and some kind of train together.

1072
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,940
And like you're leaning forward

1073
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,380
and it's a very cute picture of both of you

1074
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,100
and I look at it and I kiss it as I walk out.

1075
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,420
And I see like. Where do you kiss it?

1076
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,540
I kiss it square on the face.

1077
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,620
Slow down.

1078
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,740
Okay, both of you.

1079
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,580
I will.

1080
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,100
ASMR, ASMR, please.

1081
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,340
I kiss both of you on the face and I take turns

1082
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,380
as who's gonna be the first one each time I do it

1083
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,220
and then when I come.

1084
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1085
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,380
You're welcome.

1086
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,220
And then I come home and say,

1087
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,740
I'm sorry I let you down again.

1088
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,940
I'll get him next time, I'll get him next time.

1089
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,260
Tomorrow for sure.

1090
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,780
And when I say leave the house, I walk down to the corner

1091
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,780
and just stand there for 30 seconds and walk back

1092
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,100
so you guys will think I'm trying to do something out here.

1093
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,420
Anybody wanna put me in a movie?

1094
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,740
Tomorrow for sure.

1095
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,860
There hasn't been a single movie filming on my block yet.

1096
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,100
We love it.

1097
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,940
But I'll get it.

1098
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,620
I'll get it for you guys.

1099
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,260
I'm not talking to you.

1100
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,500
Griffin, do you know that I tried to get Travis.

1101
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,460
I tried to get Travis to go to Utopia

1102
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,860
so he could be on that show.

1103
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,360
Oh, fuck, Travis, you would have been great.

1104
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,200
You gotta.

1105
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,340
You can visit.

1106
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,300
You can visit Utopia and here's the thing about you.

1108
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,140
Okay.

1109
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,460
We can't, we can't, we keep teetering on the edge.

1110
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,460
Quick, super quick.

1111
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,740
Utopia is a reality TV show about people trying

1112
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,940
to forge a new community together.

1113
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,220
It's amazing.

1114
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,620
But they let people visit, right?

1115
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,380
And they film it because they're filming 24 hours a day.

1116
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,740
This is a situation that is bizarre to me

1117
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,740
because people have come in and inserted themselves

1118
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,580
into the romantic lives of these people.

1119
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,100
There's a gentleman who's a beekeeper

1120
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,700
who just came to sell them some bees

1121
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,540
and ended up on the show.

1122
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,940
And this seems very treacherous to me in California

1123
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,300
where people could drive it from LA

1124
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,220
and if you are crazy enough

1125
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,500
and if you do something noteworthy,

1126
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,180
you will end up in the TV show.

1127
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,340
That seems irresistible.

1128
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,540
I don't understand why there aren't more people

1129
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,060
just getting buck wild in that place.

1130
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,420
Yeah, I imagine the waiting list has to be

1131
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,980
pretty long at this point.

1132
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,380
How many pictures, okay, but see,

1133
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,580
the other side of this is what if you walked

1134
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,540
into someone's house and they just had 30 pictures

1135
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,500
of themselves and their partner

1136
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,620
just as soon as you walked in the door

1137
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,860
and they were all from different poses

1138
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,460
and different outfits and they're like,

1139
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,420
this is our documented love.

1140
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,500
Well, nobody has that.

1141
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,340
That's what I'm saying.

1142
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,300
So how many pictures do you need?

1143
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,420
I say that if you're in a long-term committed relationship,

1144
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,540
you've been dating for about a year now,

1145
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,300
you're fine because the next thing that happens,

1146
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,340
I mean, really, not to freak you guys out,

1147
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,660
is you get married and then they document

1148
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,740
the fuck out of it and then you're good forever.

1149
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,580
That's it, you super get that one.

1150
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,420
Yeah.

1151
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,100
Like you super definitely 100% get that one.

1152
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,140
To the point where it is weird if you don't.

1153
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,500
Like people will comment if you don't document

1154
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,780
the shit out of your wedding.

1155
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,820
So it's like, okay, great.

1156
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,500
Now, Teresa and I went from having two pictures of us

1157
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,820
to having like 200 pictures of us.

1158
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,700
A billion.

1159
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,220
And it's like, okay, we're good.

1160
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,940
I actually keep a reserve of those

1161
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,260
that you guys have not seen.

1162
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,780
And every like five years or so,

1163
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,220
I'll drop another 20 and we'll all remember,

1164
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,140
we'll all talk about it.

1165
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,860
Oh, it's so cold, but the food was so great.

1166
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,340
It was the most beautiful wedding I went to that year.

1167
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,140
Well, I mean, yeah.

1168
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,460
There were other weddings that you ever saw were notable.

1169
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,380
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

1170
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,420
I think it's a tricky problem

1171
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,580
because it's not something that you can do anything about.

1172
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,500
Other people have to take the pictures of you.

1173
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,420
You cannot, you can't.

1174
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,500
We just got back from our honeymoon.

1175
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,900
We took almost no pictures.

1176
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,780
I mean, we didn't take pictures of ourselves at all.

1177
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,940
We had to get other people to do it.

1178
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,820
It was occasionally incredibly awkward

1179
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,860
because once we climbed to the top of a mountain

1180
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,100
and asked a gentleman we did not know to take the pictures.

1181
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,820
And then he stood there for a while

1182
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,460
while we waited for the couple who was taking pictures

1183
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,380
at the sightseeing point

1184
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,980
that we wanted to get our picture taken at.

1185
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,820
And eventually after about 30 seconds or so,

1186
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,020
the man said, my tour group is gone.

1187
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,860
That was a pretty cool time.

1188
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,100
It's like, that's what I'm talking about.

1189
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,460
That is the kind of social issue I run into

1190
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,580
whenever I try to get people to take pictures of us.

1191
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,420
Yeah, I think you're good.

1192
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,180
I don't think this is the thing you want to force

1193
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,620
or try to make happen.

1194
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,860
Or else you might as well just like hire a photographer

1195
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,100
and say like, hey, would you do like a session with us

1196
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,540
and take photographs?

1197
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,820
Could you have an open marriage

1198
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,620
and the third person is a photographer?

1199
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,460
There you go.

1200
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,380
There you go.

1201
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,060
I really liked our wedding photographers.

1202
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,020
Did you really, really like them?

1203
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,460
I've seen them at a couple other weddings.

1204
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,500
Like open marriage like them?

1205
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,780
I've seen them at a couple other weddings

1206
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,620
and they remembered us.

1207
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,020
So I'm just gonna put that out there.

1208
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,940
Okay, just play it cool.

1209
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,980
Don't rush it.

1210
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,020
Yeah, I hope they're not listeners.

1211
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,820
Statistically speaking, they're probably not.

1212
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,900
On November 30th, I'm headed down to Cozumel, Mexico

1213
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,780
to attempt my first Ironman triathlon.

1214
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,540
That's 2.4 miles swimming, 112 miles cycling.

1215
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,500
Oh, so this person's full of shit.

1216
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,340
And 26.

1217
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,180
Nobody's ever done this.

1218
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,620
That's something I've never been able to do.

1219
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,440
I've been training hard, but I'm still nervous.

1220
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,040
It'll be grueling, no shit.

1221
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,300
The race will take 12 to 16 hours to complete.

1222
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,600
What are you doing?

1223
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,100
Do you have any motivational phrases or race tips

1224
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,280
I can use to get through the day?

1225
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,420
Not so far.

1226
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,900
Every edge I could get.

1227
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,180
That's Chris from Arlington, Virginia.

1228
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,020
Oh, geez.

1229
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,060
Carve it.

1230
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,180
Carve that racist butt up.

1231
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,460
Okay, you have to do one of the three of these.

1232
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,100
Doing all three is unthinkable.

1233
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,500
You have to do one of the three of these.

1234
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,960
Which would you guys pick?

1235
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,660
You know, I would say not swimming.

1236
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,500
No, fuck no.

1237
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,380
Because that seems like a thing

1238
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,180
that if you get exhausted in the middle, you die.

1239
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,700
You die, you would die in it.

1240
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,000
I would definitely die at the running too.

1241
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,140
I think the cycling, I would get very sick.

1242
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,140
How much of it is downhill?

1243
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:44,980
I don't know, but it's-

1244
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,300
112 miles downhill, I think I could do it.

1245
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,220
That's the one thing about 112 miles in your cycle,

1246
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,660
you can take some breaks for coasties in there.

1247
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,900
You can get some coasties to try to like reacclimate.

1248
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,560
And you are sitting.

1249
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,460
So that's nice.

1250
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,180
It's also just occurred to me that I really hope

1251
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,660
that this whole triathlon is like a circle

1252
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,660
or else when you finish, it's 16 hours later

1253
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,100
and you're like a full three hours drive away

1254
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,360
from where you started.

1255
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,200
And you're like,

1256
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,200
oh, how do you get back?

1257
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,300
Maybe the best we can provide in terms of motivation

1258
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,140
is just telling you that it's impossible.

1259
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,700
And so with every step you take,

1260
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,100
know that you're defying both us

1261
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,940
and the laws of nature and physics.

1262
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,420
So this is your friends and my brother and my brother

1263
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,740
me telling you it cannot be done.

1264
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,620
Can't be done.

1265
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,660
No one, you're gonna, no one's crossing that finish line.

1266
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,440
No one man has ever finished an Ironman challenge before.

1267
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,900
You know what's funny about that?

1268
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,140
It would be way harder to do if you were Ironman.

1269
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,900
Like really hard, especially the swim.

1270
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,400
I don't think you make it 30 seconds in the swimming

1271
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,240
if you're Ironman.

1272
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,100
You would have to have a super strong bicycle

1273
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,460
to hold up the weight of the suit.

1274
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,500
And then you're gonna run.

1275
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,380
And like, you're not allowed to use your blasters.

1276
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,220
Like you have to run.

1277
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,180
No thrusters.

1278
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,740
I saw that note.

1279
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,580
Yeah.

1280
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,140
Running, you're gonna leave a bunch of holes in the ground

1281
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,220
cause your suits are really heavy.

1282
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,720
Shouldn't this be called the Iron Person Triathlon?

1283
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,940
It absolutely should be called the Iron Person Triathlon.

1284
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,780
Or it should be called

1285
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,940
the Iron Imaginary Person Triathlon.

1286
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,420
Cause nobody can do that 12 to 16 hours.

1287
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,260
I had a 10 hour flight that I sat through.

1288
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,140
I took two naps and I watched the Amazing Spider-Man 2.

1289
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,340
It sucked dick.

1290
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,540
And when I got off the plane, I was exhausted.

1291
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,620
It can't be done.

1292
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,940
How much money would you guys pay

1293
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,540
to participate in a triathlon?

1294
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,140
Now hear me out.

1295
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,020
All the triathlon is, is it's on an undisclosed location

1296
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,020
that only the quote participants are told about.

1297
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,840
You get to hang out in like a bunker for 12 hours.

1298
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,500
Then they spritz you down with water

1299
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,140
and you get to come out like real sweaty

1300
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,620
and be like, I did it.

1301
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,940
You do a half mile of cycling.

1302
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,960
You do 120 feet of the watermelon crawl.

1303
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,380
And then they will give you a certificate that says like,

1304
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,060
I definitely did this.

1305
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,340
And then you get a bus ride back.

1306
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,980
That's the third leg.

1307
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,820
And everybody gets a participation ribbon

1308
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,220
and you get like a photoshopped picture

1309
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,620
of you like running through like the ticker tape at the end.

1310
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,460
No, you won't.

1311
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,140
It's photoshopped because you can't even run like four feet.

1312
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,140
It's gonna be your head on the body.

1313
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,500
You actually just lay down on a bed

1314
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,380
and raise your arms above you and look exhausted.

1315
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,660
And then they remove the bed and stand you up.

1316
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,820
And stand you up.

1317
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,860
They photoshop you next to Usain Bolt.

1318
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,100
He's got his arm around you.

1319
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,100
This guy can run.

1320
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,540
There's a speech bubble in the photoshop.

1321
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,380
This guy's a running fiend.

1322
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,500
Everything I know about running, I learned from Steve.

1323
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,900
The one condition I would need

1324
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,660
if I was gonna do an Iron Man triathlon

1325
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,980
or an Iron Person triathlon, if you like,

1326
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,220
is that at the end,

1327
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,520
I would need there to be complimentary pizza and pop.

1328
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,260
If I got like halfway through

1329
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,100
and I knew that waiting for it at the end

1330
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,860
was complimentary pizza and my choice of soft drink,

1331
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,940
I think I would be able to push through to the end.

1332
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,740
I'm gonna sweeten the deal and motivate.

1333
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,300
Here's the motivation for our listener.

1334
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,580
At the end of the race,

1335
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,300
there's complimentary pizza and pop,

1336
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,300
but there's not enough for everybody.

1337
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,680
And I heard they were running out.

1338
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,500
And you're racing against a bunch of hunky boys.

1339
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,420
Here is my no bullshit offer to you,

1340
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,180
Chris from Orleans in Virginia.

1341
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,600
If you complete the Iron Man triathlon

1342
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,740
and you send us a picture of you completing it

1343
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,440
along with your mailing address.

1344
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,140
No Usain Bolt Photoshop shitty bullshit.

1345
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,040
No bullshit.

1346
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,820
If you finish this race,

1347
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,100
I will send you a complimentary,

1348
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,740
through delivery, complimentary pizza

1349
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,480
and two liter of your choice of soft drink.

1350
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,800
I am guaranteeing you free pizza and pop

1351
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,500
from my own wallet delivered to your door

1352
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,780
if you complete the triathlon,

1353
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,200
but believe me, you'll have earned it.

1354
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,280
Free pizza and pop.

1355
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,260
There's the motivation.

1356
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,080
Go get it.

1357
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,880
And let's push it even further.

1358
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,660
We will extend this offer to the first person

1359
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,420
who sends us this thing.

1360
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,820
And it has to be, I need you to have a sign,

1361
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,660
like holding a sign.

1362
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,760
It's like M-B-M-B-A-M and date it.

1363
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,380
Cause I don't want some old Iron Man triathlon photo.

1364
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,340
I want a new one.

1365
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,420
The first person to complete an Iron Man triathlon

1366
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,660
and send a picture with something denoting it as for us,

1367
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,180
I will send you complimentary pizza.

1368
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,980
And don't do your own Iron Man triathlon.

1369
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,400
It has to be an official event.

1370
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,060
Don't just like, while you're listening to this episode,

1371
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,540
be like, I gotta go and start swimming.

1372
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,920
Don't just start swimming.

1373
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,020
You need to be in water.

1374
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,580
At the end, you will be lost.

1375
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,980
I can guarantee you that.

1376
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,180
All right, so that's gonna do it for us here

1377
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,100
on my brother and my brother and me.

1378
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,980
We hope you had a good time.

1379
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,460
Got some fun news for you.

1380
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,020
If you didn't hear in the last episode

1381
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,240
or on our various social media channels,

1382
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,680
we are doing a live show in Huntington, West Virginia,

1383
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,660
our hometown, Huntington City Hall, December 21st

1384
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:58,140
at 7 p.m. with Sawbones,

1385
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,140
the medical history podcast I do with my wife, Sydney.

1386
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,400
We are gonna do a live recording

1387
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,020
called My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

1388
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,020
Home for the Candle Nights, A Holiday Spectacular.

1389
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,380
You can get tickets to that.

1390
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,780
Yeah, they're super cheap, 15 buck ticket,

1391
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,780
and you can get them at mbmbamcandlenights.brownpapertickets.com.

1392
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,460
We've had some people ask,

1393
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,740
how far is reasonable to travel in from?

1394
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,460
And I'm not here to answer that for you.

1395
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,100
You gotta look in your own heart.

1396
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
But I know that there are people flying in for it.

1397
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,820
There are people driving in and out of Chicago.

1398
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,040
I know, we have sold tickets from as far away as Chicago.

1399
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,660
Lindsey and Davin that work at Max Fun Friends,

1400
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,900
they have bought tickets,

1401
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,900
and they live here in California with me.

1402
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,740
Oh, shit.

1403
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,900
Yeah, and so I will say it's gonna be a great show.

1404
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,940
It's gonna be super fun.

1405
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,580
We're really excited to do it.

1406
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:55,260
So I think anybody who comes is gonna have a great time.

1407
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,300
We're gonna find some things to do in Huntington

1408
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,280
either before or after, or maybe both.

1409
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,900
There's a lot of places that are closer

1410
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,020
than you would think.

1411
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,860
Lexington is two hours away.

1412
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,180
If you're in Morgantown, it's about three hours.

1413
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,020
Pittsburgh is about four.

1414
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,620
I think people in Morgantown, West Virginia

1415
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,460
know how far away they are from Huntington.

1416
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,380
Fair enough.

1417
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,060
Louisville's three hours.

1418
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,460
Nashville's like five, I think.

1419
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,060
We have some people coming in from Nashville.

1420
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,140
Tickets are selling faster than we expected.

1421
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,980
We're not sold out yet,

1422
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,180
so that you still have a chance to get them,

1423
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,660
but do not wait.

1424
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,500
Make sure you get them,

1425
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,140
especially if you're planning to travel in

1426
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,580
and you're making those travel plans now.

1427
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,600
Go ahead and get your tickets before they sell out.

1428
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,440
And send any questions.

1429
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,040
If you need some travel recommendations,

1430
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,300
I put some up on my blog, Justin McElroy,

1431
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,540
what is it, JustinMcElroy.wordpress.net,

1432
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,860
I think, or wordpress.com,

1433
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,460
where I recommended some things to do

1434
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,580
in Huntington while you're here.

1435
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,620
There's also an event page on Facebook

1436
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,820
where I've posted that link,

1437
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,460
and you should go say that you're gonna come to the show,

1438
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,540
and you can see that and make plans,

1439
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,360
meet up with people.

1440
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,200
There's a lot to do here.

1441
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,420
There's a lot of fun stuff going on,

1442
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,140
so I think it's gonna be a fun weekend.

1443
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,320
We're probably gonna plan some other stuff around that event.

1444
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,460
If you wanna send anything to the West Coast HQ,

1445
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,340
it's P.O. Box 34-1769,

00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,020

00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,400
If you wanna send something to me,

1448
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,820
it's P.O. Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia 2706.

1449
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,360
We got one from Jason,

1450
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,820
and he sent us his band's album.

1451
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,280
The name of the album is Endless Dicks.

1452
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,120
I got a repurposed birthday card from Mary.

1453
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:32,960
There we go.

1454
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,940
And we got, I got some games from,

1455
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,720
I'm gonna look that up while Justin talks

1456
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,980
about something else.

1457
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,580
Okay, I will talk to us about our Facebook group.

1458
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:49,420
It's at, just search for My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1459
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,500
It's there, you'll find it.

1460
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,000
It's not hard, but it's a booming community

1461
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,960
full of people that love you.

1462
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,300
Also, wanna say a big thanks to Nature Box.

1463
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,060

I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

1467
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,500
for the use of our theme song Into Departure

1468
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,980
off of the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1469
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,000
It's really, it's fantastic tunes, man.

1470
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,620
We got, this is what I got.

1471
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,500
I got a Shakespeare role-playing game

1472
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,060
and a slash fiction role-playing game

1473
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,820
from Games by Playdate.

1474
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,960
So at Games by Playdate sent us those,

1475
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,460
and they look really cool, and I can't wait to play them.

1476
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,140
They also made the Sawbones game, they sent you one of those.

1477
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,500
Ooh, really?

1478
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,580
Yeah, the Sawbones card game, it's fun.

1479
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,500
Trav, we got a YouTube channel.

1480
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,700
It's YouTube.com slash NBNBAM.

1481
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,160
We have a new cartoon up there about scarecrows

1482
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,980
that you should go watch, and Trav's making bits

1483
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,460
for you to go, if you could subscribe to that,

1484
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,340
and then just like send the link around to your friends.

1485
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,780
And if you are Adult Swim and you wanna make our cartoon

1486
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,820
into a TV show, just go ahead and do that,

1487
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,180
and just send us a check or whatever.

1488
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,180
Also, I wanna say I'm sorry that housekeeping

1489
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,600
is so long these days, but we just got a lot of irons

1490
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,100
in the fire, because we love you,

1491
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,940
and we wanna keep doing stuff for you and with you

1492
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,140
and just having a great time, so sorry about that.

1493
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,020
If you wanna skip it, it won't hurt my feelings,

1494
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,740
but you shouldn't, because you never know

1495
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,060
what you might miss, like new merch at maxfunstore.com.

1496
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,080
That's just more housekeeping.

1497
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,440
That's just more out of the same.

1498
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,220
You might miss more housekeeping.

1499
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,740
What's our featured Max Fun Show of the Week?

1500
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:26,460
I wanna feature Song Exploder, it's so, so, so good.

1501
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:31,460
It's Rishke Sherway, who busts out the different parts

1502
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,060
of songs with the bands who did them,

1503
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,060
did an episode with Onomataguchi on the song Prom Night,

1504
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,940
which is fucking fantastic, and Onomataguchi talked about

1505
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,020
this group called Capsule that Rachel and I got really into

1506
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,940
while we were in Japan.

1507
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:50,500
Kinda wanna make it, I love the long winter theme song

1508
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,200
we have now, but these J-pop tunes are so fucking fresh.

1509
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,140
So check that out.

1510
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,900
I may do my own podcast that has Capsule as a theme song,

1511
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,820
and I talk about Vore all day.

1512
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,760
And I think that there's a very specific audience

1513
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,260
that would get very into that.

1514
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,660
So anyway, yeah, go listen to Song Exploder, it's great.

1515
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,500
They talk about music parts in Vore.

1516
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,960
Excellent, that's good deal for us.

1517
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,220
I think we're probably fucking done.

1518
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,380
Yep, this following IHU was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1519
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,800
Thank you, Drew, it's by Yahoo Answers user J Rock,

1520
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,300
who asks, how can people laugh when they see someone

1521
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,540
with a wallet chain, but they cry when they lose

1522
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,540
their wallet?

1523
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,380
Yeah.

1524
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,500

01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,540
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1527
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,780
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

May You Kiss Your Dad, Square on the Lips.

1529
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:39,340
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say, may I water?

Hi, I'm Julie Sabatier, host of Destination DIY.

1534
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,380
It's a show about people taking matters

1535
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,040
into their own hands, and we're really excited

1536
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,260
to be bringing it to Maximum Fun.

1537
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,220
You know, having that experience of I can do that

1538
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,300
makes me feel like I can almost do anything.

1539
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,140
Here at Destination DIY, we like to push

1540
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,560
the do-it-yourself envelope beyond crafts

1541
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,020
and home improvement.

1542
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,840
So tune in to hear the stories of makers, builders,

1543
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,500
inventors, and all kinds of creative people.

1544
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,420
You can essentially build a do-it-yourself space program

1545
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,220
today, and now luckily I'm a part of that.

1546
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,820
Check out Destination DIY at Maximumfun.org,

1547
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:54,820
or wherever you like to listen to podcasts.
