1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,920
A wonderful Candle Nights countdown is on to Candle Nights. We've got just ten more

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,080
Candle Nights days till Candle Nights. A lot of people seem to be asking when it starts

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,880
and when it stops. There are obviously more than one day involved in Candle Nights. Can you guys

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
offer any insight? By the way, this is my brother, my brother-in-law, I'm Justin, that's Travis and

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,400
Griffin. Hi! I think that the beauty of Candle Nights is that it starts when you feel like it,

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,680
and it ends when you don't feel like it anymore. The way that I track Candle Nights, and it's an

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,440
elusive beast, is with my handy Candle Nights Advent Calendar, which oh, I need to actually

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,280
pop open the current day on. Let me give it just, sorry, one sec. It's another condom.

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:44,160
Oh man. This is like the 22nd one. This is Candle Nights, this is on our Candle Nights show,

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,240
we'll be recording that live in Huntington, West Virginia. You can tell the difference. December

15
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,760
21st. You can tell the difference because we're not fucking cussing this one. It's one week away,

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,640
less than six days now. By the time you're listening to this, if you want to come out,

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,120
come down to Huntington. There's some tickets left. Go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights live.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,880
Come on out. It's going to be a real special time. Everybody's going to be there. Literally

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,920
everybody. O.J. Simpson. O.J. Simpson? That was the first one. That was the first name. Yeah, but

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,360
O.J. Simpson too. What's wrong with me? That was like my poll. You're broken inside. I think I

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,600
might be broken. O.J. Simpson's going to be there. Kato Katelyn's going to be there.

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:37,040
All the hits. All the great folks are going to be there. Orenthal, James Simpson. He's O.J.

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,240
also. He's also O.J. Simpson. And the Simpsons. We're going to have people dressed as the Simpsons.

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,000
And J.O. Simpson. I hate that dude. He's my least favorite of the Simpsons.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,760
He's worse than the double murderer. Wow. Not a cool dude. You can at least be in the same room

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,520
as the double murderer. You know what I mean? With J.O. Simpson, there's a lot of detritus.

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,520
This is our advice podcast. This has been such a thrilling week. Before we get too much further,

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:21,360
I want to thank everybody who... We had a sort of an impromptu charity drive called NBNB AM Angels,

29
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,720
where we tried to fill a bunch of empty stockings from the Herald Dispatch. They

30
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,440
published the thing called empty stockings. And we got it in our heads that maybe we could help

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:44,720
some of those folks. And You Find people really rose to that call. There were 101

32
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:57,520
people on the list. And at this point, 93% of them have had their needs met by You Find folks.

33
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,280
So thank you so much to everybody who participated in that. You're awesome.

34
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,160
I don't understand people who make... Because here in Austin, everybody makes a career out of working

35
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,880
at a nonprofit. But as far as I can tell, it really just takes eight minutes to change the

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,200
lives of an entire city. So what the hell are you guys doing with the other... Stop wasting your time

37
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,320
and just fix these problems. Just fix them. It takes eight minutes. Just fix all the cities.

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,040
The MBM family did. They looked at this issue and they're like, let's fix this together.

39
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,240
Next year, we're going worldwide. Huntington's great, but we're gonna see if we can't shine...

40
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
No, I wanna make Huntington even better. I wanna really...

41
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,120
Next year, we're gonna get all the MBM Angels together to fix the roads in Huntington.

42
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,360
Next year, just come out with a shovel. That's the new thing. But anyway, thank you to all of

43
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,200
you folks. We're gonna record some thank yous after we're done recording here. And if you don't

44
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,680
get yours in a week or so, you probably didn't email us. So email us at mbm at maximumfund.org.

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,640
And we'll fix you up. And sit around for... After halftime of this episode,

46
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,200
we have a very special guest. Oh, man. Do you wanna say who it is?

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,640
They probably figured it out, because it was in the show notes.

48
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh, yeah. If not, it's Bill Corbett. He is a wonder.

49
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,480
He was really funny, too. Yeah, he was funny. Anyway, that's a big show we got coming for you.

50
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,880
But first, we're gonna do some of our classic stuff.

51
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,800
Real patented MBMBA and goofs. Get ready for some classic material,

52
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
because we're gonna take your questions and turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom. Here we go.

53
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,280
I recently visited a friend of mine who just bought his first house.

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,360
I know Justin and Griffin are homeowners and Travis moved to LA, but I don't know if he rents.

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
I do. It's none of your damn business.

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,000
How different is home ownership from renting an apartment? Is it worth it? And what should

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,240
I know beforehand? That's Jeremy in the Seventh Circle of Dwell, which is pretty good.

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,880
I've never been a homeowner, so I cannot speak to this. I can speak to the renter side of it.

59
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
I enjoy renting immensely. Okay.

60
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:24,400
But see, we can smoke all fucking day long in our house. We can just rip open a carton of marbles

61
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,800
and just crush the whole box in one day and be like, fuck it. The windows are yellow,

62
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
and it stinks in here. It smells like an Elk's Lodge.

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,600
Griffin, have you ever thought of just tearing open both ends of the carton and just lighting

64
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,280
all of them at once and smoking a giant harmonica?

65
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, I don't do that, no, but I will just rip it,

66
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,400
ignite it, and then just have a grandma potpourri. You know what I mean?

67
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:59,760
Mm-hmm. It's really the final level of adulthood, and you may think that you are ready for it when

68
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,160
you actually buy a house. You are not ready for it, because it's still very bizarre to me that

69
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,160
there are whole areas in my house, if I open a door to them and I look at them, I don't know

70
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,160
what they do. I don't even know what they are or why they are. I had a thing-

71
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,320
Do you live in the Winchester house? What are you talking about? You open a door to a closet,

72
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
you're like, what is this?

73
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,760
No, I'm talking, okay, I'll give you an example. A couple of weeks ago, I went down to turn the

74
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,680
furnace on for the first time. I guess it would have been a month or so ago now. I go down and

75
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,680
turn the furnace on for the first time, and I see this thing called a humidifier that's sort of built

76
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,480
into the system there, that as far as I know, I've never used. And I was like, whoa, I could be

77
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,720
having more humid air this whole time, but I didn't really know how it works, so I kind of

78
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,160
turned some things and opened a valve and did all that kind of business, and I was like, hmm, okay,

79
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,280
humidity, oh boy. I go down three days later, my basement carpet is fucking soaked, like literally

80
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,400
standing water in my basement carpet, water everywhere, because this thing just, apparently

81
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,480
it's like humidifying jam, it's just spitting water randomly, and so I ruined my house. So you

82
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,720
just boarded up the basement and you called that one a loss? Yeah, I don't have that room anymore.

83
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
It really is a weird- It's like we're in an island.

84
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,440
It really is weird, like, how many times have you been in your attic, Justin?

85
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,200
Twice a year, once to get the Christmas lights out and once to put them back.

86
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,160
Okay, I've been in our attic twice, once when we, like right when we moved in, and then again when

87
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,480
our HVAC unit up there stopped working, and that was after that we had roofers come and replace

88
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,640
every single shingle on our roof a month after we moved in. Home ownership fucking rules, you guys.

89
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:55,600
And I realized that in nailing those new shingles in, they had turned our attic into a fucking

90
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,200
hellraiser pain box, because there are infinity nails coming through the ceiling. It's like a

91
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,160
goddamn Iron Maiden up there. So no, I don't think I will ever be going into that room again, thanks.

92
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,240
What on earth were you planning to do about your broken HVAC unit when you went up there?

93
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,920
Did you think there would be a switch that said broken and you would just flip it to fixed?

94
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,280
Like, is that what you were hoping for? He was gonna reason with it.

95
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,800
I went up there, I was using my phone's flashlight, and I had a fucking

96
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,800
hex wrench from an IKEA cabinet I had bought. Were you ready to do battle with it?

97
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
I was seeing what I could do up just surveying the, you know what?

98
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
Yeah, honey, I tightened a couple of hex bolts and it started working again. Apparently just all

99
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
the hex bolts were loose. You're laughing? I used that fucking hex wrench to fix our

100
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,680
garbage disposal. So you don't know anything about shit, do you? It is the universal nano tool.

101
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,480
So what does this person need to know before they get a house?

102
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,160
Please realize, like, you don't know. Be prepared to be reverted to baby state,

103
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,080
especially with buying a house. That process is inscrutable. I still don't know if I bought this

104
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,680
house. No one's gotten rid of me yet. Our realtor would just come to us like,

105
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,520
hey, I need $300 for the... And I'd be like, yep, here you go. Take it. It's yours now.

106
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,680
I never had that money, I guess. Were you buying the house from the ancient ones?

107
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,560
Yeah, it was a deep tongue. I got a really great deal on this house,

108
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,120
but except for that the walls are full of rats. Yeah, and the seeping floors.

109
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, that's Justin's. Oh yeah, I would say from my money, I'm so happy being a renter.

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Teresa and I have often considered home ownership, but I don't know. I think what's always scared

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,600
me most about it is the permanence. And I know you can always sell your house,

112
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,840
but in this market, it seems like such a permanent decision.

113
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,360
Oh, this market. The problem with renting is that you're just putting your money into a shitter,

114
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,040
and you're shitting on it, and then you're flushing it. It's insult to injury.

115
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
How were you paying your rent? Huh?

116
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
Is that how you were paying your rent? I pay it to my landlord, Mr. Toilet.

117
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
Yeah, it's an investment, Travis, in yourself and your family.

118
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Yeah, now I live in Los Angeles, where it costs $2 million to get the smallest home ever.

119
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,600
Right, but you get that, and then next year's worth $3 million. You just need that initial

120
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
investment. And if you need help with money, Travis, I've always told you this, you can come

121
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,040
to me. You'll give me $2 million?

122
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,720
I will give you, I could probably break you off a couple Gs.

123
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Okay. But that's, you know what? You put that in a jar. You guys want a Yahoo?

124
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,680
Absolutely. This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

125
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,040
Rachel Sperling, recognize that game. Take your game, take a minute, and recognize it.

126
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,520
Thank you, Rachel. Ladies, get to know your game.

127
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mahalkita, Mahalkita, I think that's a Pokemon, who asks,

128
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,720
should men start wearing cock pieces as a fashion accessory again?

129
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,960
I think you've missed it. I think you missed the word a little bit.

130
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,360
A little bit. You were off by a little bit. Additional details, would you wear one?

131
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,720
A cock piece?

132
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,360
A cock piece?

133
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,440
Should men start wearing dick flaps again?

134
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,720
No.

135
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,640
No, you shouldn't. But should we?

136
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,560
I will say this, having worked at the Shakespeare Company, like, every time, there's something

137
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,640
about it that when you wear one of those, you tend to strut. Like, it's hard not to just leave.

138
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,880
Wow, that's because your gait has an extra flap there that you didn't plan for when you woke up

139
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,520
that morning.

140
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,080
You do have to have very wide thighs, or else you will chafe on your codpiece.

141
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,480
One of my favorite examples, Jeremy Dubin, every time we had a student matinee in a show that had

142
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,920
codpieces, he would have to get up first thing, just go out and give everyone a solid minute and

143
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,880
a half to laugh and just get it out of their systems so then they could enjoy the show.

144
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,440
But he had, I don't want to put him on blast on our incredibly popular radio broadcast,

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,960
but he had, let's call it, an abnormal cod.

146
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,920
Yeah, and the things he could do with it, it was like puppetry of the penis.

147
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,880
Did you guys know that cod is actually Middle English for scrotum? It's not a joke,

148
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,600
that's a real thing.

149
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
Wow, learned something new today.

150
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,120
Something really useful.

151
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,840
So when you call someone a codfish, like Peter Pan does, you're calling them a scrotum fish.

152
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,040
Basically, yeah.

153
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,400
Oh, Peter Pan.

154
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,440
Peter Pan, how could you?

155
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:48,400
Can we bring this, listen, the new school of thought for manliness, which is such garbage

156
00:13:48,400 --> 00:14:00,000
bullshit, with fucking fashion axes, everything is so terrible and so dumb, I could see, listen,

157
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,720
if you really want to accentuate your masculinity, put this little parachute over your dick.

158
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,320
I could totally see that becoming an actual thing.

159
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,440
And if you think about our current dress, am I gonna have a codpiece on my jeans?

160
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,120
On my jean shorts? Oh, fuck, that's a look right there.

161
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
Yeah, that's a lot of look.

162
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,640
I sewed a codpiece on my utilikilt.

163
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
That wouldn't even work because then it would become pants again.

164
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,000
I accidentally turned my utilikilt into pants.

165
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,640
Into pants with a weird dick part on it.

166
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,360
I feel bad.

167
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
What is a codpiece?

168
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,280
Oh, Justin, we've been doing the whole bit.

169
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,400
You should have asked us.

170
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,240
We've been doing this for two and a half minutes.

171
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
You were too embarrassed.

172
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,800
I was hoping that through your context clues, I could weave a picture.

173
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,360
It kind of looks like a canoe of fabric that you put over your junk.

174
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Men used to wear hose, right, hosiery.

175
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,240
Yeah.

176
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,560
But it didn't really do a great job in that zone.

177
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,480
And so, like, when dudes started to, like, when they would sit...

178
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm reading a...

179
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,720
This is from Art of Manliness, which, like, great.

180
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,360
I love that I've given this website my business.

181
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,640
When dudes would sit down with these hos, their tunic would ride up.

182
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,360
And it's like, hey, ho, my cod is out, is what they would say.

183
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,320
Oh, goodness, my...

184
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
Oh, goodness, my cod.

185
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,200
Huzzah, my dick.

186
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Huzzah.

187
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,600
Behold, my cod.

188
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,240
And so they began to cover up their cod with a little dick tunic.

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,360
And it was just a little piece of linen that just sort of wraps around it like a little...

190
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,280
A pup tent.

191
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,640
Okay.

192
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Can I just jump back real quick to say that if on the website, the Art of Manliness,

193
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,640
like, if it doesn't just say, like, I don't know, be like a person,

194
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,240
just do whatever you want, then that website is dumb.

195
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,760
Man, my Art of Manliness, you know, my secret to the Art of Manliness,

196
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,200
you just flex when people aren't expecting you to.

197
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Now, Jaisalyn, could you name a situation in which you would flex,

198
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,520
in which people were not expecting you to, and suddenly it would be very positively all about you?

199
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,080
DMV.

200
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:24,960
Okay.

201
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,440
Why the DMV?

202
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,320
Because people walk past you, like, that dude is stacked.

203
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,760
That dude's ripped for days.

204
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,680
That dude is manly as hell.

205
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,960
And look at that cod piece.

206
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,400
Oh, there's a...

207
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
He's selling it.

208
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
There's a picture on this article.

209
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,960
There's a picture on this article from Batman and Robin.

210
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,520
No, okay.

211
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,880
Do you think that it's like, you know how when people get really flashy,

212
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,840
like sports cars and everyone's like, oh, compensating for something.

213
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,240
Do you think, like, the baller move with a cod piece is to get, like, just...

214
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,440
A really little one?

215
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,760
Yeah, the smallest cod piece, like, I don't even care.

216
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,120
I don't fucking care, whatever.

217
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,800
Yeah, this is my tiny dick.

218
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,040
One that is so small that you actually have to tuck your actual physical material zone.

219
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,800
It's a false flag zone.

220
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,240
Your corporeal zone.

221
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,440
Right, and then someone comes up and stabs you in it, and you're like, nothing.

222
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
You did nothing.

223
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,560
Better luck next time.

224
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,080
Where did his dick go?

225
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,880
You'll never know.

226
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,240
Smooth like a Ken doll down there.

227
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Check my butt, and then you look at the butt.

228
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,600
What is that?

229
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
It's a rear cod piece.

230
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
You fool.

231
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
You've fallen for my false flag.

232
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,240
I've got cod pieces for days.

233
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,360
My false flag cod.

234
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm gonna stab that one.

235
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,240
Right armpit.

236
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
Holy shit.

237
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,760
He's cod's toe to tip.

238
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
This guy's all cods.

239
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,680
It's like a house of mirrors.

240
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
You just keep shattering them, and there's more.

241
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,720
It's like a house of lies with Kevin Spacey's cod piece.

242
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
House of lies is not the name of this.

243
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,840
I think it is.

244
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
I think that's the Don Cheadle show.

245
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,360
Damn it.

246
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Man, I could have made a reference to Don Cheadle's cod piece, and it would have been great.

247
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,360
You could have made so many references.

248
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,040
I could have made all the references.

249
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,320
Another question, hit it.

250
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,640
A coworker of mine recently started sporting a single black glove on her left hand every day.

251
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,120
Is there a polite way for me to find out why?

252
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,800
Fashion statement, medical issue, aspiring magician?

253
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,840
I need to know.

254
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,440
Initial details.

255
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
It looks like a one size fits all cotton glove.

256
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,720
No embellishments or markings.

257
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,800
As from ANSI in Austin.

258
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,600
Can I tell you what this coworker is doing right?

259
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,640
Create an air of mystery.

260
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,760
Yeah, for sure.

261
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,240
Is it possible that somewhere under that glove is a cod?

262
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,680
Possibly.

263
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,360
For days.

264
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,160
For days.

265
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,240
I love this idea because if it was flashy and showy, if it was like a sequined glove

266
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,200
or like covered in rhinestones or shit, like you wouldn't be that in,

267
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,560
but there's something about just the plainness, the unadornment.

268
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,320
Like you're not trying to draw attention to it.

269
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,880
You're like, I have to know why are they doing it?

270
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,720
Because it's clearly not to draw attention and yet it is drawing attention to me.

271
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
Take a lesson, everyone.

272
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,080
This is how you do it.

273
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,000
This is how you affect something.

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,240
This is a real like gateway to becoming fully a mysterious person.

275
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,600
And some people have already gone so far down this road that a glove wouldn't raise an eye.

276
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,880
If you saw Prince walking around LA, perhaps shopping in a candle store,

277
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
and you saw that he was wearing a black glove on one hand,

278
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,640
you would not give it a second thought.

279
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
You would think, oh, it's Prince.

280
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,800
But there's another dude who could also just start wearing a codpiece

281
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
and no one would be surprised.

282
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,280
Well, yeah, he could start wearing a codpiece and probably-

283
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,400
Start wearing a codpiece?

284
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
I mean, you gotta ask, right?

285
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,560
That's why they're wearing it.

286
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,600
Well, there's two situations.

287
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
They're either wearing it because they want you to ask

288
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
or because they explicitly don't want you to ask.

289
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
Are they trying to hide the fact they have six fingers?

290
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,960
Can I just say, like, wouldn't it be crazy if this person was like,

291
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,080
oh, I got engaged last night, so I'm going to wear this glove

292
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,320
and then someone's going to ask and it's going to be a big reveal.

293
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,040
And this has been going on for three weeks and no one's asked.

294
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,080
Someone please just ask, my pinky smells terrible.

295
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,840
Please just ask me so I can do the review.

296
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
Why is everyone so afraid of asking?

297
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,640
I feel like you have to ask now or it may already be too late

298
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,920
because if you wait too much longer,

299
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,840
you're just going to walk up and go, what's with the glove?

300
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,960
What's with the glove?

301
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Because you've held it back for too long.

302
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
They're dying for you to ask.

303
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,720
Oh, they want you to ask so bad.

304
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,920
Just ask them.

305
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,080
Just ask this one question about the glove.

306
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
What if they've been waiting this whole time to ask

307
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,720
and on the, like, the palm of the glove is written,

308
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
talk to the hand and they're just waiting.

309
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
Oh shit, like what?

310
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,480
It's a great bit.

311
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,360
It's a power play.

312
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,120
It's a long, it's a long game.

313
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Is it a power glove, perhaps?

314
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
Is it maybe a power glove?

315
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
Are they going to maybe play some rad racer after work?

316
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,200
Or catch ball.

317
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
That was an NES game, I think.

318
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
I think it was called catch ball.

319
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,960
Catch ball.

320
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
How about another Yahoo?

321
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
Man, what if black glove is like a thing that's like worldwide

322
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,920
and we don't know it because we're just like not keyed into.

323
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,160
Like it's a red hat kind of thing?

324
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,640
No, I don't think it's red hat kind of thing.

325
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm saying like it's a legit protest about issues.

326
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,560
Oh.

327
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,280
Oh.

328
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,000
Not an LA lady social group.

329
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,800
Probably not.

330
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,240
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

331
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,120
Please.

332
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,840
This Yahoo was sent in by several people,

333
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,200
including Anthony Delacurty and Sean Moran.

334
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,480
Thank you, everyone.

335
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user whatever.

336
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,520
Who has the most Yahoo points I've fucking ever seen.

337
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,160
78,053 Yahoo points.

338
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,680
Fucking get out the game.

339
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,040
Retire, you're done.

340
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,480
And the highest one goes to whatever.

341
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,280
Whatever asks, what would happen to our world

342
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,080
if all of a sudden potato chips stop being made?

343
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,760
Whoa.

344
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm saying that this is going to lead to a complete and total

345
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,840
shutdown.

346
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,080
Just a decimation of our society.

347
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,640
Sometimes you just need that crunch.

348
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,600
And no corn products, no rice products are gonna fill the bill.

349
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
I mean, the fact of the matter is, as soon as one thing goes away,

350
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,800
even if you're like, there's still pretzels,

351
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
but as soon as you tell everyone like,

352
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,920
everything else still fine, still plenty of everything else,

353
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,360
but there's no more potato chips,

354
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,400
everyone then is going to instantly want potato chips so badly.

355
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
You're disrupting the ecosystem, right?

356
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,240
Like we have to eat potato chips.

357
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,120
Humans do.

358
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,680
Because the potato chips eat the M&Ms.

359
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:49,920
Right.

360
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,800
And if there's no more potato chips, first of all,

361
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,840
M&M of our population is going to kill us all.

362
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
But that won't matter because we're all going to die anyway

363
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,680
because our main food source is now gone.

364
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,880
You know what that means?

365
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,720
That the leopard seal is gone because we're fucking dead.

366
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
And they eat us.

367
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,840
They have to eat us.

368
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,080
Yeah.

369
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
Because of that, they also eat penguins.

370
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,040
Penguins are going to be all over the place.

371
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,320
Going to be penguins and M&Ms.

372
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,160
It's going to be the best apocalypse ever,

373
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,840
but we're not going to be around to enjoy it.

374
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
Because we ran out of potato chips.

375
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
Because we ran out of crisps?

376
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,600
We don't have any more vitamin Pringles.

377
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,880
Now, here's a question that I would have for you.

378
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
If potato chips in this world-

379
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,440
Crisps?

380
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,200
If potato chips aren't crisps, sorry, are no longer made,

381
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,680
are we to assume that french fries are still extant?

382
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,800
And if so-

383
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,440
Ooh.

384
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,080
Aren't people like smashing them with a hammer

385
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
and then putting them in a fryer later and just-

386
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,440
They do that.

387
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
This is such a good question, Justin.

388
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
Is it that we've suddenly forgotten the existence

389
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
of like how to make potato chips,

390
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,680
or is it like they've all been beamed off the surface

391
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,000
of the planet?

392
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,400
No.

393
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,560
Because if we fucking forgot how to make potato chips,

394
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,920
somebody would fucking figure it out in like half of a second.

395
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,240
Like, ah, these french fries are too thick.

396
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
I gotta fry these things.

397
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,600
But that's the question.

398
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
Are we talking like they're no longer being made

399
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,880
or they no longer exist?

400
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
Oh, you're talking about in this situation

401
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
where you stomp down some french fries,

402
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,120
throw them in a fryer,

403
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
you pull up the fryer basket and it's empty.

404
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,160
It's empty.

405
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,040
Where did they go?

406
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,160
The Happening 2, starring nobody.

407
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,280
Nobody agreed to do it.

408
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:24,960
What is it?

409
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,480
No actors.

410
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
Just no chips?

411
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
No, I have to turn this one-

412
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,120
I have to turn this one down.

413
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,040
Did you guys hear about the Sony leak

414
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,680
where they were thinking about making The Happening 2

415
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,880
where we did all the potato chips?

416
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,960
Nicolas Cage was like, this is-

417
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
Sorry, this is my first time saying the word.

418
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
The word, no.

419
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,160
I'm gonna Morse code tap it out of the table.

420
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,480
Potato, just, I love potato chips,

421
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
but this is just too, this is a bridge too far.

422
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,160
I probably said I'm too busy doing Drive Angry shot in 4D.

423
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,880
So-

424
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,920
Where you can smell it.

425
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,800
You can smell it.

426
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,320
And we have potato chips in the picture,

427
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,160
so I'm gonna do that.

428
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,360
I signed a non-compete.

429
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
It's produced by Lays.

430
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,880
How fast would technology evolve

431
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
if the potato chip didn't exist?

432
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,960
How fast-

433
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,400
Because we have so much time in our hands

434
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
because we're not just fucking chomping?

435
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, we've been dropping stuff constantly

436
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
because of the grease and the salt,

437
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
and now we can actually hold our Bunsen burners

438
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,240
and beakers and such.

439
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,480
Science accoutrement.

440
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,640
My fingers are delightfully non-bloated.

441
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,000
Let me type out some code.

442
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Oh, world hunger's gone,

443
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,440
which is weird because there's no chips.

444
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,800
So like, what's the point?

445
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,600
But I guess if you want to eat shitty garbage-

446
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,160
Would taro chips still exist?

447
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,080
Would you still be able to eat taro chips

448
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,720
and like-

449
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
No, Justin, that's how you tell the future.

450
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,600
It's stupid.

451
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,320
Okay, what about this?

452
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,120
Would Tato skins, the potato chip-

453
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,000
Those would survive.

454
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840
From potato skins, would that still exist?

455
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,640
Those would survive and let's just say,

456
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,120
invest in Tato skin stock right now.

457
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,240
What about Pringles?

458
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
It's just like compressed potato flakes.

459
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,960
Come on.

460
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, actually, legally speaking,

461
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,840
they can't call those potato chips.

462
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,280
They have to call them crisps

463
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,560
because of Big Potato made it so they had to do that.

464
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,080
So they would probably survive and uptick.

465
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,720
Melissa Pringle, heiress to the Pringles empire,

466
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,440
is actually doing 25 to life in jail

467
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,480
because she just wouldn't stop calling them chips.

468
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,600
That doesn't-

469
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,320
Then they got her.

470
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,360
They found her in a spider hole.

471
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,920
They fucking got her.

472
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,160
It was a sting operation.

473
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Recently, a good friend has rapidly become my best friend.

474
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,400
He's like a brother to me now and vice versa.

475
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
As such, I've gotten him a book and a t-shirt for Christmas.

476
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
Nothing extravagant.

477
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,880
Do I need to give him advance notice

478
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,240
that I had gotten him something?

479
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,080
I don't want him to feel bad if I give him a gift

480
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,520
and he has nothing to give me.

481
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,160
Of course, getting presents is always fun,

482
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,400
but this really does come from a place

483
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
of wanting to avoid awkwardness and not greed.

484
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,520
Brothers, how can I give my friend a gift

485
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
without making him feel shitty?

486
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,880
That's from Altruistically at Sea.

487
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
You gotta tell him.

488
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
Yeah.

489
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,320
Okay, but how?

490
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
Hey, no big deal.

491
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,560
I just want to let you know that I got you a couple of things.

492
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,600
They're not super expensive,

493
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
but I just wanted to give you the heads up.

494
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,040
For me, where my anxiety tends to rear its ugly head

495
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,640
is in situations like this

496
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,000
where something that seemed like such a normal good idea,

497
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,880
but then I'm confronted with having to voice it out loud

498
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,760
to someone.

499
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,080
I guess the fear for me would be saying like,

500
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,640
hey dude, just no big deal, I got you a Christmas present.

501
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,240
And then their response being, why?

502
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,920
No, that's not, you're not gonna do that.

503
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,320
The best feeling in the holiday season

504
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,680
is getting somebody a good gift.

505
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,840
The worst feeling is receiving a gift

506
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,360
and not having that feeling of getting them a gift.

507
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,160
So don't do that.

508
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,400
Once you reach a certain age,

509
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,840
you gotta start thinking like that.

510
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,160
The gift you are giving them is the feeling of satisfaction

511
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,240
and giving you a stellar Christmas present.

512
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,560
We have emergency gifts on hand.

513
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,720
Just try that, have like a nice bottle of vino wrapped up

514
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,680
like you cared and then just get ready to give it to them.

515
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,200
But is there not something to be said

516
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
for like the idea of just if you feel this way

517
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
and you guys have become this friends

518
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,200
and you felt like getting him a gift,

519
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,600
like the faith and trust that maybe he felt the same way?

520
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
No, absolutely not.

521
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,480
No, that's the different society that you're living in.

522
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
You just described utopia, Travis,

523
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,760
and that show got fucking canceled

524
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,600
because of freewheeling ideas like that.

525
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,680
What if you made it a little more cash

526
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,720
than Griffin's suggestion?

527
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,240
You were like, I'd love to,

528
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
we need to get together sometime.

529
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,080
I've got a couple of things to give you in a big deal.

530
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,320
That just gives them some advanced notice.

531
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,120
You know what I mean?

532
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,160
I like that.

533
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,360
Thank you, I thought that was pretty good.

534
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,560
I like that a lot.

535
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,360
Can I elevate it?

536
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,640
Elevate it.

537
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,320
Why don't you tell them,

538
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,800
I feel like we are best friends now.

539
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,280
I feel like we have been elevated to best friend status

540
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,120
and I looked online and they said the best friends

541
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,320
get each other Christmas presents.

542
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
And you're human society.

543
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,640
And then you have elevated it

544
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,440
because then you've also given them the gift of saying,

545
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,320
I'm your best friend.

546
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,160
When was the last time either of you said to anybody,

547
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,280
I'm your best friend?

548
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,000
I rarely tell other people where my status is in their life.

549
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,080
Hey, listen, buddy,

550
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
I'm the best fucking friend you've got in this situation.

551
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
Look around you.

552
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,560
This is the best deal you're gonna get.

553
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,880
You know, I'm not gonna lie,

554
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,520
you know what we need right now?

555
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,480
To tell each other that we're each other's best friends.

556
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,960
Yes.

557
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,160
Let's go in a circle.

558
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,400
Okay.

559
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm both of your best friends.

560
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,200
Well, you can't have both.

561
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,960
No, you can only have one, choose.

562
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
It's not how the superlative works.

563
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,080
I'm Travis's best friend.

564
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,560
God damn it.

565
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,600
I'm Justin's best friend.

566
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,480
That sucks.

567
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
No, you messed up.

568
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,880
No way.

569
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,240
I'm just being honest.

570
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
I like Griffin a lot.

571
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Griffin's like my second in command.

572
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,880
Oh, but that's second best friend.

573
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,440
Oh, that's good

574
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,920
because I didn't get either of you guys any fucking Christmas presents.

575
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,880
You're my third best friend.

576
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
Griffin, you're my third best friend.

577
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,680
My first one is Hank Mardukas.

578
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Hate that dude.

579
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Although, can I tell you something?

580
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,840
He's also my best friend.

581
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,240
That dude's gonna be swimming in Christmas presents.

582
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,040
Let's go in a circle.

583
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:25,520
Fucking Hank Mardukas. I hope you die, Hank Mardukas.

584
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,040
You're my best friend, but I hope you die.

585
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,040
Two words.

586
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,320
Hank Mardukas.

587
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,440
Mardukas.

588
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,480
No, two different.

589
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,200
Going on Safari on you, Hank.

590
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,320
Hank Safari, two words.

591
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,240
No, the two words are free snacks.

592
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,720
Did you guys ever play the Nintendo 64 game Hank Safari?

593
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,800
The gameplay was a little bit rote,

594
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,400
but the graphics were really ahead of their time.

595
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,760
They really realized Hank in a lot of really great polygons.

596
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
But potato chips don't exist anymore.

597
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,120
You've got to eat something delicious and wholesome.

598
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,720
And you can get exactly that from naturebox.com.

599
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,800
These are snacks with no artificial flavors or colors or sweeteners.

600
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,400
There's no trans fat, no high fructose corn syrup.

601
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,280
It's wholesome.

602
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,720
Salt of the earth type stuff.

603
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,200
You can feel good about giving your family

604
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,960
or hiding individual pieces in an advent calendar.

605
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,320
I just got a new box yesterday.

606
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,120
Dang it.

607
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,440
Yeah.

608
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,120
And I got some Kung Pao pretzels.

609
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
What does that even mean?

610
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,960
Oh, they got like, what they taste like is like really good,

611
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,400
really like quality ramen on pretzels

612
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,920
with a little bit of Asian spice.

613
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,560
So good.

614
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,520
That sounds delicious.

615
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,480
Just awesome.

616
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
These are, there's even snacks on there

617
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,440
that don't have added sugar or gluten ingredients.

618
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
I know we're always talking about the peanut butter nom noms,

619
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,040
but it's as fun to say as it is to eat

620
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,880
and bake sweet potato fries since potato chips don't exist anymore.

621
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,600
You can eat those.

622
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,840
That's available to you.

623
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,520
That's a good stop gap.

624
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,920
Justin, how much would one of these boxes cost our listeners?

625
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,360
Free, you impeccable man, you free.

626
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Free, not a red dime.

627
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,320
Free snacks.

628
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,160
Those are the two words I want you to keep in mind.

629
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,800
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

630
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,080
Every single week we hear from listeners who said,

631
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,320
thank you, I'm sorry I waited so long.

632
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
Fuck these snacks are good.

633
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,480
Thank you for hooking me up with these free snacks.

634
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,160
We packaged these ourselves.

635
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,880
We hand packaged these free snacks just for you.

636
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,280
I coat each nom nom in delicious peanut butter one by one.

637
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,880
Each one takes me six minutes.

638
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,840
So do the math.

639
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
Hey, here's an idea.

640
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,800
You should sign up for this.

641
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,640
Get it in time for your holiday party.

642
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,200
Put them out as like little snack nauseous.

643
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
We have no way of knowing that's possible.

644
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,040
Well, I mean, I'm just saying if you could

645
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,240
or for a new year's party.

646
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,040
Yeah, or for a mid January party.

647
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,720
But put them out, you're gonna look

648
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,560
and people are gonna be like, you get these at Trader Joe's?

649
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,120
Where did you get?

650
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,520
And be like, nope, I got them at nature box.

651
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,880
And then you can tell them to go to naturebox.com slash my brother

652
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,320
and then you're just spreading the word, the good word.

653
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,080
If every person on earth went to naturebox.com slash my brother

654
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,160
and got a free box of delicious snacks,

655
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,000
that's the kind of worldwide change

656
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,480
that I want to bring to the world all the wide around it.

657
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,320
It's time we take down big potato.

658
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,160
If you wanna take down big potato, you're gonna need some money.

659
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,840
They have a lot of lawyers on hand,

660
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,000
but you decided you're gonna put a stop

661
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,520
to their starchy shenanigans and you're gonna need a war chest.

662
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,720
So it's hard to get money.

663
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
It's hard to borrow it.

664
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,480
Nobody's got any money in the world,

665
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,240
but if you need to borrow money, somebody else might have some

666
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,240
and you can get a low fixed rate loan at prosper.com.

667
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,240
You can borrow up to $35,000 in five days.

668
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,680
Use the money for anything you want.

669
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,120
Pay off high rate credit cards.

670
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,960
Fix up the house for the holidays.

671
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,720
Stop big potato.

672
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,440
It's weird that they put that.

673
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
It's weird that they put that in the notes.

674
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,480
That's prescient of them.

675
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,360
Wait a second.

676
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,760
They've also mentioned Frankenstein's dick.

677
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,720
They are the one.

678
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,840
How did they know about that classic future bit?

679
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,360

691

All personal loans are made by web bank,

692
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,840
a Utah chartered industrial bank,

693
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,080
member FDIC, equal opportunity lender.

694
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,740
Justin?

695
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,680
He's having an asthma attack.

696
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,400
Kevin, do you have some messages?

697
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,200
Yeah, real quick.

698
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,680
Got a message for Alex and Aubrey.

699
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,200
Double your pleasure.

700
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,680
That's a little stinger I came up with

701
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,360
for when a message is for two people.

702
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,360
Perfect, a stinger.

703
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,080
That's what we need.

704
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,160
We need to direct more music in this show.

705
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
Okay, well, this is great because it's from Jazz.

706
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,240
Who says,

707
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,200
that's a saxophone.

708
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,880
Jazz says, happy birthday, Alex and Aubrey.

709
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,000
Here's a list of out of context inside jokes.

710
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
Entrepreneurial.

711
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,880
Wow, that's a fucking word, isn't it?

712
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,560
It's more than a half, man.

713
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,680
Entrepreneur.

714
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,440
God, entrepreneur.

715
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,280
Now you're thinking about it.

716
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,320
I am, aren't I?

717
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,000
Entrepreneurial.

718
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,120
Did I get it?

719
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,480
Yep, got it in one.

720
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,960
Entrepreneurial pirate, mouth winking.

721
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,480
You're a stone cold fox.

722
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,960
The old man who talks about dead teens.

723
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,440
The colonies are in revolt.

724
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,560
Geno, or perhaps gino, gets in the pizza with you.

725
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,400
I'm so sorry everyone else, but hey, these are the jokes.

726
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,200
Love Jazz.

727
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,400
That's probably what it's like listening to my brother.

728
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,280
I skipped one.

729
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
Frankenstein's dick.

730
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,560
Got a message from Mr. Kelch from Kat.

731
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,040
And Kat says, Eric, ketchup needs to be refrigerated.

732
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,560
Why did you need a message for that?

733
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,600
Of course it does.

734
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,880
Eric, ketchup needs to be refrigerated.

735
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,320
Stop saying it doesn't.

736
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,840
And that it is better warm or there will be some divorce.

737
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,320
There we go.

738
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,840
Love your wife, PSJK on the divorce, but seriously.

739
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,680
Cold ketchup is the right ketchup.

740
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,080
I got some bowling alley french fries last night

741
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,240
because my life is a garbage.

742
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,320
And they-

743
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,120
Garbage body.

744
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,640
I have a garbage body.

745
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,320
I'm garbage all over.

746
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,400
I played foot golf yesterday and my glutes, my whole butt-

747
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,280
Excuse me.

748
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,240
It's called soccer.

749
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,480
Yeah.

750
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,680
Is foot golf just kicking the ball because you don't have a club?

751
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,320
You kick a soccer ball into the hole, like golf.

752
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,720
Okay.

753
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,600
But my glutes, my butt is garbage right now.

754
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
What was I saying?

755
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,160
Oh, right.

756
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,400
I had to eat warm ketchup and I wanted to die.

757
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,360
I'm saying the divorce, it sounds sad

758
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,440
because it sounds like you've worked a really hard time

759
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,160
on your guys' love and it's an investment and it's special.

760
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,920
But you got on the right thing.

761
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,640
You got to toe a hard line against these fucking monsters.

762
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,240
Oh my God, guys.

763
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,480
Guys, we have talked about potato-based products

764
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
in literally every second of this show

765
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,840
and I'm so hungry for potatoes right now.

766
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,160
I would do terrible things to some potato.

767
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,920
A raw potato, I would eat like a golden delicious apple right now.

768
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Would you pluck off the eyes?

769
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,120
I would bite off the eyes, chew them up, swallow them,

770
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,760
and then I would eat the potato whole raw.

771
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,160
Okay.

772
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,400
Would you just, you would swallow it in one go?

773
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,560
Because right now we're in a big golf territory.

774
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,720
Trademark infringement.

775
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,080
I would just, hold on, wait.

776
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,640
Can we get, would it be a Mr. Potato head?

777
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,960
Because then that's some good for dog.

778
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,640
Yummy, yummy.

779
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,400
That's some good, good for.

780
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,200
This is all things considered.

781
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,440
This is 99% invisible.

782
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,360
We're listening to Pop Culture Happy Hour.

783
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,240
It's bull's eye.

784
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,800
The podcast Song Exploder does pretty much what its name suggests.

785
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Musicians break apart songs so you can hear the pieces.

786
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,440
Track by track, instrument by instrument.

787
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,960
How they were imagined, created, and built into a composition.

788
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,200
And all of these artistic decisions are packed into this 11 or 12 minute show.

789
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,800
It's really fascinating to hear them explain how they fit these pieces together.

790
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
The concept is simple but brilliant.

791
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680

793
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,600
Folks, your friends and my brother, my brother and me like to play experts on the podcast.

794
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:56,640
But sometimes our own knowledge, our own expertise has limits, believe it or not.

795
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,600
Even after 230 episodes, there are still things we don't know.

796
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,080
And in those situations, we call upon what we have cleverly titled,

797
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,440
in a handy bit of neologism, a guest part.

798
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,520
230 episodes, I think one thing that we don't know is when to stop.

799
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,280
Just when to like get out on top.

800
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,640
Just get out of the intro.

801
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,080
Our guest today is Bill Corbett from RiffTrax, MST3K.

802
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,640
Many other, a current playwright, songwriter, cruise director.

803
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,240
I'll keep going.

804
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,440
Power lifter.

805
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,560
Power lifter.

806
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Comic, comic book, funny, funny book, man.

807
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,320
What is the funny boy?

808
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,440
Comic book funny boy.

809
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,000
I like it, guys.

810
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,520
Bill Corbett, welcome to this program.

811
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,000
Thank you.

812
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,840
I am a comic book funny guy.

813
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,360
I'll embrace that.

814
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,040
We have questions.

815
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,920
Let's get right to them.

816
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,120
Let's help people.

817
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,640
Thank you, of course, so much for joining us.

818
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,760
Oh, my pleasure, you guys.

819
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,120
I love your podcast.

820
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,640
Your many podcasts.

821
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,400
Read it and weep, Ms. Williams.

822
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,680
Said we wouldn't amount to anything.

823
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,040
Aside from, I've been haranguing her lately.

824
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
I think three episodes I've mentioned Ms. Williams.

825
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,080
And I don't think she exists.

826
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,960
I think she's fiction.

827
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,720
No, because I believe she told me the same thing.

828
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,320
I remember her saying to me, do you

829
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
know how many people from Huntington, West Virginia

830
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,880
have ever gone on to succeed in the entertainment industry?

831
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,600
And I said, no.

832
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,000
How many?

833
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
She said, none, which is not true.

834
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
Not 100% true.

835
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,600
Yeah.

836
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,100
No.

837
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,520
She needs to be your next guest pert.

838
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,040
She's dead.

839
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,000
She's shaming.

840
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,120
Oh, is she dead?

841
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,160
She's dead, Bill.

842
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,360
Thank god.

843
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,040
How could you?

844
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,280
She can't get to you guys anymore.

845
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,960
Our most inspiring teacher.

846
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,880
I remember being in third grade.

847
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,040
She said, you'll never be on a podcast.

848
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,560
And that's a pretty good pull.

849
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah, 1993.

850
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,160
Wait, hold on.

851
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,720
Think about it.

852
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,320
I think we just found the evidence that we need

853
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,920
to overturn that one patent.

854
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
So let's circle back to that.

855
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,840
Now we got it.

856
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,480
We can't forget to circle back to that when we're done recording.

857
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,240
We'll be certain to email that patent troll.

858
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,800
Here we go.

859
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,440
Questions.

860
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,960
Aside from continuing to, quote, circulate the tapes,

861
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,480
what can I do to help foster the skill of riffing movies

862
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,280
in any future children I may have?

863
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,840
It's a skill that has carried me and less enthusiastic friends

864
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,160
through many a bad movie, whether in my school days,

865
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
dealing with my mom's hallmark movie binges,

866
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,200
or just because laughing at a bad movie seemed like fun.

867
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,720
Is the art of riffing something we can pass on,

868
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,960
or should I not worry about it

869
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,320
and just hope my kids take to it naturally?

870
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,880
That's from Zap Rausdauer.

871
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,280
Who, for those of you who know, that's a MST3K deep cut.

872
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,920
He was the hero of one of our movies.

873
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
I'm not even sure that qualifies as a deep cut.

874
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,400
That seems like the, that's that primo stuff.

875
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
I'm being modest on behalf of the old show.

876
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,480
Yeah, the future children.

877
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,240
Let's talk about the future children.

878
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,760
The potential, the at this point hypothetical maybe kids.

879
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
The twinkles in this man's eye.

880
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,600
This guy's priority, by the way,

881
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,000
for like of all the parent inquiries,

882
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,560
this is gotta figure out how to teach the kids to riff.

883
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,440
Maybe he's nailed down all the more important ones

884
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,480
and he's moving on to the refinement.

885
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,080
He knows how to talk to him about sex.

886
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,600
He knows how to talk to him about drugs.

887
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,840
But how do you talk to him about bad movies?

888
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,320
Got it.

889
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,040
Has the college education all lined up?

890
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,640
You know, I always think, you know,

891
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,240
it's just something to take to naturally.

892
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,160
I think he answered his own question here.

893
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,920
It depends on your goal really.

894
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,120
If you just wanna have a couple of laughs with your family

895
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,000
and you know, kids will pick up on your wise assery,

896
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,880
no doubt about it.

897
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,800
But if you're trying to get your career in movie riffing,

898
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,120
they don't exist really outside of about a dozen of us.

899
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,600
And it is a weird thing to do.

900
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,240
It's a weird thing to just sit there and painstakingly write.

901
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,760
You know, I flatter ourselves, but we do write

902
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,440
like an alternative comic soundtrack to a movie.

903
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,080
So it's more than just kind of hanging around

904
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,840
and making jokes, which is fun too.

905
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,960
We tried to do it for an educational short as like

906
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,000
a max fun bonus material that I think is still out there.

907
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,320
And Jesus Christ, that thing was like a minute and a half long

908
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,600
and it took us like a month.

909
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,880
It was like pulling teeth.

910
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,240
It is a bit laborious.

911
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,200
We are masochists first and foremost.

912
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,800
Do you take a dry run first?

913
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,040
That's basically just all of you shouting at each other

914
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,240
and then hone from there.

915
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,520
You know, we used to when during the old show days,

916
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,680
I feel like an old vaudevillian here,

917
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,800
back in the 90s, lads, at the height of vaudeville.

918
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,360
Comedy Central, also the comedy channel.

919
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,080
Well, we actually used to just sit in a room together

920
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,200
and look at the movie and just blurt out whatever.

921
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,360
It was like a mass tourette syndrome.

922
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,760
While one poor sap, one of us had to kind of just record

923
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,560
as we went.

924
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,200
And we took turns doing that to spread the pain around.

925
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,240
But now for riff tracks, we just kind of each write

926
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,600
about a quarter to a sixth of the movie in a first draft

927
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,720
and take a run at it and then try to mash it all together

928
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,040
in some Frankenstein-like first draft.

929
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,600
Over your years of riffing on terrible films,

930
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,200
whether it be Misty 3K and riff tracks,

931
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,320
are there any particular mistakes or just bad ideas

932
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,800
that you see repeated frequently?

933
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,680
And that's from Bevan Blocker, who

934
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,640
says that his name is pronounced Bevan like Kevin.

935
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,480
OK, Bevan, or Beevan, if I might.

936
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,000
OK, if we may be familiar for a moment.

937
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,560
I feel like we've grown close enough, Bevan.

938
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,640
Yeah, there's one.

939
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,160
I don't know if my colleagues are as obsessed about it

940
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,120
as I am, but the idea of the kind of do-nothing,

941
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,080
personality-less main hero, the protagonist,

942
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,880
usually a chunky white dude who's considered good-looking

943
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,840
by some standards of mostly like 1950s Hollywood.

944
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,920
I guess I'm thinking of that time in movie history

945
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,400
where you could just put a sort of bland-looking guy

946
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,760
in front of a screen, a six-foot-one white guy,

947
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,720
and just have him be the lead in your movie

948
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,960
and not have him really have any qualities

949
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,720
that are appealing in any way.

950
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,240
Except that he's there.

951
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,360
Except that he's there.

952
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
He occupies physical space.

953
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:09,600
Sure.

954
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,480
And he doesn't trip over his feet.

955
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,200
I mean, that's about it.

956
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,560
It's got to be the producer's like,

957
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,920
who's the most handsome guy we know?

958
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,960
Like, the most handsome guy we know in real life.

959
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,600
Right, right.

960
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,760
I always think it's who's the least weird-looking.

961
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,320
Like, no one's going to say anything.

962
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,120
They don't have that nose or those weird ears.

963
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,640
No one's going to be upset by his face.

964
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,840
I think that is well put.

965
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,360
Yeah, just a blank slate.

966
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,800
In the case of Zapp Rousder, though,

967
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,120
some casting director dropped the goddamn ball.

968
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,920
Oh, but he's great.

969
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
I mean, he's comparatively great.

970
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,600
At least he does something.

971
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,120
He drinks a lot of beer, first of all.

972
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:43,440
Sure.

973
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,400
Yes, but he also runs around and shoots guys.

974
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,520
I wonder if people who make and write video games

975
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,920
get a lot of their inspiration from that very bland,

976
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,640
milk-toast protagonist.

977
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,760
Because I don't know, you also just accurately described,

978
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,320
maybe without realizing it,

979
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,560
every video game protagonist is just like,

980
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,840
a dude who is just like,

981
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,440
that's the thing that holds the gun

982
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,640
that you shoot the guys with.

983
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,120
Right, right.

984
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,960
That's about all that you get out of it.

985
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Somebody asked the question on Twitter,

986
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,000
and it wasn't, sorry, quite good enough to make the cut,

987
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,200
but the question was good.

988
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,080
Take that.

989
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,680
The idea was great, which is,

990
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,320
now that watching bad movies has become

991
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
such a thing that people do,

992
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,280
there are directors and studios trying to make bad movies,

993
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,200
like a shark potato, that kind of idea.

994
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,360
And do you think that that is kind of like,

995
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,520
ruining, spoiling the recipe?

996
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,840
Because it's like, no, it has to be accidentally bad.

997
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,040
Yeah, I think you can tell the difference.

998
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,800
And I think people who go to Sharknado,

999
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,520
or Sharknado 2, know the difference.

1000
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,840
We actually did a live show of Sharknado,

1001
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,920
and we'll probably go on to Sharknado 2.

1002
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,360
But we have to sort of switch our gears a little bit,

1003
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,960
and sort of acknowledge that, yeah,

1004
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,800
they are trying to make a bad movie,

1005
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,040
and trying to have one over on us.

1006
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,840
So we just try to find a way around the edges there.

1007
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,760
But yeah, I mean, there are these pure uncut bits

1008
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,200
of bad movie making, like The Room, or Birdemic,

1009
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,880
that are just so great in the way that they're bad.

1010
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,920
Because you really, you almost could not imagine that.

1011
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,800
Someone just tried so hard, and failed so bad.

1012
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,240
And so beautifully.

1013
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,960
The Room, especially, I've probably watched that movie,

1014
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,840
no joke, and I think I'm in good company here,

1015
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,280
probably like 30 times.

1016
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah, I'm usually like half and half with riff tracks,

1017
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,480
and without, they're both really excellent.

1018
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,160
But I can watch without riff tracks,

1019
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,280
and it's like, I'm enjoying it.

1020
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,160
I don't know when my friend Dwight, one summer,

1021
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,240
got really into Billy Joel as a joke,

1022
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,240
and then the next year,

1023
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,960
he was super into Billy Joel like legitimately.

1024
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,080
It's the Billy Joel flip.

1025
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,040
And I think I made that switch with The Room,

1026
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,840
like I enjoy every second of it, it's terrible.

1027
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,240
Did you just compare Tommy Wiseau with Billy Joel?

1028
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,440
You monster.

1029
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,560
Is he Austrian Billy Joel?

1030
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,600
He's the something foreign Billy Joel.

1031
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,000
Let's not pin him down.

1032
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,840
Let's not pretend like we've solved

1033
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,520
the grand mystery of life.

1034
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,560
Mr. Corbett, you guys have done a lot of movies

1035
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,440
that would traditionally, with riff tracks,

1036
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,800
I think be traditionally considered to be good.

1037
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,640
Good films, even some great films.

1038
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,640
Is that a lot harder to write gags around those,

1039
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,880
or is it the same sort of form?

1040
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,760
Are you talking about The Apple?

1041
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,800
No, The Apple's another one, man.

1042
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,840
I love The Apple.

1043
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,720
Love it so much.

1044
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,040
I have to say, I'm with you.

1045
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,000
I watched that enough times, The Apple, enough times

1046
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,320
that I just fell into its spell.

1047
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,600
Some of the songs are really good.

1048
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,080
Yeah, they're super good.

1049
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,120
They actually are not bad.

1050
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,120
Wow, you have it right there, don't you?

1051
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,160
He really loves The Apple.

1052
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,760
He made me watch it.

1053
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,440
We watched that the night before Griffin got married.

1054
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,360
Yeah, I was like, no, it wasn't that.

1055
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,560
I was like super nervous.

1056
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,040
I was like nauseous for being so nervous.

1057
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,240
And Jess was like, I got what you need.

1058
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,120
It was that and beer, just like a lot of it.

1059
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,760
There you go.

1060
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,960
Anyway, good movies.

1061
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,720
Writing jokes about good movies.

1062
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,080
It took a while to adjust to that

1063
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,920
because we were never able to do them on the show.

1064
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,800
And people were kind of clamoring for us

1065
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,640
to do at least more mainstream movies.

1066
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,920
But then we decided to try a few that we actually kind of like,

1067
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,800
like The Lord of the Rings.

1068
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,400
I mean, collectively, we have more or less taste for them.

1069
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,280
But Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark.

1070
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,600
And then we really tried to underline it three times

1071
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,520
by doing what we called a riff tracks challenge

1072
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,880
by doing Casablanca.

1073
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,080
And what we wind up doing really is just joke, of course,

1074
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,800
joking less about the quality of the movie being bad

1075
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,920
because that would be a lie.

1076
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,440
And just sort of roasting it in the old Hollywood fryer style.

1077
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,600
And just finding almost like alternative narratives going on

1078
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,240
in the moment, just imposing it on them,

1079
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,200
whether they like it or not.

1080
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,600
Here's a question.

1081
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,560
I'm a writer myself, but I often find it hard

1082
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,360
to transfer rudimentary ideas from my brain to paper

1083
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,320
to be fleshed out.

1084
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:24,480
Do you have any specific process to get ideas out from within?

1085
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,960
That's from finding a flourish in Florida.

1086
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,720
Oh, well, you're already on your way

1087
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,800
with your mastery of alliteration.

1088
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,200
Nice.

1089
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,400
That's three Fs right in a row.

1090
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,120
There you go.

1091
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,280
Just keep up that, pal.

1092
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,600
That's a do a whole book of F words.

1093
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,120
There are so many writing teachers out there,

1094
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,440
and there's just so much nonsense.

1095
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,880
And I will probably give nonsense here as well

1096
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,200
because I just don't think it's one size fits all.

1097
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,360
But I can give you a general guideline,

1098
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,440
which is do it regularly.

1099
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,120
Just do it every day if you can or five days a week.

1100
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,400
And don't do it for long.

1101
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,880
If you're struggling with the real basics,

1102
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,520
like how do I sit my ass down and write,

1103
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,480
then just be disciplined, but be kind to yourself

1104
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,280
at the same time, which is the discipline part is making sure

1105
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,640
you show up every day and do some.

1106
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,120
The kind part is don't expect to do whatever that acronym is,

1107
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,800
the NaNoWriMo month.

1108
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,080
That was fun to watch you say.

1109
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,320
It felt really good.

1110
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,680
Travis, you're in the studio with Bill.

1111
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,520
Did he put some licorice in his mouth

1112
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,960
when he tried to say that?

1113
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,680
He looked like a dog that you put peanut butter in his mouth

1114
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,800
to make it look like he was talking.

1115
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,280
It was great.

1116
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,960
I quickly put peanut butter in my mouth

1117
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,400
while you were not looking.

1118
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,040
It was delicious.

1119
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,960
Yeah, I guess my point is just regular practice.

1120
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,720
There's nothing, there's no substitute

1121
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,600
for actually writing.

1122
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,960
You can't wait for ideas.

1123
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,160
You can't wait for inspiration.

1124
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,440
You just have to kind of do it.

1125
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,440
And the inspiration will come faster through that,

1126
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,360
which a lot of writers have said.

1127
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,760
My little part of it is that don't try

1128
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,720
to do eight or 10 hours at a stretch.

1129
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,520
You'll hate it.

1130
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,000
That's great.

1131
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,040
I mean, I need that advice.

1132
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,760
Thank you very much.

1133
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,080
More peanut butter, please.

1134
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,320
That's his reward.

1135
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:10,820
Thank you.

1136
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,240
We had Elizabeth Gilbert on the show,

1137
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,040
the author of Eat, Pray, Love, who said

1138
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,880
that you should never try to write in sweatpants

1139
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,120
and a shitty t-shirt.

1140
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,200
You should dress like a serious...

1141
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,800
Is that something that...

1142
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,440
Can you write in sweatpants and cozy wear?

1143
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,440
Or do you feel like you need to be

1144
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,960
a professional businessman?

1145
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,400
I have to dress in full tuxedo and tails.

1146
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,000
No, I respectfully disagree with Ms. Gilbert.

1147
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,040
I write in the shittiest clothes in the world.

1148
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,400
You weren't here first, folks.

1149
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,960
Beef between Bill Corbyn and Elizabeth Gilbert.

1150
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,720
Threadbare garbage clothes for me.

1151
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,560
The garbagerier, the better.

1152
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
I do like her eating and her praying and her loving.

1153
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,240
Travis, you know, as you were saying that,

1154
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,080
I looked down, I am wearing sweatpants

1155
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,880
and a Greetings from Tybee Island t-shirt

1156
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,240
with baby vomit on it.

1157
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,400
Yeah, that's just the Justin.

1158
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,080
It's actually not his baby, Bill.

1159
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,680
It's designer baby vomit.

1160
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,240
It just came that way.

1161
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,600
You pay extra for that.

1162
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,400
Pay a lot for this.

1163
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,680
Jock strap and a t-shirt.

1164
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,600
That's all you need to write.

1165
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,000
I meant to mention, I love your jock strap today, Bill.

1166
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,400
Thank you.

1167
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,280
I have a friend who absolutely hates the concept

1168
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,120
of laughing at bad movies.

1169
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,240
For instance, he considers watching a movie like The Room

1170
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,560
to be a massive waste of time when he could be watching

1171
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,760
something better, quote, like Transformers.

1172
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,520
Oh, come on.

1173
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,200
That's the whole of this, dude.

1174
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,920
You know, like Trans Brothers and Mr. Corbyn.

1175
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,760
How can we get this farcical flick Debbie Downer

1176
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,040
in the right frame of mind?

1177
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,480
Or is this a lost cause?

1178
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,640
That's from bad movie Buff in Brooklyn.

1179
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,600
Oh my God, with the alliteration in your listeners.

1180
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,400
We have a pretty savvy audience.

1181
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,480
This actually, this reminds me of the first time Griffin

1182
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,760
and I watched The Room with my now wife, Teresa.

1183
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,640
The look on her face was like a combination of like confusion

1184
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,600
and frustration.

1185
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,040
She didn't know why we did that to her.

1186
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,800
Yeah, she just kept saying, what is this?

1187
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,360
Why are we?

1188
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:23,920
No.

1189
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,040
I'm testing you, darling.

1190
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,080
Yeah, and it was like, get it.

1191
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,760
And she's like, no, no, it's bad.

1192
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,240
She's bad.

1193
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,400
And then we made her watch it like eight more times

1194
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,200
and now she loves it.

1195
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,640
Oh, sort of Stockholm syndrome.

1196
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,320
Yeah, I was very much like, you'll get it, honey.

1197
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,200
He's from Stockholm.

1198
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,760
We've cracked it.

1199
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,800
There is a real problem with the premise of this question

1200
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,560
in the Transformers message.

1201
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,880
I mean, I don't know where to go with that.

1202
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,720
Because if you don't enjoy The Room

1203
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,040
and you do enjoy Transformers, I don't

1204
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,960
understand you as a human being.

1205
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,600
It seems to me like maybe his through line,

1206
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,240
he doesn't like really good movies or really bad movies

1207
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,560
and he just wants it right down the center there,

1208
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,160
like milk toast, nothing.

1209
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,560
He likes the movie protagonist of 1950s version of movies.

1210
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,520
Sure, yeah.

1211
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,840
And he wants to be beat up by Michael Bay.

1212
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,040
Well, I mean, I guess there's, why would you try to force

1213
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,760
someone to do that?

1214
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,960
I guess to marry them if Travis is to be believed.

1215
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,640
But that's the only reason, as a weird dourer.

1216
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,960
I forget what the actual question was.

1217
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,240
I snagged on Transformers.

1218
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,600
How do you fix this broken person?

1219
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,680
The question, if you really break it down to like really

1220
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,240
parse it, is how do you get someone to like bad movies?

1221
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,320
And I think it's a little questionable as a premise.

1222
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,400
I mean, you're not supposed to, right?

1223
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,520
Well, but here's the thing.

1224
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,920
Because I was thinking about this on the way over when I got

1225
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,280
stuck in traffic, is the idea of I

1226
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,880
didn't start liking bad movies.

1227
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,600
I started as a kid watching MST3K with dad.

1228
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,080
Sure.

1229
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,560
And then through that, transitioning

1230
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,080
into liking bad movies.

1231
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,000
And I think that it's an acquired taste.

1232
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,560
It's a thing that's like, you can't show someone who's

1233
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:07,120
only seen current blockbuster quote good or bad movies

1234
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,560
and then expect them to like The Room and Manos Hands of Fate

1235
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,360
and get it.

1236
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,920
Like, you kind of got to like clue them in with,

1237
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,480
we're going to watch something that frames it like,

1238
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,560
isn't this fun to make fun of?

1239
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,720
I think you are really onto something.

1240
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,240
And when I was working on the show,

1241
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,480
my parents would watch and they could not,

1242
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,320
they just couldn't get past the movies.

1243
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,600
They would just go like, man, that movie was really bad.

1244
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,280
That was just a terrible movie.

1245
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,680
So I couldn't watch anymore.

1246
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,120
That's sort of the point.

1247
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,920
We hope we could sort of take you through it a little bit.

1248
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,320
We'll take you through it a little bit, mom and dad.

1249
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,440
But yeah, and I don't, I would never force that on people

1250
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,120
unless I wanted to marry them.

1251
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,080
Do you feel like you guys like provided a really valuable

1252
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,960
service to the movie industry, the filmmaking industry

1253
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,960
where if a movie studio, I feel like made a really terrible

1254
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,280
movie before you guys came around,

1255
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,680
it was just a total loss.

1256
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,120
It was a disaster for them.

1257
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,920
But now if somebody makes a really bad movie, it's like,

1258
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,120
well, at least somebody is going to get some sort of like

1259
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,240
twisted pleasure at like, like there is a,

1260
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,040
there has been cultivated among people and appreciation

1261
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,080
for bad movies that wasn't there before.

1262
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,560
So at least we've got that.

1263
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,960
At least we'll bring some modicum of joy to people.

1264
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,520
Especially now with podcasts and like YouTube.

1265
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,760
And it's like, everybody talks about bad movies now

1266
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,640
in a way that like people weren't doing, you know,

1267
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,040
in the 90s.

1268
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,040
So for example, I was a teenage strangler was filmed

1269
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,800
in our hometown, Huntington, West Virginia.

1270
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,720
So when it was on MSD3K, it was like this huge thing

1271
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,560
of like, it's back, we've done it.

1272
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,080
And it also puts the lie to your old teacher's thing

1273
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,960
about nobody ever making it.

1274
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,920
Take that, Mrs. Williams.

1275
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,640
Well, no, because we're all getting strangled.

1276
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,960
By a fellow native though, right?

1277
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,800
There you go.

1278
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,840
Yeah, so.

1279
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,360
It's our town in the best light.

1280
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,880
Just culling the herd.

1281
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,480
We're building a staircase of human bodies

1282
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,320
for him to climb on.

1283
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,160
There you go.

1284
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,600
Well, you know, I don't know, we've wanted Hollywood

1285
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,240
to appreciate that service we provide them for years,

1286
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,280
but so far, so far, nothing.

1287
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,960
No fungible.

1288
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,920
You know, we're just not big enough problems

1289
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,040
to affect their sales and that's all they care about.

1290
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,240
And when we have actually negotiated them via riff tracks

1291
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,860
for bigger titles, it's like diffusing a bomb.

1292
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,120
They're very sensitive about it.

1293
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,800
And we eventually have shook a few, you know,

1294
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,560
90s to early 2000 titles away from them with money,

1295
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,320
just with Kickstarter money.

1296
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,560
But they're just very concerned about the relationship,

1297
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,880
the trail of relationships they have in general.

1298
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,740
I'm imagining that conversation, like,

1299
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,320
you wanna make fun of Casablanca.

1300
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,160
Right.

1301
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,000
No.

1302
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,880
No, no, you can't.

1303
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,720
You can't do that.

1304
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,540
Come on, they're all dead.

1305
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,380
Come on.

1306
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,280
Yeah, you're right.

1307
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,000
My girlfriend and I live about 1500 miles apart

1308
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,720
and one of our favorite pastimes is watching MST3K

1309
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,020
and Riff Tracks together over Skype.

1310
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,400
Which MST3K episode of Riff Tracks VOD

1311
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,680
would you recommend for a young couple in love?

1312
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,560
Amorous in Austin.

1313
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,040
I don't, you know, I guess if he's asking me

1314
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,200
if it's something that would enhance their love

1315
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,760
or sexual pleasure, I'm a little scared of that question.

1316
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,680
Frankly.

1317
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,680
What's the most erotic MST3K episode?

1318
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,040
The apple, hands down.

1319
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,160
The Roger Daltrey looking guy

1320
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,040
running around in a loincloth.

1321
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,880
It doesn't get any more erotic than that.

1322
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,780
Can you just repeat the chapter with the sex song in it?

1323
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,000
The song that takes place in the sex.

1324
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,880
I was drunk at that point of the movie

1325
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,420
the time that I watched it,

1326
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,240
but I do distinctly remember there being a sex song

1327
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,800
that somebody sang while having sex.

1328
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,640
Which I think is-

1329
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,740
I'm guessing one of your brothers can sing it.

1330
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,360
Sex song from the apple.

1331
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,380
Oh man, it's gonna make me mad.

1332
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,220
I'm gonna-

1333
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,760
It's a double entendre, I believe.

1334
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,840
It is a single entendre.

1335
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,960
It's 1.2 entendres.

1336
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,640
I'm coming.

1337
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,480
There it is.

1338
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,300
It's the one.

1339
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,040
Oh, I'm, it's very subtle.

1340
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,200
Oh, I'm coming.

1341
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,760
Bill, do you think, just like if an actor often says

1342
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,320
if they're gonna play a serial killer or a terrible person,

1343
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,000
they have to find something within them

1344
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,800
that they can relate to.

1345
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,000
When you guys watch bad movies or choose bad movies,

1346
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,640
there has to be a level on which you like it

1347
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,240
in order to make fun of it.

1348
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,040
Yeah, I mean, we have to enjoy watching it.

1349
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,160
I don't know whether that means we like it or not,

1350
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,840
because there are definitely ones

1351
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,960
that are on our reject pile

1352
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,960
that we just have no fun at all watching.

1353
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,320
And we just, we realize that'll be the experience

1354
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,200
no matter how many jokes we sling.

1355
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,480
Is that because they're so bad

1356
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,080
or just because there's not the opportunity

1357
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,240
or like, oh, this is so bad that there's nothing?

1358
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,080
A little of both.

1359
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,200
Sometimes it's just technical.

1360
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,680
Sometimes it's just really, really, really boring.

1361
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,160
And we don't find a way to make some fun

1362
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,120
around the boringness.

1363
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,960
I think that's, I actually think that those movies

1364
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,700
outnumber the good, bad movies.

1365
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,120
I don't know if you have listened to the Flophouse,

1366
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,660
a podcast that actually very recently joined Maximum Fun,

1367
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,600
but they talk about bad movies.

1368
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,240
And they have a scale of movie qualities.

1369
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,640
Is the movie good?

1370
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,600
Is the movie good, bad?

1371
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,960
Or is it just like, not?

1372
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,520
There are so many movies that just lack any redeeming value,

1373
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,680
whether it be, you know, genuine or ironic.

1374
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,100
Oh yeah, well put, yep.

1375
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,320
Bill Corbett, thank you so much for joining us

1376
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,400
on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1377
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,240
It's been a genuine thrill and dare I say, an honor

1378
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,280
to have you on the program. Shucks, guys.

1379
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,160
What a pleasure talking to you guys.

1380
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,520
Where can people find your holiday themed comic book

1381
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,600
Superpowered Revenge Christmas?

1382
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,040
You just put all those words together that you just said

1383
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,560
and add.com and there's all sorts of ways to get it there.

1384
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,480
Superpoweredrevengechristmas.com.

1385
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,280
And of course, if you've never seen Riffrax or MS-23K,

1386
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,560
then you're dumb and you should go do that.

1387
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,140
Those people don't, I don't think there is a Venn diagram

1388
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,120
between those things in this show.

1389
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,480
I think that it's just a big circle.

1390
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,320
I tend to agree.

1391
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,720
Is there anything else you want to plug?

1392
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,640
Plug anything.

1393
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,500
No, thank you.

1394
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,440
That's what I like to hear.

1395
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,360
Bill Corbett, thank you so much for joining us

1396
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,280
and have a great rest of your week.

1397
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,120
You too, guys.

1398
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,520
I guess it's something people say at the end of the day.

1399
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,360
Never!

1400
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,640
I'm gonna do it.

1401
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,040
I'm taking you seriously.

1402
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,200
I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

1403
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,980
He was fully planning on having a super shitty Friday

1404
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,840
and you just turned it around for him.

1405
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,680
I'm going for it.

1406
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,360
I'm Terry's brother, Jerry Gross,

1407
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,440
and this has been our interview.

1408
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,700
Trav, we got a lot of, well, first we should say thank you

1409
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,040
to Bill Corbett for joining us.

1410
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,920
What a treat it was to have that cat on.

1411
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,460
Travis, we got a lot of live shows coming up.

1412
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,300
That's great.

1413
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,120
Announced a lot this week.

1414
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,960
What's the haps?

1415
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,000
Give me the 411.

1416
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,920
Okay.

1417
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,760
Well, we already talked about-

1418
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,600
Give me the 311.

1419
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,420
Okay, great.

1420
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,260
We already talked about the-

1421
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,100
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

1422
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:43,920
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

1423
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,760
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

1424
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,580
Emma is the color of our energy.

1425
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,620
Okay, you guys are the worst.

1426
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,460
Whoa!

1427
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,980
We already talked about the Candlelight's live show.

1428
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,020
Crazy game of poker.

1429
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,280
Bit.ly forward slash Candlelight's live.

1430
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,000
Also, if you're going to be at the show

1431
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,440
or if you just have a Candlelight's question,

1432
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,880
make sure you email that to us

1433
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,660
and put Candlelight's in the subject line

1434
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,000
so we know that that's what it's about.

1435
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,600
We also just announced a Los Angeles live show

1436
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,300
with my brother, my brother, me, and Sawbones

1437
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,600
on February 6th at 9.30 at the Masonic Temple

1438
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,920
in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

1439
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,880
Tickets for that go on sale the 16th,

1440
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,740
and that's bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-L-A.

1441
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,600
And we will also be at San Francisco Sketch Fest

1442
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,640
with Jordan Jesse Goh on February 7th.

1443
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,700
And tickets for that go on sale,

1444
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,400
well, they're going on sale right now.

1445
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,900
And that is bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Sketch Fest.

1446
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,700
And make sure you grab all those tickets

1447
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,960
and then also January 6th at UCB Franklin

1448
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,020
here in Los Angeles at 11 p.m.

1449
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,840
Bunker Buddies is gonna do a live show

1450
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,880
with Jordan Jesse Goh.

1451
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,920
Tickets for that will be going on sale soon.

1452
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,800
And we'd love to see you there.

1453
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,440
It's gonna be mine and Andy's first live show.

1454
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,440
We're very excited about it.

1455
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,120
And if you wanna go to a live show for the Adventure Zone,

1456
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,360
it'll never happen because I will never be confident enough

1457
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,000
to make that happen.

1458
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,800
And we would have to swear you to silence

1459
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,320
because we record for four hours

1460
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,800
and then edit it down to an hour.

1461
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,760
And then, yeah.

1462
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,800
You must never know the terrible rules

1463
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,840
discussing what happens.

1464
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,520
All the dull dice rolling that Griffin has edited out.

1465
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,120
All the dullest complaints.

1466
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,080
I actually leave the sound of the dice in

1467
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,200
because people like get off on that shit.

1468
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,480
They got their ASMR.

1469
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,280
Speaking of, go check out the Adventure Zone

1470
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,140
if you haven't yet.

1471
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,720
And then also, which is our D&D podcast

1472
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,820
that we do with our dad.

1473
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,920
And then go listen to Sawbones,

1474
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,760
which is Justin and Sydney's podcast.

1475
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,440
And go listen to Bunker Buddies,

1476
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,960
which is mine and Andy's podcast.

1477
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,080
And then go listen to Big Gulp if you can find it.

1478
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,920
Here's a little taste of the Adventure Zone

1479
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,920
just for people who haven't tried it out

1480
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,200
and maybe want a little sampler box.

1481
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,400
It's basically just like,

1482
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,440
mm, I cast the magic spells at the orchid.

1483
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,020
How many points do I get?

1484
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:58,860
That's what our dad sounds like.

1485
01:04:58,860 --> 01:04:59,700
And that's what our dad.

1486
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,640
If you haven't heard our dad, he is a-

1487
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,200
Now, can we have a sample of Big Gulp

1488
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,640
as long as you're giving out free samples?

1489
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,480
Yeah, sure.

1490
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,360
This week on Big Gulp, Monstro.

1491
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,740
Sexiest whale yet?

1492
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:13,120
Thanks to Nature Box.

1493
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,480
Speaking of free samples,

1494
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,400
go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

1495
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,880
Sign up to get your free sampler box

1496
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,680
of great tasting, healthy snacks.

1497
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,360
Snacks.

1498
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,440
It's a fun word.

1499
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,040
As we head into 2015,

1500
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,240
it's a good time to think about

1501
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,560
when you want a birthday message

1502
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,880
because we'll probably end up doing it two months late.

1503
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,480
So if you want to wish someone a happy birthday

1504
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,520
or get your Kickstarter or website or something

1505
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
talked about on the show,

1506
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,640
go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron

1507
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,060
and all the instructions on how to get

1508
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,240
into the money zone are there.

1509
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,760
So go do that and we'll see you in 2015.

1510
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,520
Do you guys think that 2015 is going to be better

1511
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,840
than this fucking dumpster of a year?

1512
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,880
Do you want to know?

1513
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,480
I had a thought as to what the title for 2015 should be.

1514
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,460
Yeah, you told us and it didn't really set our asses on fire

1515
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,300
like it did for you.

1516
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,200
You didn't like it?

1517
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,040
Well, just go and say it.

1518
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,200
I was a 2015 and it's all about giving to others

1519
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,240
and taking care of the planet and shit.

1520
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,560
That's really good, Trav.

1521
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,400
Thank you.

1522
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,900
I have one other suggestion.

1523
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,700
20 Drifting, fire it up.

1524
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,400
Get behind the car in front of you.

1525
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,600
Go faster as a result of air pressure reduction.

1526
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,420
20 Drifting.

1527
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,580
Let me hit you with this though.

1528
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,800
20 Gulpting.

1529
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,280
That's a little promotional for my taste.

1530
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,400
We got a YouTube channel, nbmbam.com slash YouTube.

1531
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,240
No.

1532
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,080
No?

1533
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:33,900
No?

1534
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,740
No?

1535
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,120
I went, we bought YouTube so fuck you.

1536
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,640
You want to get YouTube, you got to go to my

1537
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,560
Where's my Rhyme of Gotham sound though?

1538
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,160
Slash Studio City slash GeoCity slash Tripod

1539
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,000
slash Angel Fire slash YouTube

1540
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,960
and you'll find all your videos there.

1541
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,800
Where's all my Beyonce songs?

1542
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,700
They're all at YouTube.com slash nbmbam

1543
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,960
is our actual address.

1544
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,600
Thanks again to Bill Corbett, by the way,

1545
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,440
for joining us on the show.

1546
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,480
That was a lot of fun and what an honor

1547
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,440
to have that guy on.

1548
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,620
Next week is our,

1549
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,960
next week's our Candle Nights Live show, Spectacular.

1550
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,360
It might be up late because we're recording it

1551
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,200
late Sunday night and that is way later

1552
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,960
than I usually edit the show.

1553
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,840
So maybe a Tuesday episode.

1554
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,280
Sorry for the lateness.

1555
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,480
You will get it before Christmas.

1556
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,320
Oh, you'll get it, yeah, definitely, definitely.

1557
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,080
And again, like our other Candle Nights shows,

1558
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,040
that'll be clean so you can listen to it with family

1559
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,320
and not feel uncomfortable about it.

1560
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,800
And we want to say thanks to John Roderick

1561
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,760
and the Long Winters for the use of their theme song.

1562
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,240
It's a departure from the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1563
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,640
Well, it's our theme song, not really theirs.

1564
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,120
So if you're gonna steal my fucking game, then just-

1565
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,400
Well, you weren't doing it.

1566
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,440
You weren't doing it.

1567
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,640
You should listen to John Roderick's Christmas album too.

1568
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,480
Who's Rod Ruck?

1569
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,400
Oh yeah, One Christmas at a Time.

1570
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,400
Him and Jonathan Colton did a great Christmas album

1571
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,840
you should listen to.

1572
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,780
That's gonna do it for us.

1573
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,620
We're done.

1574
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:52,440
We're done, final yahoo.

1575
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,280
We love you.

1576
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,160
We love you very much.

1577
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,920
This final yahoo was sent in by Connor Stuxlager.

1578
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,520
Hell of a name.

1579
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,360
Thank you, Connor.

1580
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,600
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

1581
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,080
They are suspended.

1582
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,660
But when they were living, they asked,

1583
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,760
do you think Santa Claus is opposed

1584
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,120
to Obama's death panels?

1585
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,800
Wow.

1586
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,800
I'm Justin McElroy.

1587
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,200
I'm Travis McElroy.

1588
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1589
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,760
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1590
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,920
Kiss your dad.

1591
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,940
Square on the lips.

1592
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:48,800

1593
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,800
Welcome to Oh No!

1594
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,800
Ross and Carrie.

1595
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,800
Ross.

1596
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Hi Carrie.

1597
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,800
What do you think is creepier?

1598
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,800
Okay.

1599
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,800
If you go into a swimming pool, all of a sudden, the water goes away and instead of water,

1600
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:04,960
there is the bones of your dead ancestors or our show.

1601
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,320
That's pretty tough because we visited a live exorcism.

1602
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,040
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis where we had to worship a naked lady.

1603
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,960
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

1604
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:14,960
They were scary.

1605
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,960
Super creepy.

1606
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,960
We joined the Ethere Society.

1607
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,360
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

1608
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,840
Oh boy, I tried breast enlargement.

1609
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,960
We have basically done every creepy, weird, fringe thing except for thousands more, which

1610
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,680
we will get to if you listen to our show.

1611
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,160
I'd still say the swimming pool of my ancestors' bones.

1612
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,120
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

1613
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,120
I guess they shouldn't.

1614
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,440
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun and the show's called Oh No!

1615
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:52,520
Ross and Carrie.
