1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,960
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,840
oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,760
brother, 30 under 30 Griffin McElroy. Now, Travis, I'm looking at the show notes that you submitted

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,720
for potential items of discussion for the opening of the show, and it says here,

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,160
you like a Taka Dino? I would like a Taka Dino, Justin. Hey Griffin, you like a Taka Dino?

10
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,360
I like a Taka Dino. It let's Taka Dino. I'll Taka Dino one second, Travis. I'd like to Taka Dino

11
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,240
with you. Ah, yes, thank you. Let me Taka Dino for just a second. I watched, finally saw that new

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,880
Jurassic Park 2. The second one that did come out like this year and is kind of relevant.

13
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,120
Yeah, Jurassic Park 2 slash 5, depending on how you're counting them. And let me tell you

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,720
something, they're added again. Yeah. I need to know how, listen, I have respect for all

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,440
of the creatures of Earth. I think that, and there's an undercurrent in the Jurassic Park films

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:11,840
of these are animals and they should be respected. I would argue that they were created because of

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,840
man's meddling. They are the children of men and we may deal with them as we wish. They are the

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,000
products of our hubris. God has nothing to do with them. They are our products. So why, at the

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,320
beginning of Jurassic Park, I guess five? Why is the first scene not President Barack Obama 2,

20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,120
Jr., Barack Obama's son, because it's in the distant future. Why is the first thing that

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,960
happens not the president saying, kill all these fucking dinosaurs. Hey, everybody, kill every

22
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,960
dinosaur. We're not doing it anymore. Everybody kill all the dinosaurs. You can't have them.

23
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,760
How are we so good at extincting tens of thousands of species every year, but we can't wipe out

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
these fucking dinosaurs. I would like to remind everyone that we live in- Guys, I'm sorry,

25
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,360
just the doorbell rang, sorry. Oh, guys, John Hammond. He's come to claim. He heard us talking.

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:22,080
I spared no expense in doxxing you, Griffin. It's a bag of dog poop. I left it upon your stoop.

27
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,640
I gave you a flaming dog poopy bag. That's T-Rex poop. I heard you talk a dino.

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,200
You should talk a nicer dino, Griffin. Did you ever have a flea circus?

29
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,560
I've had six. Spared no expense. Griffin's still gone, eh? He's been crystallized in amber.

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
Okay, I will talk about this because Griffin's not here, so I get to talk about it.

31
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Okay. John Hammond says the first attraction he made when he came to America from Scotland

32
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,360
was a flea circus, right? Can you imagine how bored you have to be to see an old man playing

33
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,160
with a tiny circus and be like, I would love to pay some money to watch this old man play with

34
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,720
this tiny pretend circus. He's just on a corner? Like, what is he doing? All right, I'm back.

35
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
He's back. We're talking about John Hammond's flea circus.

36
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
John Hammond's flea circus, Griffin.

37
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,400
Wait, were you guys doing the podcast without me?

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,680
We were, just a little bit.

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,640
What the fuck?

40
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,880
There was definitely lacking something, so I'm so glad you're here. John Hammond said he came over

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,280
from Scotland. The first attraction that he had was a flea circus.

42
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,000
Right.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So here's what I'm trying to figure out. Did you just walk up on a corner and see all John Hammond

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,200
playing with a pretend circus on a corner and he's like, wait, if you're gonna keep watching

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,960
me play with this pretend tiny circus, you're gonna have to give me a quarter.

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,200
Right.

47
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,560
Because this is business.

48
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,600
And that happened eight billion times until he had four billion dollars.

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
And then a wealthy investor with a monocle did come up and say like,

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,560
this would be cool. Have you thought about doing it with dino sours?

51
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,440
This is the thing that really floored me watching JWFK, is that me, Travis Vagra,

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,240
I live in a world in which once we cloned a sheep and people talked about that motherfucker

53
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,800
for like 10 years. And in JWFK, everyone has acclimated to the fact that there are now

54
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,440
dinosaurs super quickly. Everyone's just like, yeah, I get it.

55
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm over dinosaurs. But like, yeah, me too. Doesn't that parallel us as the audience?

56
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,680
When Stevie Spielberg first unloaded his boat full of beautiful robot dinosaurs,

57
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,800
we all lined up at the shore to wave our hankies at them. These conquering heroes.

58
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,480
Give us your thunder lizards, Stevie. They look so real. And now Stevie's back for a

59
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,920
fifth time with a fifth boat that has Chris Pratt as the captain of it.

60
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,120
And we're like, is Deadpool on there somewhere?

61
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,440
We need him.

62
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,520
Because if not, we need a different boat. You're gonna need a bigger boat with even

63
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,200
an angrier dinosaur on it.

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,320
To the point where, here's how bored everyone is with dinosaurs.

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,680
And I mean the audience. That Jurassic World has to make up new dinosaurs.

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,840
They gotta keep getting more visceral. We're so bored of these fucking dinosaurs.

67
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
They gotta, the next one, they gotta get like,

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,240
they have to have abs and dicks and stuff to like-

69
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
Listen, these dinos fuck. There's one thing we can all agree on.

70
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,240
They can get it. And they do. The last thing was that they're bored of dinosaurs so they

71
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,200
make a bigger, angrier dinosaur that can kill more people.

72
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,600
And you're telling me they do that again?

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,920
Yes.

74
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,120
You know what fucking stinks? That park looked dope.

75
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
They had roller coasters and fun attractions that didn't have

76
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,640
shit to do with these killer, awful monsters that I'm so bored of.

77
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,880
Get some abs and dicks and butts and, you know, expose-

78
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
You know what I mean? Something to really catch the eye.

79
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,760
But there were fun roller coasters for thrill seekers like me

80
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,560
who don't want to be eaten by big dinosaurs.

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,760
You could clone Abraham Lincoln and have him at your park.

82
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,360
I think that'd be pretty cool too.

83
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,760
Like-

84
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,200
Okay, wait. Stop.

85
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,280
You understand that you would need to get a sample of Abraham Lincoln's blood, right?

86
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,600
Yes.

87
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,160
Is that really harder than getting a dinosaur's Justin?

88
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,320
Because Abraham Lincoln was around more recently.

89
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,240
I bet you could find a mosquito that ate on Abraham Lincoln

90
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,640
and then got frozen in some carbonite or whatever.

91
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,560
Find a bayonet down Gettysburg that has a bit of president blood on it.

92
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,320
From his great fight he did at Gettysburg,

93
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,120
we led the troops and stabbed like nine dudes.

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,640
Definitely got stabbed in return.

95
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,040
Find that one. We got ourselves an Abe Bruin.

96
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
Or what if just a random dude?

97
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,200
Like, I'm sorry. I think that would be enough of an attraction if you're just like,

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,920
this is, you know, Sam and this is Sam B and this is Sam C

99
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,320
and like we just cloned Sam over and over again

100
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,680
and you can come to Samrassic Park and see like it's all Sams everywhere.

101
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,240
You know what'd be dope is if instead of tightening up the security protocols of the Jurassic Park,

102
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,080
if they just got a little clone DNA sample from every visitor who came in.

103
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,640
And then if you get all led up by a Stegosaur,

104
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,080
then it's fine because your heart will go on in this new clone.

105
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,560
You're taking this to full Black Mirror territory and I love it.

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I think what you should do is say like,

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,720
I am going to get killed at Jurassic Park,

108
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,760
so let me go ahead and get this clone a-cooking.

109
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,280
Okay, so I have my clone done and then I'm just gonna go in here

110
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,760
and run through the dinos at the time of my life,

111
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,680
meet Jeff, meet Sam, the whole gang.

112
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,760
It's got Laura Dern. I'm gonna meet all of them.

113
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
Then I will get killed by a dinosaur.

114
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,840
But I know my children will have a papa tomorrow because of the clone.

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
And it's like the prestige.

116
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
You never know whether you're gonna be the new clone Griffin

117
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,320
or the one inside the dinos, you know, tummy.

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,560
Yeah.

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
You never know which one you're gonna be.

120
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,280
I'm just saying, hey, let us write the next Jurassic World movie, please.

121
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,240
Like, I think that that would be way more fun of like,

122
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
we cross this dinosaur and a chair.

123
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
Like, okay, all right, I can sit on that T-Rex.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,920
Okay, like, that's interesting to me. Make them smaller.

125
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
I've talked about this before.

126
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,320
This is a pet project of mine of people being like,

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
they want bigger, scarier dinosaurs.

128
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
Like, no, no, no.

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,160
I want a small T-Rex, like in Pee Wee's Playhouse.

130
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
What they need to do is cross them with some animals

131
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
that are a lot more spin kickable.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,480
Yeah.

133
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,720
So cross them with the flamingo.

134
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,160
Huge, stupid neck, long, dumb legs, pink.

135
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,520
Like, you could just spin kick.

136
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,360
So pink.

137
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
So many kickable zones on a mingo, man.

138
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,800
Or just give me like a T-Rex cross with a penguin

139
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
where it kind of waddles a little bit

140
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,280
and is literally like football sized.

141
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,160
Can we?

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
I love animals and I would fight to protect them.

143
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
And I do every day.

144
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
But if you had to spin kick a flamingo,

145
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,040
what would be the most viscerally satisfying zone?

146
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,560
I actually would love to get it right in the middle

147
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,160
so that as I kicked it, it kind of veed to the side.

148
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,520
It would wrap around your foot.

149
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,720
It would wrap all the way around your foot.

150
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,640
So that like the feet and the head

151
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,720
would kind of trail behind it.

152
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,040
Like you were throwing like a Nerf football

153
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,480
that had a tail on it.

154
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
Like, that's what I want.

155
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
I would like to kick it in its head,

156
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,480
but then it moves its head the last second

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
and I miss and I fall to the ground.

158
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
Then I punch it in its nuts.

159
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,280
So wait, you want to try to kick it, miss it.

160
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,120
Maybe it laughs a little bit at you.

161
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
It's like, yeah, because I want that like,

162
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,560
I want to feel better about it.

163
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,960
You know, he's like a real jerk.

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,720
You want a redemption story.

165
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,760
Yes, exactly.

166
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,400
You know how the boy who can fly

167
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,160
when Fred Savage shoots that squirt gun

168
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
full of piss at the bully and the bully says-

169
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,200
Sorry?

170
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,840
Just this one scene.

171
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,400
I need that redemption, bully redemption moment.

172
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,680
I need that Falkor soaring over the flamingo

173
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
and peeing on everything as I punch him in the nuts.

174
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,680
Was it his piss?

175
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,520
It was Fred Savage's piss, bro.

176
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,920
I can't, Griffin, both options are the worst.

177
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,520
Well, you're right.

178
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,560
If it was the bully's piss,

179
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,840
it would be probably better for the bully,

180
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
but how'd he get it?

181
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,560
It's dinosaur piss.

182
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
That's how it all comes back around.

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,160
It could go like full psychological terror.

184
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
Like this is the piss that I wrung out of your sheets

185
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
when you went to bed last night

186
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
because I screamed in the middle of the night

187
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,840
and I know you pee yourself anyway.

188
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,800
Hey, we've had like, I don't know,

189
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
seven or eight Jurassic Park movies-

190
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
Let Fred Savage play Batman!

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Let Fred Savage play Batman.

192
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,920
How have we gone seven Jurassic Park movies or whatever

193
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,280
and there's never once been a scene

194
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,440
of a dinosaur peeing on somebody?

195
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Like, come on, it's right there.

196
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
Y'all, I'm not gonna be able to think about anything

197
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
but Fred Savage's piss gun.

198
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,680
And I was Googling it just to make sure Justin wasn't lying

199
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,280
or having a fever dream,

200
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,320
and I couldn't really find like hard, firm news

201
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
about Fred Savage's piss gun,

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,440
but I did find a quote on IMDB that says,

203
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,320
bad boy.

204
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
So you thought you could make it around the block?

205
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,920
Louis pulls out a water pistol.

206
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,560
Bad boy.

207
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,360
Oh, so now I'm supposed to be afraid of a water pistol?

208
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
Louis, there ain't no water in this gun.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,720
Bad boy.

210
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,840
So what's in it?

211
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,320
Louis.

212
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,540
Piss.

213
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,040
Piss.

214
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,180
Now, there's also a scene in Little Monsters,

215
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,140
though I'm not mistaken,

216
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,580
where Harry Mandel and Fred Savage pee in a bully's coke.

217
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,780
Okay.

218
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,180
So everybody, if you could find this Fred Savage.

219
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,460
Pretty much any time.

220
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,780
Okay, here's your challenge.

221
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,900
Can everyone just find all the scenes of urine assault

222
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,340
that Fred Savage has perpetrated in cinema history

223
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,020
and just tweet them out to us?

224
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,500
No, I'm not making calls like this again

225
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,660
because the birthday one got really annoying really quickly

226
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,940
and I regretted doing it.

227
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,460
So I'm not doing this again, but like-

228
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,460
Maybe a super cut?

229
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,060
Maybe a super cut of all the times that Fred Savage-

230
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,500
Has weaponized urine.

231
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,640
Yeah.

232
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,820
If you just search Fred Savage piss on YouTube,

233
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,220
it's the very first result.

234
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,700
And then lean back and maybe close one eye

235
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,220
and just be careful.

236
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,100
There's probably a joke about the wizard,

237
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,620
but not on this show.

238
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,660
There won't be.

239
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,940
No, not here.

240
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,300
We don't work blue.

241
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,740
Can we do the show?

242
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,700
It's been so long.

243
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,780
Well, can we just watch this scene?

244
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,340
Because everybody in the audience is going to do it.

245
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,180
So I want to give them a time period where-

246
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,380
It's 25 seconds.

247
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,900
So if we could just watch this one scene

248
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,660
from The Boy Who Could Fly real quick,

249
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,540
starting now.

250
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,180
So you thought you could get around the block.

251
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,860
Go ahead and make my day.

252
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,300
Oh, I'm supposed to be real scared of a water pistol.

253
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,540
There ain't no water on this gun.

254
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,700
So, what's in it?

255
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,260
Piss.

256
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,220
Oh, shit!

257
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,420
He gets him in the face.

258
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,140
Classic.

259
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,580
This is culturally important.

260
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,660
He gets him in the open mouth.

261
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,180
He really blasts off.

262
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,980
It's fucking good.

263
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,540
And you know what the best fucking thing

264
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,660
in this entire clip-

265
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,100
Hey, Griffin, please put the audio for this clip

266
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,660
into the show.

267
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,940
Griffin is with the audience.

268
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,060
The best fucking thing though,

269
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,180
you do have to go watch it

270
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,940
because the last thing that happens-

271
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,060
Fred Savage, I should mention,

272
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,820
is like eight and on a big wheel.

273
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,860
The last thing that happens,

274
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,620
he sprays this bully with piss.

275
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,380
The bully falls on his own baseball bat and trips.

276
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,860
And then Fred Savage chucks his gun

277
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,460
into a neighbor's yard.

278
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,700
Ditching the evidence.

279
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,740
Like he's just done a-

280
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,940
Like the police are gonna-

281
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,180
Yeah.

282
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,900
Execution.

283
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,300
It's amazing.

284
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,260
It's wild.

285
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,380
Holy crap.

286
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,820
The boy who could fly.

287
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,620
And that's not-

288
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,740
Here's the thing.

289
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,140
That's not what this movie is about.

290
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,020
No, for me.

291
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,580
You would think it would be just about

292
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,580
building up to this exact moment

293
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,460
when Fred Savage blasted this bully with pee.

294
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,460
Pee, so this is an invite show

295
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,940
and we're gonna get right down to it.

296
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,580
My office has an annual Thanksgiving potluck.

297
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,140
People take this very seriously.

298
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,180
Years ago, someone brought a half store bought pie

299
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,660
that person was soon after fired.

300
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,900
I'm sure there were other contributing factors.

301
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,700
There didn't need to be.

302
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,420
That's a joke.

303
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,460
Yeah, people still bring him

304
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,300
and his half a pie up in regular conversation.

305
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,660
But here's the other important fact.

306
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,540
I don't really want to put a lot of work into this.

307
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,540
What should I bring that will be good enough

308
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,380
to not get fired and also require minimum effort?

309
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,220
You are playing with fire, Jason.

310
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,380
Yeah, it's a tricky one, right?

311
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,100
Thanksgiving is.

312
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,300
Cause I know there's a lot of people

313
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,060
who maybe don't like cooking.

314
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,460
And so maybe you just do want to swing by the,

315
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,820
you know, Kroger get some pecan cups or something.

316
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,940
And I think that's fine.

317
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,900
I think that's okay.

318
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,260
But the whole thing is like,

319
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
I worked on this for you to eat it.

320
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,740
And that's, I don't know.

321
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,780
That's what makes it such a nice gesture, you know?

322
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,020
But here's the thing about it, Jason is like,

323
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,900
I wish, listen, I know that the jobs

324
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,740
that Justin Griffin and I have now

325
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,020
are very non-conventional,

326
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,980
but there were some times

327
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,220
where I worked some fairly conventional jobs

328
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,140
and I wish that there had been opportunities

329
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,580
of like this one day, you know exactly what metric

330
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,020
you're being judged by.

331
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,060
And if you just deliver like a banger of a dessert,

332
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,340
you might get a promotion.

333
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,980
Like, cause it's gotta work both ways, right?

334
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,340
Like that's a shitty, you brought,

335
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,020
I'm sorry, person in the past,

336
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,060
we got fired for this.

337
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,220
You brought half a pie?

338
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,340
So like the other half had already been eaten.

339
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,980
You deserve to be fired.

340
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,060
But you bring like a banger dessert

341
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,620
and it's like, you get the Johnson account.

342
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,300
It ain't gonna be a dessert.

343
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,220
It's gotta be the whole Turk, doesn't it?

344
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,700
It's gotta be the showstopper Turk of the century

345
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,180
if you wanna get the boss's job, I think.

346
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,260
Here's what I would recommend.

347
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,620
I have made a lot of different dishes

348
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,740
for a lot of different purposes

349
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,980
and I'm not gonna get into the ins and outs of baking.

350
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,820
Here's my fucking slam dunk, easy,

351
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,700
everyone will love you recipe.

352
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,420
Here's what you do.

353
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,220
You go pop a couple of bags of popcorn,

354
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,340
you buy like chocolate bark,

355
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,540
it's over in the baking section,

356
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,780
like chocolate bark that you melt in the microwave,

357
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,300
literally melt in the microwave

358
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,700
and then you buy a bunch of candy canes

359
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,540
that you crush up into dust.

360
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,100
You pop the popcorn, you put it on a sheet,

361
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,460
cover it in the chocolate,

362
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,060
turn in the chocolate, stir the chocolate,

363
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,820
then stir the crushed up candy cane into it,

364
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,980
lay it out on a sheet, let it cool and harden.

365
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,700
People will be crazy for it.

366
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,100
It's the easiest shit in the world to make

367
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
and people will lose it.

368
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,380
They will lose it.

369
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,540
And you'll be a grand slam person

370
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,700
that didn't put hardly any work into this at all.

371
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,620
Turkey's easy too, though.

372
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,180
Turkey's so easy, you just gotta wait.

373
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,740
You know, salt it, pepper it and get it hot.

374
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,260
I don't see why people always complain

375
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,700
and have a special hotline.

376
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,140
You just put it in the oven,

377
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,780
which makes things hotter once they're in there.

378
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,260
Get the bird hot enough, the flesh turns good.

379
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
I don't see why everybody freaks out about this shit.

380
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,540
That's pretty clear, Griffin.

381
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,660
Here's the problem, Jason,

382
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,700
you've asked us this question

383
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,300
but you didn't give us what kind of budget

384
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,020
you're working with.

385
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,700
Yeah, a lot of stuff.

386
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,300
You could maybe get a Wolfgang Puck-esque figure

387
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,060
to make individualized turkeys

388
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,580
for each person you work with.

389
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,860
You don't have to do it.

390
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,300
Wolfgang's banking them

391
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,980
and every turkey reminds them

392
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,300
of their favorite childhood memory or whatever.

393
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,140
And then now you own the company.

394
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
He definitely has a rat in his hat

395
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,060
telling him how to do shit, though, huh?

396
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,660
Wolfgang Puck, definitely.

397
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,420
He's probably got, oh, wouldn't it be funny

398
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,260
if he actually had nine wolves

399
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,940
telling him how to cook in the kitchen

400
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,620
and that's how he got his name?

401
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,460
And maybe one Shakespearean fairy.

402
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,820
You could tell your boss

403
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,060
that you will bite the bullet,

404
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,660
you'll make the turkey for everybody.

405
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,620
You'll be in charge of turkey to bring in

406
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,460
but listen, you're gonna have to stay home

407
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,060
and babysit this bird.

408
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,660
You gotta babysit the bird

409
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,300
because you never know when it's gonna be done.

410
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,780
Yeah.

411
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,540
So you gotta stay home from work.

412
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,500
Come in at lunch

413
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,180
because you got a turkey baking at home.

414
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,020
So this is like you get the day off

415
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,180
but you do have to bring in a turkey

416
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,220
and there is that stress

417
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,500
of being sort of the centerpiece.

418
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,140
And then you be the centerpiece

419
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,980
and let them eat the turkey off of your body.

420
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,420
That's what's good is you don't even have

421
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,300
to cook the turkey.

422
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,700
You come in with it on your head like in Friends.

423
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,780
I wanna tell everybody a fun,

424
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,660
a quick sidebar, cooking sidebar.

425
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,060
I feel like this is gonna be this sort of episode

426
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,300
with a lot of sidebars and fun blind alleys.

427
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,340
It was my in-laws 40th anniversary this weekend

428
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,540
and they went up to Lexington

429
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,660
at the, I believe you've been there,

430
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,740
or sorry, Louisville at the,

431
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,660
I believe you've been to the Brown Hotel, Travis?

432
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,380
I have, yes.

433
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,860
Okay.

434
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,660
That's the name of it.

435
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,580
It's not like I can't remember the name

436
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,260
and I'm just telling you the color.

437
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,460
It's the Brown Hotel.

438
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,300
And they decided to stay in the last night they were there,

439
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,580
just enjoy each other's company

440
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,180
and get a nice pizza delivered by Grubhub.

441
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,580
So they ordered this pizza from Grubhub

442
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,900
and when it shows up,

443
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,540
they finally, they understand,

444
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,700
they come to realize instantaneously

445
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,140
that they have ordered,

446
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,420
that my father-in-law, Tommy,

447
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,700
has ordered a pizza from a take and bake pizza place.

448
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,980
Oh, goodness.

449
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,020
So you tell them what ingredients you want

450
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,700
and then you come there and pick it up

451
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,980
and then you bake it at your house,

452
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,220
which I guess is a restaurant concept

453
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,660
that I was not aware of,

454
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,820
but at no point during this exchange of ideas

455
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,420
did anyone say, like, this is not going to work.

456
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,700
You're not going to be able to bake this pizza

457
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,140
in your hotel room.

458
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,060
It just isn't going to happen.

459
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,980
And I asked my father-in-law,

460
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,420
because I know him very well,

461
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,180
well, you didn't throw it away, did you?

462
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,460
And he said, no, I didn't.

463
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,180
We had brought a beer cooler with us

464
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:31,700
and I put it down sort of sideways into the corner

465
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,580
and kind of put ice down at the bottom of it

466
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,300
and kind of left it standing up inside the cooler

467
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,660
buried in this ice.

468
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,820
But then I went to check on it the next morning

469
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,260
and it had just collapsed.

470
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,260
But good news, I invented pizza water,

471
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,140
which is great.

472
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,660
So I threw it into the trash.

473
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,020
Can you imagine being the maid cleaning this room?

474
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,780
What the fuck were you all doing?

475
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,260
What kind of wild party happened in here?

476
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,940
What was your strat?

477
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,380
Did you make the pizza

478
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,220
and then decided the last minute?

479
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,700
No.

480
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,460
It's wrapped in plastic.

481
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,780
Oh, man, that's good.

482
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,060
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

483
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,380
Yes.

484
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,580
This one was sent in by lots of people.

485
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,380
Thank you, everybody.

486
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,300
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

487
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,020
They're anonymous, so I'll call them.

488
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,820
Boris asks, can you be naked in a laundromat?

489
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,300
Can you wash the clothes you have on

490
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,860
and be naked in a laundromat while they're washing?

491
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,740
Have you guys ever cooked laundry,

492
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
cooked laundry in a laundromat?

493
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,020
I've cooked some laundry,

494
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,260
both in college and post-college.

495
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,060
Living in LA, I've used several laundromats.

496
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,500
I understand why you can't just be fully nude

497
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,020
in public most of the time.

498
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,900
I mean, I can't,

499
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,260
but I understand why folks get up in arms about it.

500
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,700
But in a laundromat, it does feel...

501
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,300
It doesn't feel fair, does it?

502
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
It's like if you did go to a pizza hut,

503
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,740
but they stopped you from eating

504
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,900
the last slice of pizza every time.

505
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,540
Do you know what I mean?

506
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,620
I need to cook all my laundry,

507
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,940
except for this one last little bit.

508
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,860
You will never know the experience

509
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,180
of having all your clothes clean at the same time.

510
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,020
It does kind of feel like when you get to the laundromat,

511
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,940
they should like hand you a robe

512
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,340
and invite you into a changing room.

513
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,380
They should provide that for you.

514
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,780
I get you don't want me nude with my business out,

515
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,220
so give me an alternative.

516
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,860
You know what I mean?

517
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,140
Give me an airlock that I can walk through,

518
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,180
change into the robe,

519
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,300
and then walk through the rest

520
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,100
that I'm in the laundromat in my robe.

521
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,060
Or just somebody's old cruddy dungarees

522
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,500
that they left behind.

523
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,780
Or like a cycle?

524
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,060
We cycle through the clothes.

525
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,740
Well, kinda.

526
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,140
I was thinking of one communal pair of dungarees,

527
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,020
and we don't have to cover the top, just the bottom,

528
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,180
because that's where the worst stuff lives.

529
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,740
And so we can just have one crusty old pair of dungarees

530
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,540
that you can use as needed.

531
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,820
And they can be pretty big,

532
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,020
and you just cinch them up.

533
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,900
Could you have a place

534
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,660
that is a combination laundromat spray tan place?

535
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,460
So you go, you want to get that sun-kissed look

536
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,660
here in early November.

537
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,420
You go in, you throw your clothes in the wash,

538
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,660
and then they give you that great look.

539
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,740
But here's the one thing about it,

540
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,700
is that it needs to do a place that does it all,

541
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,900
or else it's not gonna be complete.

542
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
The process will not be complete.

543
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,060
So it needs to advertise itself as like,

544
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,860
yes, we do the butt, too.

545
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,740
Oh, okay.

546
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,940
Your butt will be tan.

547
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,540
I guess if they could get a pink diaper.

548
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,860
Justin, there is no way on earth

549
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,620
that that doesn't already exist.

550
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,140
You think?

551
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,060
Yeah, like a spray tan slash laundromat.

552
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,620
It just seems to me like not that wild of an idea.

553
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,940
It has to exist somewhere.

554
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,180
Now let me hit you with this.

555
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,980
A spray tan laundromat

556
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,940
where you put your body in the washing machine

557
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,780
and they spray tan all your clothes.

558
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,060
Okay.

559
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,220
Just to give them a little sun-kissed color

560
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,020
as we move into the long, long winter months.

561
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,980
Or what if it's like a combination laundromat spray tan

562
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,820
where you walk in in your clothes,

563
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,900
they spray tan you, you're still wearing your clothes,

564
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,260
and then you take a step forward

565
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,460
and then they wash your clothes

566
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
while you're wearing them like a car wash.

567
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:35,860
Okay.

568
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,100
So you're getting the spray tan

569
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
and then they wash the spray tan off your clothes.

570
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,660
How about a combination laundromat spray tan Taco Bell?

571
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,380
Okay.

572
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,260
Okay, so then you eat the Taco Bell,

573
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,140
you shit your pants, you throw it right into the wash.

574
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,620
And I mean, you drop all their messy,

575
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,060
nasty lettuce all over yourself

576
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,620
and it's got sauces you wouldn't even believe of

577
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,060
that paint the front of your shirt,

578
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,060
just a beautiful spectrum of hot colors.

579
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,500
And then you're gonna have to wash those off

580
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,340
while you get a sweet sun-kissed look.

581
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,340
And I think you can just knock out all your needs in one go.

582
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,340
What about a combination spray tan and laser tag place

583
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,820
where the laser tag guns shoot spray tan?

584
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,980
That's really good, Travis.

585
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,660
Wow, Travis, that's excellent.

586
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,740
Oh, also, you're nude.

587
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,740
It's important to note you are nude.

588
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,940
Bunch of nude adults running around with spray tan guns

589
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,020
and then when the match is over,

590
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,420
there's a judge who meticulously figures out

591
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,820
what percentage of your body has been spray tanned.

592
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,900
And that includes hair and eyeballs.

593
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,820
And they're gonna figure it out.

594
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,220
Always, they're very accurate with their measurements.

595
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,900
And it's called spray-zer tag.

596
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Spray-zer tag is the best.

597
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,340
And then we're gonna get a Taco Bell

598
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,860
and a laundromat in there somewhere.

599
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,900
Well, yeah, you gotta get some celebratory tacos afterwards

600
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,660
and you're gonna have something to do with your clothes

601
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,340
while you're playing spray-zer tag.

602
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,140
So that's what you do.

603
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,060
You get there, you pop your clothes in the laundromat,

604
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,700
you all look around, you have a moment of discomfort

605
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,900
because you're all nude,

606
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,140
but then someone comes and hands you a squirt gun

607
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
and they say, oh, I'm seriously afraid of a squirt gun

608
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,500
and say, well, there's not water in there.

609
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,380
And they say, what is it?

610
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,300
And they say, it's spray tan.

611
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,740
And so then-

612
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,740
You say, goof-oo, I thought it was gonna be piss.

613
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,740
I was so worried you were gonna say piss.

614
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,340
And they say, not this time.

615
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,620
And then you kind of give them a weird look

616
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,900
and they chuckle and they say, I'm just kidding.

617
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,860
It's never piss.

618
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,900
And then you run through like different obstacles

619
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,980
and some of you are on one team

620
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,180
and some of you are on the other.

621
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,220
You shoot at each other

622
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,300
and then you get scrutinized at the end by a judge

623
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,860
who determines how much spray tan stuff ended up on you.

624
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,060
And then they say, you did great.

625
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,300
And you either get celebratory tacos

626
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,740
or like a taco consoling.

627
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,340
Yeah, consolation tacos.

628
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,180
And then, oh, also your clothes are clean.

629
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,420
Have a great day.

630
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,180
And then they put a punch under your punch card.

631
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,020
And if you get 10 of those, you get a free time.

632
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,540
Hey, speaking of the piss soldier, Fred Savage,

633
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,100
I still have his IMDB page open

634
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,060
and his bio on here is a trip, man.

635
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,900
It is wild.

636
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,260
It says the following.

637
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,660
At the age of 12, he was cast the lead role

638
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,940
of the series, The Wonder Years, 1988.

639
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,700
It became a good show

640
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,940
and on the pilot, he got his first kiss.

641
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,660
It became a good show.

642
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,100
This is the beginning.

643
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,140
Oh, okay.

644
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,980
I thought you just fell off your desk chair.

645
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,100
This is what The Wonder Years would sound like

646
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,180
if the singer was pushed down a well.

647
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,940
Anytime Joe Cocker is singing,

648
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,420
he is always about to fall out of his desk chair.

649
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,700
That's the secret too.

650
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,900
He's sitting on a yoga ball.

651
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,580
She can't get through the bathroom window.

652
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,900
Joe, be careful, my friend.

653
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,180
Can we go to the money zone?

654
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,300
We're already there.

655
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,020
This is an ad for Joe Cocker's bargain desk chair.

656
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,220
Sprazor tag.

657
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,820
Lightly used complete sprazor tag with Joe Cocker.

658
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:09,300
This lightly used desk chair.

659
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,380
This is an ad right here.

660
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,940
This is an ad for Ring.

661
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,580
I love Ring.

662
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,540
Ring is a little robot that is attached to your front door

663
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,820
and it looks like a doorbell and it is.

664
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,100
If someone walks up to your door,

665
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,380
they can press this thing

666
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,300
and you'll get a notification on your phone

667
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,540
so you can answer it from anywhere in the world.

668
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,940
They have service, of course,

669
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,300
and you can see what they want.

670
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Hey, what's going on?

671
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,820
It's usually the FedEx person,

672
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,500
but sometimes it could be anybody.

673
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,620
I don't know who's at your door.

674
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,740
This is why you need Ring.

675
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,180
Let me tell you.

676
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,060
Purpose.

677
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,580
Here's the amazing thing about it, right?

678
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,500
Yeah, it gets the people who ring the bell,

679
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,620
but it also just,

680
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,540
if you are worried about packages

681
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,980
being taken off of your porch,

682
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,820
you get motion alerts

683
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,740
even if they don't ring the doorbell

684
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,380
or I actually just found out recently

685
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,100
that there's a neighborhood tab in the Ring app

686
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,460
where you can post or other people will post videos

687
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,140
of people doing shady stuff

688
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,220
and be like, hey, keep an eye out for this person.

689
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,060
Imagine a social network

690
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,300
that is strictly comprised of people in your neighborhood

691
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,940
capturing people being sneaky criminals.

692
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,060
It is worth the price of admission, I think,

693
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,500
and I think, you know what?

694
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,940
Surprisingly affordable price.

695
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,900
I think you should check it out.

696
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,980
We have a special offer on the Ring Starter Kit

697
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,020
available right now

698
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,220
with a video doorbell

699
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,620
and motion-activated floodlight cam.

700
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,020

That's ring.com slash my brother.

705
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,780
I would like to tell you something amazing.

706
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,180
I am very, very excited

707
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,220
because I have just received today

708
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,900
moments before sitting down to record

709
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,260
my first pair of me undies lounge pants.

710
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,540
That's what the doorbell was.

711
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,460
Are you telling me there's fucking lounge pants

712
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,500
in this bag I got?

713
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,640
Yes.

714
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,800
Yes, and here's the thing.

715
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,000
They look like flannel pajama pants,

716
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,600
but they're made out of me undies material.

717
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,680
That micromodal fabric,

718
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,240
which is three times softer than cotton.

719
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,600
And if you've never felt this fabric,

720
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,800
get ready to experience pure bliss in underwear form.

721
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,840
Like I am a little worried, honestly,

722
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,720
that if I wear this micromodal pants

723
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
with my micromodal me undies,

724
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,880
I will be so comfortable

725
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,120
that I will Alex Mack into a puddle.

726
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,840
I'm very excited about it.

727
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,360
But yeah, this holiday plaid I think is real cute.

728
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,960
And also for the Halloween holidays,

729
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,160
I had some like cool like jack-o'-lantern underpants.

730
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,840
I just got so many great underpants

731
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,200
and now shirts and like sweatshirt me undies

732
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,360
is they've got you covered.

733
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,860
Get it?

So go check it out if you haven't.

00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Maybe order some like presents for friends

736
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,480

Jumbotrons for sale, $1 each for Justin and Travis.

748
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,560
What do you say?

749
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,120
Pony up.

750
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,480
I'll take it, but I'll have to owe you the dollar.

751
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,200
All right, so this one's for Sarah and it's from Sarah.

752
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,560
That's where they have the same name.

753
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,080
Just kidding, they're the same person.

754
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,640
Here it goes.

755
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,320
Sarah says to Sarah, surprise.

756
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,020
Is it?

757
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,520
Is it?

758
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,360
Well, Sarah bought this while like hopped up on Ambien.

759
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,000
All right, maybe.

760
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,760
Surprise!

761
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,680
It's random self-appreciation day.

762
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,200
Push the clock ahead an hour to put the kids in bed early tonight.

763
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,760
Pour yourself a glass of wine and dig out the Oreos

764
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,080
that you've been hiding in the Grape-Nuts box.

765
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,120
That's a clever ruse.

766
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,040
Ain't nobody gonna fucking look in there.

767
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
You work incredibly hard and you deserve this.

768
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,400
Great job.

769
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:23,880
P.S.

770
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,040
You just blew up your secret cookie spot.

771
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,720
Remember to find a new one.

772
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Not gonna be as ironclad as Grape-Nuts.

773
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,760
Those things are awful.

774
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,920
Sarah, I love this full-blown grift you have planned on your kids

775
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,120
of like moving every clock in the house forward an hour

776
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,360
so that you can be like, oh, it's bedtime.

777
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,000
And the kids are like, the sun's out and I do not feel tired at all.

778
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,960
And you're like, well, it's eight.

779
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,080
And they're like, I guess you're right.

780
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,120
And they go to bed.

781
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
Can't argue with the clock.

782
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,320
Here's one that is sent in by Benji and it's from Shreds who says,

783
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,000
Ben, and then I have to wait because I scrolled up accidentally.

784
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,640
Ben, you are the kindest, most selfless person I've ever known

785
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
and I'm proud to be your best friend.

786
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,760
Thank you for baking such good pretzels and donuts

787
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,080
and always being there to watch Jeopardy with me

788
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,320
and being the best travel buddy imaginable.

789
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,000
You're the coolest astrophysicist and the best boyfriend ever.

790
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,480
Love you.

791
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,880
Did you boys know?

792
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,960
They have Jeopardy on Netflix and that's not a joke.

793
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,520
What?

794
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,320
Why? Why?

795
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,560
Yeah, yeah.

796
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,240
Hey, Griffin, why, bud?

797
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,560
Yeah, like, yeah.

798
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,680
Unless it's like only like the wildest, too hot for TV Jerry Springer episodes

799
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,400
of Jeopardy that they can't show in syndication

800
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,360
where like, you know, a dude wearing shorts gets excited and a nut comes out.

801
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,160
That one's got to live on dark Netflix.

802
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,880
Since the dawn of time, screenwriters have taken months to craft their stories.

803
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,440
But now three Hollywood professionals shall attempt the impossible.

804
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,480
Break a story in one hour.

805
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,560
That's right. Here on Story Break, I, Freddie Wong, Matt Arnold, and Will Campos,

806
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,440
the creators behind award-winning shows like Video Game High School,

807
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,320
have one hour to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie.

808
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,880
Now, an awesome movie starts with an awesome title.

809
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,280
I chose The Billionaire's Marriage Valley.

810
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,000
Mine was Christmas Pregnant Paradise.

811
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,320
Okay, next we need a protagonist.

812
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,440
So I've heard Wario best described as libertarian, Mark.

813
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,440
And of course, every great movie needs a stellar pitch.

814
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,640
In order to get to heaven, sometimes you got to raise a little hell.

815
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,840
That's the tagline!

816
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,560
Check out Story Break every week on MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

817
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,600
How about another question?

818
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,440
Absolutely. I am pregnant.

819
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,480
Several of my friends are pregnant as well and are due close to the same time as I am.

820
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,400
Our kids will be around each other enough

821
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,120
that having the same names will be annoying and confusing.

822
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,040
Do I announce my potential baby name to stake my claim,

823
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,440
or keep my mouth shut to avoid poaching?

824
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,360
That's from should I name it Bramble Pelt?

825
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,560
No one would steal that.

826
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,240
Yeah, this is not an issue, I feel like.

827
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,920
There's so many names, aren't there?

828
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,040
There's so many freaking names.

829
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,480
So many names these days.

830
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,280
I don't think it's going to be a big problem.

831
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,400
And I think that your friends would understand that if you're like,

832
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,840
I'm going with Dylan, and they're like, well, now I'm going with Dylan.

833
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,640
They're like, okay, well, we can all agree that that's not okay.

834
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,040
Like, that's, yeah.

835
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah, it just, but at the same time, if they had poached the name that,

836
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,560
like, I have friends who have babies around Henry's age.

837
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,880
If they had said, now we're going to do a Henry right before we announced our name,

838
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,640
that would be a big bummer, huh?

839
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,160
It would really take the wind out of my sails.

840
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,600
I, I, I, maybe you do need to stake your claim.

841
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,320
Now, Griffin, you've got me thinking, like, saying the name out loud is more important.

842
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,520
Yeah, or what you could do is you could do what, like, movie studios do

843
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,640
and come up with, like, a fake name that you, you know,

844
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,360
you send out all the film canisters listed as, like, oh, like Blue Harvest.

845
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,720
What?

846
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,200
Blue Harvest is a Star Wars empire, I think.

847
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,240
Oh, damn it.

848
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,640
That's what I was going to name my next kid, though, for real.

849
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,080
You're going to name your kid Blue Harvest?

850
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Blue Harvest McElroy, middle name Jonathan.

851
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,880
Blue Harvest is the first name, all one word.

852
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,440
Here's what you do.

853
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Pick a name that you love and you're excited about and say it's Davis.

854
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
It's a great, powerful name for a child.

855
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,080
It calls to mind Jim Davis and all his great jokes.

856
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,000
So you pick Davis and then your friend, you don't announce it,

857
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,920
but your friend says, proud to announce coming 2019,

858
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,880
the boy Davis, my boy, my boy Davis.

859
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,600
And you say, well, shoot, but you want to get revenge on him,

860
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,880
but you don't want to be so on the nose that you give him the same name and do a rhyme.

861
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,320
Ooh, like Travis.

862
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,800
Travis McElroy.

863
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,520
Oh, you know what you do?

864
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,560
You don't announce it, but, like, your friend's like,

865
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm going to go with Davis and you reach in your back pocket and what's that?

866
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,000
It's an envelope that you mailed to yourself.

867
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,320
Got to.

868
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,000
Where you've written the name Davis inside and they're like, ah, damn it.

869
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,360
You could do an arm wrestle for it.

870
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,440
Arm wrestle for the fated Davis.

871
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,600
I solve most of my problems these days with a good arm wrestle.

872
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,960
That's great too, because you get exercise.

873
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,800
You get exercise and you get stronger arms, which is good,

874
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,560
because arm wrestling is fun and usually pretty low stakes,

875
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,840
except for this one example.

876
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,600
Usually it's pretty low stakes, though.

877
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,720
But when you have an assailant coming at you and you need one strong arm,

878
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,920
that's not going to be low stakes.

879
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,440
That's the that's the real deal.

880
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,560
That's the big show there.

881
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,840
How come there are more fight scenes that are just arm wrestling?

882
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah, or them just using their one big strong arm to fight everybody.

883
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,080
They got huge and jacked from arm wrestling.

884
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,320
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

885
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,520
Yeah, I do actually.

886
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,320
Thank you.

887
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,360
Okay, so this one came in from Cool Ocelot.

888
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,760
Thank you.

889
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,920
It's Yahoo Answers user Abby who asks,

890
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,840
can I trick somebody a Walmart into thinking I had a prize in the claw machine

891
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,040
and it got dropped by the claw machine and I want to have it?

892
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,120
That's really good.

893
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,160
That is a perfect scam.

894
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,440
Yeah, what would be the utility of this, do you think?

895
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,520
Get stuffies.

896
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,200
Hmm.

897
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,960
Maybe it's one of those claw machines where there's like vouchers inside.

898
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,560
Oh, or an iPod Nano and the claw picks it up,

899
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
but then it falls before it goes in the hole.

900
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,880
And then you call over a Walmart employee and say,

901
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,520
hey, just so you know, the claw had the iPod Nano in its grasp

902
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,240
and there must have been a malfunction or a glitch

903
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,800
or some sort of hardware flaw because it fell.

904
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,520
It fell out of the hand before it could go in the prize hole.

905
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,240
So I'm wondering what my sort of like recompense is.

906
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,720
What's our next step here?

907
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,600
What's the next step?

908
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,320
You tell me, do I write a letter to the claws company

909
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,120
or is this a manager that can come in

910
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,440
and just fish that iPod Nano out of there for me?

911
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,720
Because the claw fucking had it.

912
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,880
I don't know what to say.

913
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,560
If you watch the tape, it was there.

914
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,680
Like it was locked and it dropped it.

915
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,440
I didn't drop it.

916
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,560
I didn't drop it.

917
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,520
I did my job.

918
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,480
I told the claw where to go and it went there,

919
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,800
but then it fucked up by dropping it.

920
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,320
Yeah, and it had it.

921
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,800
And you know, here's what I would tell the Walmart employee.

922
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,960
If I was going through the checkout line

923
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,080
and the person checking me out dropped like my carton of eggs,

924
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,800
I feel like you all would get me another carton of eggs.

925
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,520
And this claw machine is your employee and it dropped.

926
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,040
This is still a shop, isn't it?

927
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,000
I bought, excuse me, I bought a stuffed animal

928
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,680
for this vending machine

929
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,520
and just when the claw was over my selection,

930
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,920
it dropped it and this machine is defective.

931
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,000
Listen, if this was a gumball machine

932
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,360
and I put my quarter in and I turned it

933
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,880
and no gumball would come out,

934
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,440
you would open it up and give me a gumball, right?

935
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,720
How is this any different?

936
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,120
Sure, it's got a few more moving parts,

937
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,800
but it's a vending machine, isn't it?

938
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,520
Like at this point,

939
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,720
the person has definitely given you a stuffed animal, right?

940
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,280
For sure.

941
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,440
Yeah, but now it's a principal thing, Justin.

942
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Now I have to continue explaining my,

943
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,360
yes, listen, I appreciate that you've given me

944
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,520
this hilarious Bart Simpson toy,

945
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,080
but I need to continue explaining to you

946
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,400
why I was disappointed by this interaction.

947
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,360
I bought that SpongeBob in there with my own quarter

948
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,120
and made the claw go where it needed to go,

949
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,520
but then as it was retrieving it to the prize hole,

950
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,920
a large boy did bump into the machine

951
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,800
and made the claw drop.

952
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,720
So is that an act of God for the insurance purposes

953
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,000
or what's the deal there?

954
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,640
I had promised this to my nephew, William,

955
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,800
and now he will be so disappointed

956
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,080
if you do not get me that SpongeBob.

957
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,400
Also, have you seen my nephew anywhere?

958
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,560
I got distracted by this vending machine.

959
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,320
I'm very concerned.

960
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Y'all ever see those boys-

961
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,880
Oh no, William's inside the machine.

962
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,320
Well, I was just about to say,

963
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,120
y'all ever seen those boys that do get inside the machine?

964
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,640
And it does happen for real.

965
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,720
It just seems like the machine shouldn't be built

966
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
in a way that would allow that, huh?

967
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,560
Yeah, it also seems like they should have a way

968
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,200
to get the kid out without using the claw.

969
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,400
It's fucked up, right?

970
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,080
That kid's gonna have claw-based nightmares

971
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,960
for the rest of its life,

972
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,600
what with all of its grasping and grabbing at the child,

973
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,040
trying to lift it into the prize hole.

974
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,560
And also, you start to get in,

975
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,640
you're like, well, I put $5 worth of quarters in

976
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,240
and I still haven't gotten that kid out.

977
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,720
I'm out of quarters, I don't know what to do.

978
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,120
How fucking tight would it be if David Blaine was like,

979
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,400
y'all, I got a new stunt.

980
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,800
I might get up in this claw machine

981
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,320
and that'll be my new house for four years.

982
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,240
And then you just point to which toy you want

983
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,880
and I'll drop it down the street.

984
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,160
I'll just drop it in, baby.

985
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,560
No problem at all.

986
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,920
It's not a big deal.

987
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,600
David Blaine, get out of there.

988
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,880
I can't.

989
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,560
I can't, sadly.

990
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,280
But do you want, I don't know, what do we got here?

991
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,120
Oh, is that a copy of Grand Theft Auto?

992
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,320
Here you go.

993
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,760
My adult body's too big for the small claw, unfortunately,

994
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,680
so I live in here and I will die in here.

995
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,000
You can maybe fish my individual bones out of here

996
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,360
in what, 50 years or so.

997
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,520
My magical bones.

998
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,840
Oh, nice, I got David Blaine's skull.

999
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,040
That's the big one.

1000
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,720
I'm gonna scry with it.

1001
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,920
Excuse me, I had David Blaine's skull in the claw

1002
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,440
and it dropped and fell.

1003
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,960
So I'm gonna need you to get that for me.

1004
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,240
Thank you.

1005
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,480
Kermit, do you have a Yahoo's?

1006
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,760
I thought we didn't do a Yahoo.

1007
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,200
I literally just did one, but we can do another one.

1008
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,560
No, I'll do a question.

1009
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,880
You're right, I forgot that we had spun that off of Yahoo.

1010
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,720
I work in a trendy tech startup.

1011
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,560
I just got back from vacation to discover

1012
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,800
that the owner of the company has installed speakers

1013
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,200
throughout the office to play elevator music

1014
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,600
in an effort to combat our noise problem.

1015
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,320
It has only made things exponentially worse.

1016
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,000
However, we discovered that we have access

1017
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,240
to the audio input for these speakers.

1018
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,720
Brothers, what music or sounds can I play

1019
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,320
to cause enough chaos that the owner removes

1020
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,080
the speakers for good?

1021
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,680
That's from disgruntled employee in Florida.

1022
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,840
Can I ask a question?

1023
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,320
Ask her, when you say noise problem,

1024
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,600
do you mean like employees talking to one another?

1025
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,160
Yeah, they don't actually, they say our noise problem

1026
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,360
as though we at some point have been clued in

1027
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,280
as to what this noise problem is.

1028
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,440
Like this is our first time hearing about it.

1029
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,160
So I am not sure what exactly they're referring to.

1030
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,400
When we took BB trick or treating,

1031
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,880
we got into the car and we were driving

1032
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,760
to a friend's house where we all went together

1033
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,120
and took our kids together.

1034
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,200
And Teresa said, you know,

1035
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,280
oh, there's a Halloween station on SiriusXM

1036
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,240
and she flipped to it.

1037
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,920
And it was just spooky sound effects.

1038
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,760
It wasn't like music.

1039
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,200
It was just spooky sound effects.

1040
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,240
Nah, that's good.

1041
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,400
Play it all the time, not just at Halloween.

1042
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,440
Cause things can be spooky even when it's not Halloween, y'all.

1043
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,920
I, we had a great, this great cat over at Vox in the olden days

1044
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,120
who I believe was on our video team.

1045
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,080
And they had a system like this in the bathroom

1046
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,000
that they had rigged.

1047
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,040
And they actually recorded their own,

1048
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,440
their own radio station for people to enjoy

1049
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,080
in the bathroom called Bathtunes,

1050
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,840
if my memory serves me correctly.

1051
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,280
And they would record interviews with people in the office.

1052
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,720
And play them in this bathroom radio station.

1053
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,560
And they of course had their own songs

1054
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,040
that they had programmed in to this radio station

1055
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,640
that they were sort of running.

1056
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,360
But they had also put in a lot of different interviews

1057
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,480
with different employees that was for Bathtunes.

1058
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,440
So I think if you want to get a little more creative with it,

1059
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,240
you could always run your own pirate radio station

1060
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,920
about the office comings and goings.

1061
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,800
And you know what I found?

1062
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,360
I actually have a pretty good experience with,

1063
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,960
if you do things like this that make your,

1064
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,800
especially like a tech startup,

1065
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,720
that make it, or like a tech, you know,

1066
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,840
like a Trinity tech company.

1067
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,040
If you do things like this that make your office seem like fun

1068
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,280
and quirky, like a cool place to work,

1069
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,480
sometimes it can get you out of doing real work.

1070
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,160
When I, when I was at Best Buy,

1071
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,280
I used to try to sell karaoke machines

1072
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,320
by setting up a playlist and doing karaoke

1073
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,960
by myself in the middle of the Best Buy.

1074
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,200
Just like doing whatever tunes I felt like,

1075
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,480
trying to sell karaoke machines

1076
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,680
and the ill-fated music streaming service, Rhapsody,

1077
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,200
if memory serves correctly.

1078
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,800
So I would try to sell the two karaoke machines

1079
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,520
that we had in the store.

1080
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,800
I would open one of them, completely void its worth,

1081
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,160
and then I would just do karaoke.

1082
00:46:59,160 --> 00:46:59,640
But you know what?

1083
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,480
It made it seem like a fun place to be

1084
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,760
and a fun place to shop.

1085
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,160
And I got out of working for like four hours.

1086
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,840
So maybe you could swing something like that.

1087
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,400
Have you thought about a fart?

1088
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,240
But hear me out.

1089
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,400
It would start out really quiet.

1090
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,800
And so people would look around and be like,

1091
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,120
uh-oh, and then the next day you'd bump it up

1092
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,240
like half a decibel.

1093
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,160
And you would keep doing that

1094
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,080
and see how long it took for people to realize

1095
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,840
it's coming from the speakers above you.

1096
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,080
And maybe you record it with like a binaural microphone

1097
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,000
so it sounds really realistic.

1098
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,720
And you could maybe choose which speaker it kind of favors.

1099
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,120
So people are like, uh-oh, it's definitely uncounting.

1100
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,720
But then the next day it really sounds like

1101
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,080
it's coming from, you know, customer relations or whatever.

1102
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,520
That's my first funny joke.

1103
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,760
My second one is what if it played,

1104
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,240
what if it played the pizza music from Spider-Man 2

1105
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,760
that it played the game

1106
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,680
and it just constantly got faster every time it finished.

1107
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,920
And that would help with your efficiency as a company

1108
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,440
because everybody's going to be working so fast

1109
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,200
because of the fast pizza music.

1110
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,040
Can I, Griffin, can I take your idea

1111
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,320
and spin it a little bit?

1112
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:03,820
Classic.

1113
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,100
Mm-hmm.

1114
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,620
What if you took the fart idea, right?

1115
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,820
And what you did is you started-

1116
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,020
Oh, I thought you were going to do the pizza idea.

1117
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,140
This is a better one.

1118
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,140
Either one works really for this idea.

1119
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,500
You start it at a like really, really incredibly low

1120
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,740
imperceptible volume and it's a constant.

1121
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,540
And then you just slowly, and I mean slowly,

1122
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,820
this might take weeks, increase the volume

1123
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,020
little by little by little

1124
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,980
until eventually everyone's so used to it

1125
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,540
that they don't even notice it till they leave the building

1126
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,340
and now the outside is too much for them to bear

1127
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,180
because of the eternal quiet.

1128
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,020
I miss my wife's farting noises.

1129
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,220
I can't sleep without them.

1130
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:44,060
I feel embarrassed about the farting noises.

1131
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,260
I feel like it's below me.

1132
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,140
The Spider-Man 2 one was like a funny idea

1133
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,500
and like a really good reference.

1134
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,900
Yeah, yeah, everyone was crazy about it.

1135
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,740
Oh, I've got one.

1136
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,340
Can I save it from your fart?

1137
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,540
Can I save it, Griffin?

1138
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,380
I mean, I kind of already did with Lincoln's Spider-Man,

1139
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:58,880
but go ahead.

1140
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,800
What if you made it just a recording

1141
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,200
of different voices of people in the office

1142
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,040
calling out your boss's name?

1143
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,840
Hmm.

1144
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,840
Oh, they're all over the place then.

1145
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:08,960
Yeah.

1146
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,080
That's amazing, Travis.

1147
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,960
Good job.

1148
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,080
I thought that that was going to be so much horseshit,

1149
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,680
but it turned into something.

1150
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,040
Thank you.

1151
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,720
Yeah, no problem.

1152
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,640
Or, oh, just get a recording of whatever the noise problem is

1153
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,480
that you have in your office and play that.

1154
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Play that over again over the speakers.

1155
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,720
Over again over the speakers.

1156
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,840
What is the noise problem?

1157
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,000
Can we get some clarity, please?

1158
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,760
It's like playing the pizza theme music outside so loud.

1159
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,320
And the only way to cancel it out

1160
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
is to play the opposite of it.

1161
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,720
Could you play the opening four bars of Amber by 311?

1162
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,240
But every time it gets deeper.

1163
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,600
If you play Santeria at full volume

1164
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,600
enough times in a circuit,

1165
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,360
eventually so many people will quit that you will be the boss.

1166
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,880
Is the enough times once?

1167
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,720
Now listen, that's not allowed.

1168
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,480
Hey, hey, we don't joke like that on this podcast.

1169
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,080
That's not allowed.

1170
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,280
Have we done an hour yet?

1171
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,520
Yeah, folks, that's an hour.

1172
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,560
Thank you so much for joining us

1173
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,720
for this episode of the podcast.

1174
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,400
I wanna say stop, stop.

1175
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,200
I wanna say happy birthday to both of my beloved brothers.

1176
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,600
They turn ages tomorrow.

1177
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,640
Thank you.

1178
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,760
The day we're recording this.

1179
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,040
What's it gonna be, 37, 34?

1180
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,960
Nope, close, 35, 38.

1181
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,160
Oh my God.

1182
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,600
Okay.

1183
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,680
That's so high.

1184
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,480
Hi, all right, thank you.

1185
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,120
I really like 35 as a number.

1186
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,800
Yeah, you can finally go for president,

1187
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,040
which apparently anybody can do.

1188
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,920
And happy birthday, boys.

1189
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,120
I love you both so much.

1190
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,640
And I'm glad that you just are here with me

1191
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,200
and just doing a great job every day.

1192
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,920
So celebrate one, pour one out five days ago

1193
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,760
when you hear this for Justin and Travis.

1194
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,320
Titans among boys.

1195
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,520
Wow, what a beautiful tribute to us,

1196
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,120
to me and Travis both.

1197
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,520
We appreciate it, Griffin, thank you.

1198
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,000
I must have very excited-

1199
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,680
Stop, do you maybe wanna say something about me?

1200
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,840
Do you maybe wanna say something about me?

1201
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,360
Happy birthday to Griffin.

1202
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,920
Happy birthday to Griffin, of course.

1203
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,560
Can you say I'm a Titan among boys?

1204
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,960
You're a Titan among boys.

1205
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,440
This is the end of the podcast, of course,

1206
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,240
where the words are sure to stop any second now.

1207
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,360
We promise.

1208
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,440
We promise, we can assure you of this.

1209
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,320
I don't wanna, I don't have anything to promote, okay?

1210
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,760
Okay, was that just that?

1211
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,920
Oh, I thought you were gonna, all right.

1212
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,040
Buy the Sawbones book.

1213
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,720

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,920
we got t-shirts up now at McElroyMerch.com

1222
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,200
where you can decide between a dog with human hands

1223
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,480
or a cat with a human face.

1224
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,520
Oh yeah.

1225
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,240
They are so good.

1226
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,200
Louis Zong made them.

1227
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
They're my favorite shit ever.

1228
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,960
But you're only gonna have till the 15th

1229
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,800
to order these shirts is a very limited run

1230
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,840
because the joke won't be funny after then.

1231
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,320
That's about how long the expiration date is on this.

1232
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,840
So go get it.

1233
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,600
And also coming out November 16th,

1234
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,160
there's a Cincinnati Underground Society Show.

1235
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,280
You can get tickets for that

1236
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,120
if you're going to be anywhere in Cincinnati.

1237
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,280
Come out, you can get tickets at bit.ly slash

1238
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,200
cusnovember2018 and come see me

1239
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,320
and all our super fun guests and join the society.

1240
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,560
I just wanna say apologize for being sick

1241
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,000
for a month and a half now.

1242
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,640
Wow.

1243
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,320
On every recording that we've done.

1244
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,680
It's not a permanent thing.

1245
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,000
Eventually my body's gonna beat it and-

1246
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,680
You say that, Griffin,

1247
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,760
but I've known you since you were a child.

1248
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,560
Yeah, yeah.

1249
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,760
Yeah, I've had some nose issues

1250
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,600
and it must be bad to listen to.

1251
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,040
There's one episode where everybody thought

1252
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,480
I had been replaced and I'll never tell.

1253
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,920
Do you guys want the final Yahoo?

1254
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,320
Yep.

1255
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:34,560
Yeah.

1256
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,640
I didn't pick one, but I'll use one of the other ones.

1257
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,640
Yeah, this one's pretty good.

1258
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,560
It was sent in by level 9,000 Yadru Dru,

1259
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,360
Dru Davenport.

1260
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,120
Thanks, Dru.

1261
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,640
It's Yadru Answers user, Guy, who asks,

1262
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,160
when is Santa's birthday?

1263
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,160
My name is Justin McElroy.

1264
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,440
I'm Travis McElroy.

1265
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,480
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1266
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,680
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1267
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:13,200
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1268
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,520
You wake up, eat a tasty meal with some new friends,

1269
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,560
some old friends,

1270
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,480
maybe the host of your favorite podcasts.

1271
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,200
After that, it's a couple of inspiring classes,

1272
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,040
spectacular podcast tapings,

1273
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,720
a hilarious stand-up showcase,

1274
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,720
a dance party, and more.

1275
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,840
And s'mores!

1276
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,080
All of this can be yours at Max Fun Con,

1277
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,160
returning to Lake Arrowhead next June.

1278
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,960
Tickets go on sale Friday, November 23rd.

1279
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,080
Put that on your calendar

1280
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,800
because Max Fun Con tickets always sell out.

1281
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,040
