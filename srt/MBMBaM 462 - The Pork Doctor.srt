1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,480
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,120
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,720
McElroy. And I am your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I tried to do a normal one.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,600
I tried to think, like, how's a normal person just say the introduction to, like, a normal,

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,240
happy person. I thought about, like, I'm unhappy, just like, sure, it doesn't need to be weird just

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,720
because I feel weird about doing it. Just like, how do you say your name? Yeah, I thought about,

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,560
like, what if I did, like, a howl in the middle of mine? See, it doesn't need to be that every

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,480
single fucking time. Yeah, or it doesn't need to be that. We're near 500. We can't keep, we can't

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,640
keep escalating. Introducing the program. My name's Justin. I'm a person. I got two brothers.

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,320
We do this show. Just because I feel weird about introducing a show doesn't mean I have to make it

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,560
weird while I'm doing it. It's hard to get comfortable in my own skin. What with this weird

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,440
hair everywhere, this new hair that everybody else is so excited about, but I'm so, so scared

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,240
about this hair. I think as long as you say it- Pubes and all? Yes. No, yeah. I think as long as

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,760
you say it as a statement of fact rather than, I'm Travis McElroy, right? Rather than, I'm Travis

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,200
McElroy, don't make it sound like a question. Statement. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,000
McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy, and I do hate my pubic hair. Griffin hates his pubes. I want to

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,280
tell you guys a story. We often get into the email like a weird thing happened to me in the bathroom.

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,480
What do I do? Am I good? Mostly. That's like 28% of the questions we get. Yes. I would like to share

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,600
my own, and I want to preface by saying it's not blue. This is not, it's not a blue story. It's

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:44,000
brown. Okay. Okay, Griffin. Justin, did you hear? Thank you. Play the noise. When dad and I flew

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,400
into the Los Angeles airport for the Dungeons and Dragons live stream- A lot of weird bathroom users

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,800
in there. Well, this was in the LAX bathroom. There was a line, men's room line, and I was

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,640
nearing the front of the line. The person in front of me stepped to use the stall, and I hope to God,

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,360
I presume an employee of the airport in a vest, I believe a turtleneck, and they had a laminated

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,800
badge, stepped up, stepped in front of me, faced me, and said, number one or number two. Okay, so

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,840
hold on. They had a turtleneck on? Yes. Was it like a uniform? Was it like LAX uniform? You have to

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,400
wear a turtleneck like a Steve Jobs? Oh God, I hope so. Because the other option is just a

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,040
passerby said either A, I'm going to help direct traffic, or B, I'm a big old bathroom pervert.

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,640
It's one of those two. And looked me in the eye, another human, another human being looked me in

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
my human eyes and said, number one or number two. It could be both. It could be both a

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,520
bathroom pervert and an employee. It seems like a great job. I thought you were saying it can be

36
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,600
number, both number one and number two, as it always is for me. I can't have one without the

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,800
other. And so I said, number one, like without thinking, because I was so terrified. And it was

38
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,640
number one. It was number one. And then this person simply directed me, as I said, number one,

39
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,440
a urinal became open, and they directed me towards the urinal. And all I could think is like,

40
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,280
that's what I would have done. What purpose? Why did you ask me? But then you look to the

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,080
left and you saw an old, old man just having a shit in the urinal. And that's what you knew.

42
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,200
I think what they were trying to solve for is a problem that happens in men's rooms all across

43
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,480
this great land. And if you traditionally go to a bathroom that only has toilets and no urinals,

44
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,560
you wouldn't be aware of this. When you go in, sometimes there's a bifurcation of the line.

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,240
So there's urinals available, but no toilets available. And you're just kind of haunting.

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,760
Oh, okay.

47
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,440
It's going to be like that. It's going down like that. And you have to like wave

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,880
other people onto the urinals. Like, go ahead. Yeah, that's no, I'm just going to go ahead.

49
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,400
I'm going to wait for one of the little closets here.

50
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,920
While I understand that, I still stand by that there is a better way to ask that question

51
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,080
than number one or number two.

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,000
I mean, I will, y'all have given this person way too much credit. This is a profoundly

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,680
discriminatory, not inclusive thing, right? Like not everybody goes number one in a urinal.

54
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,720
So fucking chill out, partner. Also, the other thing is, Travis, you should have just said like,

55
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,000
I always forget which one they are and I have to make shitties.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,720
So can you tell me which one?

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
I need to make dirt.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,280
I'm making a dirty mess. So can you tell me which one is it?

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,600
I always forget.

60
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Which one do I make dirt in?

61
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,000
I already made pissies on the plane and now I need to make shitties.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Can you tell me which one it is?

63
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,920
If somebody said number one or number two to me, you know what number I'd give them?

64
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,880
38. That's my age of the years that I have. That's my number of years.

65
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,040
Yeah.

66
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,760
And I'm just going to go wherever I feel like going.

67
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,040
We've got a big man with a big swirly gray mustache says,

68
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm a kindred spirit. I also make 38.

69
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,600
I also need to go 38. And let me ask you, how do you get it out of your belly button?

70
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
How do you polish the tool afterwards?

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,760
He steps into a stall and just tendrils start shooting out of it.

72
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Like the birthing scene in Men in Black.

73
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,000
You hear steam like whistling through some kind of steampunk device.

74
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Trav, you brought up the Dungeons and Dragons thing.

75
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,680
I know you caught some FaceTime with some famos.

76
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,000
I did.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,920
And I just want to know if you had any interactions.

78
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Did you get that Lillard stink on you?

79
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,280
I did. He was nice. He was a very nice person, that Matthew Lillard.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,160
I had a lot of fun playing the Dungeons and or Dragons with everyone.

81
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
I don't give a shit about that.

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
Let me tell you about Joe Manganiello.

83
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,480
I want to hear about famos or nothing.

84
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,400
Yes. I'm going to tell you about Joe Manganiello.

85
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,920
A mountain of a person.

86
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:22,800
Perhaps the largest, just square footage wise, largest human being I have ever been beside.

87
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
Yep. The fridge is what we call him.

88
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
At one point, he stood in front of me and blocked out the sun.

89
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,720
Listen, I'm not the biggest person in the world.

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,520
I'm 5'10", but I'm a fairly broad 5'10".

91
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,680
And I felt like a tiny child in his presence.

92
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Like, I think he could have juggled me.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,880
How many of his big D20s just turned into ash in his hand when he just crushed it with so many bones?

94
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,560
I watched him try to eat a peanut butter cracker and it just turned to crumbs in his hand.

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
And then he said, I wrecked it.

96
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,320
And he started punching through buildings.

97
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah.

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,320
He's a dad figure.

99
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,880
Dad showed me a picture of him with him and I said, oh, two dads.

100
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,720
There's my two dads that I have.

101
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
My dad and my real dad, my bio dad.

102
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
My big bone crushing fridge dad.

103
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,160
My big strong dad and my regular dad.

104
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
Enough of this Hollywood bullshit.

105
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,200
Thank you.

106
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,680
Whoa.

107
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

108
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,240
Wait, really?

109
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,760
Yeah, I am going to go to the bathroom.

110
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,040
Number one and number two.

111
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Number one, Justin.

112
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,840
Okay.

113
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
This has been so fun, but I'll just be right back.

114
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,560
Okay, I visited my grandmother over the weekend and we started to watch a show together.

115
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,840
We watched two episodes before I left and promised to text about the episodes as we

116
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,320
watched them.

117
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,800
Problem is, from the third episode on, there have been many sex scenes, some of which are

118
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
relevant to the plot.

119
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,920
How can I binge a show and talk about it with my grandma when folks are blatantly getting

120
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,320
it on?

121
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
That's from Chaste in Chicago.

122
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,360
And folks, if you don't start sending in fucking relevant information in these questions, I'm

123
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
losing my mind right now.

124
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,760
How on earth would you think we don't need to know what the show is, right?

125
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
What if it's mad about you?

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
And I'm supposed to talk about Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt.

127
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,480
I've got all this great Reiser material, Reiser shine, etc.

128
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,120
Yes.

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,920
And I can't fucking do any of it because I don't know what show you're watching.

130
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,720
Yeah, there's a lot of porking and mad about you.

131
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,520
I'm going to email them.

132
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm going to email them right now.

133
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,880
And let's find out if we get an answer by the end of the show if it is mad about you.

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Just send a, just send mad about you?

135
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,240
Question mark?

136
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,720
Twas it?

137
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,680
Twas it?

138
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
Twas it mad about you?

139
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,320
Twas it?

140
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,520
Um, first of all, don't be so close minded.

141
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,760
Your mom's mom or dad's mom probably, I mean, they porked at some point and that's why you're

142
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,560
here, right?

143
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,280
In a roundabout way, their porking led to your parents porking, which led to you.

144
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,720
Even if your parents happen to be adopted by this grandparent, I can't guarantee they

145
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,440
porked at some point.

146
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
They probably porked.

147
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,840
Yeah, they probably did pork.

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
That's a good thing to say.

149
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,280
That's one good thing is like, I'm glad you did this probably.

150
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,920
You know what I mean?

151
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,600
Like, I'm glad that you probably, I'm glad you probably did this because otherwise I

152
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
wouldn't be sharing this moment with you.

153
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,520
Maybe like when you get to that sexy and like, text your grandma and say like, I really like

154
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,680
this episode, but I was confused by that one scene where they seem to be just slamming

155
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,280
their bodies into each other.

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,080
What's that about?

157
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,040
They were really slapping shanks and I'm not quite sure what the purpose of that was, grandma.

158
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
So tell me now.

159
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,400
What was even happening there?

160
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,960
What's that?

161
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,760
What is that?

162
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,840
Did that hurt them?

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,520
Did that hurt them?

164
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,760
They seem to be in pain of some sort.

165
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
I couldn't place it.

166
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Are they okay?

167
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,200
They seem to be laying down in bed, but very exhausted.

168
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
So please tell me why it was.

169
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,760
Did they run?

170
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,320
Are they okay?

171
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
What happened?

172
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,760
Is it a sickness?

173
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,840
Justin, are you done drafting the email?

174
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,360
Yeah, the email has been sent.

175
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,840
All right.

176
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,400
And now we wait.

177
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,360
Chased in Chicago.

178
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
Option two, you text your grandma and be like, I really like this episode, especially the

179
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,400
part where they fucked.

180
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,600
Or you could just-

181
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
No, that's nothing.

182
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,680
That's not helpful.

183
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah, sometimes you just say stuff that's not helpful.

184
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,680
And it's a joke of how bad helpful it is.

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,800
Then what would you do?

186
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
I mean, unless it was like, you know, Skinamax.

187
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
I bet there was stuff that happened in the episode that was not slapping shanks.

188
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,280
But then you would worry, like if you said, like, I thought the car chase was really good

189
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,600
and all that negotiation scene was so tense.

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
And then grandma writes back, like, what'd you think about the fucking?

191
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
Then you are probably in the clear.

192
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
And this question doesn't matter anymore, Travis.

193
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,080
I would argue that that is best case scenario.

194
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,360
Okay, then what if it's a little more subtle and it's just like, what do you think about

195
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,160
the rest of it?

196
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
And then a winky face of a-

197
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
And then a winky face and maybe like an eggplant.

198
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,400
An emoji of two ham shanks that are moving in together.

199
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,840
They're slapping together one might say.

200
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,560
Oh, I thought you like maybe got like an apartment together.

201
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,800
Maybe like, what about this?

202
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,840
Oopsie snack time.

203
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,520
Saying something like that to your grandma when the sex starts.

204
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,440
Like, oops, oops-a-daisy snack time.

205
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,080
I don't know if you're syncing up your watch, are you?

206
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah, I don't know if you're live texting it.

207
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,680
That was what I imagined.

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,800
Why else would you text?

209
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,160
Text about the episodes as we watch them.

210
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,880
So wait a minute.

211
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm just going to get a bunch of fuck.

212
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,480
I'll be middle of my day and my grandma is going to be like, oh man, I'll tell you what,

213
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
the rock has really got these ballers around his finger, huh?

214
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,280
Anyway, I can't believe he went to this-

215
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,720
Wait, did you get the answer back?

216
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Is it ballers?

217
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,560
Did you get the answer back?

218
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
No, I don't know.

219
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,240
It's just a guess.

220
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,120
It seems the right.

221
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,680
It's, it felt good in the moment.

222
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,320
Yeah, grandma's like ballers.

223
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
I sure hope that R-E and E hug it out.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm betting it's either ballers or entourage.

225
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,880
That's my bet.

226
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,600
You think it might be entourage?

227
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,120
It's definitely ballers.

228
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
It feels like it's probably ballers.

229
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,640
Okay.

230
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,560
A show that may only exist.

231
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,800
I feel like ballers, okay, I feel this way about a lot of entertainment programming,

232
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,360
but I feel this way definitely about ballers where it's like a fake, it's like a facade.

233
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
Yeah, and if I walked in through the front, like on a sound stage,

234
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,200
if I walked in through the front door of ballers,

235
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,680
it would just be two by four supports and paint, paint claws and everything.

236
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
Like there's no actual show in there.

237
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,400
Like you're not actually, like they only shoot enough to do like the montage

238
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,680
of please don't cancel your HBO because Game of Thrones ended.

239
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,960
We got lots of other things.

240
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,000
It's like at some point, like somebody said to Dwayne The Rock Johnson,

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,360
like, hey, we're good friends, right?

242
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,640
Will you come see my community theater production of Cats or something?

243
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,720
And Dwayne The Rock Johnson said, I can't, I'm in a new show that I need to film.

244
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
And they're like, oh, what's the show about?

245
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,960
It's like, it's called Ballers.

246
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
And it's a real show.

247
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,320
It's definitely a real show.

248
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,640
And then they're like, well, I can't wait to see previews for it.

249
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,880
He was like, oh, and then he had to go to someone and said,

250
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
please help me make previews, but we can't say what day or time it's on.

251
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,560
We don't want people to watch it.

252
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,000
And so it only exists in preview form.

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
Okay, so just a quick update.

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,160
I am looking at a Vulture recap of season one, episode three of Ballers,

255
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
which would be the inciting episode.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
It's called Move the Chains.

257
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
And here's just a little excerpt from their recap.

258
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
Thanks to this episode, I practically see Reggie's whole arc

259
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,080
mapped out for the rest of the season.

260
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,000
While he claims to be looking out for his boy Vernon,

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
even telling Spencer he's mostly pissed that he wasn't consulted

262
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,960
about the ideas that he had for his friend and his brand,

263
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,120
we later learned that that's all bullshit.

264
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,600
And then more stuff, more stuff, more stuff, next paragraph.

265
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,960
But enough about Reggie.

266
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,240
Let's get to Ricky smashing Alonzo's mom.

267
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,800
So it seems like maybe this is Ballers.

268
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
It could be Ballers.

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,240
Because I think episode three is the episode,

270
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,600
if I remember correctly, let me go through my notes.

271
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
This is the one where Ricky does smash Alonzo's mom.

272
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,040
So it could be Ballers.

273
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Can you just text your grandma about the artistry, right?

274
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
I'm really believing this.

275
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,240
This is appropriate.

276
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,880
I love the lighting, you know, like that kind of thing.

277
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,280
Oh, it seems like they hired an intimacy director.

278
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,040
This seems very realistic.

279
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
Is that a dog?

280
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,820
Yeah.

281
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,320
Is that a dog?

282
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
How do you think I'm feeding my family?

283
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,320
Podcasts?

284
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
It's like a fight choreographer, Griffin,

285
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,280
but instead of the two ham shanks punching each other,

286
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,040
you choreographed the two ham shanks.

287
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,680
Stop, stop, stop.

288
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,760
You guys know more about movies and drama and theater

289
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
and the arts than I do because you went to college

290
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,040
for some of that stuff.

291
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,680
Yes.

292
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,960
Is this a real joke you're telling me

293
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,800
or is this dry olive garden pasta?

294
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,080
No, this is a real thing.

295
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,320
Intimacy director is hired to choreograph love scenes

296
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,160
and really any kind of physical intimacy.

297
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Love scenes!

298
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,520
Yes, love scenes, Griffin.

299
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,400
Not just physical love, but perhaps other kinds of love

300
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,240
so that everyone on set feels comfortable and it's realistic.

301
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,520
I think that that's important, right?

302
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,800
Making sure everybody feels comfortable.

303
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,960
I just am imagining something to be like,

304
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
you guys know what Porkin's all about.

305
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,480
I think that's the opposite of them making everyone

306
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,520
feel comfortable, Griffin.

307
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,800
The reason Griffin had a hard time believing

308
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,600
that intimacy coordinator is a real thing

309
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,920
is because Rob Schneider did not make a movie

310
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,720
where he stars as a-

311
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,920
Right?

312
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,680
I mean, because of the absence of the Rob Schneider movie,

313
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,760
like the Pork Doctor or whatever the fuck he'd call it.

314
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,840
I mean, it would be the Sexspert, which is unfortunate

315
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,880
because that'd be our brand.

316
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,080
It sucks for Travis especially.

317
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,360
Drunk through the mud.

318
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,280
But that's why he had a hard time believing it

319
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
because it's not a Rob Schneider movie already.

320
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,040
I just, now that you've explained why,

321
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,840
it makes a lot of sense.

322
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,120
I think it's an important role.

323
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,640
But my brain immediately went to,

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,840
so you guys ever done kissing?

325
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:40,960
Kissing.

326
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,800
How about a Yahoo?

327
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,400
Yeah, I'd love that, Griff.

328
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,800
Thank you.

329
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,480
I have a miniature one here.

330
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
It's not gonna be a good jump have for discussion,

331
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,480
but when I read it, I laughed for like a minute straight.

332
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,600
It made me very happy.

333
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,080
Jack sent this one on Thinks Jack.

334
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,800
It's Yahoo Answers user, Greta, with all caps.

335
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
Greta, who's a very recent member.

336
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,520
Greta asks, I have a TV that talk, but no picture?

337
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,520
Huh?

338
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
I have a TV that talk, but no picture.

339
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
My TV talks.

340
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,640
My TV does talk, but it doesn't produce picture.

341
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,920
It talks the sound of the show.

342
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,000
The thing is, I think it's easy to assume

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,840
that you're hearing the sounds from TV,

344
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,480
but Griffin, well, that's the TV just talks.

345
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
Okay, let's get into this, yeah.

346
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
I've been watching The Americans and Keri Russell

347
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
sometimes speak American on that show.

348
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
Sometimes they'll speak English,

349
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
sometimes they'll speak Russian,

350
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,440
but you're saying that it's the TV.

351
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,640
Uh-huh, and it's just like, hello, Greta.

352
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
It could be the TV.

353
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,120
We don't know for sure.

354
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
And you like TV, because here's the thing,

355
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,760
my Amazon Alexa talks to me sometimes.

356
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
What if this just went a step further

357
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,280
and was just like, hey, Greta, and you're like,

358
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,360
hey, TV, please turn on picture.

359
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
And the TV was like, no.

360
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,480
And you're like, what?

361
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,520
The screen's all fucked up,

362
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,000
but they're in the big throne room,

363
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
and the dragon seems very angry,

364
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,360
and you know what?

365
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,160
I do want actually my spin on the Game of Thrones finale

366
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
because it could be a softened sort of blow.

367
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,840
Would you enjoy that, Greta?

368
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,760
Uh, no, TV, I think I'd just rather watch it.

369
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,600
Could you show it to me?

370
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
This part's dirty.

371
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Your mom told me to not let you see the dirty parts.

372
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,920
So this part's dirty.

373
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
It's totally fine.

374
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
My mom left, but before she did,

375
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,080
she said, and tell TV it's okay to see the dirty parts.

376
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
So Greta's watching.

377
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
It's really dirty, though.

378
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
Greta's watching Ballers episode three

379
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,520
and fucking Denny's walking up towards Alonso's mom

380
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,800
and starts to pull his pants down.

381
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
The screen just cuts to black,

382
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,840
and Greta's like, what the fuck?

383
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,640
And then Greta's like,

384
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,960
uh, he pulled his pants right back up.

385
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
He pulled them right back up.

386
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,040
He pulled them right back up.

387
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,640
And then he took her up for ice cream.

388
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,920
Took her to Wendy's.

389
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,960
They got a Frosty together.

390
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,680
He took her home.

391
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,040
He pulled his pants up and said, I gotta get to church.

392
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,720
And then that was the end of the scene.

393
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,080
Do you have a real Yahoo?

394
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,360
Uh, yeah, sure.

395
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,160
Here's one that was sent in by Jeremy S.

396
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,280
Important science question.

397
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
We're very good at these.

398
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,040
Thanks, Jeremy.

399
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,760
It's Yahoo Answers user, Lana, who does ask,

400
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
what happens if you eat pudding mix

401
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,120
and then drink a bunch of milk?

402
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
Does it turn to pudding in your stomach?

403
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,400
Well, not if you don't shake around a bunch.

404
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,480
You gotta shake around a whole bunch.

405
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,280
Come on.

406
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,920
Get one of those old timey shaky belts that they have

407
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,280
on like funny TV shows about like how whack old stuff was

408
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,480
and give it to jiggle and jiggle and jiggle year round.

409
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,400
And then, I guess you'll die.

410
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,000
It's not, yeah, you'll probably, no, you'll be fine.

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,040
I mean, first off, I bet it would taste pretty good

412
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,360
in that same way that like that dirty way

413
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,920
where if you get a big chunk of chocolate milk mix,

414
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,400
you know what I mean?

415
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
Oh, you like that?

416
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,800
Yeah, it's good.

417
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,600
I like that.

418
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,640
I think that that's good.

419
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
I don't like it.

420
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,680
Really, okay.

421
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,480
It's powdery.

422
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,640
Yeah, okay.

423
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,040
I like the marshmallows.

424
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
In chocolate milk mix?

425
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,280
Yeah, sometimes they have marshmallows in them.

426
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,780
Do they?

427
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,240
Seems like maybe you've never had chocolate milk mix, Griffin.

428
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
I thought you said hot chocolate.

429
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,840
You did not think he said that.

430
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,320
He didn't think I said that.

431
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,000
He twice, he repeated himself.

432
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
I shoot chocolate milk all the fucking time.

433
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,280
Child.

434
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,720
Uh-huh.

435
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
When was the last time you had chocolate milk?

436
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:46,880
Now.

437
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,600
From a mix.

438
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,720
From a mix.

439
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,040
Right.

440
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,600
From a mix.

441
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,840
Right.

442
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, you're having it now, you said.

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm having it right now.

444
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,040
Shit, listen.

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,720
You're loving it.

446
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,040
Wait, what is happening?

447
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,760
This is sonically, this is sonically the worst part of my life.

448
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
I don't care for this at all.

449
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,960
This one afternoon, this one May afternoon when I was 38

450
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,800
was sonically the worst thing that ever happened.

451
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,440
Oh, that's weird.

452
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,760
I thought you liked chocolate milk mix because that's the sound it makes.

453
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,120
That's weird that you fucking said that.

454
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
I've read the instructions for pudding a lot.

455
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,760
I've made my fair share of pudding, not to brag.

456
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,440
I made my fair share of pudding.

457
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,800
But you prefer British pudding, the proper the Queen's pudding.

458
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
A delicious pud.

459
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,760
Listen, I love a pud and I love to make a pud.

460
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,040
No, actually, judging by the leftovers I have every Christmas,

461
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,360
empirically, we don't all love a pudding.

462
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Some people would prefer to leave the pudding where it is

463
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,680
and maybe at the store bought key lime pie.

464
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,520
I bought two anyway.

465
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,680
I don't want to get hung up on a lot of Christmas angst,

466
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,160
but not once have I seen in the directions

467
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,120
and also include a bunch of fucking stomach acid

468
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
and bile into the into the equation.

469
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,040
That's not part of the recipe.

470
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,560
Just because you have two of the components

471
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,800
doesn't mean we're not going to wang it with some extra ones.

472
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,840
I also would say, while I appreciate the scientific nature of this question,

473
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,800
you're missing out on the enjoyment of the pudding.

474
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,080
Like if this did work, you wouldn't mix it together in your tummy

475
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,160
and then like say like, mmm.

476
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
It would not become pudding.

477
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,800
Now I have pudding.

478
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,120
Right.

479
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,080
It wouldn't become pudding at the point at which it is important

480
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,600
that it is pudding, which is just, if not more so,

481
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
prior to going in your mouth.

482
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
Have you had pudding today?

483
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,840
Not yet.

484
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
But give me a second and then I will have had pudding.

485
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
Let me throw myself down this set of stairs

486
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,680
and then I will have had pudding.

487
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
Let me shake up my tummy.

488
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,300
Right.

489
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Roll me down this meadow, this buttercup covered hill

490
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,640
and perhaps at the bottom of it, I will have had pudding today.

491
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,280
Put me in this big barrel and roll me over the falls

492
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
and then there will have been pudding the whole time.

493
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
Put me in coach.

494
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,760
I'm ready to make pudding today.

495
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,360
There are very few foods where the flavor or texture of it

496
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
isn't designed for the mouth.

497
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,560
You guys ever think about that?

498
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,600
Wait, what?

499
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,920
There are very few foods

500
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,600
where the flavor isn't designed for the mouth.

501
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
Where the flavor and texture of it

502
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,640
is designed to be enjoyed once it's in your belly.

503
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,080
Like that's the peak of it.

504
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,640
All right.

505
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,800
Yeah, there's booze.

506
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,120
Yeah, that's one of them.

507
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,240
But I wouldn't say that's a food.

508
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
And I think if you do think that's a food, that sucks.

509
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,000
But I would say any carbonated beverage

510
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
where once again a beverage isn't a food, I get that.

511
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,120
But where you're almost guaranteed to make burpees.

512
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,280
You guys are really throwing up some real fucking air balls

513
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,480
right now, some real bricks.

514
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
Yeah, you fill a person with milk,

515
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
you fill a person with pudding mix,

516
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
you shake them around, they're full of pudding.

517
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
You know who I bet wishes that worked?

518
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,320
Bears.

519
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Bears and sharks.

520
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
What are you eating, dude?

521
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Well, it's a guy, but it's also fudgy gushers.

522
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
It's a guy.

523
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
It is a guy.

524
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

525
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
This is a pudding boy.

526
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Did you guys not have pudding in yours?

527
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
Careful, Kevin, I know what to do.

528
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Stand perfectly still.

529
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
No, Kevin, here's what you do.

530
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
All right, so you're gonna take

531
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
all this jello pudding mix.

532
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
You're gonna eat it up good.

533
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Trust me, Kevin, it's the only way.

534
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
It'll really drive me off or whatever.

535
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Oh, I hate what you're doing.

536
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
And then the milk, Kevin.

537
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
All the milk, all the milk, all the milk.

538
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Keep going.

539
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Now shake it.

540
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Now do I stand perfectly still?

541
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
No, Kevin, quite the opposite.

542
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
You're gonna shake it like a Polaroid picture, Kevin.

543
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Just jiggle and jiggle.

544
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Sorry, Kevin.

545
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Can I go?

546
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
Yeah, Dylan, you can go.

547
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm out of pudding mix.

548
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Yeah, this is the only pudding mix I need.

549
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Munch, munch, munch.

550
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Yeah, and then the boy gets eaten.

551
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I wanted to jump over that part

552
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
because it makes me sad.

553
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
That part's sad, but at the last second

554
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
the bear doesn't do it

555
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
because he remembers he has diabetes.

556
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Oh, the last one that he remembers.

557
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Oh, no.

558
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Do you want a yahoo?

559
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Well, let's do another question real quick.

560
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
That'll be our third yahoo.

561
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
It seems a little bit unnecessary.

562
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
We'll do six yahoo's in a row.

563
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Let's do another question then.

564
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Here's a quick question.

565
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Whenever I get my hair washed at a salon,

566
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
I close my eyes because I don't want to make eye contact with the stylist.

567
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
Oh, perfectly normal.

568
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
I'm worried the stylist will think I'm some perv

569
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
if I close my eyes,

570
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
but I'm also worried it'll be worse if I look.

571
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Oh, man.

572
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
That's the same reason.

573
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Is that weird? Am I creepy?

574
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
If you walked into a salon

575
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
and saw someone with their eyes closed getting a haircut,

576
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
what would you do?

577
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
That's from Eyes Wide Shut in Shanghai.

578
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Cool.

579
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
I don't think we've ever had a question from Shanghai before.

580
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
That's neat.

581
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
I think, and I don't know,

582
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
maybe I'm in the wrong here,

583
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
but I think it's way weirder

584
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
to be sitting there

585
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
because you have two options if you keep your eyes open.

586
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
You can go straight ahead,

587
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
which is, after a long period of time,

588
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
weird,

589
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
to track what they're doing with your eyes,

590
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
which is even weirder.

591
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
All right.

592
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Hey, everybody.

593
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Eye contact. Unbroken eye contact.

594
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
That's no good.

595
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
There's only another way.

596
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Everybody, on a monthly basis,

597
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
you have to come to me

598
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
and sit down in front of me,

599
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
supplicating yourself to me,

600
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
while I touch your hair for a half hour.

601
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
In this situation,

602
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
there are infinite,

603
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
imaginable vectors

604
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
through which things can become uncomfortable.

605
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
I think that's fair to say.

606
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
This scenario,

607
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
getting the haircut,

608
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
it can be very uncomfortable,

609
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
which is why, for me,

610
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
I have had the same hairstylist now for a few years.

611
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
It's one of the longer streaks I've had with a hairstylist.

612
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
She does a great job cutting my hair,

613
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
but the reason I decided to stay

614
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
is because I had found comfort there.

615
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
I had found a routine that was comfortable.

616
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
It's a huge selling point.

617
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
So I don't think we...

618
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I don't think this is...

619
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
This is not, like, a travesty, right?

620
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Like, this person closes their eyes when they get a haircut.

621
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
I'm sure that your hairstylist has seen weirder things

622
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
because it's an inherently strange

623
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
human flaw

624
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
that these weird,

625
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
sticky, itchy things

626
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
keep coming out of our heads

627
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
and other parts of our body

628
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
and I wish they just would stop for, like, a minute

629
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
so I could get a handle on it.

630
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
I think you've just made...

631
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
This is, I think, a fun thing

632
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
that you could do to break the ice

633
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
with a new hairstylist

634
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
is you sit down and, you know,

635
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
there's a little bit of tension, you know,

636
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
because it's new and you don't want to talk about...

637
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
The first time they cut hair, scream in pain.

638
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Oh! That's interesting.

639
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
And then you're both gonna have a good laugh about that

640
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
because they're gonna jump

641
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
or you say, like,

642
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
and I have a minute, and then you say an individual goodbye

643
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
to each hair they've just cut.

644
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
They make the second cut, you do it again.

645
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
You repeat that over and over again.

646
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
What if you have a bunch of little

647
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
bones sticking out of your scalp

648
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
mixed in with your hair?

649
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Oh, that's fun.

650
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Just to mix it up like you're

651
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
King Koopa from the Super Mario Brothers movie.

652
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I like that.

653
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Maybe you have a few Double Dare flags in there.

654
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Cool.

655
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
And so as they're digging around, they find one,

656
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
and you're like, you're on a space ship.

657
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Maybe as they cut it shorter and shorter,

658
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
you've written a message on your scalp

659
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
that says, like, too short.

660
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Too short.

661
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Start over. Try again.

662
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Maybe one thing you could do

663
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
would be to,

664
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
as the haircut progresses,

665
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
continually compare yourself

666
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
to other celebrities.

667
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Like, oh, nice.

668
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Just like Eddie from the Munsters.

669
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Or, oh, nice.

670
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Patrick from Spongebob.

671
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Just continually, he doesn't have hair,

672
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
so that wasn't ideal, but you get the idea.

673
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
That's really great.

674
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Just like Lance Henderson

675
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
in Aliens.

676
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
I think giving the hairstylist

677
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
an activity to do while they're cutting,

678
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
as we are suggesting universally here,

679
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
giving them something to occupy themselves,

680
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
like a child on a road trip,

681
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
is definitely the right way to go.

682
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
So you can just close your eyes

683
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
and have a good anxiety nap.

684
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Mm-hmm.

685
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Here's all I'm saying.

686
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
I used to talk a lot on this show

687
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
about social anxiety, right?

688
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Before you've gone, cool!

689
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Yay!

690
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Now, no.

691
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Now, I think,

692
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I don't think of people

693
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
who have social anxiety

694
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
and don't know what to say.

695
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
I don't think those people exist anymore.

696
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
You know how I label them now?

697
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Ooh.

698
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
If you have memorized...

699
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Hear me out.

700
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
If you've memorized 50 riddles,

701
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
you'll never be

702
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
in a conversation or social situation

703
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
where you don't know the perfect

704
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
thing to say, because it's probably

705
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
a riddle.

706
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
One of your 50 riddles, yeah.

707
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
One of the 50 riddles you know,

708
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
one of them is probably somewhat applicable

709
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
to the situation.

710
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
There's no such thing as comfortable

711
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
socially. There's people who are comfortable

712
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
socially and people who haven't memorized

713
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
50 riddles. So then...

714
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Because if you've memorized 50 riddles,

715
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
that is going to be the perfect icebreaker.

716
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
It's fun. What a fun brain

717
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
teaser. While I'm cutting hair,

718
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
I get to like, you know,

719
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
try to unravel

720
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
your mysteries.

721
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Right. I think it would be great

722
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
to memorize some riddles. And then...

723
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
An added benefit, if you find somebody

724
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
who has memorized the exact same

725
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
50 riddles as you, you marry

726
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
them. That's another option.

727
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
That's how you know. Or if you see your

728
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
hairstylist for long enough,

729
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
when they finally solve that 50th

730
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
riddle, you can take their

731
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
hands and look at them and say,

732
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
thank you.

733
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
And then you transform into a wind

734
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
serpent and you

735
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
fly out of the salon.

736
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
And you never go back there. But then you're

737
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
back a month later. With 50 more

738
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
hot new riddles. And you also

739
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
bring their ant back from the dead.

740
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Yes. But only if they get the

741
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
riddles right. Don't get

742
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
the dead ant back if you get

743
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
49 of them. You know what I mean?

744
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Ant stays dead. For each

745
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
one you'll miss, another

746
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
ant's gonna go.

747
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Because that's the wind serpent's curse.

748
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
And you should have known that before you agreed to take

749
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
me on as a client at this

750
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Super Cuts.

751
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
You work at Super Cuts?

752
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
You should. That's day

753
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
one in the orientation. You work at Super

754
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Cuts, you're gonna lose a few ants

755
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
to some cursed wind serpents. That's just

756
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
in the manual, man. That's what they always

757
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
say. You can't work at Super Cuts without

758
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
losing a few ants to a wind serpent.

759
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Listen. And it's terrible curse.

760
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Unless we wanna get a second

761
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
job at Super Cuts, we're gonna need to head to the

762
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
money zone. Okay.

763
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Cause we won't be making a podcast

764
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:22,320
in like a week.

765
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Hasbro. They've got a new hybrid

766
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
mattress. It combines the pressure relief

767
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
of their award-winning foam with

768
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
the durable yet gentle springs.

769
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Oh boy. When you lay on this

770
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
it's like you're sleeping on a giant's palm

771
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
and that giant has moisturized

772
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
consistently but not too much.

773
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Right? You know

774
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
that's a perfect metaphor or simile or whatever.

775
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Yeah, not a wet giant. Not a wet giant.

776
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Not a wet giant. Just a perfectly

777
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
balanced, moisturized giant.

778
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
And this new innovation

779
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
offers the best of both worlds.

780
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Luxurious comfort and resilient

781
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
support just like a moisturized giant.

782
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
And even with springs, these

783
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
mattresses still come magically in a box

784
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
that simply arrives on your doorstep just like

785
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
a giant's hand. And you can be sure

786
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
of your purchase with Kasseri's 100 night

787
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
risk-free sleep on a trial

788
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
just like a giant's hand. So basically

789
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
these mattresses are

790
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
as much like a giant's hand in the real

791
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
world as you will find anywhere.

792
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320

802
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
These things are like very, very, very

803
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
small, sticky hands.

804
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
When you put them on a letter, it lets

805
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
the post office know that this letter's

806
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
good to go, baby, and they will take it

807
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
where you need it to go. But only if you use the

808
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
right small, sticky hand

809
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
like you might find on a rat in a sewer.

810
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Okay.

811
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Every stamp that you get from stamps.com is like a

812
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
rat's hand from the sewer. And you put it on

813
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
stamps dot com enter my brother. Probably

846
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
just stamps dot com though

847
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
not the other one. It was a joke

848
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
and a pretty freaking one if I had to say it

849
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
by myself.

850
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Welcome.

851
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Thank you. No problem. These are real

852
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
podcast listeners, not actors.

853
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
What do you look for in a

854
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
podcast? Reliability is big

855
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
for me. Power. I'd say

856
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,320
comfort. What do you think of this?

857
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Oh.

858
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
That's Jordan Jesse Go. Jordan Jesse

859
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Go? They came out of the floor?

860
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
And down from the

861
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
ceiling? That can't be safe.

862
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm upset.

863
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Can we go now? Soon.

864
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Jordan Jesse Go.

865
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
A real podcast.

866
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Now he's back good.

867
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Not forgotten.

868
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
More theremin like.

869
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Now there's just a bug in the studio.

870
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Yes let me get that.

871
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
I want to munch. Bugs.

872
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
I want to munch.

873
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Squad.

874
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
First off, it was dead to me on

875
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Netflix.

876
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Cool.

877
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Cool. I'll just say cool back.

878
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Oh, okay.

879
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
I don't

880
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
know. Okay, so

881
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
this is a weird situation

882
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
where

883
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
I heard about this

884
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
when it was first making the rounds

885
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
and

886
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
I, it was

887
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
like such a munch squad that

888
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
I had somehow assumed

889
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
that it had, like I had

890
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
already done it. Like once I'd heard about it

891
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
it just seemed like oh, certainly I've

892
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
already done this.

893
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Certainly I've already done this.

894
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
But

895
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
I haven't.

896
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
And so it's Garfield Eats.

897
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Is this

898
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
the concept of

899
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
the orange cat we all love?

900
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
The orange cat is in it.

901
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
And it's just the concept

902
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
that he does consume food for

903
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
calories and power?

904
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Yes, he's

905
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
in it. He's in this

906
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
one, okay? And it's Garfield Eats.

907
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Introducing, it

908
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
says here in the subject line, the

909
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
world's first Garfield

910
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
mobile app restaurant.

911
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Wait, what is Love Me

912
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
Feed Me at Garfield Eats?

913
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
It's the world's first

914
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Garfield mobile app

915
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
restaurant. So that means that when they

916
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
decided to do it

917
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
they had to see, has

918
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
anybody else done a Garfield mobile

919
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
app restaurant? I can't believe

920
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
they beat the rush. And the answer is no.

921
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
I know. They were the first ones to

922
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
pioneer this at Garfield Eats.

923
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Did you say Love Me Feed Me?

924
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Love Me

925
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Feed Me at Garfield Eats. Does it say

926
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
that? It's the subject

927
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
of the, it's the headline

928
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
of the press release. The headline of the press release

929
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
says,

930
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
like Frankenstein would say,

931
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Love Me Feed Me

932
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Frankenstein Eats? Or like

933
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Audrey 2 from Little

934
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Shop of Horrors might say. Another option.

935
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
You all are

936
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
getting, it's not that you

937
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
can't see the forest for the trees, there's like

938
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
a big sign outside that's like

939
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
trees ahead and you stopped there.

940
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Like you need to come with me, okay?

941
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Garfield is, this is how this

942
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
press release fucking starts, okay?

943
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Garfield is the most read comic strip

944
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
in the world. You know that Garfield

945
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Eats. Holy

946
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
shit. I do know that. That's the

947
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
first. Garfield is the most

948
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
read comic strip in the world. M

949
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
dash. You know that Garfield

950
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Eats. I remember that about him. A lot.

951
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
A lot. Oh.

952
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
That's a whole sentence. A lot.

953
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
The fabulous funny that

954
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
inspired. The what?

955
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Certainly they meant to say feline.

956
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Certainly they meant to say feline, but they don't.

957
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
They say the fabulous funny

958
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
that inspired books,

959
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
movies, and TV

960
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
shows. Feed the fabulous

961
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
funny. Love him.

962
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
The fabulous funny is about

963
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
to mark its 40th

964
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
year. This is like how John refers

965
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
to Garfield if they were like old Victorian

966
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
lovers. Oh my fabulous

967
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
fun. It's about to mark

968
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
his 40th year on the comics

969
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
pages. So it's apropos

970
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
that Garfield Eats

971
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
a new innovative mobile

972
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
app for entertainment and ordering

973
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
food will make its debut

974
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
in the world. What the fuck

975
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
do you think apropos means?

976
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
What do you think apropos means?

977
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
That 40 years of Garfield

978
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
being on comic pages

979
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
is apropos to do a whole restaurant

980
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
about it. Garfield

981
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Eats is a new food experience brought to

982
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
you by the world's first

983
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
intergaging app.

984
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
What? What? What? Stop. You're the

985
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Garfield restaurant. You don't get to make up

986
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
that word. That also once

987
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
again sounds like some of the most steampunk

988
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
shit I've ever heard.

989
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
It is gonna fucking. We must

990
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
apply force to the intergage if we want

991
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
to power our steam zeppelin.

992
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
I don't want to do anything else other than this press

993
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
release. This is the first sentence

994
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
of the second paragraph

995
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
of this six paragraph long press release.

996
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
It's the world's first intergaging

997
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
app and it is

998
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
an entertaining and

999
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
engaging app.

1000
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Fuck. It's a

1001
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
it's entertaining

1002
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
and engaging. It's

1003
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
both entertaining. This is entertaining

1004
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
me but not engaging me.

1005
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
It's an entertaining

1006
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
and engaging app that replaces

1007
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
the quick service restaurant with

1008
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
the quick mobile restaurant.

1009
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
OK. Not a QSR.

1010
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
A QMR. The app

1011
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
immerses the user in

1012
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
a complete

1013
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
Garfield experience.

1014
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Holy. Wait.

1015
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
How much longer do we have in this episode

1016
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
because I'm starting to feel like this may be

1017
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
it. Now Justin

1018
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
before you continue on with any details

1019
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
they're just kind of. Oh I'd love to take a break Jeff.

1020
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Hold on let me pull over the car.

1021
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
They're just throwing out that word complete

1022
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
with a lot of bravado huh.

1023
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Because to me a complete

1024
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Garfield experience does involve like

1025
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
a costume and maybe a

1026
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
giant house that makes me feel like the

1027
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
perspective of a tiny kitty. Maybe

1028
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
even a box of dirt I'm supposed to

1029
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
shit in. Yeah. Unless I can

1030
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
experience this app through the Oculus Rift.

1031
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
I don't think this is a complete

1032
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Garfield experience. I'd love

1033
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,320
that to be true but I don't think that

1034
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
that's accurate. It's a quick

1035
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
mobile restaurant. The app immerses

1036
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
the user in a

1037
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
complete Garfield

1038
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
experience offering

1039
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
cartoons and

1040
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
augmented reality. Holy

1041
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
shit. Whoa.

1042
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
Whoa.

1043
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Cartoons

1044
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
and augmented reality

1045
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
and food.

1046
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Cause it's a restaurant.

1047
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
It is one. Remember

1048
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
how it's a restaurant. Yeah.

1049
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Cause it still is

1050
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
and it's got that too cause it's

1051
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
intergaging. Yeah. Garfield eats

1052
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
by the way is stylized. No space

1053
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
eats is all caps.

1054
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
So that's powerful. Fucking cool.

1055
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
It's very fucking

1056
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
cool. It's like a it's a very

1057
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
punk rock of spelling Garfield eats.

1058
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
So

1059
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
on the menu

1060
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
delicious

1061
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
healthy farm

1062
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
two plates and

1063
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
here they have in parentheses F2P.

1064
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
This is a free to play

1065
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
AR Garfield

1066
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
experience.

1067
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
You can fucking have this

1068
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
fucking fresh kale that just came

1069
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
from a half mile away while you put on

1070
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
your Google Glass and

1071
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
have Odie's big powerful

1072
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
feet step on and crush you baby.

1073
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Now

1074
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
we should warn you there are microtransactions.

1075
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
Let me finish the clause.

1076
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
On the menu

1077
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
delicious healthy

1078
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
farm to plate lasagna

1079
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
of course and

1080
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
pizza shaped like

1081
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Garfield and baked

1082
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
in a wood fire oven.

1083
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Ordered through the

1084
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
app and delivered quickly to anyone

1085
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
in Dubai.

1086
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Justin you just

1087
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
I have never been so quickly deflated.

1088
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
I know

1089
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
I know.

1090
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
I can't fucking believe you.

1091
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
What you just did

1092
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
what you just did was treasonous.

1093
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
It was treason.

1094
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Ordered through the app and is delivered quickly

1095
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
to anyone in Dubai. Also

1096
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
this is a sentence.

1097
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Also because

1098
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Garfield loves his coffee.

1099
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
Enter the Garfuccino.

1100
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Made with 100 percent

1101
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Arabica

1102
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
coffee from Italy.

1103
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
It's an international

1104
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
affair.

1105
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
The word Garfuccino

1106
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
is the grossest thing

1107
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I've ever heard. Like if you

1108
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
told me that was a euphemism for

1109
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
vomit I would be like oh man

1110
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
I gotta go Garf.

1111
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm gonna Garfuccino all over this place.

1112
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
I've got a running list

1113
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
of substances I would

1114
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
least like to drown in.

1115
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
And Garfuccino has just

1116
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
rocketed up the list.

1117
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
Especially when you consider that

1118
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
one of my favorite like

1119
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
abomination words duncuccino

1120
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
is such a great word

1121
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
that I love saying.

1122
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Yeah they were so close. Garfield eats

1123
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
co-founders. Oh no!

1124
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Are they okay? Oh man!

1125
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
That's too bad. Sorry

1126
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Garfield eats co-founders Nathan

1127
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Mosery and Pascal Heider

1128
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
were born well after Garfield's

1129
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
rise to fame but both

1130
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
were fans of the cartoon growing up.

1131
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
What the fuck could that possibly

1132
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
matter?

1133
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
So they're legit. These aren't your

1134
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
bandwagon Garfield. No they know

1135
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
they're gonna get the brand right. Knowing

1136
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Garfield's penchant for Italian food

1137
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
they thought Garfield would be the perfect pitchman

1138
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
for their brand of scooter pizza

1139
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I guess. I don't know

1140
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
that he's a fan of Italian. We never see like

1141
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
we never see scenes

1142
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
of him like at a fancy restaurant

1143
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
enjoying like

1144
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
bolognese or something

1145
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
like he's. You're gonna lose this

1146
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
because his favorite food is lasagna.

1147
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
No I know that but his favorite food is lasagna.

1148
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
That doesn't mean like

1149
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
he's a fan of Italian. It just means he really likes

1150
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
lasagna. Yeah.

1151
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Their vision is to make the ordering

1152
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
of food fun and easy

1153
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
utilizing modern technology.

1154
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
You can use voice recognition

1155
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
to order.

1156
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Here's the thing. How

1157
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
frequently do you have to

1158
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
order from the Garfield Eats app

1159
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
before you're like I don't have the time

1160
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
to type this every time I want

1161
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
lasagna. I'm gonna need

1162
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
to start speaking and just rolling the dice.

1163
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
If I could have a button like one might get from

1164
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
Amazon then I would have that

1165
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
with just a picture of a Garfield

1166
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
shaped pizza on it that I can push.

1167
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
No I sold my phone.

1168
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
I got an Amazon Dash button for Garfield

1169
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
scooter pizza. And you know what really sucks about that

1170
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
is when I'm watching my

1171
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
television stories and one of the

1172
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
characters on the show says boy

1173
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
I'd love to have a scooter deliver me a

1174
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Garfield shaped pizza in Dubai

1175
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
which happens in most of my shows.

1176
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
Yeah that happens eight

1177
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
time in Ballers episode four.

1178
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
That's a false positive.

1179
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
That sucks and maybe I don't want a Garfield.

1180
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
Of course I am always gonna want a Garfield shaped

1181
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
pizza. That shit's hilarious.

1182
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
By the way if you're wondering

1183
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
I looked it up. Garfield shaped pizza

1184
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
is like the outline of

1185
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
his face which looks

1186
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
to be an impossible

1187
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
shape to roll a pizza

1188
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
out into. So every

1189
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
one of these motherfuckers must

1190
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
be like hand shaped

1191
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
into his face.

1192
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Nice.

1193
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
So

1194
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
okay so Garfield Eats will adhere to

1195
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
and I'm sure this is everyone's concern

1196
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
adhere to strict F2P

1197
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
guidelines on supply

1198
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
sourcing guaranteeing no GMOs

1199
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
that doesn't matter. No preservatives

1200
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
no artificial colors. That's Garfield modified

1201
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
organisms.

1202
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Yeah

1203
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
he hasn't fucking licked anything.

1204
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
No artificial

1205
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
colors and no fertilizers.

1206
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
I mean I should hope not.

1207
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
That would be a weird topping as these

1208
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
things go.

1209
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
They'll also use rechargeable

1210
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
electric scooters to deliver

1211
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
the food in rebox packaging that

1212
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
can be repurposed. Okay.

1213
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Anything can be repurposed. What's the Venn diagram

1214
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
of people out there

1215
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
who are so excited about

1216
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
like is there is that

1217
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
how big is the overlap between like

1218
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
yes listen of course of course

1219
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
I want to eat a Garfield

1220
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
shaped pizza or maybe even Garfield

1221
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
shaped lasagna I'm not sure

1222
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
but only if

1223
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
it is sustainably

1224
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
sourced and eco friendly.

1225
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,320
Farm to table.

1226
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
F2P.

1227
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Free to play no loot boxes no

1228
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
pay to win.

1229
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
Here's something that's just a whole

1230
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
you guys

1231
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
know what a nut graph is? Sure.

1232
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Griffin you probably know that from journalism.

1233
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
It's the paragraph in a press release

1234
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
that's so good that you can't

1235
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
not have a cum.

1236
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Nut graph is the

1237
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
thing that you like if you're a reporter you like

1238
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Dave it's like anytime you need to talk about

1239
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,320
this thing like you can

1240
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
put this in right there.

1241
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
So the nut graph

1242
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
for Garfield and this is a paragraph

1243
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
I'm assuming is in everything Garfield related

1244
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
from here to eternity.

1245
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
Nearly 40 years ago

1246
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
on June 19th 1978

1247
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Garfield was born on the

1248
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
comics pages. The master

1249
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
mind of cartoonist Jim Davis

1250
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
that's not what that means.

1251
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Garfield is a humorous strip. Or wait let's

1252
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
change the possibility.

1253
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
Wait Jim Davis not exist?

1254
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Jim Davis was the fictional

1255
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
creation of the orange lasagna cat Garfield.

1256
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Whoa. Garfield is

1257
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
a humorous strip and you know what

1258
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
humorous is just about right

1259
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
huh? That really gets it doesn't say

1260
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
riotous or funny.

1261
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
It says it's humorous. It's definitely

1262
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
not sad most of the

1263
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
time. It's this unsad

1264
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
strip except sometimes

1265
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
it's very sad though I will say that.

1266
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
It is very sad.

1267
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
Garfield is a humorous strip centered on

1268
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
the lives of a lazy

1269
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
cynical orange cat who loves

1270
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
lasagna, pizza, coffee

1271
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
and his remote control. His owner

1272
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
the long suffering John Arbuckle

1273
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
and Odie a sweet but dumb

1274
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
dog. So

1275
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
can you give me

1276
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,320
here's the thing Travis here's the thing

1277
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
this is five paragraphs in.

1278
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
I'm excited about this

1279
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
idea I cannot wait to find out who

1280
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
this Garfield character is.

1281
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
Who the fuck is Garfield?

1282
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
This is so good I love all of it

1283
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
F2P lasagna for sure.

1284
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,320
Who the fuck is Garfield?

1285
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,320
I cannot wait to find out about this lasagna cat.

1286
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
I'm on pins and needles

1287
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,320
about who Garfield is.

1288
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,320
That's the one thing

1289
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
my checkbook is out. I'm loving

1290
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
it but who's Garfield?

1291
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,320
It actually ends on an even higher note.

1292
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,320
Garfield's creator Jim Davis

1293
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
said he was delighted with the concept

1294
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
here's a quote. In forty years

1295
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
no one has ever come to me with a better

1296
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
thought out plan to deliver great food

1297
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,320
in a fun and engaging way. Holy shit

1298
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
Really?

1299
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
So Jim Davis

1300
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,320
in Jim Davis's life one component

1301
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,320
of it is people frequently

1302
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
come to him with plans to deliver

1303
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,320
great food in a fun and engaging way.

1304
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
No no no none of you. He can't even

1305
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,320
look at his Twitter DMs anymore.

1306
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
It's just fucking. So here's the thing Jim

1307
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
it's called the Gar Ferrari. No.

1308
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,320
It's Garfield shaped Ferrari and you bring

1309
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
it and kids love it. Listen when I created

1310
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Garfield like a half

1311
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,320
a century ago I did so

1312
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
with the dream of one day

1313
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,320
turning it into an F2P

1314
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,320
home delivery food

1315
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
intergaging experience

1316
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,320
and you have not found it yet sir.

1317
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,320
So you take this garbage

1318
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
and you bury it in a box of dirt where it belongs.

1319
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
So you can go to GarfieldEats.com

1320
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
and

1321
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,320
find out more

1322
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
about that. I'm very disappointed

1323
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
because I wanted to get the Garfield Eats

1324
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
app on my phone. I think it's only in the UAE

1325
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
but if you search Garfield on the

1326
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,320
app store here's what you get. Garfield Rush

1327
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
Garfield My

1328
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
Big Fat Diet. My Talking

1329
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
Garfield. Garfield

00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Survival of the Fattest.

1331
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
Garfield Snack Time

1332
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
Garfield Go. Garfield Food

1333
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
Truck. Garfield Daily.

1334
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Garfield Walk.

1335
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
This is all the Garfield apps that

1336
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,320
there are. So there's a lot of that. Wowzy

1337
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
bowzies my boy. This website

1338
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
GarfieldEats.com is a

1339
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
good one of the websites.

1340
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
This website Justin. This website

1341
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
it's a good website. In

1342
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
this website you've seen lots of websites

1343
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,320
folks because the internet's been around for a bit.

1344
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
In this website they do have a picture

1345
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
and it's half just Garfield's

1346
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,320
face but then the other half

1347
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320
is what looks like an asparagus

1348
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
and broccoli pizza. So it's almost

1349
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
like he is a I'm gonna say Pizzamorf

1350
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,320
which is a new series from Scholastic

1351
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
that I'm very excited about in which famous

1352
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,320
cartoon cats do turn into pizza.

1353
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
This website is so fucking good Justin

1354
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,320
I'm losing my mind.

1355
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
I think very

1356
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
we've been looking we've talked behind the scenes

1357
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
a lot about trying to find that perfect

1358
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
excuse to do a Dubai live show

1359
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
and maybe this is it.

1360
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
Maybe this is maybe

1361
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,320
it's not we don't

1362
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
go to the live show and happen to eat some Garfield

1363
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
shaped pizza. We go eat

1364
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,320
some Garfield shaped pizza and happen to do

1365
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,320
a Dubai live show. There is

1366
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
on the website

1367
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
because they did it in

1368
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
Canada too. It is in Canada so it is

1369
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
Well we're never going to Canada. Let's admit

1370
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,320
that. Canada?

1371
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,320
What's that? There's a video

1372
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
on

1373
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,320
the website that has 371

1374
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
views. It was released

1375
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
May 2nd so this is off the presses.

1376
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
It is on the Garfield Eats website

1377
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
and is a 3 minute and

1378
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
44 second long video

1379
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
of Jim Davis talking

1380
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
about Garfield eating while

1381
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
he holds the stuffed Garfield and

1382
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,320
cartoons of Garfield.

1383
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,320
That's a video that you can go see at

1384
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,320
GarfieldEats.com if you want to scoop that up.

1385
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Griffin if you want to

1386
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,320
edit in like 10 seconds of the

1387
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
audio from that I think we'd be cleared to it

1388
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
just to like get a little bit

1389
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
of that heat. Okay don't tell Jim.

1390
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Garfield Eats.

1391
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
I think that's been pretty well established.

1392
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
His lifelong love affair with pasta

1393
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,320
and pizza is legendary.

1394
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
In fact if Garfield could dream

1395
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,320
up the perfect restaurant it

1396
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
would feature lasagna and pizza.

1397
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
Well Garfield's dream has come

1398
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
true and it's in the form of

1399
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
a new innovative concept

1400
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,320
restaurant.

1401
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Garfield Eats.

1402
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
Take care of the cat

1403
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
and the cat will take care of you.

1404
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,320
And I'm on the website now there is a little

1405
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
chat box where you do want to talk to customer service

1406
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
so I did ping them hoping to ask like are you

1407
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
planning to spread to the states anytime soon.

1408
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
So I said hello and then the bot responded

1409
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
oh it's you. Thanks for chatting us up.

1410
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,320

00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Hard pass. I panicked I said my name is Derek

1415
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
and then customer service

1416
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320

and Garfield exclusive series.

1429
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
I don't think you meant to do that.

1430
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
I don't think you meant to do that.

1431
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
Guys I don't think this is groupons

1432
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
misspelled because why would they give out

1433
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
groupons. I think this is

1434
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
Garfield coupons

1435
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
is an experience that they

1436
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
have a currency that they have titled

1437
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
goopons.

1438
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
There is a fucking. OK

1439
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
guys this is going to sound like a joke

1440
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
but it's not a joke. So this

1441
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
Reeboks thing you can and

1442
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,320
it's not Reeboks how it sounds

1443
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
in your brain when I say the words

1444
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
it's R E hyphen B O

1445
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
X right Reeboks is a thing

1446
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320

I want to take advantage of

1573
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,320
humankind and make them believe a lie

1574
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,320
so that they will trust us with the government it's

1575
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
all an elaborate lie and when you get on a plane

1576
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
they purposely fly you farther

1577
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
than you need to go it's disgusting

1578
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,320

just kidding

1582
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,320
we won't do that we will just tell

1583
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,320
you the truth behind the truth because what we

1584
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,320
