1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,020
It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis the great

10
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,220
My name is Griffin McElroy. I want to warn everybody there was a moment where I

11
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,020
Like what I said my name in a what could be like a melodically tuneful manner

12
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,360
Yeah, you're happy for the first time in so long. Well, no, I just I I had the compulsion in that moment of

13
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm gonna sing the rest of this and I'll make everybody sing the rest the episode. It's a musical

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,080
I just want to tell you guys like I fought that off like I fought that un-listenable urge

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,160
I appreciate you fighting that off because it saved me from having to do that

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,000
Mike like myself and I I don't know that I

17
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,120
Physically mentally emotionally could have done it. Are you guys just gonna let me get away with adding a flourish to my name like that?

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,000
What was the flourish? I was thinking about the thing I was gonna say rather than listening. Yeah, I'm so sorry about that

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,320
That's okay

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,520
No, I said Travis the great cuz I'm watching the great and I thought I need a flourish and yeah

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,700
I'll be fancy or like Travis the powerful. I don't know. I'll find it but I want to talk about

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
Guys, okay

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,240
This is gonna depend on where people are listening to this because there are laws differing in states of state

24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,080
But I don't know about you guys. I got a lot of money riding on the big game

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Oh

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,100
It's basically all of our collective life savings

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,520
Oh, and I have been so curious why our financial advisors did tell us to

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,640
Have a shared pool of life savings

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,360
We're living three different lives at this with children. I mean we have dependents and wives and everything right?

30
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,040
I paid the financial advisor to do that because I knew the big game was coming up and you know every year

31
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,160
You know, I I watched the game and I think I should have I should have bet because now I know who won and I

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
should have bet and

33
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,820
Yeah, it's so easy when you know

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,560
Sherry and logic and here's the best part. I mean I put about 75%

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,100
Of our life savings on the big game and about 25% on the puppy bowl

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,220
So I figure one way or the other yeah

37
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,860
We're gonna come out big because I bet 25% of our life savings that the puppy bowl would be a doable

38
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,680
And that was it was I mean to be fair. It's two to one odds a doable

39
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,520
I put 50 large on the Bengals in the puppy bowl

40
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,920
The Bengals are playing. Well, no, I'm let me do my joke. Okay, I

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,520
I put 50 large on the Bengals in the puppy bowl because I am wagering that they will release a

42
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,580
Handful of Bengal Tigers during the puppy bowl because let's be honest. Those games are rarely

43
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,000
intense or

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Like dramatic the stakes are so low

45
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
And I want to be like, yeah

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,360
But did he fucking get that sack lunch from fucking smashing the QB into a fucking

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,840
Bone meal that's I notice the the puppy bowl is very globetrotter asking that way Griffin. Yeah

48
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,700
They're very lax on some of what I would consider the rules that make football fun to watch

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Right, and it's just like what's happening here?

50
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,600
And the puppies never beat the human players. That's true. Like what's the point, right?

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,200
It's never seen I've never seen one of the puppies get thrown out of the game for unsportsmanlike conduct

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,360
but I've seen them piss on yes, absolutely if like one like, you know, if

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,640
Troy Aikman just took a big one, right?

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,720
Yeah, thank you. They would kick him right

55
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,760
thick-armed fucking damn marino just took a

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,680
Dumper right there on the 50. That's not gonna they're not gonna let him finish that one out. I

57
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,740
Haven't announced it. We're calling it the Super Bowl from this point forward. I decided this come at me

58
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,540
Please come soon. Nothing would delight me more than for the National Football League

59
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,140
The NFL or as I call it, no fun left

60
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Come get me

61
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,460
Back when people used to be able to take swords on the field. Come on

62
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,060
Come on, Raph. Let the but the fellas what are you afraid of?

63
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Oh, I

64
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,980
Had this moment after the so after the Bengals secured their place the Bengals are in it

65
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:12,540
Yeah shooter my man shooter got that big kikaruski for the right. That's why you drive. That's why you drafted kicker

66
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,640
That's why you drafted kicker. That's why you draft a kicker

67
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,900
and

68
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,860
I had this thought like I'm gonna you know, what dad loves the Bengals, huh?

69
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,460
I'm gonna get him tickets, you know, like I'm gonna get I'm gonna get I'm gonna get him a flight

70
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,660
You know, this will be birthday and Christmas combined whatever but I knew that it would fill up, you know flights from Cincinnati to

71
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,780
Lax we're about to get like wilds. I was right

72
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm gonna do it right now and I was like I was checking the flights on that

73
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
I was like, okay, maybe you know, I've got a lot of

74
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Miles saved up from traveling and then I was like, oh, wait a minute. He'll lean actual tickets to the game for oh, yeah

75
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,980
That's our winnows. Yeah, so I went on to

76
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,980
The the place where they sell the tickets or the Internet. Yeah, and um

77
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,500
The bad ones are six thousand dollars. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey everybody

78
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,020
It's that yeah, it's a it's a after all it's a game guys. It is a game

79
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,740
It's a game and the players aren't getting paid. They're doing it for fun. Thank you

80
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,780
So like where's this money going right down the toilet? That's where it's going

81
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,220
Don't do six dollars for a ticket to the no Super Bowl in the bad seats where you can't I think about that

82
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,780
There's a scalper somewhere right who's who bought those tickets

83
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,660
I somehow probably a robot bottom and there was like I'm gonna resell these for six thousand dollars

84
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:41,540
Like they fought with their human slash AI brain that six thousand dollars was like, this is a good choice

85
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,540
This is a normal amount. Yeah, this is an amount someone will pay to sit in bad seats

86
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,260
To watch people run at each other real fast. And that's yeah, that's really all that's really all football is

87
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,760
You know what? I mean? Well except for kickers. Can we talk I'm I've decided to make this the only

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,960
My body is riddled my legs specifically my kicking leg, right? It's riddled with pain

116
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,080
Okay, these three hours out of

117
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,640
Of every day. Oh is a waking hell what happens during the one-hour?

118
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Shoot me up the doc. Shoot me up real good. Oh with it. They call they call it spinach

119
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,920
But it's in this it's in a syringe. I know it's not my spinach, but it releases me from

120
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,360
The the hell right my every day is right long enough for me

121
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
How old are you hey thick how old are you

122
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,720
22

123
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Jesus

124
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:59,560
Jesus do you find it hard to sort of navigate can I request? Oh sure, but Bethany you said this was a curse-free

125
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,760
Sorry, my sister Bethany. Did we cut did we Kurt? Sorry? It's said the boy took the Lord's name in vain. Oh, sorry

126
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,160
Crackers man, that's wild. You're 22, huh? Also, did you just call me a boy? I'm 16 years your senior kick

127
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,400
It's an affectionate nickname that we have for other players

128
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,880
Oh, you see me as another player in this field of power

129
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,240
Castaglia, that's a weird way to say that. Hey, do you talk about?

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,400
What get kicking or my career? I was trying to kick and then your bedeviled leg came up

131
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,840
But we were very trying to do our job

132
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,760
brief

133
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,680
There's brief

134
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,380
valleys between the crests of pain

135
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Are we in one of those manageable?

136
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,440
Agony as the hellish sine wave that is my life, right?

137
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Rises and falls getting dark

138
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,880
Valley, I mean something in a valley right now our terms of right. Got it. Got it. Got it. So what's your record?

139
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,760
What's your longest? What's the biggest kick you've done? What's your biggest kick? We could have looked at your favorite

140
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,320
But I I have been known to I came short at one point

141
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,980
Of the record held by Dan Strazinski. Yeah, the Falcons he holds it down at about 60

142
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,320
Yards, and I did kick a 58 and a half yarder

143
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,800
when in our matchup against the the

144
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,200
Tennessee tight did you ask did you ask the coach if you could scooch it back?

145
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,080
Yeah, two or three yards just so you could scoot scoop that um that that record. I

146
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,840
Would never compromise. Okay, where do I have a question for you?

147
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Go ahead good day go for travel when your pain management is going

148
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
All right, you know what I mean?

149
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,840
And you're in one of them valleys you think you could kick a ball hard enough that you could kick it through a man

150
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I always think about this

151
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,160
Or or or sorry, sorry

152
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,680
Or you kick it Adam and it hits him in the head and their head goes flying off like oh good question

153
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,940
And then the head goes through and the head goes through and the and then the refs are like three points

154
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,800
I guess I guess it counts. There's no rule against it

155
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm surprised you guys are privy to this, but that is how you become the kicker for a team

156
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,800
Oh, you got all the previous kicker have to blast one of those beautiful pig skins right through the

157
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,680
Uprights that are their ribs. Oh, I think just blasted clean through it's rough

158
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,200
And honestly, it's supposed to be a private and I'll be frank tasteful ceremony

159
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,440
Oh sure between two consenting adults, right? I have another question for you kick. Is there anything in the rule book?

160
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,040
This has long trap us. Okay. Yeah, let him back. Okay. Is there anything in the rule book?

161
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
This has a dog can't play football

162
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,880
This is one that we like to ponder. Yeah

163
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,960
Oh

164
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,720
Seems like a straight up and down. Yes, or no question

165
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah

166
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Yeah, sorry

167
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,440
Cuz every time I say this another one of you kids gets is a wild idea that you're gonna trade up your pup to take out

168
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,480
Think Johnson. Yeah, but there is

169
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,120
Nothing in the rules that says a dog

170
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,680
Can't play football right? Oh, I will say yeah

171
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,240
they

172
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
are not

173
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:36,080
Reliable no bugs. Mm-hmm. They're reliable usually but not in terms of of play. They don't get a lot of graphs. Yeah

174
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,720
They won't join the Union which to me is weird. Yeah, but they refused

175
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,800
Because they say it's a big issue. You cannot put rings on those paws. That's true

176
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,480
I told you you're not gonna get a ring with the dog behind the ball. It's it's a human's

177
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,140
Human, it's a fingers game. You need a person right? You need a person

178
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,580
Johnson you need a dancer since key you need, you know, any of the many other kickers with which I am well

179
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,680
Do you weird and we all fight boys

180
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:22,680
We would like to ask us we ask everyone where you do buy your pants that have one big pant leg good question

181
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,360
This is an excellent question. I

182
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
You stitch fix. Oh

183
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
That's kick-ass

184
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,060
But it's a special service that they maintain just for me called fix fix

185
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,500
Oh, and they just get the pants just for me not stitch fix

186
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,180
I'm sorry. Mine was

187
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,740
Not thick thick. Hey, you started a little bit like like the agent from from matrix. Yeah that a lot

188
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,380
Mr. Anderson the prices on thick thick are so good

189
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,900
Can I ask you a question kick because Griffin said kick ass and made me think about it

190
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,460
Are you ever afraid that like you'll lose control and you'll kick someone in the ass and you'll kick them so hard that you'll kick

191
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm in half or that their spine will shoot out of their mouth like in Mortal Kombat and I'll go through the uprights. I

192
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
That would be impossible

193
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,060
in when I am NOT on the field my

194
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,340
Kicking leg is weighted down with over 130 pounds of dry weight. I wasn't asked about that

195
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,420
I can see that here under the table. So you

196
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,820
Lifting it is a torturer. There would be no way of me kicking a civilian in the open world

197
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,780
Yeah, because of the weights on the leg

198
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,600
They only release those when it's time to make the doughnuts go nuts, if you know what I mean? Yeah, I do

199
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,700
So we're gonna let you go thick, but I have one more

200
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,180
Don't have anywhere else. Okay, you can stay here, but just please don't talk anymore

201
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,420
I'm worried about what it's doing to your voice, but I have one more question for you thick

202
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,900
Do you have any predictions on how you think the Puppy Bowl is gonna go this year a?

203
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,700
Lot of people in my circles are saying, you know, I still cute

204
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,500
That's the way we're leaning right now. Really?

205
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
I'm not allowed to bet

206
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,140
Anymore sure. Oh, so it's not like a league thing

207
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:18,580
It's like a personal thing for your personal thing for between me and my my lord. Oh, okay. Cool. And who's that?

208
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,820
Sorry, you don't know him. Oh, okay. Oh, this is like a feudal situation. It's a different

209
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Disregard, yeah

210
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,540
We have our own DD our own language. Oh

211
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,620
Yeah, our own dress code and kicks ass yeah, it's well, sorry that's blasphemy

212
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,220
Yeah, you don't like it when we take kick in vain, huh? Please don't take kick in rain

213
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,220
Got it. God this pocket. Hey kick or thick. Don't you agree that this podcast was a fucking great idea?

214
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:56,740
Like a really good idea for a podcast. I just think you got nowhere to go but up. Okay, great

215
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
All right, just like the ball

216
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,740
Okay, hey Justin Griffin, yeah

217
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,500
Directly from from through the uprights in the riddle me piss boy

218
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,300
Yeah, let's hear it

219
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,740
If a chicken says all chickens are liars, right is the chicken?

220
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
telling the truth

221
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,860
No

222
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,740
This comes from Paul, by the way to her manager. Why oh, thank you for tour manager Paul

223
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,400
Yeah, why can I ask why it had to be a chicken?

224
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:46,340
Interesting. Is this is this the riddle is that like a chicken can't speak and so the chicken cannot be telling either a lie

225
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,860
Or the truth

226
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:55,060
Do not I mean hey Griffin? Yeah, you solved it. Oh, did I really yes, but here's why I wanted this guy the answer

227
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,420
What's the answer chickens cannot talk?

228
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
but

229
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:08,980
Hate this shit, but this goes deeper because here's what I would like to pause it. This question is written by a chicken

230
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,340
Right. So all chickens are liars a chicken tells you that but then the chicken also says like no

231
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,820
Don't worry chickens can't talk and you're like now. Hold on. I don't know what's up. What's down?

232
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,860
You got me all turned around here chicken. I don't know what to believe you guys

233
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,100
Is that I'm sorry trap. Hold on one second. Is that really it?

234
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,700
That chickens cannot talk

235
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,820
But this is the riddle that you've brought to us today

236
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,180
Yeah, this is the real I brought to you because I'll change their lives, but I gotta say man

237
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,300
I think we've moved past this. I think our brains have evolved to a point where

238
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,660
Like we know the dark corners of the internet so well that the riddles will not

239
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,980
Like I literally just shitted the answer out in an instant

240
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,620
And I think that says a lot about sort of how I have been turned

241
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,340
No, I broke Griffin a long time between riddle me piss and sad libs and of course work a fart

242
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,340
It's very clear that I've broken Griffin's brain and somehow

243
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,540
Dragged him down

244
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:14,180
To where I'm at all the time where my brain operates all the time. Yeah, and I'm okay

245
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,260
I tell you I'm pretty proud of it. Yeah, I broke a human beings thought process

246
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,440
Yeah, I'm bada bada bada loving it. Anyways chickens or liars. Yeah, Justin

247
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,460
maybe do a question cuz we'd I don't think we did any last episode and

248
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,100
I didn't see the response to the last episode

249
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,700
They loved that shit. I've been cast in a play which my character is a former high school

250
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:44,020
American football champ. You don't need to do that on this show. This is a safe space. Okay, there's my picnic. Is it picnic?

251
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,700
What but I don't know you because two of us were talking at once

252
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Why does Travis I'd make his great

253
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,020
Reference to picnic like I it's just that I have a degree in theater Justin. I don't know if you know that

254
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:03,120
One scene I even hold and toss around the old pigskin so you this person knows some of the slang going on

255
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,640
Cool. However, I have no real-life experience with this. I've never tossed the old pork flesh. We don't call it that

256
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,460
The shows in a month that I don't want to embarrass the rest of the cast with my shrod

257
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,960
You are siblings surely you spent many hours throwing around the old hammer. I'd that is what can you tell me how to convincingly?

258
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,280
Hold one lights up on a touchdown. No one Google. I will say this is all I know dad taught us

259
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,680
Okay, these two things I know are important. Yes one

260
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
wrap

261
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,800
Your hand around the ball and put your fingers on the lace got a lover's embrace on the laces

262
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
Yes

263
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:48,200
Second tight spiral tight spiral also in like a tight spiral. This is something dad taught me which is

264
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,640
You're really worried about it hitting you in the face, but it's not gonna hurt nearly as bad as you think

265
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,640
It is watch and then like bonk, you know, it was right

266
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,880
This it does hurt, but it didn't hurt as much as I thought it was for what is a bunch of leather?

267
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,280
Like an oblong leather balloon

268
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,360
Yeah, that shit hurts if it hits you hard and the other the other guys throw it fucking hard man. Same with a baseball

269
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,480
That's another like very prominent dad lie by the way, like you're afraid of it hitting you but it's not gonna hit that hard

270
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:24,120
Yeah, fucking hard man. Baseball is hard like a rock and a softball. Don't let the name fool you still

271
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:31,720
It's nice to be hit by the size way bigger is weird that somebody invented softball and they're like pretty soft and no one was like

272
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,680
Way softer things my dude, do you think it was invented before there were other soft things? Yeah, maybe is that possible?

273
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,660
Until then everything was hard. And so instead well, this is this has a little give to it

274
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,520
I'm gonna call it soft and people said I wonder if there's anything softer than this

275
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,940
I was playing with a softball in my bongo bat at the park one time somebody threw the softball at me shattered my fucking bongo bat

276
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,240
That shit did not go sailing which is the typical response you do get from a bongo bat

277
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
anyway, you need a

278
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
props master or

279
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
someone who is going to

280
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,040
Go up on the catwalk above the stage with a football tied to a string and like maybe a fishing rod if we want to

281
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,600
go full sort of

282
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,920
Goofy movie on it and then like you make a ball throwing motion and then they just kind of swing the football on

283
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,200
The long fishing line to the other person. Do you know I mean? Oh even better

284
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,340
Practical effects if you're doing some practical magic and you want to like show up like really make it clear that this person is

285
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,320
really good at football what you're gonna do the postmaster up there you're gonna whistle and

286
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,480
They're gonna like bring the football to you. Like you called it through the air. Oh, that's cool, right?

287
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,120
Yeah, do they have the money to get like flying by for him? Oh

288
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:00,560
Rigging that's huge a huge reference that for people are gonna get definitely. Yes, but I'm saying just listen for a second

289
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,200
That's a company. There's one company that flies Peter Pan's around

290
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,520
Yeah, if you want to fly somebody in in a show not just like in a plane to your house

291
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,560
You get flying by Foy. Okay, you get flying by Foy. They're gonna come they're gonna they're gonna do swing back and forth

292
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,280
They're gonna do up and down maybe even forward to back if you've got the money. Yeah

293
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,080
There's one why is that still in there? Why is it still in there?

294
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Why is it in your head I

295
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:39,040
I don't need to know it. I directed Superman. It's a birthplace. You're in a musical about Superman. That's

296
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,560
Like and they and and they help with that. That's the only opportunity. I've got it. I've used the information

297
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
You don't need it. I've slumdog millionaire. Yeah

298
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Gonna be a time where you're just like sitting there and someone's like, I don't know man

299
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,400
Could there possibly be a company that specializes in flying specifically children in like shows and you're like wait, what did you say?

300
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah, I know it

301
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,640
You're a hero. Do you think that they do big boys?

302
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,000
Like us do you think they do big boys like us?

303
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
That would be a great

304
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,680
Funny would it be if at one of our live shows and we wouldn't announce it ahead of time and we wouldn't even say which

305
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,160
One of the three of us it was

306
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,960
But we're like do the kick-ass final yahoo and then just one of us stands up and flies off the stage sins

307
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,280
They're in Vegas. You think they're open yet flying by boy

308
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Yeah, you mean like time change why I got their phone number right here. I could just call him up

309
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,480
Ask how big a boy they can do and if you podcast up

310
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,840
Hey, do you do pod you fly for podcast?

311
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,920
You guys have exactly 10 seconds to talk me out of this. Well, I don't think

312
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,520
Just I want the mental image of us doing a live show only one of our shirts looks vaguely

313
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,960
Rectangular and well, we'd all have to wear the harness fly. Yeah. Yeah, we have to wear the we'd all wear the harness

314
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,800
But only one of us would fly away and it would keep a little surprise in there

315
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,200
We're gonna fly tonight. Yeah, and we could do it of like there's a buzzer under your seat

316
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Yeah, you're all gonna vote on which one you think it's gonna fly away. Can you nail it?

317
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,800
Yeah, and then like Paul comes out and hooks up. Maybe that's it, right? So Paul has the hook

318
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,520
We're all waiting right and you're all in the audience gonna vote. We don't know

319
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,080
Paul's gonna sneak out hook one of us and then whoa

320
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,920
Oh, we'll talk it. We'll be like, oh Paul. I got a wicked wedge right now. Can you come fix for me?

321
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,440
And yeah, so insulting you make me fix your wedge, but really it's not a wedgie

322
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,200
He's hooking the cables up. That's gonna let us Paul. Could you adjust my balls for me?

323
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,600
For like for like a minute and a half until you know, it's safe

324
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:52,600
My balls so they're in the same I'm not calling I'm tired. I want to make this I

325
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Want to make this show normal again. Oh

326
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
I was thinking about it and

327
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,920
I just feel like after the last

328
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,000
Few I was gonna say episodes, but I think I mean years

329
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,640
I just feel like I want this show to get back to normalcy, you know

330
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,560
It's like a normal normalcy has to start somewhere and Justin's saying it's gonna start here

331
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:24,160
It's just like this is not the sort of podcast where people call flying by for the standard of the industry

332
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,060
like

333
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,940
When they did Mary Martin Peter Pan on Broadway fine by foie

334
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,620
See NBC was there and they did the live versions in in the 50s

335
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,240
Yeah, that's flying by foie. And then when they did that one with them Allison, what's her face?

336
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,320
Yeah, I'm on to Allison Janney. No, Allison. It was Allison Janney Williams cuz Brian Williams daughter. Um, the the

337
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,600
Slime by foie like you can only get them and they only do Peter Pan

338
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,160
They don't only do Peter Pan but like you know, they clearly also do Superman gotta do you gotta get foie

339
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,920
You gotta get foie gotta get how does it say on their webpage? How many people they've lost?

340
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,920
They have like well, no, they haven't days since boys boys have fallen

341
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Well

342
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,680
Now to be fair a list and they it's a very it's a very touching memorial wall where it says boys boys

343
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
You no longer need our

344
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
own angel

345
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,960
Now Bobby to be fair we didn't drop him we launched him too hard

346
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,240
That was a different one. So if anything we did it to you good show this this one over here

347
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,880
Ricky he choked on a carrot which we did tell him to not eat carrots while in the harness

348
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,800
We settled that I mean and lay out of court. So don't worry that one

349
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,160
We're that's why there's a question mark over his face

350
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,580
I do I if you do go to a production of a foie production of Peter Pan where there is a boy based

351
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:03,160
Whoopsie, that's got it. That's got to be on some bird man or the unexpected virtue of ignorance shit where it's like, whoa

352
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,360
Damn, that child's committed to the bit. He ran into that armoire going really fast

353
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,640
He is not getting up damn

354
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
He's selling it Wow

355
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:28,720
Wow, man the place then the rest of the place stopped. Whoa, I've never seen something like this

356
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
commitment I

357
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,040
I

358
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Think we should start our own

359
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,160
Flight company like to do performer flying like our own

360
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,600
But it's like the whole bit is that we undercut flying by for like whatever flying by foie hats for you

361
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,040
Like we we will we will do it for less. We're called flyers

362
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,840
Yeah, and with a Z and you could just get us for cheaper and our slogan is basically just as good

363
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,160
Yeah, it should be fine

364
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,520
I

365
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,280
Not too high. I'm going to hit up Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

366
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:13,560
About breaking up this fucking boy based flight monopoly that always got on that cuz like thank you crushes

367
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,480
creativity

368
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,240
Think of all the different ways we could be flying boys right now. Yeah, was it flying with boys?

369
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,440
That's the name of ours flying with boys. We're gonna try some new innovative solutions. They may not always work, right?

370
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,880
But we're willing to try something new foie has been rigging kids the same way, right?

371
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,960
Right, we're gonna wait rig them a different way, right? Exactly. Well, and you know what?

372
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:45,200
There might be a few break good eggs. Listen, I'm not gonna say that we won't break a few eggs. Right a legs

373
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,400
Legs and eggs. That's another thing that I'm trying to pitch

374
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,160
Maybe that's the name of the company. Yeah

375
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
legs legs and eggs

376
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,520
Legs and eggs. That's can I say for like

377
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,440
Just really yeah, just do it. Just real quick legal disclaimer

378
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:11,960
Flying by four. I have no idea if they've ever lost anybody. I will say they do not have a page called foies boys

379
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,340
Why don't we do this

380
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:26,000
Why don't we just leave a gap here where we can drop in the specific audio that flying by foie's lawyers?

381
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
like

382
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,400
Let's leave a break right because they're gonna use some terminology that like we can't generate right now with because we don't have law degrees

383
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,080
Yeah, we'll just leave like a little gap here and then we can drop that in later. Yeah

384
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,480
It was probably silence because we're incompetent but still yeah, definitely

385
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,160
Um, yeah, let's go we're sponsored this week by flying by foie. Oh

386
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,520

So when you buy bomb us, you're also giving it to someone in need

390

You're just you're just going huh? Yeah. Well, I wanted to make it feel personal right?

442
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:56,940
Listen to bull's-eye because Jesse always has really good questions. What did John Malkovich wear when he was 20, huh?

443
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,180
I don't know how to describe it

444
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:06,060
There's always that moment where Jesse asks a question that the person he's interviewing has not thought of before

445
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,180
I don't think anyone's ever said that to me or acknowledged that to me and that is so real

446
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,100
Bull's-eye interviews with creators you love and creators

447
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,100
You need to know from maximum fun org and NPR

448
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,340
Here's another question, so I pulled into the drive-thru a Taco Bell for a breakfast burrito

449
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,900
They took my order, but when I got to the window

450
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:38,340
They told me their system was down and that quote it was my lucky day quote and that quote

451
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,820
My order was free and quote. I'm

452
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:46,620
Done too many quotes. I realize that now. They handed me my food, and then closed the window

453
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
awesome free food except

454
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,020
They forgot to give my drink. Oh

455
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,100
My god, this is real. I need my morning caffeine boost brothers

456
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,060
Would it be okay for me to flag them down to ask for the missing drink?

457
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,700
I ordered but didn't pay for or should I just be happy?

458
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,020
With a free burrito and scram, that's from thirsty in Tennessee

459
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,540
I have no idea. I don't know guys

460
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm

461
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,060
Thanks, just based on how much we've discussed Taco Bell on this show

462
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,860
Which is I would say more than the average bear

463
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,820
We would have a sort of foothold on the diamond. I'm on the tall grass

464
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,460
I'm I'm like

465
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,140
I'm spiral. Yeah, can I be honest? Yeah, this I'm

466
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,380
Melting my noodle, you know what I mean? This is this is our white whale

467
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,940
This is this for me is our greatest challenge

468
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,660
Like we've solved almost everything up to this is our more already. I'm just gonna say entire life

469
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:57,340
Including give birth to my two girls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's this is like nine. Yeah, that's more exactly nine

470
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
I mean I carry those things

471
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:05,060
Yeah, exactly. No, I mean I you carry those for nine more weeks because that's more more accurate

472
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:10,600
That's more accurate and back to back to you. It was 80 weeks total. I got it. Oh, yeah

473
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:16,560
I'm gonna call if he white away. Okay, perfect. Now, are you sure cuz we only get one phone a friend per episode

474
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,740
Well, yeah, no, no, no, it's fine

475
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,180
It's less fun when you actually use real touch tone sounds

476
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,360
A lot of numbers. It's like a toll like

477
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:44,580
He's not it's ringing she's sending a message like more skill couldn't get that sound effect. Hey, how's it going? How's everybody feeling?

478
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:51,160
Wake you up. I'm sorry, man. Oh, you know, you know, I'm always ready to answer the call. So

479
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:57,120
As like the Ghostbusters. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, have you been waiting? Have you been waiting this whole time?

480
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,680
Yeah, I'm sitting in a dark room staring at my cell phone. It's been

481
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:09,040
Three to five years. I don't know what time is anymore, but oh boy. Oh boy. Oh, you've missed so much in the world

482
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,440
I'll tell you it's not great. We got bud. We got some pretty heavy news to drop on you

483
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,520
Yeah, I think that being not going yeah. Yeah, what do you mean?

484
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,160
I was ready to just step outside, you know barefaced and start doing my ritual of kissing everyone

485
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,960
I see it's so funny that you said that oh, oh boy. Oh, yeah

486
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,920
There's this new rapper the baby and I think he's got good opinions and

487
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:45,200
Oh, yeah, and you know, you know how you campaigned so hard for Trump's re-election

488
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:53,280
No way I was I was on the street and by the way, he is he's the toddler now

489
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
That's one of the big things

490
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,060
If you're you're a comedian, you're an actor a writer, but you're

491
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:09,900
Just right. Did you just read his email signature? No, what do you want me to say? What do you want me to say saying you?

492
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,500
You taught me professionally talk about John Cena

493
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,540
You're someone who for a living talks about how funny is that opening number by the way, I'm never skipping the intro

494
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,720
I'm watching this so good crash every time

495
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:28,020
Anyway, we got a question and I got to read it to you because you wouldn't have hurt at it

496
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:35,180
you're good, but yeah, let me sum it up to like basically this person got a free burrito, but not but they didn't get the

497
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,180
drink they ordered and

498
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Sit sit down because

499
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:45,020
They didn't get the so it's like they didn't know if they should go back for their drink or they should just appreciate the free

500
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:52,060
Food they got and I just kind of wanted to take your temperature real quick. Oh, yeah. No, I'm glad that you know

501
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:58,140
That you you've hit me up for this. You know, I I would like to say I'm a Taco Bell expert

502
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:04,620
Yeah, I I was there for the launch of the breakfast menu. Oh really there that morning. I I have pictures

503
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:11,420
Oh, wow, saved of me and two other sad fellas who was like we gotta we gotta be here day one

504
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,140
See what they got going and you know, I also I've worked at Disneyland

505
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,740
Oh, wow, I wonder you're probably wondering where this is gonna come into play, but I'm gonna let you know right now

506
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:30,060
Working at Disneyland. We have these things called magical moments. You try and create a magical moment for your guests

507
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,340
Yeah at the park what is a way and here's what I'm thinking. That was a magical moment

508
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:42,620
Between between them, you know Taco Bell and their systems toxicity of the city of the city

509
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:50,300
So you got to just take it and scram you yeah

510
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,680
I don't think you you know

511
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:59,300
You just take because they're already having a bad day as someone who has worked in the fast-food setting like it was cool for you

512
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,580
But I'm telling you on the inside they're losing their mind like what are we gonna do?

513
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:10,980
Did it count when I clocked in am I working for free that that's if the class is that's the biggest thing

514
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,260
I am I think your reaction to it depends on what level of

515
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,540
Like what level you are with the Taco Bell corporation, which yeah yum brands, right?

516
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,540
Is that yeah, I I feel like if you're a lower level sort of cog

517
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:32,080
It may be turned into a pretty cheery day and honestly, we're gonna be able to slap that that big we're closed side on the window

518
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,520
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

519
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:40,540
I'm sure if I'm sure if you would have returned for your for your drink and walked in it would have been like the

520
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:47,660
Island and yellow jackets like they're all wearing like deer bones, and they're like we are free from the Bell

521
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,020
I don't love that Taco Bell

522
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:00,060
Sells coffee. I guess they don't say coffee explicitly. This could be a war a morning Baja blast

523
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,320
They can't they cannot start their working day without being by Baja

524
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:11,840
uh, but it feels like coffee to me and yeah, it's it can't be you can't be coffee and

525
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,440
Burrito, though, right? Those don't seem like those would go well together for y'all poo-poo the coffee. I

526
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:27,080
Will pitch to you their other breakfast drink, which is just orange juice and Mountain Dew mix together. Oh, that's right

527
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,040
Start your day, honestly

528
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,600
So so y'all jokingly set the bar

529
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
That just gave me

530
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,040
That gave me heart palpitations to hear you say it. Oh boy, howdy

531
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,160
But also I need that drink. Yeah, this is my problem

532
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,560
I like if you're going if you're going through Taco Bell or in I guess this applies to any store

533
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:59,360
But it's definitely definitely true talk about you've already made the decision in your head that it's worth trading your dollars

534
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,960
For your refreshments like that's a some cost at that point that money's gone

535
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,120
But it's not because it was free, right? Yeah

536
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,200
Now you do run the risk if you go back through at a time you go back through the systems up again

537
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
And I like good now we can charge you

538
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:35,680
Yeah, that is good good theory also just consider the fact that that money you've budgeted can now go towards like that

539
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,100
Super expensive coffee shop. You've been wondering about but you're like, I don't want to spend that much on coffee

540
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,740
So now the burrito fund has some rollover bucks

541
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:53,740
And we can take it there and see what it's talking about see what this turmeric pistachio milk latte is all about

542
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,700
Hey me while you're there maybe take some wire cutters

543
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,260
Systems down there. Oh, it's a daisy. Oh, no. Oh god

544
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:10,940
I guess I'll take this yeah to go and they're like, well we can still accept cash and you're like, it's 2022

545
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,940
And you just walk out the door with your free coffee

546
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:19,740
Welcome to my pit for ocean sports are we to assume that the system broke down as like between the time that you ordered and

547
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:26,260
The time you got to the window. Yeah, they wouldn't have taken the order. Yeah, that's what that's good fortune

548
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,580
I think you need to just roll. I I'm I'm taking it back. You shouldn't go back through this Taco Bell

549
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:36,340
You should never go back to this Taco Bell like your this is your moment. You won

550
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,700
You need to get out while it gets good

551
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:44,820
This is the one time where you're up, right the house always wins when you go to Taco Bell, right?

552
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:50,380
But this time you won, you know, it's time to walk away. You're up one over talk about never go back

553
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,300
Because one time what's gonna happen is you're gonna pay they're gonna hand you the bag. All the bags empty

554
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:01,980
Yeah, fuck right. No, man. That's so true. Yeah, it's you'll be like I did not order this I

555
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,420
Or like when you get the trade when when you get something you didn't order and like you're up

556
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:14,180
I got something better, but you're down if you got something worse like I like those Cinnabon buckets

557
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,100
I like a good, you know, Taco Bell Cinnabon bites. It's crispy

558
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,820
Oh, yeah

559
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,280
You know and it definitely has to be I have to be have the heart for it

560
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,140
because when you bite into it and you don't have the heart for you realize what it is and

561
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:32,300
Sad, but when when all the stars align and you can eat that it's great

562
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,700
And one time I ordered it and I got the cinnamon twists

563
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:41,860
which I knew were cheap because my buddy my best friend worked at a Taco Bell and I would

564
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,980
in this is when I was like 18, so, you know, I was pulling up and I was like

565
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
What can I get for free?

566
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:56,020
And he and he always said it was like the cinnamon twist because we just make the like we don't make it to order

567
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:01,180
We just make a whole bunch so we can we give them for free just as a treat a magical moment

568
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,580
Just a magical moment. It's not you're giving away so much information. Oh, yeah

569
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,780
Yeah, like you're gonna put the bail out of business. How do you capitalize on this?

570
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,900
You just go to the window and you're like, hey, listen, I want cinnamon twists and I ain't gonna pay for

571
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:20,900
You do it that which that will do you think do you guys do that thing where you'll get your order and then you pull

572
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,460
Up a little bit and you stop and you go through the back to make sure it's all in there

573
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:29,300
Do you think like the employee ever watches you do that from the window and they're like fuck man, you don't trust me probably I

574
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,940
Can still see you here at my house?

575
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,380
You just checked it what probably but also one time not one time a couple times now

576
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:44,780
There has not been a toy inside of happy meals that has oh full-blown

577
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,380
five harm house fires

578
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:53,620
So that's the worst. We fool me once or twice. No way. Yeah. Well see you got it

579
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,760
You just gotta be like me and be a turbo nerd and be like, oh no. No, they didn't forget the toy

580
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,900
Here's a super Saiyan 5 Goku statue. They put in here

581
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,900
I

582
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,260
We're gonna put it on the shelf so we can look at it, but they did

583
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,460
This is a 12-inch

584
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:20,140
Sculpted statue that they put in your bag. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Yeah, that's a

585
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,020
Kill Bill sword. It's all yours, buddy. Have fun. That's an Atari right there

586
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:33,100
Like I took my three-year-old through Burger King yesterday and the toy was I kid you not

587
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:40,940
pictures of dolphins and I handed it to her and she looked at me like I had just kicked her in like how

588
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:47,620
Fucking dare you. Sorry. What is it again? Dad pictures of dolphins? Wow, that's so cool

589
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,900
I wish everybody had an electronic device that could instantly pull up high-resolution video of dolphins

590
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,100
Oh what we do, but thank you for these great

591
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,820
Cherishable pictures of dolphins

592
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,900
They're half like most of the time now when I get a children's story for my child in a bag

593
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,740
It's like something that then I the parent have to build and I think this is completely

594
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,340
Defeating the purpose of having something to distract my daughter so that I can have five

595
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:16,940
Peaceful moments to myself while she's staring at me going fish building that tackle or whatever

596
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:26,260
Yeah, you keep going to the McDonald's when they have the gunplug giveaways with that

597
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,420
Can you build this HG Gundam Freeman, please?

598
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,140
Yeah

599
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:42,220
You know and a well-ventilated area, yeah, no I I feel the same way whenever it's a whack toy

600
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:47,740
I'm like I failed you but also I'm like you failed yourself because I did research as a kid

601
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,700
I remember you would look and you know, okay, okay Lion King's coming out. They got the Simba toys

602
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,860
This is what I'm asking dad for McDonald's. Okay, they got they go. Yeah, whenever it was like, oh

603
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,820
Here's this like slightly not cool. So I was like, oh we can eat it. We got McDonald's at home dad. It's fine

604
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:13,380
I recently a BB on a Saturday saw that they had in cancer toys. So we went on Sunday and

605
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:19,660
The window like it was the toy changeover and I said, do you still have in Canada? Like and they're like no

606
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,860
We had I got and I said, can you know?

607
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,900
I know and there was a long pause and then they're like, yeah

608
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,580
We don't have any and I wanted to be like I don't listen. I I don't think they

609
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:39,900
Did guarantee they did not look my child is in the car. Like can you tell I'm like you got it

610
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,420
But you remember when Burger King sold golden Pokemon cards inside of metal

611
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,740
Po like you would roll up to Burger King bill

612
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:53,020
Let me get a kid's meal and those have the golden pokeball Pokemon cards that have right and they would be like no man

613
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:59,320
That's five extra dollars and it's like you're a toy store now Burger King. Nice try. Yeah. Yeah

614
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:06,640
Yeah, they did that on the reg because they also did that what like I remember buying a nightmare before Christmas watches

615
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,520
Oh, yeah. No, I got the Wild Wild West sunglasses

616
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,280
Boy

617
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,880
Boy, oh

618
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:27,320
Man, do you still have them? No because that same day we went to Disneyland and me being an idiot kid

619
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:33,960
Wore them on Space Mountain, which if you know what Space Mountain is, there's no reason to wear sunglasses

620
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,520
They're gone

621
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
It's that you want to get rid of

622
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,160
West Jim West Desperado on space

623
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:59,520
But it's just you reaching out towards nothing as your parents

624
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
Hey

625
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:16,280
Please look on the floor Space Mountain decapitated looking for sunglasses

626
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,960
If he can I ask what you did it Disneyland

627
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,200
Oh that if you're one, I know you're one of the princesses you have to say you were like Ariel's friend. Yeah

628
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,800
Yeah, that's that's the scale they do and you know

629
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,960
I gotta say the magic dies the moment you walk backstage because the first thing I saw on my first day

630
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:41,160
I'm working at Disneyland was Mickey with his head off smoking a cigarette and I was like, well, there it is

631
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,760
But I worked on honey. I shrunk the audience and Astro orbiter eventually

632
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:55,920
Was once the no, well Astro orbiter kind of sucks honey. I shrunk the sorry. I'm sorry. I was your fault

633
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,920
You didn't design it

634
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,960
Honey, I shrunk the audience. I was the kid one time on that was on the giant

635
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah, that got blue screen. I had to act like oh no

636
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,160
I'm gonna be is like I did a really good job like the cast member said that I did great

637
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,160
Which I feel like if I had not done really well, they would have said good. Yeah

638
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,880
Yeah, right. All right, but you nailed it back back when it used to be the MGM

639
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,440
Studios instead of Hollywood Studios. I was in a live show and I don't want to brag

640
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,360
But I was waiting backstage to go on and do my bit or whatever. And this isn't the Alfred Hitchcock

641
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,200
No, that's a universal right? Yeah, well, that's another great one, but it doesn't exist anymore

642
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,840
but this was like some kind of old-timey movie show and

643
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,040
read the one of the performers filled up pie set with some whipped cream and then turned me and said put your hands out and

644
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,800
I cut my hands and they filled my hands with whipped cream and it was one of the like when people say like hey

645
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,960
What's your favorite Disney memory? I'm like, well, there's one time when I was nine years old

646
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,680
I got to eat a handful of just whipped cream. It was the greatest experience

647
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,220
I have ever had a Disney because an adult was just like

648
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,680
So don't I would not complain at Taco Bell

649
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,760
