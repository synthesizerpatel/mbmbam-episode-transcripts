1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And their advice should never be followed.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But if there's a diploma on his wall, I haven't seen it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I know it's degree, Travis.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Although this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
out there will know how cool they are for listening.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What's up, you cool baby?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:01:00,000
crowd cheers

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's familiar.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But not too familiar.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But not too not familiar.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a new craze.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey good girls, do you wanna?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just say, hey I wanna.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just say, hey I wanna.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:40,000
crowd cheers

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ladies and gentlemen, John Roderick!

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
crowd cheers

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Claire McElroy.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thanks, both dads.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hey, San Diego, I had a quick question for you. Do you wanna get weird?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
crowd cheers

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think that was a yes. That was the wrong answer.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My MacBook Pro has 69% battery, it's a sign!

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
crowd cheers

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Nice, nice, nice.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If all the owls, instead of saying, who?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All said, nice.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Does a bear nice in the woods? Who knows?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'd probably camp more if owls were like, nice.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you wanna introduce the show, Justin?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
crowd cheers

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
crowd cheers

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
crowd cheers

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Travis fucking,

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I wanna break down what just happened. Travis fucking waited until Justin's

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
cheer died down so there was no cross-pollination. I wanted it to be clear.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hi, I'm 30 under 30 media luminary and baby brother

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Griffin McElroy.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
crowd cheers

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You know, here's what's up. I was about to say, one of these days we'll have to

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
do it in reverse order. I'm in the middle either way.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's a lot of Hennessy!

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a lot of ginger ale, it's a big cup.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a small amount of Hennessy, it just looks large from where you're seated.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You ever call it hinger ale?

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, it's called a horse's neck.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, I'll just do some jokes now.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When Travis said I just wanted to clean a sampling or whatever it was,

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
he said I wasn't paying attention. What you gotta sample there was

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the current Travis character, which is big time Travis.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Or my city Travis. So here's the thing, whenever we go

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
on a tour, and I don't have an explanation for this because it doesn't happen at the holidays

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
when they visit, whenever we go on a tour, we get a new Travis character.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's kind of like Doctor Who except played by the same actor every time.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And usually the performance leaves something to be desired.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Here are some of the characters we have gotten

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
previously. One is Mordecai Travis, which is not

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Mordecai, the Johnny Depp character, but rather a character obsessed with the film

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mordecai while lacking any sort of context or

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
insight into what the film might actually be about. So just basically

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
saying Mordecai a lot. No, it's this, based off the poster

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
what I think the movie is about. Yeah, it's a very fleshed out character. There's

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Big Snapple, who we only get in New York City, and again

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
sort of the depth of that character is, what if they called it the Big Snapple?

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I asked for,

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because I wanted a reprieve from big time Travis McElroy, I was like,

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
please give me Big Snapple, and he said, no, that's a New York boy.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't get him here. We did get a brief reprieve from big time

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Travis McElroy, who also is my city McElroy, so we

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
get a lot of, well that's how we do it in my city, San Diego, because he got here

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
a day before we did.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The other one that we've gotten,

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't know why we've gotten such a... I'll say this, we're ragging on him. I really like the

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
new character. The new character! And I don't know why we've got this fucking...

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is going to, I think, last me on tour, because it's maybe my favorite

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
thing I've ever done. We have this huge

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Noel Coward-esque cast of characters that Travis is dipping into

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
just for this one tour, and this one is

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
whenever there's a dessert or rich food offered, we have to deny it,

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and then Travis has to say, oh come on, let's be bad. Just this once, let's be bad.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He did it with

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the cinnamon

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
bun I had at breakfast today. He did it at the, we've been to the bar,

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
the pool bar at the Marriott twice. He did it with churros

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
both times there? Yeah. And he gets furious. The churros

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
showed up, and I reached over to grab one, and Travis said, no, no, no, no, no. And I was like, what the fuck are you...

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, I really shouldn't eat these churros.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He's going to go straight to my hips, and then... No, let's be bad.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now what, Travis? Well, Travis, you can cut us off a slice. I want to drink the rest of the...

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
God, you know, we've got a show to do. I really shouldn't...

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now...

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Listen, we've worked really hard this weekend.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's be bad.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Justin! I really think we've earned it.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Just this once. Just this once! I'm not done!

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay. Just this once.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This character... I'm not done! Please, please,

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
please be done. Let's be bad. And good.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This character was born out of the fact that all of your meals here in San Diego when you go to a

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
restaurant are apparently just like, they bring them to your table and just

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
upend them out of a fucking duffel bag because it's the biggest fucking portion sizes

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've ever seen in my life. This is not a joke.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We asked the waiter about it this morning, and he said, I don't get it either. Yeah, it's fucked up.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I usually order off the kid's menu is what he said.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Sorry that we got rolling a little late. I know you guys were outside

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
a little bit longer, so I'm sorry. I'm apologizing even though it wasn't my fault at all. Blame Mystery Science Theater

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
3000 for being too funny for too long.

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We're gonna do an intermission, which we've never done before, but we

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
realized there's a thing I guess they invented in the opera,

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in the 16th century, where the opera singers would be like, man, I got pissed.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So we're gonna do one of those, and then after that we're gonna

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
come back and do some Q&A stuff. Not Q&A, that's a fucked up way.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, no. If you've ever wondered how we do our

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
thing, don't do that. Just be more show.

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's not gonna be like a behind the scenes direct. It's just gonna be more of the show.

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The second half, you know, like intermission.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But what that means is extra long, and it'll get a little weird in here, but

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we're all... It's a safe place.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
During intermission there will be, if they're still out there, posters for sale

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
designed by Evan Palmer. They are fucking incredible.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Beautiful. They're really beautiful. They are also pre-signed, so

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
partake. Let's get into this shit.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I have really pointy elbows.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Previously this hasn't been a problem. Someone once thanked me for elbowing them in the face

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
by accident during San Diego Comic Con. But recently...

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Did someone thanked? I don't understand that. Thank? Yes!

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You knocked it back into place.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Several events have made me reconsider the advantages of being able to elbow anyone out of my way.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I popped a friend's air mattress with just my elbow. Holy shit!

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's pretty serious. And my partner

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
will only cuddle with me conditionally out of fear that I'm going to make a wrong move

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and make her double over in pain. Do you have any

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
suggestions as to how I can stop inadvertently causing my loved one's pain

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and financial ruin from HER?

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
HER, are you here? Are you her?

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hi! It's really dark. Hey, what's up? Okay.

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If you could just shout... Why did the person thank you for elbowing them?

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, okay. So they weren't really thanking you

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
specifically for elbowing them in the face. I need to repeat what she said into the microphone

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
for the posterity.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No, there's not. They were looking for the place where the ticket

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
was and you pointed them in the right direction with your elbow.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Can a dull elbow not accomplish that same task? Or check this out!

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I got two of these!

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Did you really? Okay, I don't...

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Did you really? Wait, everyone stay out of this.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is just between me and her.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Did you really pop an air mattress with your elbow?

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It was mine! Okay, yeah.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We got evidence. The wronged party is here.

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Did you like lay down and then turn over and then

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
did you wake up on a flat piece of plastic

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and think not again?

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
These elbows?

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And then you had the Incredible Hulk walk down the street hitchhiking.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Are we talking like apocalypse style

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
bone spurs coming out of them? Yeah, I was about to ask if it's a jagged bone spur situation.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Sorry, we're asking you so many questions. You're sitting so far away.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We just want to know if you're doomsday.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
People get that joke. He had bony elbows.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I mean, I'm sure there's some sort of

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
orthopedic surgery option, but that's not fun.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And also, God doesn't make any mistakes. You got those elbows for a reason.

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You gotta Rudolph this shit.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's some sort of Rudolph scenario. Have you seen the movie?

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Won't you fucking stab a bunch of folks tonight?

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What's gonna happen? David Tennant's trying to get through Comic Con.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's like, no one will make room. And you're like, I've got it, David.

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Except you didn't because you got the surgery to get rid of them.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Have you ever seen the movie Signs? It's basically like that, except

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you're gonna take all your glasses of water and throw them in the toilet.

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They're allergic to water. Fuck, I cleaned all those up.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Where's my baseball bat? I don't know. I'm a grown man.

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's in storage. I don't know where the baseball bat is.

181
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
All the aliens look like big air mattresses. Fucking sweet.

182
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Aw, damn it. I had that surgery yesterday. I can't defend Earth.

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like Jesus wanted me to.

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
God don't make ugly.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We didn't say anything remotely helpful. Do you all want a yahoo, though?

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I just saw

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
your t-shirt in the front row. Yeah, it says, they horny for this one.

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's very, very good.

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This one was sent in by... Somebody yelled, we are!

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This one was sent in by Level9000. Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Thank you, Drew. Oh.

192
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Are you here, Drew? Just shout a big barbaric yell.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I fucking...

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I was just shaken by your fucking Fus Ro Dah all the way up.

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Thank you, Drew. You are a champion and a scholar.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's by YahDrewAnswersUser... Oh, the website's not

197
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
loading. Very good.

198
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The something's gone wrong has popped up. I'll refresh it. That was a mistake.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The data's gone. And it's back. Still not giving me the user's name.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Fine, fuck. Christian Bale. Christian Bale asks...

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
My parents found my bong?

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I had a water bottle bong in one of my sports bags in my closet.

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And mom thinks that it is for drugs, but she's not sure.

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And it reeks of smoke. While my dad thinks it is

205
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
for an experiment I did or something.

206
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I plan on telling them that I planned on seeing how a leaves smell

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
by burning a leaf on the bong and smelling the smoke.

208
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I've never smoked in my life. Do you think I can get away with it?

209
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm very paranoid of getting caught. I wonder why.

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're bad at this. I'm very paranoid of getting caught and they haven't found

211
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
bud or lighter. I would say to this question asker, you don't have to be

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
paranoid about getting caught. You got caught. You got caught, it sounds like.

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How cool is this dad?

214
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think it's for drugs.

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I've never seen one of those before. That's an Erlenmeyer flask.

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
As a parent myself, I can promise you

217
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
your parents will take whatever to get out of this situation.

218
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If you give them something in the same zip code as plausible

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
deniability, they're going to leap right on that. Oh, we don't have to parent this one.

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He was just burning leaves in a science experiment to see what they smelled

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
like. You know how when you're in science class and you burn

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
something and the science teacher is like... Now smell, huff that shit.

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Everybody, don't waft it you wuss. Get in there.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
First huff this shit. It's the control group. Now that one.

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Science. How does that smell? Cool.

226
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's science. You just did science. That's all it is.

227
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You know the experiment. What does it smell like? That's not a

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
scientific experiment. That's a creative writing prompt.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You dullard.

230
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hi, it's me, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

231
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Did you do the experiment I told you about on television?

232
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You know, if the entirety of human existence was a calendar,

233
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
then point zero zero

234
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
zero one second to midnight is where you smell.

235
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, I didn't know you were doing Neil deGrasse Tyson there for a second. Okay.

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I didn't sound like Neil deGrasse Tyson. No, it was weird. You didn't.

237
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Neil, are you here?

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't hear Neil. Holy shit, he's here and there's eighteen

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
of them. It's our worst nightmare. Neil deGrasse Tyson

240
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is cloning himself. How about another question?

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah. Hey boys. Hi.

242
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I've been cosplaying at conventions for years and a few cons

243
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
ago, an artist at a convention took a photo of me and asked

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
to do a painting of me based off of it. The resulting painting was

245
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
not so great. I'm reluctant to hang

246
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it in my home, but I feel like I shouldn't get rid of it. Help?

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What do I do with this huge painting of me dressed in a silly

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
superhero outfit? And that's from Stacy. Stacy here.

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hi. Wait, are you a Cuvian throat singer?

250
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why were there two?

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I just want to say, I heard when you said, took a picture, the acoustics

252
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
in here are fucking incredible because I heard when you said they took a picture and wanted to do a painting

253
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
of it, I heard one person two thousand feet away go, ugh.

254
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I did see today, I saw today on the convention floor

255
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
someone take a photo of someone else's

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
art piece and it was all I could do not to destroy that camera.

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Because the art piece,

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that's theft. It's just that one thing. The camera's pretty much getting it.

259
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Getting it. You got it. You got all the art in there.

260
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You should, let me help. This is an advice show.

261
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Throw it in the trash can.

262
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No, no, no. Short sighted. Short sighted.

263
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I watched many a sitcom. Okay.

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I just rewatched Seinfeld. Have you guys seen it?

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's pretty good. That was a very tepid response.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah. I cannot believe, by the way, IDW announced they're bringing it back

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
as a limited run here at Comic Con for eight issues. They're going to finish

268
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
a lot of the storylines that they left lingering. Are the pretzels making you thirsty?

269
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They are. Yeah, they are. It turns out. Issue three. The crisis on infinite pretzels.

270
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm very excited for it. But here's what's going to happen. You throw that

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
away. Someone drives by. They see the painting. They're like, oh, it's pretty nice. And then they take it.

272
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Then, 15 years from now, they get it appraised and hang it

273
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
in some kind of gallery. The artist sees it and like, where did you find this?

274
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
In the garbage. And they cry.

275
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Or, I mean, by that point, having their work valued

276
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
highly would probably be... They'd probably be maybe a little stoked in this imaginary

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
situation you came up with. No, they painted that for you.

278
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It was a gift. I didn't want a bunch of people to see it and be worth money.

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're bad at... Wait, hold on. I just had a huge realization.

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If an artist's painting sells for a bunch of money, the artist doesn't get that money.

281
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If I sell a painting I already own, I get that money.

282
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The artist is like, my painting sold for how much? Fuck! Damn it!

283
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey, artist, what the fuck?

284
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You should keep getting money off of that. That sucks. I'm gonna work on that

285
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
for you and see what I can't come up with.

286
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I got some things cooking. So, Travis, your version of the

287
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Antiques Roadshow is you go to the Antiques Roadshow and say,

288
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
listen, I had something and I don't now.

289
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What do you think that is worth?

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That would be the best version. It already happens now.

291
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's my favorite version of the Antiques Roadshow. They're like, I have this lamp.

292
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And it's like, did you polish this? I did.

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, polish, it's worth $15. But with the patina,

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
two million. Well, thank you.

295
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I would love it on one episode if they're like, and did you

296
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
do you have the gravy bowl that comes with it?

297
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, actually I don't. I threw it out, didn't I? And then the

298
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Antiques Roadshow, the person just puts their head on the table and is like, Motherfucker!

299
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Fuck!

300
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Fuck! And it's 15 minutes of that.

301
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And it just keeps cutting back to them. And it's a pledge drive.

302
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So that's not...

303
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Did you still have the dust cover to this?

304
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No, when I bought it, I didn't have the dust cover. Oh, okay.

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Son of a fucking

306
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
shit. That is all I've ever wanted from Great British Bake Off

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
is for Paul Hollywood to take a

308
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
bite of something and then look at the person and go, this tastes like dog shit.

309
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's all I've ever wanted. All I've wanted is to watch

310
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The Great British Bake Show and Mary Berry takes a bite of something and says, this tastes like dog shit.

311
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, I want Antiques Roadshow, except the person's like,

312
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I think it's worth $15,000, but who cares what I think? And then Mary Berry comes out and

313
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
takes a bite of the painting.

314
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's a good bike, isn't it? You did really good.

315
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Wouldn't it be funny if the tent fell down?

316
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What if Paul Hollywood just like,

317
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
farted? What are we doing? Why are people here?

318
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I think you've got a future

319
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
at SNL, young man. How about this

320
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yahoo is sent in by Zoe Kinski. Thank you, Zoe Kinski.

321
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Zoe, are you here?

322
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay, that would have been like a gathering of the stars that I was not

323
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
ready for. It's by Yahoo Answers user Katie, who

324
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
asks, Katie has 66% best answers. That's the highest fucking

325
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Katie knows what's up. How to sneak pancakes

326
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
into a movie theater.

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
My brother and I are going to see a movie on

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Friday morning, and we wanted to get IHOP.

329
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And then we thought it would be awesome to do both at once.

330
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But that means we'd have to sneak takeout in, and that's a full meal.

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yep, we have a few ideas on how to do this,

332
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
but they mostly suck. So does anyone have ideas? That was not

333
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
my editorializing. And then a little smiley face at the end to let you

334
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
know, like, it's all fun.

335
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Here's the thing. At this table, two of us

336
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
have had jobs at movie theaters.

337
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Justin, you worked at a movie theater once, didn't you? No, at Blockbuster, it's the movie theater

338
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
in your home. The rest of that sense was going to be, and across this table,

339
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
we have been fired twice from Blockbuster. But we've worked at

340
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
movie theaters twice, and I feel like the sneaking food in thing

341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
is something that everybody's a little paranoid about,

342
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that you couldn't be bothered less about. Yeah, I couldn't get less of his shit.

343
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You could walk into my movie theater with a pizza

344
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and a growler, and I'd be like...

345
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Wearing a sport coat made of the pizza you plan to eat during the movie.

346
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And I'd be like, you didn't have to, just go. Go.

347
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Fine, yeah. Enjoy Sky High, I don't fucking care.

348
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Enjoy Sky High, just...

349
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Some Sky High fans, good crowd for that, I guess.

350
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Alright, so, just so I'm clear, fuck Seinfeld, but Sky High is...

351
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Awesome.

352
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You've gotta get a top hat.

353
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And the thing is, you're gonna have to

354
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
stack some cakes. You're gonna do some cake stacking.

355
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
In your hat. And then, that's easy. We've got the easy part solved.

356
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Cakes, pancakes. But then, you're gonna get the shi...

357
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Wait, you gotta do it dry. Gotta do it dry. Gotta do it dry, because you're gonna get those shitty plastic ramekins

358
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
that are designed to open. That are designed to open... How do you know so much about how the

359
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
IHOP fucking goes? How they IHOP-erate?

360
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That's gonna be the hard thing is... Wait! No, that sucked, don't...

361
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That was bad. IHOP-erate? I wanna hear stories of Justin's IHOP experience.

362
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So, what... You're just gonna have to dump the syrup

363
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
on and get a good seal going.

364
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, wait! Straight up, freeze the syrup. Freeze the syrup.

365
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Then warm it up in your hands in the movie.

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And then, listen, you're gonna be tempted to go too far, and then you'll

367
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
just have syrup on your hands, and that's gonna be tricky. This process, it's gonna

368
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
make a lot of noise, because you're gonna be in the theater just like...

369
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And someone will turn around and say, like, can you please keep it down? It's fucking Despicable

370
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Me 3, and, like, my kids, can you please... And then you turn to them... I can't hear the

371
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
minions of the important dialogue. You turn to them, and what's great is you go...

372
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And you look like a weird syrup monster, and no one fucks with that.

373
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Wouldn't it be sweet if movie theaters finally started selling syrup warmers?

374
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And they're just like, yeah, we get it.

375
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That'll be seven dollars.

376
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So you get a watertight, syrup-tight seal on your top hat.

377
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The problem is this, and I know you've all been thinking, but Justin,

378
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
wait. I've thought about it. When you go in, you see a

379
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
gentleman or a gentle lady, and they're gonna doff their cap to you.

380
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Ah, shit. And then it's like, am I gonna leave a

381
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
gentle bro hanging or not? Because if I open it...

382
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Preserves. It's gonna be fucking compote.

383
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Compote sliding down your grill. That's no good.

384
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But you're not gonna leave a gentle person hanging. I gotta go for it.

385
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Gotta do it. That's how they get you. That's why they have a doffer at every entrance.

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah. Ah!

387
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You doff your hat. Runts. Just falling down your face. Bulk runts.

388
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's...

389
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I tried to explain to them, like, no, it's much cheaper

390
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
out there. They give you a lot of it for less money,

391
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
so I just did that. No, they're structural runs. Do you have

392
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
price matching? Because I'll do that here.

393
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I would watch this show, and it's just about the plight of a ticket taker,

394
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
who anytime anybody comes in with like a unique garb,

395
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
a uniquely spacious garb, like some of the platform shoes, like,

396
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
all right, go on in, but I'm looking for fucking spaghetti

397
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
hanging out of those. The show's just called

398
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's Cool, I'm Stoned.

399
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
They should have a bake car where a guy hands you

400
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
a box of Junior Mints outside. Hey, can you hold these for me?

401
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's for a friend. I left the... She's inside. Maybe just carry these inside.

402
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
When I worked as security at a

403
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
big electronic retailing... It's Best Buy, why are you being real? Shut up!

404
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm under an NDA!

405
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm not. It's fine. They're cool.

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
They understand. Taking a while to back into this Best Buy story.

407
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's gonna be a good one, guys. Strap in. With this much build up?

408
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
One of the things that you had to do to arrest someone was prove that

409
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
they intended to leave without paying, so just because you

410
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
saw someone put it in their pocket, maybe they were gonna pull it back out and pay for it at the register.

411
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This is my payment pocket.

412
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I need these hands free!

413
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I wanted to remind myself to buy it, so I put it here so I wouldn't forget.

414
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So one time, this person was stealing a bunch of stuff,

415
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and they walked through the detectors and it beeped, and they looked at me

416
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and I was like, you're cool! Travis!

417
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Because if they didn't walk out the door, I wouldn't get the arrest!

418
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What the fuck? Did you immediately go outside and tackle them?

419
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No, the cops did that. That I had called.

420
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And prepared for this moment.

421
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You're on stage describing entrapment, and also...

422
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Did you have a commission of just like...

423
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
No, but I did jump up and down so hard and, joy, I hurt my ankle.

424
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Because you got someone arrested?

425
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
This is confusing to me, because if you're in Best Buy Laws Prevention,

426
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
they have to leave the store before you can prove stealing, right?

427
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You take one fucking step out of that

428
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
store, and you're nothing. Like, you don't have jurisdiction

429
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
outside the store, right? You have no power out there.

430
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So where is the horizon?

431
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Hey, is this the police?

432
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Be ready. No, you did 811. We get this all the time, though.

433
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Try again. This is Sketchers.

434
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Alright, Sketchers.

435
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Why is your phone number so fucking short?

436
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Wait, did you say Sketchers? Yeah, they're also at the mall.

437
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Oh, okay, got it. Thank you. Come along with me.

438
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Also, I don't think that's a thing. I don't think there's a Sketchers store at the mall.

439
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Wait, hold on. Oh, please, we gotta do more fucking questions

440
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
instead of talking about stores at the Huntington Mall.

441
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
My partner... but did you hear the Payless and the Shoe Carnival merged?

442
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Really? They're just one big fucking shoe carnival now.

443
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Get out. It's madness. That seems like a monopoly.

444
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I love any investment in the old girl. I'm just happy to see the dollars

445
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
at the Huntington Mall. Also, they expanded the dicks, so now it's a dicks

446
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and a field and stream. Get the fuck out. I'm serious.

447
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Really? Did they have a pet store back? For a while,

448
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
they built an additional entrance to dicks because they were changing the other one

449
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
to field and stream, so for a while there were just two dicks there.

450
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This sucks so bad. What's at the Pied Piper now?

451
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The Pied Piper, it's a US Army recruitment station.

452
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Really? And there's some parallelism there if you want to get into the...

453
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Two pretzel places. Really?

454
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Which one's better? One's a kiosk. Is that Excalibur?

455
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What? Excalibur? Excalibur's still selling swords and Hummel figurines.

456
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Nice, nice, nice. Crushing it. They closed. I thought it'd be funnier.

457
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Did they rebuild the Caramel Corn store after it burned? Sorry? The Caramel Corn store?

458
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Please, oh God, you had to say it twice. That's double...

459
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Caramel Corn store is now Dave's. They have Caramel Corn,

460
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but also other things. You know, if Caramel Corn fought to diversify,

461
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
they might not have burned down. Let me get in on the bit, actually.

462
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I forgot we had a Caramel Corn store at the mall.

463
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Not a restaurant, a retailer. I love it. How about another

464
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
fucking question?

465
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That was the sound of relief.

466
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
The Caramel Corn store at the mall was called Caramel Corn,

467
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
but they spelled it with K's. Okay, guys.

468
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Good try. Having fun with it. How about another question?

469
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
My partner and I both like dancing,

470
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
especially at parties. We wanted to up our wow factor, so we're thinking

471
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
of choreographing a full dance that we can whip out whenever

472
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
a certain song comes on. Go back to talking about the Huntington Mall.

473
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The question is,

474
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
what party song do we use?

475
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And that's from Matilda. Matilda, I have some bad news. You've chosen the wrong question.

476
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We see this sometimes.

477
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I didn't know questions could be wrong.

478
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Are you here, Matilda? Yeah, sorry.

479
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
No, that's fair.

480
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm thinking about the amount of effort that goes into

481
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
choreographing a dance that you can bust out at events.

482
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
We all understand the impulse. Everyone wants to look like a dancing queen.

483
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We've all seen a goofy movie and thought that would be...

484
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That's the dream. But at the same time, you work really hard

485
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
to master this dance. How many times can you do it before your friends

486
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
show up to a party and you're like,

487
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
do you want to funk on that thing? And they're like, fuck! God!

488
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh, good point, Griffin. So what you need to do,

489
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
choreograph a dance. That can work to any song? Do it to any song.

490
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Song comes on, yeah. This one.

491
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Do the chicken dance, but it's not the chicken dance. No, it's not.

492
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's your own thing. It's a turkey dance. Matilda, you... It's not great.

493
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That's the best joke I had. Shit.

494
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Matilda, I'm not sure you should do this thing.

495
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I think that it would be pretty fun the first time, but I do think that there's going to be some

496
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
devaluing in repetition with this, where you'll feel very good

497
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
about it the first time, and honestly, the first time, people are going to fucking nut about it.

498
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They're going to be really stoked about it, and you'll feel stoked about it,

499
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and then you'll be like, those McElroy idiots, they don't know anything. And then it's going to be

500
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
a funeral, or it's going to be...

501
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The song's going to come on, and there's going to be a part of you that's like, this isn't appropriate.

502
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And then there's going to be another part of you where it's like, we did practice a lot.

503
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Seems like a shame to miss it. And this is maybe the only time

504
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm ever going to be at a funeral where they're playing Uptown Funk.

505
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But the slow ballad version. The slow acoustic Uptown Funk.

506
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Uptown funk you up, I said Uptown funk you up.

507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What if you pulled a move directly from 90s TV

508
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and just yelled, do the Matilda!

509
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And then just saw what everybody did, and whatever they did was down the Matilda.

510
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That's the dance, I like that. That's the Matilda, everybody going, hmm? That's the dance!

511
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You know what else I like?

512
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You get this dance going at a friend's wedding, steal the fucking spotlight, love that.

513
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Take that, Derek! And then...

514
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You fucking pack your bags, you move away. I'm talking about

515
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
you are now living an Incredible Hulk Pretender-esque lifestyle

516
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
where it's just like, hey, yeah, I just moved here to Milwaukee, I need some new friends.

517
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You spend like a month ingratiating yourself, getting invited to that new party,

518
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and then you're like, is this Uptown Funk?

519
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You folk it up. No, it's Garth Brooks' The Dance, and we've told you

520
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
that several times. And then it's like, where did Matilda go? Ah, moved to Phoenix.

521
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Had work there.

522
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Let me suggest this. They play Uptown Funk.

523
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Natural.

524
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You dance to it bad. Oh, no.

525
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Everyone's like, mmm, mmm, and move. I thought they practiced this, that wasn't very good.

526
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah, this is bad, right? And then you turn to the DJ and you go, you know what?

527
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Give us one more shot.

528
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Play Uptown Funk twice in a row!

529
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And then the DJ...

530
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The DJ sees something in your eyes.

531
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And he goes, you know what? Gotta give him a shot.

532
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And he plays that again, and everyone's like, didn't we just play this?

533
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Is he okay?

534
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But then they see you swing dance to it, which is of course the best dancing.

535
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
To Uptown Funk, it's the best dancing

536
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
you can do is an old-timey swing dance. It fits to any song.

537
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Sure. Have you not seen swing dance?

538
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
How about a Yahoo?

539
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
This one was sent in by Level 9000. Yajur Juju, do you have it in port? Thank you, Juju.

540
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's from Yajur Answers Users.

541
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh, this is 200th one!

542
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah!

543
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Can we get a little bit of house lights, please? Can we get the house lights up, please?

544
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Can we get house lights up, please? House lights.

545
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
A little bit. If that's possible, house lights. House lights.

546
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
One sec. House lights.

547
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Drew Davenport!

548
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Drew Davenport!

549
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Alright, now back to us. Now let's do it.

550
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Hey, wait a minute. Drew's dead. It's our show now.

551
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Let's do the question. Wait a minute, this one's super racist. Drew!

552
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Drew, you milkshake ducked us.

553
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
This one's asked by Yajur Answers User, Sarah W,

554
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
who asks, does Batman eat or drink while he is Batman, or does

555
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
he wait until he is Bruce Wayne?

556
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I think...

557
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Travis is laughing for a very specific reason that we'll get into in a second.

558
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I think that Batman is in costume so long sometimes that he must at least drink water

559
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
to keep himself hydrated. But my friend thinks that there must be

560
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
a hydration IV in Batman's utility belt. Not fucking Dune!

561
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That makes a lot... Not in a Freeman suit!

562
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That makes a lot of sense. Batman doesn't know how long he's going to be hiding up there

563
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
when he's in the rafters or what have you.

564
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So he just wants the hydration built in and a catheter, we must assume.

565
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
My favorite Batman series is Batman

566
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The Catheter is Assumed. It only ran for a few

567
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
issues. It was soundly rejected by critics, but it meant

568
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
something to me, damn it. Here's why I'm laughing. When Griffin and I

569
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
were walking to the Avengers Zone show yesterday, we saw a guy

570
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
in a full Christian Bale Batman

571
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Dark Knight Batman ordering some

572
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
food. He was still wearing the

573
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
cowl and everything. And then we had a lot of fun

574
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
with the rest of our walk of just like, are the samosas particularly spicy?

575
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
How spicy are the samosas?

576
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Is the non-dairy free?

577
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This is fun.

578
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I would actually love to like, I don't know how we do this, but I would love to hear

579
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
from the audience about my favorite, this is my first time at Comic Con

580
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and it's been, thank you, thank you. I don't know why I'm thanking you

581
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I came to a show, I did a thing.

582
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The best part, other than watching Justin's face

583
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
as he is slowly consumed by a mob of people

584
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
racing to meet the cast of The Flash. Quick side note, I was trying

585
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
to cross the fucking floor and I hear, is anybody out there

586
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
like The Flash? The answer from everyone on Earth was

587
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
yeah. And then I hear, welcome to the stage, the cast of The Flash

588
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and I look up and just like a fucking omen of death, there's

589
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
John Wesley Shipp just staring back at me. It might also have been Grant Gustin

590
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I have a hard time telling them a part that looks so similar to their father and son. And they're

591
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
looking down at me and I realize, oh God.

592
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I can see them so good. And then I turn around

593
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and it's just like this mob of iPhones raised high in the air

594
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
squishing me and my dad as we try to get

595
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
away from the show floor and get out of there and we were almost killed

596
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
by this horde of people trying to see the cast of this show.

597
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm sorry, does it have to stop you? No, Travis, you don't because I'm going to be

598
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the first to say flash mob out loud. No, no, no.

599
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
No, I'm sorry. Our dad has just texted us. Our dad

600
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
has just texted us mid show. I saw a Golden Age Flash

601
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
riding on one of those pedal thingies yesterday. That's very good.

602
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Golden Age Flash in a pedigab is funny on a lot of different levels. But this is what, this is

603
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
my favorite thing of Comic Con is cosplay people

604
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
as characters doing mundane things that it is so inappropriate.

605
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And this is all time, maybe funniest thing I've ever fucking

606
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
seen in my whole life. And I feel uncomfortable conjuring the specter of this

607
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
scene here during this live show because it's going to be funnier than anything that we could possibly say.

608
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
When we were at the Marriott pool bar the other day, I

609
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
was walking outside and I passed by a table

610
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and there was Dumbledore and he was

611
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
eating out of a styrofoam to go box some buffalo wings.

612
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We saw

613
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Pepsi Man peeing in a urinal.

614
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
We saw Pepsi Man piss in the bathroom. We got here

615
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
day one, we're like let's go to the bathroom before we get into it and there was fucking

616
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Pepsi Man just like pissing.

617
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's become my new favorite thing to see these really intricate cosplays.

618
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Like that's great. And then the first, if they walk in the bathroom they have to go, fuck.

619
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
If you've got a really good one. Can we get house lights?

620
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
House lights for a second. If you've got a really good one. Cosplay character doing an awesome

621
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
mundane thing. Yeah, it has to be superhero doing a mundane thing, two it has to be

622
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
real, if you lie we'll know, and three it has to be short. If you have something

623
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
fitting that description. Not as many takers as I thought there would be for this. We have microphones

624
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
somewhere, right? You can also just shout it, I don't think the mics are out just yet.

625
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Okay, hold on, wait, I'm just going to, right here.

626
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's pretty good. You had to put your cape over your shoulder when you went to the restroom.

627
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I felt weird repeating that, but.

628
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's fine. Right there in the back.

629
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh shit.

630
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Hold on, we have to repeat these things into the microphone. Griffin, what did he see?

631
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You saw a guy dressed as Sasuke from Naruto get arrested.

632
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Now I will say this,

633
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I've never been arrested and taken to jail, but if I was,

634
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I would love to be dressed up like a Naruto character.

635
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I saw last night walking down the street

636
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
with my friends Paul and Storm, I saw a superhero

637
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
bunched up vomiting.

638
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And I saw a lot of other superheroes walk by without helping.

639
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This is specifically what Uncle Ben was

640
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
talking about. This is my favorite parable, Jesus, thank you for sharing it with me.

641
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Right here.

642
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Hold on, I'm pointing at this person. We'll do the balcony in a second.

643
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Saw Batman petting a ferret.

644
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Dr. Manhattan eating a hot dog.

645
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You fucking teleported to Jupiter, what are you doing?

646
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Princess Belle complaining about her boyfriend on a cell phone.

647
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Right there, I'm looking, yes.

648
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yes, you and then the person who's right next to you. You first.

649
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You're standing up. You're doing it.

650
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
A Power Ranger with a cell phone in his crotch.

651
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
When they did that, did the fucking Megazord show up?

652
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh.

653
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Excellent, right behind you.

654
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Drunk Naruto barfing down the front just like Naruto does.

655
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I've never seen Naruto.

656
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I saw a Harley Quinn and the Joker

657
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
that she was with calling her mom to be picked up.

658
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That's extremely good.

659
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm like a dog chasing my mom's car.

660
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught it.

661
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'd get in her midsize sedan

662
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and I'd go back to dad's house

663
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
because it's every other weekend.

664
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yes, stand up.

665
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Be cool.

666
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Get the fuck right out.

667
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
PETA called the cops on the furry convention?

668
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That doesn't fit within the context of our thing, but I very much appreciate this.

669
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Hold on, wait. Time out. I'm sensing there's more.

670
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah, the LAPD officer.

671
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's what I expected. There's a cop going, and what do I...

672
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And who do I arrest?

673
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I can't arrest a fucking dog.

674
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yo, yo, yo. Furries can do infinite crime.

675
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah.

676
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
This guy's holding my fucking plasma screen television

677
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
that he just took out of my house. What are you talking about? That's a big dog.

678
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Wasting my time. That's a panda.

679
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Should we... Yeah, let's call it for now. Thank you all very much for your fun stories.

680
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
We're going to go take an intermission and then we'll be back and we'll do some audience stuff.

681
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
We'll be right back. Alright, we'll be right back. Thank you.

682
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Do you think they can hear that airplane? Maybe.

683
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We're sleeping on the tarmac tonight. We're having a tarmac campout here in Los Angeles at the beautiful

684
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Los Angeles X Airport. I don't know why they call it that.

685
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Hey, I want to call it the LA Airport. Put an X on there.

686
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, it makes it better. All the kids are in the X games right now. It's a very hot airport.

687
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Thanks for listening to the live show that we just did. Where?

688
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Here in San Diego. Here in California.

689
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah, here on the West Coast. But up on it from where we are now at the beautiful Lox Airport.

690
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Let's tell them what we got them money wise. I got you a slice of

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
be able to find an easier, more pleasurable, streamlined way of

694
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
doing it than Squarespace. It's a very horny

695
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
process. There's a lot of sort of, on their website

696
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
a lot of very sexy stick art. It's a hypersexual

hyperlink experience. You can create a beautiful website

I am a big and long time fan of Audible.

708
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Audiobooks are about the only way I read nowadays.

709
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I know. I'm too busy to do stuff with

710
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
my hands. I just got these two ears. I don't know why I'm doing this voice.

711

I just read The Disaster Artist

723
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yes. Good. No you don't understand.

724
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm in love with Mr. Potter. Do you love Mr. Potter? Then you should check

725
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
out your wizard Harry. Oh there's another airplane.

726
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Don't get caught up in the jets of it. It's a Harry Potter

727
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
podcast where friends recap the books and discuss everything Harry Potter.

728
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Currently they are on Prisoner of Azkaban. If you love

729
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
drama you won't want to miss the trivia rounds during which the hosts

730
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
vie for the Quizzich cup. Oh nice. Nice.

731
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And generally get mad at each other. If you want to find it.

732
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I hope it's not too serious. They keep alight. You know them.

733
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You can search for your wizard Harry on iTunes

734
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
or you can go to geeklyinc.com

735
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
to find out more. I love by the way Justin's impression

736
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
of Gary Sinise doing an impression of Hagrid.

737
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I was going to say Rip Torn doing an impression of Hagrid. It's much more Gary Sinise.

738
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I have a personal Jumbotron message. This one's for Morgan and it's from

739
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Andrew Jose or Jose who says

740
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
since I have no idea when this message will be up we'll combine all of the

741
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
2017 things it can possibly hit. Congrats on getting into grad school.

742
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I hope. What a cold shot there Andrew Jose. Although I'm sure

743
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Morgan pulled it off. Happy birthday. Good luck at

744
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Camp Hollywood and ILHC and Merry Christmas. But above

745
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
all I hope this message finds you full of happiness. Love Andrew.

746
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I like that intern there Andrew. You know what but you know what really matters?

747
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
The friends we made along the way. We have some very

748
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
important things that we need you to know about. First Monday night

749
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
we are on an episode of At Midnight with Chris Hardwick. Earlier today we can say that.

750
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Well when you listen to this last night. If we sound loosey goosey we're coming down

751
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
off that being on TV the national television for the first time stress.

752
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But you should go check it out on the Comedy Central website

753
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and if you like it tell other people to watch it.

754
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Other stuff. Can we talk about? Yeah we should.

755
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
We're doing live shows. This fall we're doing a lot of live shows.

756
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
All over. Yeah so basically

757
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
we are going to be putting tickets on sale this Friday

758
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000

763
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we're going to be at the Cobb Energy Theater I guess. Is that a field?

764
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Cobb Energy. Sounds serious. That's in Atlanta Georgia and then

765
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
on the 21st we're going to be doing MBMBAM in Nashville at Andrew Jackson

766
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000

767
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000

we're hitting the Chicago Theater on November 17th.

769
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You can guess what city that's in. The Orpheum Theater

770
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
in Minneapolis on November 18th and the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee on

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
November 19th. And to finish up along

772
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
in conjunction I would say in the time schedule with

773
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
PodCon in December we will be doing an Adventure Zone

774
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000

775
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
December 8th. So all those tickets are going on sale this

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Friday at noon local to the times where the cities are.

777
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
If you live in one of those cities or you want to get there for one of those shows

778
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
we have no quality control we could possibly do

779
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
with any of these things. So be online and ready to buy tickets

780
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
ahead of time and may the odds be ever in your favor.

781
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I hope everything goes well but it's kind of

782
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
way beyond our pay grade. We're going to have links to all these

783
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
if you go to mackleroyshows.com we'll have a

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
header tours and you can click that and get the links

785
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
but it'll be noon your time on Friday this Friday

786
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
even the shows in December go on sale this Friday. We'll tweet the links and everything too.

787
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Good luck and we love you and

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
please come out and tell everybody because they're big shows and

789
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
we haven't been to some of these places before at all so we just want to make sure to see everybody

790
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
because sometimes it takes a long time in between us doing this stuff so

791
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
come on out. I think that's it yeah? Yep. Enjoy the rest of the show thank you

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
it's the Munch Squad.

808
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
This is like the tenth time you've done Munch Squad.

809
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It was not a good transition.

810
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Thanks Dad.

811
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Today's Munch Squad was submitted to us by one Sydney McElroy.

812
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's funny.

813
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
She doesn't care for my brother, my brother and me so much. Huge Munch Squad

814
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
fan. Deep in the squad.

815
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Whoever makes those Munch Squad only YouTube cuts, Sydney sure appreciates

816
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
that. Applebee's has introduced a new

817
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
topped and loaded menu. Wait, Applebee's?

818
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Eating good in the neighborhood? That's the one except

819
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
it's not that. It's eating bad in the neighbor sad.

820
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Thanks.

821
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Okay, the thing I enjoy about the topped and loaded menu

822
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
is that as I say the words to you, it's going

823
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
to sound normal and then your brain is going to start processing

824
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
it and you're going to realize that that is not the case.

825
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Applebee's Neighborhood Grill and Bar today unveils Topped and Loaded, a limited time

826
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
lineup of craveable, customizable entrees.

827
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Starting at only $10.99 at participating restaurants, the topped and loaded menu features

828
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
four protein choices. Let me just say, so appetizing.

829
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Three delicious toppers and four side options.

830
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Giving guests an abundance of mouth watering combinations to choose

831
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
from. Guests are invited to explore a variety of options

832
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and build their perfect meal.

833
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
If this is your perfect meal, please.

834
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
My last meal, I want it to be topped and loaded.

835
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Let's be bad.

836
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Do you want dessert?

837
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Well, we did kill 18 people. I was very bad when I did all the murders

838
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
and I'm going to continue being bad. Top and load that shit.

839
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It says they can build their perfect meal

840
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
with these three simple steps. Oh, boy. You know you got a real

841
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
hit on your hands when there's a flow chart for your dinner.

842
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So you start with your protein base. It says that.

843
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like, soylent. Like, start with

844
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
A, chicken breast. B, bone-in pork chop. Nice.

845
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Oh, it's bone-in. Never mind.

846
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Six ounce USDA Choicetop Soreloin or

847
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
eight ounce USDA Choicetop Soreloin. All right.

848
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I don't know how my hunger differentiates between the exact same

849
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
six or eight ounce steak, but here we go. You know what?

850
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm hungry, but I'm only three quarters

851
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
as hungry as I might be. Actually, can you shave

852
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
one ounce off the eight? Because I feel like a seven. I'm seven

853
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
ounce hungry. You got to pour the eight into the six ounce and what's left?

854
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
My heart puzzle. Excuse me. I saw you shave one ounce off of his steak.

855
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I want a seven by order of six. Can I have his ounce? So we all have

856
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
sevens. Then you're going to pick your topper on your

857
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
protein, and here are the options. See? The Cajun

858
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
shrimp topper, which includes blackened shrimp, salted onions, and savory lemon

859
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
butter. I feel kind of bad for shrimp that it didn't make the protein base

860
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
cut. Bacon, beer, cheese

861
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
topper. That's made of Blue Moon white cheddar cheese

862
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
beer cheese, spared. No expense. This is just called the goodbye option.

863
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Nah, that one's next.

864
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Bacon, crispy onions, and fresh green onions. Hey Applebee's,

865
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I trust you to put something fresh on my top that loaded about as far

866
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
as I can throw you, but thank you. It's very sweet of you to write.

867
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And finally, the marinara mozzarella

868
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
stick topper. And then it says, the

869
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
next part of the sentence is consisting of, and it's like, yeah, I fucking get it.

870
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You fucking assholes. I know what you're

871
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
doing. Crispy mozzarella sticks, classic

872
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
marinara sauce, and a parmesan cream sauce.

873
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
What the fuck?

874
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
How do you get a steak, and you put mozzarella

875
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
sticks on it, and then you put marinara on it, and someone's like,

876
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
there's something missing.

877
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I could do more. Here's the thing, I am not above

878
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
ordering mozzarella sticks as an

879
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
appetizer, and then a steak

880
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
as the dinner, but if the server tripped,

881
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and dropped

882
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
the app plate on the steak plate,

883
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I would say, redo that.

884
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Try again. This isn't fine.

885
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I have to ask a question of this character. Is there a

886
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
limit to Let's Be Bad, where

887
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
they put mozzarella sticks on a steak, and then they put marinara sauce on

888
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
the sticks, and then they put a fucking parmesan cream sauce

889
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
on top of the other sauce? Well, Let's Be Bad, see that, and say like...

890
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Well, here's the... Nobody's that

891
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
bad. It's the difference between Let's Be Bad, and Let's Fuck Up.

892
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But what does Applebee's have to say for themselves? We're sorry.

893
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We're so, so sorry. Our topped and loaded

894
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
menu gives guests what they've always wanted.

895
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
If they really admit it. Look within yourself.

896
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It gives our guests what they've always wanted. A cheap and easy death.

897
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
A swift, painful passing

898
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
from this thing they call mortality. A mozzarella

899
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
escape. A mozzarella mortality escape. To show up

900
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
in front of St. Peter's, Pearly Gates, and have him say, you look like shit.

901
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Did he do the parmesan sauce?

902
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Jesus! You smell like ass. You gave them the porn, you're going to hell. I hate

903
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
this. Give them what they've always

904
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
wanted. The chance to top one favorite with another

905
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
to discover a creative and tasty spin on a

906
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
classic. Hey, how's your fucking bucket list going? Pretty bad, it seems.

907
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Just the one item on there. The one thing you've always wanted

908
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
is to put mozzarella sticks on an Applebee's steak, and then marinara sauce and cream

909
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
sauce? Fuck off. The steak's pretty good, but what

910
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
bums me out is it stops here. But what

911
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
if it stopped here? Thomas

912
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Yoon, the executive chef of Applebee's, says I quit.

913
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I'm done. This is it. I knew you would push me

914
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
too far at some point, and this is it. I've never quit in a press

915
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
release before, but... No, I love Thomas.

916
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
He's my new guy. He gets audacious here. For example,

917
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
pairing the chicken breast with the marinara mozzarella stick topper

918
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
with the parmesan cream sauce is a deconstructed and reinvented

919
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
chicken parmesan.

920
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Okay, is that sentence...

921
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Are there a weird string of capitalized letters

922
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
in there where it's perhaps a secret message like, they've got me trapped

923
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
in the bunker.

924
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Please send help. Please send broccoli

925
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
or celery at this point.

926
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You want me to brand it? No, please.

927
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And reinvented chicken parmesan that satisfies and delights the taste buds

928
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
in a way that is uniquely Applebee's. Thomas Yoon

929
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
on this, we can't agree.

930
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Jesus!

931
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
That was the worst

932
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Sonic experience I've ever had. I am legitimately sorry. I got a little

933
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
choked. Let's do audience questions. Can we get lights up?

934
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So don't come down just yet. We'll just raise your hand

935
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and we'll call you up, sort of Price is Right style. Hold on. Before we call anybody.

936
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
We have one rule. You know what it is.

937
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Okay, now you might hear that and think, okay, but mine...

938
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
No. Yeah, not just one.

939
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And if you start it with, I know this sounds like a bummer, but no.

940
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Let's just work our way across and then

941
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
balcony, I'm sorry, we have nothing for you. If you've got a really good one,

942
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
come down to the lobby and just listen. Yeah, I guess so. Alright, left side.

943
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
What's up? Nothing, I guess.

944
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah, no, that person who was getting pointed at by another person with a sword.

945
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yes, yes. The only person in that whole section with their hand up.

946
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Yeah, the first person who said, yes, you're good. Come on down. Yes.

947
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It continues to be you. I fucking love...

948
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
This is the only show we've ever done where Travis said the person with the sword pointing at somebody

949
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
else and there were like six people, like, nice.

950
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It's down here. It's down here. It's down here. Can we get a little bit more

951
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
speakers? Hi. Hello. Hi.

952
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Hey, what's your name? Jerrick. Hi, we've met you at the booth at the signing thing.

953
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Hi. Hi. How's it going? Not bad. Are you having fun at the con

954
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
or have you seen? You guys. Okay, good. Fair. What's your question,

955
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Jerrick? Sounds like a pretty shitty con so far. Hey, I

956
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
was emotional. Okay. So, I have this thing

957
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
where multiple times

958
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
random people that I've never met before, they think they know me

959
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
and they'll go, oh, start waving or like, I think I

960
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
remember you from somewhere. And some of them are so excited to see me,

961
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
they go up and give me a hug. Oh, okay. And then when they pull away, they

962
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
see my frightened face. And then they're like,

963
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I thought I knew you. What's the best way of

964
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
diffusing the situation? God. Where are you at that that's happening?

965
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'll hug, but I'm not gonna look at your face first.

966
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It's happened at like school and Comic Con and just when I'm

967
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
out at... Jerrick, I live with social

968
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
anxiety, which the main way it manifests is like, I don't know what to

969
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
fucking say to people, especially meeting new people. I have no idea. Maybe you should

970
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
stop looking this incredible gift in the mouth. Like,

971
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
or gift horse rather. That's the expression. Don't look a gift in the mouth. Don't look a gift in the mouth.

972
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
This person has come up and hugged you.

973
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I think you got a friendship burn right there. Yeah, it's way better rather than your frightened face

974
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
if they pull back and you're going...

975
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I don't know you. Well, just stare them dead in the eyes and be like, welcome

976
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
aboard. Shall we exchange

977
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
contact info? It may seem you've gotten on the wrong train now,

978
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
but look around you. Maybe it's the perfect...

979
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I see you've met my...

980
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I think just lean into it and make a new friend. Do lean into the hug.

981
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Push them down. Yeah, what do you do with the hug? Because a hug is a two person thing usually,

982
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
unless it's bad. Do you return it? Well, I try and

983
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
kind of be like, yeah, we're friends, but it's like...

984
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
That's good of you. Yeah, that's very kind. That's very sweet, Jerrick. I just don't want to give it

985
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
too much of a, oh yeah, we're definitely this close. Don't be the first

986
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
one to break that contact. Yeah, and I like how you leave a little mystery in there.

987
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That's nice. We were at a party earlier today and

988
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I was getting up to leave and go to the hotel and I was sitting at a table

989
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
and some dude came in and took my seat.

990
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I guess Dad was also about to leave and he leaned over

991
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
this gentleman and then caught himself and then saw me standing

992
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
up and said, oh, I was just about to kiss this man on the head

993
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
because I was leaving. And the man, the

994
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
gentleman was a bald gentleman and so I kind of think Dad just wanted

995
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
to kiss a stranger on the... He just saw a very nice looking

996
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
head and was like, oh, don't mind if I...

997
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So it could be much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much

998
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
worse is what I'm saying. So is it possible that there's someone out in the world

999
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
impersonating you? Oh, shit. I've

1000
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
never expected that. Jerrica-like. Or worse,

1001
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
maybe it's you.

1002
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Memento!

1003
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Anyway, you got memento disease. Sorry about that.

1004
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Sorry, glad we can help. It turned out okay for them in the movie. I think I've

1005
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
seen it a long time. I can't remember how it ends. Anyway, does that help?

1006
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Definitely. Cool. Thank you.

1007
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yeah.

1008
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Yes, you.

1009
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I always get so uncomfortable because

1010
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
sometimes I think people are cosplaying as Angus McDonald, but then that could

1011
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
just be your fashion. And if that's the case, like fucking cool. That is my favorite Comic Con game.

1012
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Cosplay or weird fashion choice? Not weird. No, hey, come on. Bold.

1013
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Sorry, bold. Okay. Hello, sirs.

1014
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
That's it.

1015
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
What's your name? Hi, I'm Alexi from Oxnard. Hi. Hello. One more

1016
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
time, sorry. Everybody was talking. Everyone, please. One second.

1017
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
My name's Alexi. It's Russian, but I'm Mexican. I have really weird parents.

1018
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
But you did clarify you're from Oxnard, correct? Yeah. Okay.

1019
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
What is your question? So I think I have a

1020
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
terrific fun on stage experience when it comes to other people, but I have no

1021
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
capabilities of like doing improv or anything alone.

1022
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And I've wanted to be a stand-up comedian all my life. And you guys have done

1023
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
community theater and everything. Sure. I've done none of that. And I want to see if you have any advice

1024
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
for... Okay, wait. Stop. Turn the microphone around.

1025
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
That's good.

1026
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
All right.

1027
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
This is great. What I love about this is the first time you

1028
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
do stand-up comedy, you're going to fail, right? It's why

1029
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I've never done it once. Nice try, God.

1030
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You'll never catch me. Here's what we're going to do. I want you... Oh, shit. Don't

1031
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
do this. No, trap, trap, trap. No, no. Hear me out. Allow me to fail, Griffin.

1032
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Hear me out. Say the first thing that pops in your head and everybody boo

1033
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Alexi. No, don't boo Alexi. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me. This is nothing.

1034
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Trust me. Do it. Say it. Say it. Whatever.

1035
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
How about airplane food? Am I right?

1036
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
God. I don't like it either. All right. All right. Now you got that

1037
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
out of the way. Now say the first thing that comes to mind. Everybody laugh your

1038
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
fucking faces off. I love traffic.

1039
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
That's very good. Just like that. You're on the upswing. Yeah.

1040
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Look at that. Now that you've gotten rid of the yips, I'm going to give you

1041
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
a tight one. Just a one-minute set. Oh, boy. This is not

1042
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
what I prepared for. Alexi, no help is coming. Oh, my God.

1043
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Oh, God. This is going to be a long

1044
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
60 seconds, but I swan to John. I'm not saying a word.

1045
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Okay? So you got to hang in there. Wait, wait, wait.

1046
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Before we start, Alexi, I'm going to offer you a ripcord. Yeah.

1047
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You have the chance. You can put the mic back. Horrible thing. Hell yeah. That's my dude.

1048
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen.

1049
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
How's everyone doing tonight?

1050
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Justin was walking you on. Hold on. Are you trying to hog my spotlight right now?

1051
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I was going to get you on. Hold on one second. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

1052
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Alexi.

1053
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Okay. And go.

1054
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
All right. So everyone's enjoying Comic Con. Pretty good, right? Pretty good.

1055
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I'm a cosplayer myself, and I've done a few things and stuff.

1056
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
The worst experience I've had doing that, though, is I was a little Robin cosplayer.

1057
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I had little tights on and everything. It was fantastic. And then I got diarrhea.

1058
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So

1059
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
for the last half of the con, I shoved toilet paper down the back of my pants.

1060
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And I really just refused to stand

1061
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
up anywhere, but I got tons of kids asking me to take pictures with them.

1062
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Boy, was it hard to look a kid in the face and go,

1063
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
No. I'm not doing that. I really

1064
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
can't, because there's doodle up in this little thing.

1065
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So I try not to cosplay anymore.

1066
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Ten seconds. Bring it home. Unless I got underwear on. And let me tell you, me undies is a

1067
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
great sponsor. Fuck me right now. And they're great. Aren't they

1068
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
fantastic? Okay, Alexi. Ladies and gentlemen,

1069
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Alexi. Alexi.

1070
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Thank you.

1071
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Here's twenty dollars.

1072
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen. Okay, no. We'll just keep the twenty dollars.

1073
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Congratulations. Alexi is now a professional stand up comedian. Thank you.

1074
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Fantastic.

1075
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
That's the most we've ever helped someone ever

1076
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
fix the whole thing. Thanks, Alexi.

1077
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
The whole gesture. You gotta take the fucking money.

1078
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Take a picture with me after the show.

1079
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Okay.

1080
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
No, you don't get to give it to Alexi.

1081
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
He's a good guy. He's a good guy.

1082
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It's his money. He can do what he wants with it.

1083
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Let's go a little bit further back.

1084
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
There's somebody jumping up and down in the aisles. Yep, jumping up and down. Way on the way back.

1085
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Yes. You got it.

1086
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Yeah, it's you.

1087
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
You can stop pointing at your face. I promise, it's you.

1088
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Still me? I promise. Hi. Oh, I'm sorry.

1089
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
We were pointing. Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1090
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
This is awkward. What's your name? Nine, like the number. Hi, Nine.

1091
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
How you doing? I'm good. Cool. What's your question? Is that a members only jacket?

1092
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
What? It's a sweet jacket. I like it. A DuckTales shirt, too. That's choice.

1093
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Okay. Hi. So I've been collecting

1094
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
toys, action figures, and plushies since I was

1095
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
in high school. I have a pretty substantial collection right

1096
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
now. But the thing is that I have a niece now who comes to visit me a lot.

1097
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
She's really little and she always wants to touch everything.

1098
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
But right now, she knows pretty much like, you know, I have like some stuff and I'm like, no,

1099
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
not that stuff. But what I'm worried about is when she grows up, she's going to be like,

1100
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
well, why can't I play with those toys? And I'm going to have to tell her,

1101
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
you know, those are my grown up toys.

1102
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I'm new to this whole taking care of a kid

1103
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
thing. Don't use the phrase grown up toys.

1104
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It will not go out.

1105
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I'm so torn because part of me wants to be like, I mean,

1106
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
there's like fucking movie, the fucking Toy Story 2 mode, just like, toys are supposed to be played with.

1107
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Take them out of the box. But at the same time, like,

1108
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
that's... I guarantee my like Harry Houdini action figure

1109
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
is like, I'm fine. I'm good. Please don't let your baby gum on me.

1110
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
That's a mech I built for two weeks from Neon Genesis Evangelion.

1111
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You don't know how to play with that. You would be bad at playing with that.

1112
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You're not ready to play with that. The thing is that I do,

1113
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I have been buying like more like toys that she can play with because like I do want to

1114
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
like share that kind of stuff. You just put those low. You put the good ones high.

1115
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yeah, let's be real. You bought those to keep her away from the

1116
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
goods. The premium toys.

1117
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Yeah, so I was just wondering how I'm supposed to have

1118
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
that conversation with her. All you have to do is like make a bright

1119
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
light and a child.

1120
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Travis, you're giving some fucking like My Cat From Hell Jackson Galaxy shit.

1121
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Give her shelves that she can play with. But then you have

1122
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
your adult shelves with your adult toys. Just look the

1123
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
kids in the eye and say, that one's made of knives.

1124
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I know it doesn't look like it's made of knives, but there's knives all

1125
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
through it. Actually with a lot of those Evangelion mechs, it's actually probably

1126
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
not too far off. That's true. Knife Dad.

1127
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Knife Dad is a beloved. Please don't reference things I'm not on.

1128
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It's just a knife thing. Travis hates it when we talk about Monster Factory.

1129
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It's just not my IP. Okay, has there been, let me ask you

1130
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
this. Has there been an infraction?

1131
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
You mean like has something gotten like broken or what? Yes. Something almost did

1132
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
and it was really hard to find because I got really nervous. What was it? There's like this little

1133
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
piece that was attached to one of the toys and she was messing with it

1134
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and it came off and I was looking everywhere because I had carpet in my room and I couldn't find it and I was freaking out.

1135
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
But I found it, so it was okay.

1136
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You had me on tenterhooks.

1137
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It was pretty touch and go there for a while. How about you just like

1138
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
don't let her in your house. Maybe it's more of

1139
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
an outside kid, you know?

1140
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I got you some

1141
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
sidewalk chalks. Have fun. There's a bubble

1142
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
mower. Get out of my face. I gotta put together

1143
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
this zord. Is that still a thing people do?

1144
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Yeah, they build zords. You know, it's

1145
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
does that help? Yeah, a little.

1146
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Thank you. Thank you.

1147
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
We're probably going to do like one or two more

1148
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
because it's almost tomorrow. Right there with both of your hands. Stand up and

1149
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I'll tell you if it's you. Yes, it's you. Come on down. No.

1150
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
No, no, no. Grey shirt. Grey shirt.

1151
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
We're pointing at three different fucking people. You. Yes. Grey shirt.

1152
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Come on out. Yes. No. We'll do both. No, you're next.

1153
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
You're next. You're next. You're next. There has to be

1154
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
a better way to do this. Everyone please get a number

1155
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
like at an auction. All right. You're next. You're in the

1156
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
batter's plate.

1157
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
You're on deck. You're in the batter's plate. Hi. Hi.

1158
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
What's your name? Morgan. Hi, Morgan. What's your question?

1159
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So I just graduated from college. Cool. Congratulations.

1160
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It's our show, okay?

1161
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Hey, come on. What was your degree?

1162
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Biology. Nice.

1163
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
So like science. Couldn't have majored in something funny for us.

1164
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Rubber chickens and farts? It was a double major.

1165
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
In rubber chickens and farts. I majored in the water bottle flip.

1166
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Oh, nice. No, so my dad got me these

1167
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
for my graduation gift, these like 12 little wind-up Jesuses.

1168
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And I don't know why.

1169
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And I don't know. Let Morgan finish.

1170
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And he just like sat there with this really triumphant look on his face like it was like

1171
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
some inside joke that we have and it wasn't. So I don't.

1172
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Now I just have one fell out of my bag earlier at a 7-Eleven. It was really awkward.

1173
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
All right. Follow up question. Been holding those G's eye all night?

1174
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Yeah. I brought three for you guys because then I only

1175
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
have nine to deal with. Hell yeah. Are these your fucking horcruxes?

1176
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Oh wait, they do fun stuff. They do backflips.

1177
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Well, after he gave them to me, he stared at me for a minute and then he went

1178
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
they don't walk on water and then he just sat there. Oh, man.

1179
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Mine's broken. Oh, no. I got a bum Jesus.

1180
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Okay. First things

1181
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
first. The sound is awful. Yeah. No.

1182
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Apologies to the woman sitting in front of us. You just gave away a fourth of

1183
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
these and you're a sucker because these are awesome.

1184
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Thank you very much. You're welcome. God, that's a weird pull

1185
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
from your dad though, for real. Can I tell you? Here's my theory.

1186
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
This is what I would do. Okay.

1187
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I can't think of a good gift. I wish I could think of an inside joke gift.

1188
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Oh, you know what would be funny? If I pretend like it's an inside

1189
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
joke but I just have some shit someone else gave me.

1190
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I want to flash forward 15 years to the episode of Antiques Roadshow where they're like

1191
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
if only I had all 12 wind up Jesuses.

1192
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
You have nine? What happened to the other three?

1193
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
If you look on the foot, you can see that these are

1194
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
cast by Jesus himself.

1195
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
He was a carpenter. Do you remember

1196
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Morgan, do you remember the first words out of your

1197
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Come on. I'll put them next to this mic.

1198
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I'm getting it in the monitor and it's hell on earth.

1199
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Do you remember the first words you said to him after he handed you

1200
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
12 Jesuses? Did he maybe read the Bible really

1201
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
fast and think, okay, 12 Jesuses, yeah, I get it. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1202
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Take these toys, they are my tiny selves.

1203
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Actually, the first thing I think I did was put it

1204
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
in my mouth and then I did a Griffin's amiibo. Oh, good.

1205
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
That's pretty good. And I'm sure everyone there

1206
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
was like, oh, I love that franchise. Oh, I get it.

1207
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I definitely get that one. Actually, I think pretty much everyone there is. Oh, you have

1208
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
cool friends. Thank you for the Jesuses and I

1209
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
hope we helped in some degree.

1210
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Alright, this will probably be the last one because it's now Sunday.

1211
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Oh, that's his

1212
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
day.

1213
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Hey, how's it going? Happy Sunday. Hey, thank you. Same to you. First, Justin,

1214
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
were you at Comedy Bang Bang two days ago? No. Saw a guy

1215
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
that looked like you and I was too scared to say anything. That was Dustin. Really glad you

1216
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
didn't say hi. He was kind of a dick, so that

1217
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
sounds like a Dustin thing. Shoot, it might have been me now that I think about it. What is your name?

1218
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
What's your name? Alright. What was that? What's your name? James. James, hi.

1219
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Hi, Amanda. James, why do you have... Hi, Amanda. It does say

1220
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Idaho on your shirt. I am Idaho. My girlfriend and I

1221
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
are cosplaying... As states. No, Lisa and Ralph

1222
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
from The Simpsons. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Now I get it. We were doing Simpsons Trivia

1223
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
earlier and we won. Hey, congrats. And we won best costumes.

1224
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
So, there we go. Alright, my question. Is it Simpsons Trivia?

1225
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Because I'll fucking tank. What's the name of

1226
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
the ice cream shop in Springfield? I have no fucking idea. Is this real? No, it's

1227
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
real. Phineas Cube Butter Fats Old Time Confectionary. I would ask the audience, but I'm afraid

1228
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
the building would explode. So, what's your question?

1229
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Wait, what's the ice cream shop? Phineas Cube Butter Fats

1230
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Old Time Confectionary. Cool.

1231
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That was a question? It means nothing. I'm assuming that's for one of the later seasons.

1232
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's early, it's early. Alright, so for my job

1233
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I have to plan a donor party. Okay. And

1234
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
it just so happened to be planned that it was going to be the day before my birthday. So, I jokingly

1235
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
included a birthday cake in the catering and the budget

1236
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and got it all approved. Oh, no. So, wait, I'm going to stop you

1237
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
right there. You can't jokingly do something

1238
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and then... Yeah, let's strip away the artifice.

1239
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
You bought yourself a company birthday cake and I love it. Okay, I bought myself a birthday

1240
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
cake. I celebrate it, but let's just look this in the face.

1241
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Am I good?

1242
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
In order for me to answer this

1243
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I have to know if you... Don't say your last name

1244
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
from this point forward. I will not.

1245
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Enjoy working at the company that you work with. I love it. Oh, well, shit.

1246
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
This would have been way easier and way funnier if you hadn't.

1247
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Hey, listen. What's your rep at the office?

1248
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Like, are you, like, the bad boy or what's up?

1249
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Lovable rogue. I'm kind of the bad boy. I was the new guy for a long time

1250
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
and then we just hired two new people. You didn't say that like someone who's kind of a bad... I'm kind of a bad guy.

1251
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's also hard to say, I'm kind of a bad boy while cosplaying

1252
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
as Ralphie from The Simpsons.

1253
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
How much was it a fucking

1254
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
cake boss cake or what are we talking about? No, it's like a

1255
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
big box store fucking it's Costco sheet cake.

1256
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Like a Kroger, it's got that Kroger Whippy on there? Yeah, I mean it's...

1257
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
You guys don't have Krogers around here, fucking forget me, sorry. Ralphs.

1258
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Ralphs. Ralphs got good cake or what's up?

1259
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Ralphs is Kroger. I bet a Seinfeld response on that one.

1260
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I think... Did anybody else eat the cake?

1261
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Ralphie hasn't happened yet. Oh shit. Are you planning on sharing the cake or is it

1262
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
just a James cake? So now this is the thing, because I know you guys have very strong

1263
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
opinions on surprising yourself. Yeah, it's impossible?

1264
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Is that what you mean? That's not how brains work?

1265
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
So now I have to act surprised and be really amped and say, guys did you do this

1266
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
for me? Oh wait, wait, wait.

1267
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You did not give me a grift alert. I did not know there was a grift happening.

1268
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
That's a different deal. If you pull that off like, oh my god you guys,

1269
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
that's the fucking best. Now that's so good. This is it.

1270
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
When is this party? Because I swear to god we will hold this episode

1271
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
for a year.

1272
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Oh, misspell your name on the case. So good.

1273
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Then you get them to feel guilty for something they didn't do. Really guys?

1274
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Really guys? Really?

1275
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
The G? Honestly. That's just games.

1276
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It does actually say

1277
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
to the office bad boy. I mean if you weren't the bad boy before

1278
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
you are going to be eating your grift cake.

1279
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I'm so excited for you. This is going to be the most delicious cake anybody's ever eaten.

1280
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,000
So I'm going to spin this into a grift. Thank you. Oh no, you already did. And don't pretend like

1281
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
you didn't this whole time. It was your idea. It was your grift.

1282
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Dude, own it. I just wanted to be validated.

1283
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Well, does that help? Yep. Enjoy the cake. Thank you.

1284
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Enjoy your cake.

1285
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I think that's going to do it. Thank you to the Balboa. It's been completely

1286
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
fucking rad to do shows here two nights in a row.

1287
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Thank you to our dad for

1288
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
doing our intro for us.

1289
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Thank you to John Roderick from John at Long Winters for the use of our

1290
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
theme song. It's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed. That was fucking

1291
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
so cool. Hey, so Monday night we're going to be on

1292
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
at midnight? Yeah.

1293
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So if you all want to like watch that and then like tweet. I think it comes on at 11.30.

1294
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I don't think that's a joke. I think that's real. But please don't tweet like

1295
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
they were so bad they had to cancel the show because it's not very funny. Please. And this is specifically

1296
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
the 2,000 people who already tweeted that.

1297
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's real funny. But anyway, please watch because we'll do our best.

1298
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I don't know. We'll see. Thank you all so much for

1299
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
coming. Yeah, and for sticking around so late. How about that final? Oh, I also want to

1300
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
say I'm real sorry that we sold out of posters. We thought

1301
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
we had more than enough. Yeah, we fucked up. We never know how many to do. You all are just too kind and generous and

1302
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
you bought too much stuff. We'll do better next time. We'll do better next time. Here's a

1303
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
final yahoo sent in by Seth Carlson. Thank you, Seth.

1304
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Seth sits in some bangers. Fuck.

1305
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Yeah, say it. Well, no, it sucks now. Say it.

1306
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
It's from Shrek.

1307
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Because it was funny before, but now that I know it's Shrek, it's probably... Anyway.

1308
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
If Spider-Man shoots webs from his hand

1309
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
and Batman shoots bats from his hand, what does the Hulk shoot from his hand?

1310
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

1311
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
My name is Travis. I'm Griffin McElroy.

1312
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
This has been my brother, my brother, and me. Kiss your dad.

1313
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Square on the left. Peace. Bye.

1314
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Thank you.

1315
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Hey girls, do you wanna just say hey I wanna?

1316
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Hey guys, this is Adam Conover.

1317
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
You may know me from my true TV show, Adam Ruins Everything. Well, guess what?

1318
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Now we're doing a podcast version right here on Maximum Fun. What we do is we

1319
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
take all the interesting, fascinating experts that we talked to for just a couple minutes on the show

1320
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and we sit with them for an entire podcast, really going deep and getting into the

1321
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
fascinating details of their work. Find Adam Ruins Everything wherever you get

1322
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
