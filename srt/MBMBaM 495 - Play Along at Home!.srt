1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,480
Travis McElroy, this is Justin Griffin. Sorry to rush, boys,

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,240
but we don't have time to, excuse my language, fart around.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,800
We need to get down to business. It's not going to happen,

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:05,120
Travis. We are a month a month into 2020, and I don't know that there's any more laughter or love

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,840
happening out there than normal. I think maybe even marginally less.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,200
This is a weird vibe to put down. I know you've been out the game for a little bit.

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,320
I know you've been doing the baby stuff. Not a lot of sleep, I'd guess.

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,080
Not a lot of sleep, but Justin and I like to take it fucking slow, baby.

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,720
Yeah, it's a building game. You can't checkmate on day 27th.

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,800
You can't checkmate on the 27th move of the chess game.

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,600
No one's ever done it. And I'm pretty sure, Justin,

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
just and I know that you've actually learned about chess and I haven't,

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,880
but if you checkmate on any move, I think it's just the last move of the game.

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah, they usually stop there. There's not a bonus round for more points.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
It's not like checkmate. Now let's see where this goes.

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,760
I filled my life accidentally. My life was filled with laughter

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,840
and love this week, and I'd like to highlight it.

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,400
Sydney and I were on a road trip, our first road trip away from the children this week.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,840
Was it intentional or accidental? Like, Kevin! Kevin! No, it was a regular,

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,920
non-humiliated situation. We stopped at a gas station in the middle of Zilcho, Ohio.

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,960
Just nowhere as well, Ohio. And we went in the gas station and we got some snacks,

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,720
and the lady at the counter said, these are buy one, get one free.

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,760
And that made us have to get a lot more snacks than we wanted,

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
but they were buy one, get one free, so we're not going to leave some freebies behind.

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,080
And the fella in coveralls behind us announces,

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,360
if Bernie Sanders wins, those will all be free. I said, huh?

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
That's an interesting energy was delivered to that statement.

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
He said, if Bernie Sanders wins, those will all be free.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,760
Was he saying it in like a, won't that be totally fucking rad, I love free snacks kind of way?

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,800
Sydney said, actually that sounds, without missing a beat, actually that sounds pretty good

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,480
because of all the free snacks. And he said, it's not, it's scary.

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,600
Okay, listen, this is not an endorsement one way or the other,

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,920
but I'm pretty sure any candidate saying like, and hey, free snacks.

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640
And hey, who here likes combos?

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
Right? No one's going to be like, I don't like your free snack policies.

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,880
If Bernie Sanders wins, all those snacks are free. Like that, yeah.

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,480
Okay. That, sir, I can tell by your whole steez, you don't think that sounds chill,

42
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,200
but if you break down the words, I don't think you could put accents on any of them

43
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
in a way that makes it not sound extremely good and chill.

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,960
Right. These colors don't run unless those Pringles are free 99,

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,120
in which case I'm fucking out of here, man. No way.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
Yeah. So that was, that was filled my life with laughter that day.

47
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,560
I just want to let you guys know.

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
So I went to the mall and started handing out little paper bags of potpourri

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
that I had made, dried out my own sort of apple slices,

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
dried those the fuck out and I put some thyme and-

51
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,320
That sounds gross.

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,760
It's just apple and thyme.

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,720
Listen, Griffin, I'm glad you filled your life with love.

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
No, it's gross.

55
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,400
You know, I have a recipe if you start with grapes and thyme.

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
Do you know what you get when you mix grapes and thyme?

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,880
What?

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,920
Raisins.

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
That's filled my life with laughter and love. Thank you, Justin.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,760
You can't hear it, but I'm laughing really fucking hard at that.

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,720
Boys, step aside, okay?

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
I have an idea that's going to turn this whole year around.

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,240
I feel like I have felt like you've had an idea, Trav,

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,360
and that's why you've sort of been handling this intro the way you have.

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,240
Listen, I'm kind of the idea man around here and everyone knows that

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
and everyone agrees I'm super good at it.

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,760
I think that you've got a fucking huge load of my bim bam goofs.

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,360
I've got all my energy is backed up.

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,640
You've been saving up and you need to just sort of clean the barrel a little bit.

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,800
Yeah, I need to discharge some of my goof juice.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
Right, get it, get it.

72
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,480
Justin and I are going to go leave and you do your dirty thing

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,920
and then we'll come back when you're done.

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,360
This is my pitch.

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
The 20 funny challenge.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,560
Everybody loves those viral challenges.

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,560
The ice bucket challenge, the other ones, the bottle flip challenge.

78
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,320
Planking, that one where you eat a spoonful of cinnamon.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,200
Laying down in the middle of the road to prove to your coach that you made business.

80
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,040
Yes, all of these.

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,640
Eat a whole basketball.

82
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,080
Yes, I have two ideas.

83
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,920
One I think definitely has legs, but one has potential.

84
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,760
I'm going to start with that one and it's this.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,840
Do you want to say, do you want to say, do you want to get ahead of this?

86
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,480
Do you want to stand right ahead of this and lay down on the road

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,760
like I did for my coach and say anything you're about to say, Travis,

88
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,440
people are actually going to do and send you a trillion pictures of on Tweeto.

89
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, part one is you say, you know, hi, it's, and then you say your name,

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,120
and I'm doing the 20 funny challenge.

91
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
Fill your life with laughter and love.

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
And then part three is you nominate the next person to do the challenge.

93
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Right there in the middle, part two, you film yourself

94
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,560
watching the entirety of the movie Garfield starring Bill Murray.

95
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
That could be good.

96
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
Can it be also Tale of Two Kitties or just the first one?

97
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
Huh, that's a good, yeah, I think if you're really committed

98
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,880
to 20 funny, fill your life with laughter and love, you do that, sure.

99
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,600
So is it a video of them watching the movie?

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
Yes, it's on their face the whole time.

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,240
Okay, on YouTube for people to find, is that the idea?

102
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
Well, I don't want there to be any kind of legal issues

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,480
with the 20 funny challenge, so we can't show the movie.

104
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,600
So the movie edit must be muted.

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:57,840
Yes.

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
Or else we're gonna get copyrights, right?

107
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,760
So you need to watch Garfield muted.

108
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,160
With your ear pods in or whatever.

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
So this one, I think this one's got legs.

110
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,360
I think it's got legs, but this one could be the next big viral thing.

111
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,600
And it goes a little something like this.

112
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,720
You say your name, say, hey, it would go like this.

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,840
Okay, I can see from your guys' faces you're not getting the name part.

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,040
I'll say it like it's me.

115
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm doing the 20 funny challenge.

116
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,880
Fill your life with laughter and love.

117
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,600
And then you tell a bad joke, a dad joke.

118
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,200
Mine, for example, would be a skeleton walks into a bar

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,800
and orders a drink and a mop.

120
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,800
And then you say something nice about the person

121
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
you're nominating to do it next.

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Like I would say, and I'm nominating my brother Justin.

123
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,160
He's always been there for me, and he's never let me down.

124
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
And I love him.

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
No, that's the fucking joke.

126
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,440
Okay, now Griffin, next.

127
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,240
Did you hear what I said?

128
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,600
Did you hear what I said?

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,920
But that's a little laughter, but it's not any, there's no laughter.

130
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,520
You took a big diarrhea dump on my homemade potpourri,

131
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
so now I'm doing mine on yours.

132
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,480
Hey, okay, you know what?

133
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm nominating my older brother Justin.

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,400
He's always been there for me and my little brother Griffin.

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,800
Everyone agrees he makes the best homemade potpourri in town.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
What's the hashtag, baby?

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,320
Hashtag 20 funny challenge, and it's two zero F-U-N-N-Y challenge.

138
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
How about just we drop the challenge?

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,880
That's so many words.

140
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,720
Just hashtag 20 funny.

141
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,240
Hashtag 20 funny, this is good.

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
All right, I think that's gonna get it out there.

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I mean, I could just nominate you guys.

144
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,680
You could say something nice about me.

145
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,840
But I'm not gonna nominate you.

146
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,600
That doesn't make any sense.

147
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,520
Hey, everybody, this is Griffin McElroy.

148
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,880
This is the 20 funny challenge.

149
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
Watch how high I can kick.

150
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
I wanna renominate Travis McElroy.

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
He said some dope shit about my potpourri.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Didn't do a joke.

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,640
Well, I figured that some people don't like doing jokes.

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,080
Like my joke, my comedy-

155
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
You can't change the challenge, Griffin.

156
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
Well, but my comedy is more observational than that.

157
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,200
The ice bucket challenge wasn't like dump a bucket of ice in your head

158
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,040
or get a nice cold drink out of it.

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Well, I know, but my thing's a little bit more observational humor,

160
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,560
more narrative, confessional.

161
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,840
Pratt fall.

162
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
No, it wasn't a pratt fall.

163
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
I just did a really high kick and then I nominated Travis.

164
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,640
And maybe, and he pooped his pants when he kicked too high.

165
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah, I could rip a beaver or add in a beaver sound effect in there.

166
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,680
So I think it can be like a do a joke or some sort of like, you know, light stunt.

167
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,480
Like I don't wanna see people jumping from rooftop to rooftop.

168
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,760
I'm talking about like, how high up can you jump?

169
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,600
Maybe you can touch the ceiling with your fingertips.

170
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,320
That's cool.

171
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
Hey, this is Justin McElroy doing the 20 funny

172
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,280
fill your life with laughter and love challenge.

173
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,960
It's 20 funny challenge, fill your life with laughter and love.

174
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,520
20 funny challenge, fill your life with laughter and love.

175
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,720
Horse walks into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?

176
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm nominating Amy Adams because she brings a lot of sparkle to every movie she's in.

177
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,280
Well, Amy's listening.

178
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,720
So, you know, she's on board.

179
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
Amy, I so appreciate you listening.

180
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,840
Thank you so much.

181
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,360
We're gonna begin our advice show now.

182
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Travis was on paternity leave.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,520
So I got to pick the questions.

184
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,160
So I picked extremely long questions.

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
That's right.

186
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,840
We're going on some journeys and I want y'all to come with me.

187
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,440
The irony here folks, just if I may, is as the regular question corraler,

188
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,800
Justin's the one who's always like, oh, this is a long one.

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,880
But apparently when Justin's in charge, the mice will play.

190
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,440
You know what I mean?

191
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah, the mice are playing.

192
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,160
So I don't want you to feel like I need to charge through the whole question.

193
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,360
If we need to take some diversions throughout, these questions can sustain.

194
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,080
They're powerful, powerful questions.

195
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
I work at a deli.

196
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
Okay, let's stop there.

197
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
So a deli, what is that?

198
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,480
I work at a deli and recently a woman came in for coleslaw after we had run out.

199
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,840
She told me that her favorite part of the coleslaw was the liquid anyway.

200
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,040
And asked if I could put the remaining liquid into a container for her.

201
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
That's risk, baby.

202
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Oh boy, challenging, challenging stuff.

203
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,440
It's already extremely challenging.

204
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,960
Hey everybody, this is Griffin McRoy.

205
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm doing the fill your life with laughter and love challenge.

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
20 funny challenge, fill your life with laughter and love.

207
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,800
I did a whole thing, did a whole shooter coleslaw juice.

208
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,840
I nominate President Barack Obama.

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
So anyway, we're gonna throw it out anyway.

210
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,960
Anyway, so I didn't put a price sticker on it.

211
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,960
And I told her to come back for one if the cashier gave her a hard time.

212
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,720
I wish they had because I would love to be like, okay, let me now affix value to coleslaw juice.

213
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Let me affix monetary value to this coleslaw juice.

214
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,000
Apparently, she was able to walk out with no problem because she came back a week later

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
and asked for more coleslaw juice.

216
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
Oh my God.

217
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,020
Oh my God.

218
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,520
This is how great products get started.

219
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,760
You know, like this is how top of the muffin to you got moving.

220
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,240
It's just the part that people like, which is apparently the juice.

221
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,280
Well, here's what I'll say.

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,800
I've never enjoyed the solid matter in the coleslaw particularly much.

223
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,280
So maybe the juice is the least bad part of the coleslaw.

224
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,360
This time we were not out of coleslaw, but there was only a little bit of cabbage left.

225
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,000
I refused to give it to her for free because it was actual coleslaw.

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
And she became upset.

227
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,440
She told me it was barely any cabbage.

228
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,560
Wait, consider it was really any cabbage.

229
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,360
It said she was going to pick the cabbage out anyway.

230
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
She should not pay for it.

231
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,400
So I do want to highlight that this person came in the week before as a coleslaw fan.

232
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,200
And then they fucking mainline coleslaw juice and realize like,

233
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,280
I've been wasting my time with all the chewing, chewing, chewing.

234
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,720
I need to just get the juice and do the thing I crave.

235
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,840
You should be paying me to pick all this lettuce out.

236
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,720
Listen, I'll come and I'll take your juice away.

237
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,280
You won't need to worry about where your juice goes.

238
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,160
Thanks to me and my juice removal service.

239
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,880
So there was an argument I got into with a customer at Jimmy John's,

240
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,440
cause we used to sell day old bread and you could get it for like a dollar.

241
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
And somebody came in and wanted to buy a thing of day old bread,

242
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,760
but we had sold all the day old bread.

243
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,400
So they wanted to just buy regular bread for a dollar

244
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
since we were out of day old.

245
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,880
And I had to explain to them that that is not how it works.

246
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
And they said, well, how old is that bread?

247
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,600
And I think they were trying to negotiate a price based on that bread's relative age.

248
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,120
Yeah, that's not quite as wild as free coleslaw juice,

249
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
but it is certainly, we'll put it up on the leaderboard.

250
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,640
At that point, is it still coleslaw?

251
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,120
Like I don't-

252
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,520
So here's, okay, wait, don't get ahead of me.

253
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,080
I told her no, but the ensuing argument made me think,

254
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,160
should I have charged her the first time?

255
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,400
Yes.

256
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,480
Should I have just given it to her the second?

257
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,880
No.

258
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,960
Surely if there was only one piece of cabbage in the liquid, that isn't coleslaw.

259
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,520
Incorrect.

260
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,280
But where is the line?

261
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,880
What is the exact ratio of liquid to cabbage?

262
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,760
At which point the mixture stops being slaw and isn't worth money?

263
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Also, I do not know what this woman was doing with the juice,

264
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
but she said she liked it so much, quote,

265
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,000
she could just drink it.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
And that's from Teresa.

267
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
Then Teresa, if I may, it sounds like you know exactly what she's doing with it.

268
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,960
I know what she's doing with it.

269
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,920
Here's the thing.

270
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,000
They say there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,080
What they don't say is what lunch is to everybody.

272
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,320
Okay.

273
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,760
One man's coleslaw, Levins, is another woman's lunch,

274
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,600
and you've given her a free sort of slaw broth lunch.

275
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,920
I don't want to get too scientifical here, but I'm going to tell you guys the issue here,

276
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,640
and that is that we are looking at it backwards,

277
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:23,280
because it is not the addition of cabbage to juice that makes it coleslaw.

278
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:30,160
It is rather that we must look at it and say that the removal of the cabbage from the juice

279
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,120
does not make it no longer coleslaw.

280
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
Let me explain.

281
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,760
You have a bowl of juice.

282
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,840
You put one sliver of cabbage in.

283
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,040
That is not coleslaw.

284
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,080
What have you done?

285
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,720
But you start with a bowl full of cabbage, right?

286
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,160
And then slowly take some away until all of the cabbage is removed.

287
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,960
It continues to be coleslaw until it is zero cabbage.

288
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,040
I would say it is still coleslaw.

289
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,080
What is that juice?

290
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,680
I don't even know what the coleslaw is.

291
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,760
Coleslaw is, you know, the cap.

292
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,680
You got to have the cabbage in there, and then you're going to have mayonnaise,

293
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
but mayonnaise ain't juice.

294
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,480
Nobody's ever looked at mayonnaise and been like,

295
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,280
I'll have some of that fatty creamy white juice, please.

296
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,400
That's not a juice.

297
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,240
I guess maybe there's probably a little bit of vinegar in there,

298
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,400
but that's not what the juice is.

299
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,440
I think it's just water.

300
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,600
What's happening in there?

301
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,320
Where's the water coming?

302
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,240
Nobody's dumping a full fucking Aquafina bottle of water

303
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,200
into some cabbage and mayonnaise and saying, now that's slaw.

304
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
There's a vinegar element to this.

305
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,520
Well, so I think what you're getting in the juice is vinegar

306
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,120
and a little pot of mayonnaise and then like broke down,

307
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
like molecules of cabbage.

308
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
It's the molecules.

309
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,640
That's what I'm thinking is the molecules.

310
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,880
Cabbage is a very watery vegetable.

311
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,280
Right.

312
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,160
The breakdown of that I think is creating the water.

313
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,040
God, coleslaw sucks so bad.

314
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
It's the worst fucking food.

315
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,560
It's like homeopathy.

316
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,440
You're just getting like molecules of lettuce

317
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
and it's supposed to help you.

318
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,520
Hey, can I just say, Teresa,

319
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,440
I'm not, I don't know what else you do at your job.

320
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200
So maybe everything else is so excellent.

321
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
That's great.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,360
But you do work at a business.

323
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,840
So next time, if you're wondering if you should charge something,

324
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,120
like charge for something that you're giving to a customer,

325
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,080
the answer is yes.

326
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,040
Yes, they came in, they wanted a product.

327
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,640
You are giving them that product.

328
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,400
They're happy with that product.

329
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,840
You should charge for that.

330
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,640
All right, Travis, my brother's on the side of big deli,

331
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,840
but I'm a team coleslaw pervert here.

332
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,120
If people come in with these terrible needs,

333
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
these terrible desires,

334
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
the least you could do is support your fellow man

335
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,600
and hook them up with as much coleslaw juice as you can.

336
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
No, but that's the part they wanted.

337
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,240
They just wanted the juice.

338
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,560
Justin and I are over here throwing a fucking park bench

339
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,080
through the window of that deli.

340
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
We're gonna fucking smash capitalism and chug

341
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
the coleslaw juice, baby.

342
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,000
If you give away the juice for the next person

343
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,680
is gonna have less coleslaw.

344
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,760
And I think that's ideal for everybody.

345
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,200
Well, there's less coleslaw for them to get.

346
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,760
That's it.

347
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
If this person comes in again, you say,

348
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,120
go find a friend who just likes the cabbage part.

349
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,480
And then I will separate the two into two containers

350
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,880
and I will only charge you for one container.

351
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,920
But I'm not giving you half.

352
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,720
Codify it is what you're saying.

353
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
And then every other non-pervert that comes in

354
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,640
will have to stand there as you look at them

355
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
straight in their human eyes and say,

356
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,200
and how much juice would you like with that slaw?

357
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
Right, yes.

358
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
We juice it to order.

359
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
Yes, this is bespoke juicing.

360
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,600
Uh, that's good.

361
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
It's not, it's still coleslaw at the end of the day.

362
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
But do you guys want a yahoo?

363
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,280
I like a nice dry slaw.

364
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,520
Uh, yes.

365
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,360
And I like it 25 feet away from me as the crow flies.

366
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,560
A bunch of people sent this one in.

367
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:10,960
Thank you.

368
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,880
It's from yahoo answers user hockeypnc1 who asks,

369
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
why does the restaurant give me such a small cup

370
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,240
when I ask for a water cup?

371
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
Don't they trust me?

372
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
There's probably some sort of, you know,

373
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,040
big capitalist energy answer for this question

374
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,360
of just like, they don't want you to drink the water.

375
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,920
They want you to drink the Coca-Cola.

376
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,040
And so they want you to run out of water,

377
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,960
see, you know, Joe six packs Coca-Cola over there

378
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
and say like, well, I'm done with the clear beverage.

379
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,320
I would like the brown beverage now.

380
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
You took this a different way than I did,

381
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,520
which I assume this was like a fountain drink scenario

382
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
where I've said, I need a cup and they handed me

383
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,000
like a tiny child's cup to get a tiny bit of water out of,

384
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,920
can I just say the same nozzle the high sea comes out of?

385
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,800
Come on, where's my separate water nozzle?

386
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,880
I don't want a little bit of high sea in there.

387
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,360
That is for sure not a hundred percent water.

388
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,760
You're gonna get some high sea on that.

389
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,120
But they probably do not trust you.

390
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,560
Well, yeah, why would you?

391
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,280
They've probably been hurt a lot before.

392
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
I know, I don't think this is going on as much anymore,

393
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,360
but there was the very terrible like YouTube prank going on,

394
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,040
sort of the opposite of the fill your life

395
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,400
with laughter and love challenge.

396
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
There's the 20 funny challenge.

397
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,800
Where people were ordering cups of water at drive-throughs

398
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,520
and then eating it like directly right back into the-

399
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,160
Yeah, baby, fucking-

400
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,720
Yeah, rip it.

401
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,920
That one, rip that one.

402
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,480
Rip it.

403
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,440
Loving it.

404
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
Holy shit.

405
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,280
Yeah, baby.

406
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,080
Oh my God, that's a crisp one, bud.

407
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
Oh, that was, did you open two at once?

408
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
What was that?

409
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
Double fist it.

410
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
Fucking yes, baby.

411
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,800
Coke Zero, more like Coke Hero.

412
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,480
This one's actually a strawberry guava diet Coke.

413
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,120
Shit, that's so gnarly.

414
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,440
Okay, so that's not good.

415
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,640
It was bad that they did that.

416
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,680
So maybe that sort of meant that just mankind could not be

417
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,000
trusted with water going through a drive-through.

418
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,480
I do this to my kids.

419
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,640
You don't trust your kids?

420
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,320
I don't trust my kids with a larger cup

421
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,640
than I care to clean up with a paper towel.

422
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,040
Yes.

423
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,280
I have to envision everything I hand to my child upended on the floor.

424
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,720
And so I don't give them any, it's my fault at that point.

425
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
If I have to clean up something larger

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
than a very small cup of water, that's on me.

427
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,040
This is how I feel every time my daughter

428
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,040
sees me drinking something in an adult sized cup

429
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
and says, I would like a drink of that.

430
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,880
And then I try to help her and she says no.

431
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
And I think, well, there's the rest of my day gone.

432
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,240
That's my day.

433
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I think that all the cups should be smaller.

434
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,600
I think if you go to an Applebee's

435
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
and they give you a smaller water cup,

436
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,840
this is not a thing that happens at any chain restaurant.

437
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
This is only fast food, yes?

438
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,240
Yeah.

439
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,520
Okay.

440
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
Well, because at the chain restaurant,

441
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,680
they don't want to have to keep sending someone over there

442
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,080
as you're taking shots of H2O.

443
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,840
That's a good point, Travis.

444
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,320
Okay, well, when I'm at the fast food restaurant,

445
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm just saying, have you seen the size

446
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,520
of some of these sodas?

447
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,200
They're pretty big.

448
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,320
Can I also throw this out?

449
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,040
Here we go.

450
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,920
Are you kidding me?

451
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
I gotta hear more about these big sodas.

452
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,520
Okay, Griffin, go on in the background

453
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,040
while I make my point.

454
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,760
My car started to drag its front end

455
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,840
and flipped upside down.

456
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
And I have to drive and work upside down.

457
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,880
I think that not only should all cups be smaller,

458
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,160
I agree with you, Griffin.

459
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,560
I think also, taking a note from the water cooler design,

460
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,160
all cups should be conical

461
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,560
so that we cannot set them down.

462
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,480
You either finish it while you're holding it

463
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,600
or you throw it away.

464
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,840
That is brutalist office design.

465
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,960
I've never thought of that.

466
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,040
Are they conical so you can't set them down?

467
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,520
There's no other reason, Justin.

468
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
It's a literal spike.

469
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,400
It's an actual spike.

470
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,120
That's what Hellraiser drinks out of.

471
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,040
I just assumed they were cheaper to produce,

472
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,320
but there is something about like,

473
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
I don't want fucking cups everywhere.

474
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,720
Here you go.

475
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,080
Now you have to throw them away.

476
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,320
You gotta finish it and throw it away.

477
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,920
Or turn it into a fun bird beak.

478
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,560
Or a tiny dunce cap.

479
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,200
Fun hat.

480
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,440
A little crown of a bad kingdom.

481
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,240
That's pretty good.

482
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm just saying some of these cups are so big

483
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,520
I fell in one and drowned once.

484
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,440
I am a law school student living in a pretty okay apartment

485
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
and I've been in this apartment since I started law school

486
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,800
about a year and a half ago.

487
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,120
My landlord has been pretty okay up until now,

488
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,880
but he just did something that has blown my mind.

489
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,440
I asked him to fix my sink

490
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,000
because it was leaking from the bottom.

491
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,280
And he said he'd do it during a time when I'd be in class.

492
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,680
Past experience told me this is fine, so I'll let it happen.

493
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,880
I come back to my apartment and the sink is sitting on top

494
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,280
of a folded pizza box.

495
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,200
Of a folded pizza box.

496
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,840
Wait, what?

497
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,560
It's the-

498
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,880
Of a folded pizza box.

499
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,920
How could that be true?

500
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
It's fixed, but brothers, I have no idea

501
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,800
where this pizza box came from.

502
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,360
Wait.

503
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,320
Did he bring it with him?

504
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
I haven't eaten pizza in two months.

505
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,320
What do I make of this?

506
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,680
That's from Cassie in Albany.

507
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,200
Did he fix the sink by putting a pizza box under it?

508
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
What it sounds like to me is he fixed the sink.

509
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,400
To catch the drippings?

510
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm trying to work through,

511
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,280
here's what I think might be happening here.

512
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,040
Is that the folded pizza box is sort of like

513
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,800
underneath the basin and it's sort of like pushing it up.

514
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,720
This is not how it, this is not what this question means.

515
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,760
That can't possibly, that can't be it.

516
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,760
It's just, I don't know how you, it's leaking.

517
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,400
Uh-huh.

518
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,520
Right, so just squish a pizza box under there.

519
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,360
That's how a kindergartner would fix it.

520
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
Yeah, this is, Cassie, if I may,

521
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,360
there's two words in here that do not go

522
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,880
with the rest of the question.

523
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,120
You can't say it's sitting on top of a pizza box

524
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,640
and it's fixed, it's fixed.

525
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,720
I think it's two separate ideas.

526
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay.

527
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,320
I think the landlord ordered a hot and ready

528
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,560
and treated themselves to it as they did the dirty sink work.

529
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,320
And they were embarrassed that they ate a pizza

530
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,800
in your house, so rather than put it in your trash can,

531
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,040
they folded it up and jammed it under your sink,

532
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,960
and in doing so, somehow fixed the leak.

533
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,080
They didn't fix it, you're going at this with like

534
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,960
wild LucasArts adventure game logic.

535
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,600
Nobody's ever used pizza box on sink.

536
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
But Griffin, okay, I come back to my apartment

537
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,440
and the sink is sitting on top of a folded pizza box.

538
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,680
There's no room for daylight there.

539
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,720
The sink is somehow sitting atop a folded pizza box.

540
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,480
And then let me see next two words, it's fixed.

541
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
There's just the reason I put it,

542
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,840
there's one still image in the world

543
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,240
that maybe Cassie captured, maybe they didn't,

544
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,280
that makes this all go away.

545
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,000
There's just one picture that would congeal

546
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,200
the entire situation of my mind, and I cannot conceive of it.

547
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,560
The sink was too low.

548
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,120
So it was leaking.

549
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,400
So it leaked, sinks are very, very particular.

550
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,360
How about another question?

551
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,680
Well, I have a new segment I would like to try.

552
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,520
Oh wow, okay.

553
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,320
I was away for some time, and this is, listen,

554
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,760
this one's a little more straightforward,

555
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,360
there's not a big goof here,

556
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,160
but I wanted something everyone could participate in.

557
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,640
So I called this segment, Play Along at Home.

558
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,520
Oh, hello, didn't see it come in there.

559
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,760
I'm about to ask my brothers, Justin and Griffin,

560
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,800
some questions, why don't you play along at home?

561
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,760
Are you guys ready?

562
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,160
You need us for this too?

563
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,240
I thought the listeners were taking our role.

564
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,880
No, you're here, no, you guys are gonna try to answer.

565
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,800
I was gonna follow their lead.

566
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,400
No, they play along at home.

567
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,560
They don't play first at home, they play at home.

568
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,200
Is this like a sparring in fifth grader,

569
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,640
like you're gonna embarrass us?

570
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,360
No, no, no, no.

571
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,000
These are just some very straightforward questions,

572
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,840
and it sounds like they're not from the way I said that,

573
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,880
but they are very straightforward.

574
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,800
Can I ask one last question?

575
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
Are you getting these questions

576
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,680
from some sort of disreputable website?

577
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,960
No, I made these questions up.

578
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,280
This is a straightforward, legitimate quiz.

579
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,760
In the song, It Wasn't Me,

580
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,240
how many times is the phrase, it wasn't me, spoken?

581
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,720
Huh, probably an even number, I would guess.

582
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,480
That makes sense.

583
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
I'm gonna say 32 times.

584
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,120
Justin.

585
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,640
Wow, I'm actually gonna say 18 times.

586
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,200
Ooh, Justin's the closest, it's 15 times.

587
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,680
Oh, it's not.

588
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,880
It wasn't an even time, because once, in one line,

589
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,080
the non-Shaggy singer says,

590
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,320
how is she supposed to believe it wasn't me?

591
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,280
Oh, and at one point, Shaggy does say, it was not me.

592
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,560
It was not me.

593
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,880
If you check the records, of the United States,

594
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,400
how many state names have more vowels than consonants?

595
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,940
Five.

596
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:35,920
Justin.

597
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm gonna say eight.

598
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:38,960
10.

599
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,600
Team.

600
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,480
Eight, eight.

601
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,040
10.

602
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,240
Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa,

603
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
Louisiana, Maine, and Ohio.

604
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Cool, I'm comedy rule of threes.

605
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
Come on, third one's gonna be super fun.

606
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,320
How many times, altogether,

607
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,320
did I see the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise in theaters?

608
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,760
14.

609
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,760
12.

610
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
Justin, you are correct.

611
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,880
I saw the first one, Curse of the Black Pearl,

612
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
nine times in theaters.

613
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,280
I saw two, three, and four once in theaters,

614
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,520
and saw the fifth one on a plane.

615
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,240
I hope my prize is a joke from you.

616
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
Okay, one more, one more question.

617
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,880
If you were to stand Travis's end to end,

618
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
how many Travis's would you need to be taller

619
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
than the Empire State Building?

620
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,400
I feel like we're on a fucking car trip right now,

621
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,040
and I just like picked up-

622
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,080
How many Travis's?

623
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,400
If you stood Travis's end to end,

624
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,080
how many Travis's would you need-

625
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,480
It's like I'm reading a highlights zine made by Travis.

626
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
To be taller than the Empire State-

627
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,200
I also had a question here about Shakespeare shows,

628
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
but I edited that one for time.

629
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,200
For time.

630
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,040
I might throw it in if we have a tie.

631
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,040
I would say 220 Travis's.

632
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,000
Okay, Griffin?

633
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm gonna say 221 Travis's.

634
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Oh, it's 250 Travis's.

635
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,400
Griffin is correct.

636
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,880
Eat my ass, Justin, booyah.

637
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,400
You fell in my trap.

638
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,520
Thank you, no thank you.

639
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,120
I think in this circumstance, yeah,

640
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
three out of four Justin was closest.

641
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
Congratulations, Justin.

642
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,600
You won the first of I'm sure many play along at home.

643
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,360
Okay, well, that was funny.

644
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
And now the money's out.

645
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
Let's not go to the money zone.

646
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,400
I think we need to debrief.

647
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,760
And I'll cut the, don't worry, Trav.

648
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
I'll cut the debrief out of the show starting right here.

649
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,440
That clap was for me to see when to start cutting it.

650
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,200
Well, Griffin, let me explain to you.

651
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,000
It's fun because-

652
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,640
Yeah, do it, man.

653
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Just explain your whole concept for it

654
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,800
because we're not in the show anymore, definitely.

655
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,400
So often the things we do on the show are just for us

656
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,160
and we have a good time doing them,

657
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,760
but are the people at home enjoying it?

658
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
I thought, and so I thought this time

659
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,440
they could play along at home.

660
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,760
Right.

661
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
So you created, hold on, sorry.

662
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,600
I just need to clarify something.

663
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,280
Your intent with this was a way to help listeners

664
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,880
pass the time while they listened to our show.

665
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
We were opening the door and saying,

666
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,160
hey, come on inside and play along at home.

667
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,440
Just to give them a break from the comedy,

668
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,120
you wanted to give them like a coloring mat at Applebee's.

669
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,360
When you watch kids TV, right?

670
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,520
Every so often the people on the show

671
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,600
will stop what they're doing and turn towards the audience

672
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,360
and be like, which one's the square?

673
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,680
I thought it would be nice if we included a moment like that

674
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,560
where someone would be like,

675
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,280
I helped the brothers figure out how many times

676
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,800
Travis saw Pirates of the Caribbean franchise in theaters.

677
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,760
We should be giving the listeners some sort of puzzle.

678
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,560
That's a good point because not all of them like it.

679
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,960
And also we keep getting calls from the police like,

680
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,280
we got another dead body here.

681
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,880
They laughed too much at the show, too constantly

682
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,360
that they forgot to fucking breathe again.

683
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
So if you could start adding in a segment

684
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,800
that would be guaranteed a time for people-

685
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,560
By design, I would say.

686
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,640
Guaranteed a time to do some deep contemplative breathing.

687
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,960
Yeah, well, here's the thing Griffin,

688
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,440
we're not supposed to fill our lives with laughter or love.

689
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,160
So here's the love part of the show.

690
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,880
The love part is that Travis has provided,

691
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
the love part is that Travis has provided

692
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,160
a sort of chill out tip right in the middle of our podcast.

693
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,480
It's not all about goof, if it's all goofs-

694
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,640
It is, it's a fucking comedy show.

695
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,400
But it can't all be peaks, Griffin.

696
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,600
There's gotta be fucking valleys.

697
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,480
Oh, sorry.

698
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
So you admit it's a valley.

699
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,800
No, but it's a restful time

700
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,480
where everyone can play along at home.

701
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,520
It's a chill restful valley, like a little hammock.

702
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,360
So they can play along at home.

703
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,320
Hanging between two listenable podcast trees.

704
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,800
Yes, it's a chance to play along at home.

705
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,240
But when people laugh at our baller jokes,

706
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,320
that is a way of playing along at home, Travis.

707
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,520
No, no.

708
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Where's the chance for them to yell at the screen

709
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,360
like in Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune, right?

710
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,440
They're laughing along with us

711
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,520
and while we're like, everybody loves Raymond.

712
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,960
That's great, everybody loves that.

713
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,080
Everybody loves Raymond.

714
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
But then where's the point for them

715
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,520
to feel superior to you guys?

716
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,160
Right, like the RPG element, right, yeah.

717
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,200
Thank you for bringing interactivity to the program, Travis.

718
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,840
You're welcome.

719
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,040
It's a grand slam.

720
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,320
And with that, we will squire everyone away

721
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,360
to the Money Zone.

722
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:53,680
We got a new sponsor this week.

723
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,160
What?

724
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,760
A new, yes.

725
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,160
So we're new to talk about, it's Honey Book.

726
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,360
It sounds nice, doesn't it?

727
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160
It does sound nice.

728
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,840
Is it just a book full of honey?

729
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,720
It is a business management tool.

730
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,600
You got in, you started your artisanal donut shop

731
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,160
to make artisanal donuts and create new recipes,

732
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm assuming.

733
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,840
Yes, I did.

734
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,280
So Travis, you shouldn't waste a bunch of time

735
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,680
doing garbage that you don't wanna do

736
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,840
and Honey Book helps with that.

737
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,600
It helps you automate your busy work.

738
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,480
They got templates for emails, proposals,

739
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
brochures, invoices.

740
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,080
It organizes your communications with your clients,

741
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,320
your bookings, contracts, and invoices.

742
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,200
It's all one place.

743
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,920
It just makes running a small business that much easier

744
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,680
so you don't have to mess around with all the whack,

745
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,040
boring stuff that you don't care about.

746
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,160
Justin, hey, Justin.

747
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,640
Yeah?

748
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,560
Can Honey Book teach me how to make donuts?

749
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,040
This is a problem.

750
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,680
Because I invested-

751
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,000
Right now, can I be honest with you guys?

752
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,120
I don't mean to freak you out.

753
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,720
I invested all of our podcast money into this donut business

754
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,920
because I love donuts.

755
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,560
You know that.

756
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,280
Right, yeah.

757
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
What was the name of it again?

758
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
Of the donut business?

759
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,320
Holes to Me.

760
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,640
Holes to Me.

761
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,600
Yeah, right.

762
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,720
It was going off of like, it's all holes to me, but like-

763
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,040
I thought we were gonna call it Holes On for one more day.

764
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Oh, that's right, that is better.

765
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,960
What about Holes Your Horses?

766
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,080
Well, that sounds like we're gonna hurt horses, which I-

767
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,720
I thought we were gonna call it Donut on My Breakfast.

768
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,480
Oh, no.

769
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,120
How about Donut November?

770
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,600
Right now, Honey Book is canceling all their other ads with us,

771
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,440
but also right now, Honey Book is offering our listeners 50% off

772
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,920
when you try honeybook.com slash my brother.

773
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,120
Payment is flexible.

774
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,160
This promotion applies whether you pay monthly or annually.

775
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,520
Go to tryhoneybook.com slash my brother for 50% off your first year.

776
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,200
That's tryhoneybook.com slash my brother.

777
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,400
Hey, are you sad because you can't get Donut on My Breakfast right at home?

778
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,920
You wake up and you're just-

779
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,000
You're not feeling putting on your big boy pants,

780
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,240
but you really want some Donut on My Breakfast.

781
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,160
Well, maybe think about getting up on DoorDash.

782
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
I don't think they work with Donut on My Breakfast because-

783
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,600
Not yet.

784
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,720
It's fictional, and also I think that they have standards,

785
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,200
but they do work with over 340,000 restaurants in 3300 cities

786
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,000
to get food delivered to your home when you use the DoorDash app.

787
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
You just pick what you want to eat,

788
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,080
and food will be delivered to you wherever you are.

789
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,160
Oh my God, you guys, even as we're recording this segment,

790
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,560
the orders are flooding in from DoorDash.

791
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,000
My business is saved.

792
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,560
Hey.

793
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,840
Thank you, DoorDash.

794
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,200
You know what I like about DoorDash?

795
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,760
What?

796
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,120
DoorDash, I try to eat healthier.

797
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,760
It's the beginning of the year.

798
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,720
I'm sure a lot of people are.

799
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,920
And a lot of times I just don't feel like the extra work it takes

800
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,360
to cook something healthy.

801
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
And in those situations, DoorDash is great

802
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,960
because you can order ahead of time,

803
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,200
get something healthy delivered right to you,

804
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,480
and you don't have to put in all the work

805
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,440
of actually making something.

806
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
Also, not just to your house,

807
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
because I've been out at bars before,

808
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,720
got there and found out they didn't serve food,

809
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,600
and I was starving.

810
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,440
I've DoorDashed to a bar before.

811
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,920
What's up?

812
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,960
Not close.

813
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,400
That's pretty cool stuff.

814
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,160
Right now our listeners can get $5

815
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,320
off their first order of $15 or more.

816
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,920
When you download the DoorDash app

817
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,600
and enter the promo code MYBROTHER,

818
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,920
all one word, that's $5 off your first order.

819
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,240
When you download the DoorDash app from the App Store

820
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,920
and enter promo code MYBROTHER,

821
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,600
one last time, promo code MYBROTHER

822
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,560
for $5 off your first order from DoorDash.

823
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,280
Hey, Jake Heath.

824
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,840
Hey, Helen.

825
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,160
I hear you have a true-false quiz you want me to finish.

826
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,040
I do.

827
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,640
Here we begin.

828
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,880
We host a trivia game show podcast

829
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,920
on the Max Fun Network called Go Fact Yourself.

830
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,400
True.

831
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:46,960
Correct.

832
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
The show is all about celebrity guests

833
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,160
answering trivia questions about things Jake Heath enjoys.

834
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,560
False.

835
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,880
We sometimes don't talk about baseball or cats.

836
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,840
Thank God.

837
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,240
It's questions about things they enjoy.

838
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,360
Next, we bring on surprise experts every episode.

839
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,760
True.

840
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,240
Correct.

841
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,280
Final question.

842
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,000
It's just the two of us sitting alone with these guests.

843
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,480
False.

844
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:06,960
Correct.

845
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,600
We have a live audience at the Angel City Brewery.

846
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,240
See?

847
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,040
You can hear Go Fact Yourself every first and third Friday

848
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,600
of the month.

849
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,960
And if you don't listen, you can go fact yourself.

850
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,460
True.

851
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,840
I want to munch!

852
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,340
Squad!

853
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,120
I want to munch!

854
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,620
Squad!

855
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,020
Squad!

856
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,980
I want to read one headline, and it's just,

857
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,140
Chuck E. Cheese's parent names David McKillop's CEO.

858
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,300
I just think it's weird that Chuck E. Cheese lets his dad

859
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,860
pick who's going to run the company.

860
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,580
I'm Charles F. Cheese, the kingmaker.

861
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,980
So, right.

862
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,740
So, OK.

863
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,460
So, Mr. Peanut died.

864
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:03,940
Yeah, I knew it.

865
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,140
I fucking knew it.

866
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,940
Is this played?

867
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,580
Mr. Peanut died saving the lives of Matt Walsh.

868
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,220
And what's this?

869
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,180
So random.

870
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,860
It's so random.

871
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,140
It's like, I saw it.

872
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,260
I saw the news.

873
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,860
New York Times front page, big font, top of the headline.

874
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,820
And I was like, fucking random, dude.

875
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,900
I saw the news, and I thought, good.

876
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,900
Eat the rich, you know?

877
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,380
With his monocle, his top hat.

878
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,860
Well, he's also a nut.

879
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,260
So you could chomp down right on him.

880
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,900
But can I say something, though?

881
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,420
Yeah.

882
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,700
Is it about how random it is?

883
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,500
It's random.

884
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,540
We've covered that.

885
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,820
Can I say what else?

886
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,380
What?

887
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,620
It's fucking twisted, dude.

888
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,820
It is twisted.

889
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,940
That's their guy.

890
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,980
That's their whole guy, and he's been in all the commercials.

891
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,140
And they're like, what are we going to do for the big game?

892
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,780
Let's kill Mr. Peanut.

893
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,340
It ends with a card that says Mr. Peanut, 1916 to 2020.

894
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,100
Because he's 104 years old, and he died.

895
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,380
And I just wanted to point out that this is an ad that ran before the Super Bowl.

896
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,540
This press release, one, details exactly what happens in that, in prose.

897
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,380
The entirety of that.

898
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,500
You can see it.

899
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,060
They're all in a car.

900
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,980
It's the novelization of the commercial.

901
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,580
It's a new concept.

902
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,900
Yep, last year, Mr. Peanut saved friends from snacking disappointment.

903
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,580
This year, he's saving lives.

904
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,700
The newly released pregame ad shows Mr. Peanut, Matt Walsh, and Wesley Snipes are on a nutty

905
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,780
adventure in the Nutmobile, where Mr. Peanut is forced to swerve, causing the vehicle to

906
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,900
spin out of control.

907
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,820
The trio jumps out of the Nutmobile, clinging onto a tree branch, as the vehicle crashes

908
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,820
down into a deep canyon below.

909
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,260
They momentarily find safety until their combined weight begins to break the branch.

910
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,100
In the ultimate act of friendship, Mr. Peanut lets go and sacrifices himself

911
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,780
to save his friends from impending doom.

912
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,580
Yeah, he does.

913
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:06,100
And then it says you can watch him die in this video.

914
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,060
You can watch him die.

915
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,540
And they're going to show that in the pregame.

916
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,900
And then the brand's official Super Bowl commercial will air in the third quarter of the game

917
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
and broadcast Mr. Peanut's funeral.

918
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,500
Oh, funny, funny.

919
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,140
That's going to be fucking funny.

920
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,380
And then, but then can we just, he is going to smash out of the grave, right?

921
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,540
I mean, he's got to smash out of the grave with like a new look.

922
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,220
Guys, I think he's really fucking dead.

923
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,140
I think he needs fucking toast, dude.

924
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,060
I saw him fall down and I saw the car explode and I think he's really fucking dead, you guys.

925
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,980
There's no getting out of this one.

926
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,020
That brand mascot is dead as hell.

927
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,140
I don't see him coming back.

928
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,900
I think he's fucking dead as shit.

929
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:53,780
The fact that Mr. Peanut fell 100 miles into a huge ravine and Wesley Snipes didn't say

930
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:59,620
and me without my jelly is probably the biggest comedy tragedy of this generation,

931
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,060
or perhaps any other.

932
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,380
Can I?

933
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,540
I want to float them in the limits in everyone's mind of logging into Twitter someday in the

934
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:15,860
morning and seeing the breaking news that actor-comedian Matt Walsh has died saving

935
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,900
Wesley Snipes and Mr. Peanut in a car accident.

936
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:27,780
Well, no, because it'll be Mr. Peanut and then then Matt Walsh and then Wesley Snipes

937
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,340
who have won the tontine and he'll get all the money.

938
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,220
Okay, see, yes.

939
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,620
So it's going to be a really funny funeral for this beloved peanut who has lived longer

940
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,060
than pretty much anybody on earth and then we killed him because that's what we do.

941
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,740
I wanted to hear about his family at the lake.

942
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,060
They got smashed.

943
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,940
What does that mean?

944
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,820
Because they're peanuts.

945
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,820
Smashed peanuts?

946
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,100
Like that great treat, smashed peanuts?

947
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,180
Because they get turned into peanut butter.

948
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,340
Okay, that you're nothing.

949
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,020
Air whooshed into peanut butter.

950
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,580
Fans who-

951
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,300
No, hold up.

952
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,260
Wait, Travis started doing like a Mr. Evil impression accent and that's when it was

953
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,060
getting good for me.

954
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,140
So again, but as Mr. Peanut Butter.

955
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,780
I love it.

956
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,620
Say something else as Mr. Evil.

957
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,060
Justin, shut the fuck up.

958
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,660
One million dollars.

959
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,420
In addition to mourning Mr. Peanut during his funeral, fans have several ways to celebrate

960
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:34,020
his life, including fans who spot the nutmobile leading up to and on game day will receive

961
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,500
a commemorative pin celebrating Mr. Peanut's life.

962
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,300
Hey y'all, I know that motherfucker's dead.

963
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,060
If I see the nutmobile driving around, I'm going to freak.

964
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,340
Also, if I get a pin and then find out he's not dead,

965
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,980
I'm going to feel like a real asshole.

966
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,340
Mr. Peanut enthusiasts can show their family and friends how much the legume meant to them

967
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:02,180
by sharing the black crying monocle and their favorite memory on social using hashtag repeanut.

968
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,380
I feel like they're not taking this seriously.

969
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,780
They're like making a big fucking joke out of it.

970
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,820
A man has died.

971
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,940
Yeah, a man has died and he may be a peanut butter man.

972
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,180
And, but I mean, just because he was a peanut doesn't mean his memory needs to be assaulted.

973
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,460
The ad was produced by-

974
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,820
Was that another peanut joke?

975
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,820
No, sir.

976
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,300
Okay, who do you wish had died-

977
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,260
In that three?

978
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,900
In that three.

979
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,220
I mean, Mr. Peanut.

980
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,100
Fuck a merry kill.

981
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:36,980
Can I just say though, I am really glad they were filming when the car crash happened.

982
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,180
Cause if he had just died, like if he had just died, if he had had a heart attack and just died,

983
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,340
and then we see it in the news, they like smell rotten peanut coming from his hotel room or

984
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,460
something like five days later, like that would have been sad.

985
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,340
But at least they were recording on tape.

986
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,460
Yeah, they got a commercial out of it.

987
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,100
They recorded it when he died and exploded.

988
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,260
So now I feel like I get a chance to say goodbye.

989
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,060
I just want to say that there's no combination of the three of them in which I don't end up

990
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,820
choosing Mr. Peanut for kill.

991
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,260
Not for kill.

992
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:11,140
Yeah, cause he's, and the reason for that is that he doesn't have flesh and bone and blood

993
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,940
and brain and organs and cells and nerves.

994
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,700
Brand Twitter fucking jizzed all over itself trying to get a slice of this one.

995
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,420
Everybody's tweeting about this, this tale.

996
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,500
I think the most hypocritical one is Snickers who said,

997
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,980
we too would sacrifice it all for the nut. Hashtag RIP Nut.

998
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:43,620
And hey fucking Snickers, you've been burying his brethren for decades in people's maws.

999
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,860
I don't know where you get off being indignant about the loss of one peanut when you've been

1000
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,100
absolutely murdering them for ages.

1001
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,740
I think-

1002
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:56,740
PETA said that nuts have been a great source of protein for a long time.

1003
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,060
Whoa, shut the fuck up.

1004
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,820
You can't even, we're trying to have fun over here with this dead ass nut.

1005
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,460
And you come in here like, well, let me tell you about the body science.

1006
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:12,500
So Uno, the brand Uno of the game, you know the game Uno?

1007
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,700
So that brand replied to the other brand, which is now, I will give it up.

1008
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,900
The Twitter name of Mr. Peanut has changed to the estate of Mr. Peanut.

1009
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,180
Yeah, that does rule.

1010
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,860
That is extremely good.

1011
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,780
I will give you your proper respect for that.

1012
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,660
Uno replied to the tweet, what?

1013
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,060
No, we're dropping a reverse card on this. Hashtag RIP Nut.

1014
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,940
Hey Uno, can I talk to you over here for a second?

1015
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,340
It's 2020.

1016
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:50,180
If you have had the ability to drop reverse cards on events of the world,

1017
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,220
I do not know why you've been on the fucking bench until now.

1018
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,140
I can't believe this is against you in the fucking game, Uno.

1019
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,740
You must have just drawn it, I hope.

1020
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,940
Because if you have had this ability this entire time,

1021
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,980
and this is where you say this far, no far.

1022
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,700
Listen guys, we only have enough chrono silk to operate the time loom once.

1023
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,780
So we, and we've been waiting.

1024
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,260
I think Mr. Peanut's the one we got to burn it on.

1025
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,220
If you're already got the reverse card going,

1026
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,860
if you could just let it run for a few years,

1027
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,900
I would love another second, another pass at this.

1028
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,540
Very, very well done, Peanut Company.

1029
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,300
Can I do a Yahoo?

1030
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,660
Yes.

1031
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,220
Yeah, please.

1032
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,740
It was sent in by Kevin. Thanks, Kevin.

1033
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,260
It's anonymous Yahoo answers user.

1034
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,100
I'm gonna call Mr. Peanut out of respect.

1035
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,020
Does the washing machine in a home slash apartment

1036
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,740
share the same water that comes out of the toilet?

1037
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,340
Now I think that this person's probably smart enough to know

1038
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,740
that you don't flush your dirty toilet water down

1039
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,540
and then it goes back up into the washing machine

1040
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,540
because I've certainly done both at the same time before

1041
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,460
and like, I know that's not how it works.

1042
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,660
But I guess I'm confused about what the flow direction,

1043
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,980
like, is there one big pipe

1044
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,260
and this pipe would be called like Griffin's water pipe

1045
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,020
and then whenever I turn on washing machine,

1046
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,660
Griffin's water pipe is like, let's get some water up there.

1047
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,140
Yes.

1048
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,140
But then Griffin's downstairs toilet pipe

1049
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,820
is like same water?

1050
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,780
Or is there a yucky water pipe

1051
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,580
and then good healthy boy water pipe?

1052
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,220
I've always pictured it kind of like a whimsical

1053
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,740
kind of like pipe organ in a Disney cartoon

1054
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,140
or maybe one of those Disney movies like Mary Poppins

1055
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,900
or it's like mostly live action, but some animated stuff

1056
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,580
and like the pipe organ would be animated

1057
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,060
and it's like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1058
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,180
And some of the pipes are nasty water.

1059
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,300
I love that, yeah.

1060
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,580
And there's somebody definitely playing it for each house.

1061
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,940
Yes, definitely.

1062
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,260
Somebody's got somebody underneath each house.

1063
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,900
There has to be some kind of oversight, right?

1064
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,780
Oh, you just flushed your toilet?

1065
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,940
Let's get some of the yucky water in there.

1066
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,420
Don't waste the good boy water on there.

1067
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,260
Because otherwise you're telling me that like,

1068
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,380
it's up to a machine and I don't trust that.

1069
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,380
I don't trust a machine to always know

1070
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,260
where the nasty water can come, where the good water can go.

1071
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,540
Right, exactly, yeah.

1072
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,780
No, yeah, because the computer's gonna switch it

1073
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,820
as like a cyber joke.

1074
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,180
Because the other option, the other thing that,

1075
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,140
I don't know, scientists might try to tell me

1076
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,140
is that the water in my toilet is the same

1077
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,820
as the water in my sink.

1078
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,660
And there's no way that's true, scientists.

1079
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,940
Can't possibly be true.

1080
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,540
Justin's trying to Google the,

1081
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,060
I know Justin's Googling the answer,

1082
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,820
like how does potty water work?

1083
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,180
Because he wants to be the smart,

1084
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,820
he always has to be the smart one.

1085
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,580
I don't know, it's just like, it's so,

1086
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,700
I just, you flush it and it goes to the sewer.

1087
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,900
But how's it come back, Justin?

1088
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,340
It's not about where it goes.

1089
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,140
How's it come up?

1090
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,460
Because it's filling from the same place

1091
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,820
as your potable water does.

1092
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,100
Whoa, whoa.

1093
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,500
You have one, you don't have a potable

1094
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,620
and non-potable water source going into your home.

1095
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,100
You're telling me, wait, stop, fuck you.

1096
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,140
Are you telling me that in my sink is doo-doo water?

1097
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,500
No, Travis.

1098
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,700
No, in your toilet is sink water.

1099
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,660
It's all in perspective, baby.

1100
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,820
But then my toilet, the water that comes up

1101
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,740
and grabs my poop and takes it away,

1102
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,580
is the same water that I use

1103
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,220
to wash my Lexapro down my throat?

1104
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,380
No, the same water you use to wash your Lexapro

1105
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,100
down your throat is so fancy

1106
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,660
that you're also treating your dookies.

1107
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,940
That seems like a waste.

1108
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,180
Hey, it's 2020, let's save some time

1109
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,820
and like money and energy where we can.

1110
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,140
I don't need fancy water to grab my dooks.

1111
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,980
All right, you wanna save money?

1112
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,460
Our infrastructure is a fucking disgrace

1113
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,500
and we're supposed to run new non-potable lines

1114
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,780
to everyone's homes?

1115
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,140
Are you okay, wait, let's start here.

1116
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,780
First, new lines to Flint, Michigan.

1117
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,340
Then, new lines to grab my dookie water.

1118
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,580
This is what's bugging me out, man.

1119
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,740
And sometimes we pretend like we don't know things

1120
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,340
on this show to like be funny.

1121
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,420
And like, that's why we say sometimes funny stuff

1122
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:12,180
like that the, you know, potty water would get

1123
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,540
in washing machine and like, that's funny.

1124
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,900
But I'm just double checking now.

1125
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,780
I'm not washing my clothes in poo-poo pee-pee water, right?

1126
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,300
That's, right?

1127
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,020
No, no.

1128
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,980
I just wanna make sure I haven't been doing it.

1129
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,580
I just wanna make sure I haven't been doing it wrong

1130
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,380
this whole time.

1131
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,580
Cause I didn't, you know, I've been adulting for a bit now

1132
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,340
but no one ever really teached me how.

1133
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,420
So just making sure it's not,

1134
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,620
I haven't been cleaning my clothes with poo-poo pee-pee water

1135
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,740
or brushing my teeth with it.

1136
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,780
You know, I used to watch those tiny house shows

1137
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,620
and the people would sometimes just kind of,

1138
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,220
let's be honest, shit in a box.

1139
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,420
And they would say like, it's a compostable toilet

1140
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,700
but you're shitting in a box.

1141
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,140
But now that I'm thinking about the risk

1142
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,860
of washing my clothes in poo-poo pee-pee water

1143
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,860
and I think maybe instead I poop in a box.

1144
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,700
Maybe I poop in a box.

1145
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,620
I just think the pipe should be above the ground

1146
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,900
cause when they're under the ground,

1147
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,540
that's where first of all, the machines can tell it

1148
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,460
where to go and which one gets put, yeah.

1149
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,180
Also that's fun cause then you can follow them

1150
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,700
like they do in Jurassic Park

1151
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,300
where there's like follow the red pipe

1152
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,140
and you know the red pipe is the hot water

1153
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,740
and the blue pipe is the cold water

1154
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,580
and the brown pipe is the poo-poo pee-pee water.

1155
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:21,860
Yeah.

1156
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,300
So embarrassing.

1157
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,740
What, Justin, what?

1158
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,180
This is so embarrassing.

1159
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,340
It's like you guys aren't even saying anything.

1160
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,700
This is embarrassing, I'm embarrassed.

1161
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,140
I just think that, here's the thing,

1162
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,140
electricity, I don't fucking care.

1163
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,860
How comes electricity and internet and phone wires

1164
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,300
get to be high up in the sky, paraded high up in the sky.

1165
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,500
Look at us, everybody.

1166
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,180
We've got electricity in us.

1167
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,460
You have to look at us.

1168
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,660
Birds are gonna sit on us

1169
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,060
and poo-poo all over your cars and crosswalks.

1170
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,820
No matter what, cause we're electricity,

1171
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,780
we get to be up high.

1172
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,620
And meanwhile, all the water is like,

1173
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,060
we have to live below the earth like sloppy mole men.

1174
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,220
I think we give it a chance to switch them around

1175
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,780
and we let the water ones be up above

1176
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,620
where we can keep an eye,

1177
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,860
it's that way we can see the water.

1178
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,580
The water goes through the wires.

1179
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,420
And the internet goes through the pipes.

1180
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,340
The pipes are gonna be way up high.

1181
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,740
So wait, big, heavy water pipes up in the sky?

1182
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,620
Not up in the sky, like 10 to 12 feet off the ground.

1183
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,140
You can put little birds on top of that,

1184
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,260
that would look dumb.

1185
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,820
I mean, we can get all kinds of animals up there,

1186
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,140
but the pipes will be clean

1187
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,540
and there'll be one clean water pipe

1188
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,460
and they'll be going in towards the city,

1189
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,300
but then there will be the dookie water pipe.

1190
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,620
Maybe we paint that one black.

1191
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,260
So we can see into it.

1192
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,460
I might be way off base here,

1193
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,820
but I'm gonna throw some spaghetti at the wall

1194
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,540
and see if it sticks.

1195
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,060
Clear pipes.

1196
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,420
Yeah, no.

1197
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,220
So you can see it all.

1198
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:47,860
That's what I'm saying.

1199
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,900
And just throwing this out here too, three pipes.

1200
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,260
One for clean, potable sink and laundry water.

1201
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,900
One for whatever water.

1202
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,220
We don't need to put a dirty label on it.

1203
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,580
And then the third one,

1204
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,060
just you see some salmon swimming in there.

1205
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,100
Oh, that's nice, that's relaxing.

1206
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,380
Yeah, for the animals to get through.

1207
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,380
How's a fish supposed to get through the city?

1208
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,020
Right?

1209
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,220
Fish wants to see shit.

1210
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,620
How come a bird gets to see everything?

1211
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,260
Fish never gets to see nothing.

1212
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,700
Yeah, fish see nothing.

1213
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,020
Hey, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1214
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,620

Thanks for being patient with us

1216
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,380
in like weird schedules over the past couple months

1217
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,980
between like live shows and travel

1218
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,380
and holidays and births of children.

1219
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,340
Thank you for your understanding.

1220
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,580
We hope you've enjoyed the programming

1221
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,780
that has been available to you.

1222
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,140
Yes.

1223
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,940
Also, we're gonna be performing some live shows

1224
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,780
here in Cincinnati at the end of February.

1225
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,140
February 19th, we're gonna be doing

1226
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,500
My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1227
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,180
And February 20th, we're going to be doing

1228
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,380
the Adventure Zone.

1229
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,860
You can get those tickets by going to McElroy.family

1230
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,140

1231
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,220
And if you click on merch,

1232
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,060
you'll see all the new cool merch we've got there,

1233
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,580
including my favorite,

1234
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,820
some new Adventure Zone graduation pins,

1235
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,860
one for heroes, one for villains,

1236
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,940
one for sidekicks and one for hinges.

1237
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,620
I think they're all super cool.

1238
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,820
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1239
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,420
for the use of our theme song.

1240
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,820
Holy shit.

1241
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,420
It's a departure.

1242
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,700
I got it confused with the other show that I do

1243
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,940
that I say the name of the theme song for

1244
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,700
and I actually forgot the name of this

1245
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,700
500 episode long podcast theme song.

1246
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,420
I apologize to everybody, but it's a good song.

1247
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:30,980
Great album.

1248
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,780
Go check it out.

1249
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,300

So that's gonna do it for us.

1257
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,460
Every week on the show,

1258
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,620
we have Griffin read a Yahoo answer

1259
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,460
that we think about and come back next week and discuss.

1260
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,780
This one's sent in by Ivy.

1261
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,020
Thanks.

1262
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,180
It's synonymous Yahoo answer user also.

1263
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,860
Mr. Peanut Rips up asks,

1264
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,540
how come if we flew to the moon,

1265
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:07,220
nobody ever tried to fly underneath the earth

1266
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,980
to see what's really down there?

1267
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,620
Whoa!

1268
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,820
My name's Justin McElroy.

1269
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,780
I'm Travis McElroy.

1270
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,980
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1271
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,500
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

1272
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,540
Kiss your dad.

1273
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:33,700
Just grab my lips.
