1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,360
Here it is. This is season three of My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the podcast.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,040
And I was I've been watching a lot of going back and like binging a lot of TV shows from,

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
you know, that like started in 2012 and getting current.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
And I was thinking about it, and I think it's time that we had a character reset.

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,760
Who? Which one of the three of us? Because I've got so much. Actually, you know what?

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:27,440
But if we're able to volunteer, if this means shedding some of the lore or some of the vorlore

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,880
about ourselves and just sort of rebooting and maybe we can even bring in a new actor to play

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
30 under 30, media luminary, Griffin McElroy. I want you to know I'm already in talks with

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
Adam Scott. I am working with Adam Scott. That is such a good get.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
It's such a good get. He plays kind of a cynical boy, I feel like,

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
in a lot of his shows, though. And I don't know that that's my brand. We need to tell him,

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,040
hey, maybe your brand's changing, Griffin. That's how a character reset works. For example,

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
I've always been the kind of like curmudgeonly one, a little bit of a stick in the mud,

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,240
a little bit of like, I take it way too seriously. And Justin's the sexpot.

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,120
Right. Always talking about fannies.

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,440
I would like to stay the elderly sexpot. Are you sure?

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,280
Yeah. Yes. I feel like I've just started to really inhabit my role as an elderly sexpot

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,720
and as a room-clean-hand style elderly sexpot. And I feel like I kind of want to stay there.

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
That's the anchor. That's the anchor of the show.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah. I mean, do you want to go further with it, maybe?

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,080
Oh, yeah. Older and sexier.

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Yeah. How old slash sexy do you feel comfortable playing and then go 10% beyond that?

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:51,760
So I'm currently a very sexual septuagenarian. I could be a very, very sexual octogenarian.

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,240
I would feel pretty uncomfortable with very, very, very sexual nonagenarian.

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, what we could do is we could make it a storyline within the show where you age rapidly

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,880
and sex rapidly. I think the best thing we've done.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm getting hornier. Someone get me some iron pills. Why did I pick up this cursed stone?

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,480
I need calcium fascia to make my boner bone more better.

36
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,680
Could we start at 150 very, very, very, very, very horny and then kind of walk it back?

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,520
And I'm talking about almost a sort of bestial horniness, like an almost uncontrollable-

38
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,200
Where all of Justin's responses to things just become deep grunts.

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,360
One and a half centuries of just like,

40
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,040
and then we'll be like, we'll get some feedback. We'll get some one stars from folks like too

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
horny, too old and be like, all right.

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,040
No, no, no. And then we'll hit a point where it's like,

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,840
that's the right age, but maybe still a little too horny.

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,640
So then it'll be like, all right, walk back. Now I'm 60 and I'm just kind of horny.

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,720
And people will be like, I miss it a little bit though.

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,240
We'll figure it out. Split the diff.

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,760
Okay. So you're saying there's an exact age and an exact horniness.

48
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,560
The sex Y axis where they meet. That's what we're looking for.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Thank you. Yes. Yes. Yeah, I'll work on it.

50
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,240
I feel like that should be in private more than in a public sort of forum like this.

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
Is that fair to say?

52
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,320
Yeah. I wonder also the etymology of the word sex pot.

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,560
Were those in medieval times where people fucking boning down on pots?

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,480
It's just like a big pot of sex.

55
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,840
Yikes. Were people getting in it to do sex or were they doing sex to the pot?

56
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,880
Fill it up with some sort of good feeling wax.

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,400
They could just sort of make their own and explore the wax.

58
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,000
All of the above.

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,840
All right. And some of the below, if you know what I mean.

60
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,800
So I'm still me, but older and sexier.

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,480
Travis, what's going on with your character?

62
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,400
You know, I was a curmudgeon, a stick in the mud, not having any fun,

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:23,440
but I thought what if I instead took that in the direction of maybe I'm actually just a little doofy and maybe also a werewolf.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
Clean shaven, Travis. Maybe you take a turn being the youngest one.

65
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
And then I'll get replaced by Bam Margera.

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,940
Okay.

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm sorry. What was Adam Scott doing?

68
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,240
He was going to be me, but then Bam came in and gave you the best performance audition of his fucking life.

69
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,880
And so he's going to be me and he's going to do at least three stunts an episode like,

70
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,400
okay, I have this hot coffee right here.

71
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,760
Uh-oh, it spilled it.

72
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,080
Okay, I'm going to stick with Adam Scott for now.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay, but Bam can do his stunts.

74
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,960
I've seen how Bam treated his father and his uncle and he's very cruel to those old men.

75
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,320
And I don't want someone like that around me because I'm going to be so old and so sexual

76
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,200
that I feel like it's going to be a very juicy target for Bam.

77
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Can we get Adam Scott in the mix, but call him Slam Margera

78
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,560
and just have Adam Scott do stunts, hit our dad, and spill coffee all over us?

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
I don't want anyone to hit our dad.

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Yeah, you seem very hung up on this one key aspect of the show.

81
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,760
It's just, there was a zeitgeist, cultural zeitgeist, of the Jackass crew.

82
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,160
And the Jackass crew's John Knox was like, what's up?

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,720
Today, I'm just going to get hit by a fucking car.

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
And everybody's like, yes, yes, we love this.

85
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,800
And somebody, Pontius came in and was like,

86
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,720
hey, this time I'm going to just jump off the building.

87
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,320
Pontius Pilate is going to, this time I'm going to rule on Christ.

88
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,920
Do you want me to get Barabbas?

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,960
Do you want Christ or Barabbas?

90
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Christ or Barabbas, make up your mind.

91
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
Christ or Barabbas, make up your pick.

92
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,160
Also, do you want me to slam myself in the nuts with a huge monkey's fist knot?

93
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,120
Okay, fine.

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,000
Like sailors do.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,240
All right.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,920
And then Bilbo would come in and he was like,

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm going to just smoke a bunch of weed and maybe stable my nut sack.

98
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,400
Okay, what?

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
I couldn't remember the guy's actual, what is it?

100
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
Stevo, not Bilbo.

101
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,680
That's it.

102
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,400
Okay, yeah.

103
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,200
And then we were all loving it.

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Bilbo would come in.

105
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,680
No, Bilbo is like so on point, Travis.

106
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,040
That's like next level.

107
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,200
How has no one asked Stevo if he knows Bilbo yet?

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,840
That's like prime territory.

109
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,640
We had like wild man come in and he'd like put his wiener in a fire truck ladder

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,240
and like all these stunts, right?

111
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,000
Stunts, stunts, stunts, unbelievable stunts.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
Then Bam shows up and people like, all right, what do you got?

113
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
He's like, I'm going to slap my dad's belly while he's asleep.

114
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
And it's like, that's the, wait, huh?

115
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,600
Why?

116
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
That's the stunt?

117
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
Do you think the other jackasses were ever like,

118
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
and today I got a good stunt, I'm going to slap Bam's dad's belly.

119
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
And Bam would be like, actually, that's way out of line.

120
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,880
That's my fucking dad, dude.

121
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,240
That's my fucking dad, man.

122
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
What are you?

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,840
That's my blood.

124
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,000
That's my blood in my belly.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Johnny, you know we're brothers, but that's my dad.

126
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,760
Maybe they should do a new jackass where they just do things

127
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,480
that terrify people our age.

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Like, this week on Jackass, I'm pulling all the money out

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,320
of my 401k before I'm 59 and a half.

130
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,760
Going to be a huge tax penalty.

131
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,560
Check it out.

132
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,760
This week on Jackass, I'm going to call the customer help line

133
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,040
for an airline and see if they can move my ticket to a different day.

134
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,520
This week on Jackass, I'm just going to go to a music festival

135
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
and there's going to be a lot of people there.

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Actually, that would be very, at this point in my life,

137
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,480
if someone's like, dude, pack it up, we're going to Coachella,

138
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,920
I would just scream like a rabid raccoon,

139
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
just screaming, clawing at the walls.

140
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,160
And they could fuse, they could fuse, they could fuse.

141
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,200
Adam and Bam fuse like Steven Universe in the slam Margera.

142
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
Or we could just make it like the Olsen twins

143
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
where they would alternate, but you'd never know which one was which.

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
And then Justin is like,

145
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
Justin is anywhere between 60 and 150

146
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,680
and anywhere between very horny and very, very, very, very, very horny.

147
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,680
Okay, yes.

148
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,200
But I have a request.

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,960
I would like my role to be portrayed by host of the gong show, Tommy Maitland.

150
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,800
I'd like him to take over for me.

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
I think he's very multi-talented.

152
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,200
Not Mike Myers.

153
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,960
Oh, we could never get Mike Myers.

154
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,080
But Tommy Maitland as Justin McElroy,

155
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
I think would be, there's got to be an off-season for the gong show.

156
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,000
Sure.

157
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
All right, let's do it.

158
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
401, countdown, countdown to 420.

159
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,920
Lots of buzz about the 420 episode.

160
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,000
Y'all, we don't know anything.

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
We got nothing planned.

162
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,280
Do you know how lucky we got that the timing of the Margaritaville thing

163
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,040
was close enough to episode 400

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
that it could look like we planned something for episode 400?

165
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes, exactly.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Oh, also, it's a max fun drive.

167
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,920
10 out of 10, should have mentioned that before.

168
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120

And we're going to talk more about those gifts

174
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,080
and talk more about the drive.

175
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,160
But it's a special time of year for us.

176
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,520

Thank you in advance for your support, by the way.

184
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
But right now we've wasted enough of your fucking precious time

185
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,680
with panhandling and the jackass stuff, all of it.

186
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,720
Our jackassery.

187
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,400
Our jackassery.

188
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,560
Let's get into some advice.

189
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,480
Yesterday, someone from...

190
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
I got three words in, y'all.

191
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
Yeah, it's not like you skipped one.

192
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,520
You added a word.

193
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,840
Yesterday, someone was wandering around the office that I work in.

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
Yikes and wowsers.

195
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,800
Justin, prepositions are really not doing it for you today.

196
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
There are some typographical issues that I'm trying to do.

197
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,280
There are.

198
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,400
Yesterday, someone was wandering around the office that I work in

199
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
in a monkey costume.

200
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,720
See, there was a missing in.

201
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,520
No, that I work at in a monkey costume.

202
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,880
In a monkey costume, making monkey noises

203
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
and it scared the shit out of me.

204
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,080
I was told later that I need to...

205
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,880
You know what it is?

206
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,280
What?

207
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
Can I say something?

208
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,880
This is not a joke.

209
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm gonna have to do this right here on the show.

210
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
I have to increase my font size.

211
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,400
Oh, you're getting older before our very eyes.

212
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm aging.

213
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
Now are you getting hornier?

214
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Oh, yes.

215
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,800
I knew it.

216
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,360
This isn't right.

217
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
I shall find no relief here on this podcast I make with my brothers.

218
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,840
This is a terrible scenario.

219
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,880
You know what folks love, a nice big juicy font.

220
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,880
Yesterday, someone was wandering around the office that I work in

221
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,800
in a monkey costume, making monkey noises

222
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
and it scared the shit out of me.

223
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,520
I was told later that this person was in fact our company's CEO

224
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,120
and he does this every year

225
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,440
during our company-wide free throw competition.

226
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
You can't sneak that up on me.

227
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,560
You want your bonus this year?

228
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
All right, let's see how you do.

229
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Let's see if you got the help of that Taco Neck Syndrome.

230
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,800
And that's my main sort of basketball reference

231
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,760
is of course a Taco Bell commercial with Taco Neck Syndrome.

232
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,520
I did not receive an explanation from my coworkers

233
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,800
as to why he does this.

234
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
Now, when they say why he does this,

235
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,400
do they mean run around in a monkey costume

236
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,440
or hold a free throw competition for the employees?

237
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,640
I would say column A with a souson of column B.

238
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,440
The issue is that I now have a perfectly reasonable fear

239
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
of this monkey suit and do not know how to respond to this.

240
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,800
How I extract myself from the situation next year

241
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
and avoid the fear of death that this display inspires within me

242
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
and that's from Scared and Confused in Denver.

243
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, one, you work on the TV show The Office

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,080
and the terrifying thing about that

245
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,840
is it was canceled several years ago.

246
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,640
So you are actually kind of a prisoner,

247
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,520
an interdimensional prisoner who is larping

248
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,280
or you're larping as the office.

249
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,600
Can we all agree that the CEO owned this monkey suit

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
prior to any kind of free throw competition happening

251
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,720
and when the free throw competition started up

252
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
or maybe the CEO even started the free throw competition

253
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,800
as an excuse to wear the monkey suit that they already owned.

254
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
You're gonna look for any opportunity.

255
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,840
When all you've got is a monkey suit,

256
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,360
everything looks like a free throw competition.

257
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,440
Yes, we've always, that's the adage.

258
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
I feel like different entertainment mediums

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,800
have tried to get a fear of monkeys rapes going in me

260
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,080
for three years and decades.

261
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,800
And they just haven't succeeded like King Kong.

262
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,760
The big monster's here, what is it, a big ape?

263
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,760
That's fine, I'm not so scared of that I think.

264
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
Uh oh, Rampage, what's the rock gonna do

265
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,120
to get out of this sticky mess?

266
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
There's a big, big ape.

267
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Well, it's just a big ape, Kongo.

268
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,920
They're coming, the big apes.

269
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
Are there dinosaurs too?

270
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,240
No, just big apes.

271
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
Like are there murderers in there too?

272
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,640
Nope, just the big, just big gorillas.

273
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm not very afraid of that for some reason.

274
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,520
Okay, the ape that you're discussing in Rampage

275
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,360
is several dozen stories tall.

276
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,040
So you're saying, you're telling me,

277
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:51,440
if you saw a 200 foot giant gorilla coming at,

278
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,200
and they're the same as apes, everybody,

279
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,320
you saw a 200 foot giant gorilla running at you,

280
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
you would just be like, mm, sorry.

281
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm not saying they're not dangerous.

282
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm just saying you're not afraid of them.

283
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,800
Not, yeah, no.

284
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,400
But they are dangerous, you're just not afraid of them.

285
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,480
No, this is a big question, right?

286
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,440
Is the monkey costume comical or realistic?

287
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
Because if it's comical, I don't think about,

288
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,320
but if I turned around in an office setting,

289
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,680
a gorilla that I actually don't think I would be

290
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
as scared about seeing in the wild, right?

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
But if I turned around and saw a gorilla in my office,

292
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,960
that might instill in me a bone deep lifelong fear.

293
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
No, because it's a costume.

294
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,440
One of my proudest achievements.

295
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,960
I got scared of a werewolf once,

296
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,640
and I'm still afraid of werewolves, Justin.

297
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Yes, but for me, one of my proudest achievements

298
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,400
in life is I've never been fooled by a gorilla costume, ever.

299
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,160
Not once, not for a second.

300
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,720
Happens to people on prank shows literally all the time.

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,480
Never happened to me.

302
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,120
So I wouldn't have a fear of this.

303
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
I need to drill down on something though,

304
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,080
and I think it's important to this question maybe,

305
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,600
but it's important to me definitely.

306
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,440
You say that your boss does this every year

307
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
during the free throw competition.

308
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,680
And then you say, how can I avoid being scared

309
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
like this next year?

310
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,200
But in the question itself, you make no mention

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,640
of being involved in a free throw competition.

312
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,000
It's like a wild reverse Chekhov's gun,

313
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,720
where like if the gun just emerged

314
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,120
from somebody's belly button, and it's like,

315
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
well, nobody's ever mentioned a gun before,

316
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,720
and there's just like suddenly a gun.

317
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,120
It seems very strange to me that you would not include

318
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
the context of free throw competition

319
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,840
in the initial question.

320
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,440
It's a mental association you're saying.

321
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,040
You're not afraid of the monkey costume.

322
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
You're afraid of how bad you're just gonna brick one up

323
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
there in the paint in this competition,

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,320
and you have associated that fear with the big monkey.

325
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,280
I can understand that.

326
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,080
I get it.

327
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,440
I'd feel the same way for sure.

328
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,720
Oh, hell yeah.

329
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm thinking about my gorilla courage now.

330
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,880
I think it's because of the gorilla on the front of the box

331
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
for Gorilla Munch, the Enviro Kids organic cereal.

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,840
I don't know if y'all have ever seen this gorilla,

333
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,880
but he's looking at a bowl of this cereal

334
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
and there's some strawberries in it

335
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
and there's a little banner letting you know

336
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,320
it is gluten-free and I'm sure the gorilla appreciates that.

337
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,360
And he just looks so chill and so happy

338
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,800
to just be close to this cereal.

339
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,720
And I think when I see the Rampage monster,

340
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,400
I see the King Kong, I see the Congo ones.

341
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,160
I just think of this gorilla and I'm like,

342
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,680
we have more in common than we have

343
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,960
that separates us, little guy.

344
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,920
Yeah, I guess that's beautiful.

345
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Yeah, so I guess we helped that one.

346
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,960
How's the Yahoo?

347
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,040
How's the Yahoo?

348
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,160
A lot of people sent this one in.

349
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,680
but I'm gonna call them Coco the gorilla.

351
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
Type this in on the keyboard.

352
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,680
Says, has anybody had sex in space

353
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,360
to see if conception works in space?

354
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,320
I did a little bit of cursory Googling.

355
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,840
In space, your blood pressure gets low.

356
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,320
And so, for those of us for whom a boner

357
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,800
is an important part of the sexual process,

358
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,040
I think we'd just be plumb out of luck

359
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,320
without the help of some sort of special space belt,

360
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,400
some sort of belt that these NASA scientists are working up.

361
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,760
You know they're deep in their labs,

362
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
like we gotta come up with a special belt.

363
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,720
But I don't think they cracked that one yet,

364
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,160
and so that's off the table.

365
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
And I'm sure I don't want to be normative.

366
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,920
There's lots of other options, right?

367
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,080
But I also think like it's pretty small up there

368
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,640
on like a ship, on this ISS, shuttle missions, no way.

369
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,280
It's the size of like a jet, right?

370
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,800
And that's a tough job to get some privacy up there

371
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,640
unless everybody's nasty.

372
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
And that's a lot to ask for a full flight crew.

373
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,720
Hey, hey, hey, you get up there.

374
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
Woo, launch went okay.

375
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,960
Wow, that was scary.

376
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
We went so fast.

377
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,600
We're like, okay, we're gonna get up there.

378
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Fast, we're like 70 miles above the surface of the Earth.

379
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,200
And that's kind of wild to think about.

380
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Wow, look at the space.

381
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,880
I'm getting kind of existentially freaked out.

382
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
Is everyone cool with like just doing it?

383
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,440
You don't have to participate, but I'm going to,

384
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,480
and you'll be close.

385
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
And there's no way to vent the stink.

386
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
There's no way.

387
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,520
Now, I did some quick Googling.

388
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,200
There have been, and not that sex should be relegated

389
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
to just married couples,

390
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,760
but there has been a married couple

391
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,800
that traveled together in space.

392
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,880
So, I mean, maybe they did it,

394
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,800
but here's the thing, let's broaden our definition.

395
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,040
That's very scientific, Travis.

396
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,240
I have a theory with evidence and that is maybe they did it.

397
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,640
They would have like, but okay.

398
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,760
What about hand stuff?

399
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,720
They would have to tell Houston.

400
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,320
I think they would have to tell Houston for science.

401
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,640
I think they would make it sexier not to tell Houston.

402
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,400
I don't know if they did or not,

403
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,400
but you know, when they got picked for the MISH,

404
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,840
there was some nasty boys and girls in Houston

405
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,880
who were like, so for scientific purposes,

406
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
while y'all up there, are you gonna,

407
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,560
oh, you know, don't make me say it.

408
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,320
Oh gosh, are you gonna space?

409
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,560
What's a good way, what's a good science way to put it?

410
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,040
Are you gonna copulate?

411
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,000
I asked them, Valerie, I asked them.

412
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,120
I did it.

413
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,840
He's just staring at me.

414
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
Give me my $5.

415
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,320
You said I wouldn't, but I did it.

416
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,880
I did it.

417
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,200
You think there's one idiot in Houston

418
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,280
where like every time they go off mic,

419
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,600
he's like, y'all gonna go boned?

420
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,560
Like, no, no, Derek, we're not.

421
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,360
For the last fucking time,

422
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
we're gonna get out and get some moss.

423
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,080
No, Derek, here's what I know

424
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
about space missions and science research.

425
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,760
We have done the most specific shit up there.

426
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm talking about fucking astronauts going up there,

427
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,920
chilling on the ISS for a hundred years

428
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,600
so they got a lot of time on their hands

429
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,920
and they're getting science missions from Houston

430
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,160
and they're like, what's on the docket today, Houston?

431
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,280
And Houston's like, oh, you're gonna take this donut

432
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,920
we sent up with you and spin it real fast

433
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,800
so we see what happens when you spin a donut real fast

434
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,640
because we've done everything else.

435
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
If we're there, are you telling me

436
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,600
that we haven't been at least a little bit curious

437
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,960
about like if we traveled into space and went into the stars,

438
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,960
if like making love would even be possible?

439
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,680
That's the thing, right?

440
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,840
Because if you're an astronaut, right?

441
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,720
You're, listen, science, exploration, blah, blah, blah.

442
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,880
But your dream is to be the first person

443
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
to do blank in space, right?

444
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,560
Like that's why you become, let's be honest,

445
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,080
that's why you became an astronaut.

446
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,960
You wanted to be the first person to do blank in space.

447
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,360
And I guarantee, listen, we all humans,

448
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,880
I guarantee someone has filled in that blank.

449
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,520
You know what I mean?

450
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,920
I don't think that's necessarily true, Travis.

451
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,520
I don't think that's true, my bud.

452
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,760
The suits are very heavy.

453
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,440
Like they're just super heavy

454
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,640
and the monitoring is unparalleled.

455
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,760
I do not think these people have a few minutes to,

456
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
like we sent you to space.

457
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,280
Like please focus on science for a second.

458
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Unless you're like one of the people in the ISS

459
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,640
who's of course sent there to live out their days

460
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
and their return.

461
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,000
It's space prison.

462
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
You are sent there when you do astronaut crime

463
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
and it's a great place I think to work out your sentence.

464
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
But it is, it's-

465
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,720
Living on the ISS does increase your chances

466
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,680
of meeting the doctor.

467
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
I mean, just like-

468
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,760
That's true.

469
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,520
Where is he more likely to show up?

470
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,640
Or they, excuse me,

471
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,160
where are they more likely to show up?

472
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,480
On the space station.

473
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,800
Here's another question.

474
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
Also, when you nut and push you backwards,

475
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,400
how's that supposed to work?

476
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,720
Go ahead, Justin.

477
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,440
I said my thing about when you nut, it pushes you backwards.

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
Look at this script.

479
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,640
Did we get a clean take though?

480
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,840
Could we get a couple different reads on that one?

481
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,040
Yeah, sure.

482
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,240
Well, when you nut, it push you backwards.

483
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,720
I don't know, y'all.

484
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,400
I don't know.

485
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,200
I don't know, y'all.

486
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,040
When you nut, wouldn't it push you backwards?

487
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,520
That's what I think from my own twisted skewed vision.

488
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,240
Now, Griffin, could you give us one,

489
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,760
like even you're nervous about saying it,

490
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,840
like even you're unsure it's an okay thing to say?

491
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,040
Yeah, sure.

492
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,040
When you nut, nevermind.

493
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,080
That was good.

494
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,280
It pushed you backwards.

495
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,440
Matt, could you give us one, like a really nerdy scientist?

496
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
Let me like the test out.

497
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,160
I have a theory that when you nut, it push you backward.

498
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,640
Oh, you sounded so much like dad for a second.

499
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,880
Yeah, it's actually scared me coming out of me.

500
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah, I hated that.

501
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
I can do one as our dad if you want.

502
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,600
Yeah, do one as our dad.

503
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,960
Well, when you nut, it push you backwards.

504
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,600
The worst.

505
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I work for a company where my co-workers travel

506
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,920
or work remotely so much.

507
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,720
Master Bruce, when you nut, it push you backwards.

508
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,200
So that was my cocaine.

509
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,800
So we can be pushed backwards.

510
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
Look outside the window of the space station.

511
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,480
There's no stars.

512
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,720
Why?

513
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,800
Because they're all in here in this recording booth

514
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,520
with Griffin, the master of impressions.

515
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,160
Speaking of impressions, when I was watching Shape of Water,

516
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,160
I don't know if you guys ever think this,

517
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
and not with this specific person,

518
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
but I thought for about 15 minutes while watching it

519
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
that I had a Michael Shannon.

520
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,880
And it was like I wanted to nurture it and nestle it

521
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,760
and kind of grow it, but by the end of the film,

522
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
it was gone from me.

523
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,800
I didn't have a Michael Shannon anymore.

524
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,200
I thought I had one, and it felt good.

525
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
It felt like a good part of the repertoire,

526
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,120
maybe not the most instantly recognizable,

527
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,000
but still something.

528
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,560
And then it left me, and I just wanted to share the loss.

529
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,520
Did you think about the time that we saw Michael Shannon?

530
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
We went out for drinks with Lynn.

531
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,280
I don't know if this is okay to tell this story on the show,

532
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,520
but we were having drinks and then all of a sudden

533
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,720
there was Julia Roberts, and she was standing at her-

534
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,680
It was not there for this.

535
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,880
Oh, okay.

536
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,320
It was not there for this one.

537
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
Julia Roberts came to our table and just said hi,

538
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
and we all said hi back.

539
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,120
And there was a moment of just like,

540
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,360
should we be greeting a person?

541
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,120
Should we shake her hand?

542
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,720
But it never came up because there was sort of just a vibe

543
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,160
that we're not supposed to touch Julia Roberts.

544
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,040
Not allowed to, definitely shouldn't.

545
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,880
And then I think we ran into Matthew Broderick

546
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,720
and Nathan Lane, and at that point I was like,

547
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
I have to get the fuck out of here.

548
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,840
I'm having full blown escape to Margaritaville,

549
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,640
red carpet, panic, I need to go.

550
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,680
And we were walking out and there was Michael Shannon

551
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,320
by the door.

552
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,840
And he walked up to Griffin and he was like,

553
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,360
hey, you seem nervous, are you okay?

554
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,360
That's not bad.

555
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,600
But I saw him and I just bolted.

556
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,760
I was just like, can't, can't, too much, too many.

557
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,200
Come back, that sounds like a lot.

558
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
Justin, is Michael Shannon here with us now?

559
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,080
Can we speak?

560
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,680
Let me see who's in here.

561
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,680
Bring me the fish man.

562
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,720
Can you say, oh, you know what would be a fun thing

563
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,400
to hear Michael say, Mr. Shannon?

564
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,320
Okay, I got it, no, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

565
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,800
When you nut in space it, push backwards.

566
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Now Griffin, could you give me a reading of that

567
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
as Vincent D'Onofrio for Men in Black?

568
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,040
Could I do one as the fish man instead?

569
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,840
Oh, yes, yeah.

570
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,800
I want to do this question.

571
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,080
I do want to briefly apologize for the secondhand panic

572
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
that we saw so many people tweet about

573
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,360
listening to our episode 400 of the show.

574
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,440
Like there was some legit, like we triggered

575
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,480
some legit brutal anxiety reactions.

576
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,320
I have not been able to listen to it since we recorded it.

577
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,040
So I get it.

578
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,280
If you finish it, there's an arc of triumph there.

579
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,120
There's an arc de triumph.

580
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,240
It is very, it is a tale of overcoming the fears

581
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
that live in all of us.

582
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
And when I say all of us, I mean the three of us

583
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
and you at home listening.

584
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,800
It's all about overcoming your fears

585
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,240
until eventually you get dunked on real hard by Al Roker.

586
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,000
All right, we're gonna do this question.

587
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,640
Thank you, another thanks, by the way, ancillary thanks

588
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
for everybody who tweeted about Al Roker

589
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
or letting him know about Roker Poker.

590
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,240
That makes me feel good and not scared for my like career.

591
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
So cool and great.

592
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Cool, great.

593
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,360
And again, apologies to Mary Lou Hinder.

594
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,120
I work for a company where my coworkers travel

595
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,720
or work remotely so much

596
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,120
that I'm often the only one in the office.

597
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,800
My job requires my physical presence.

598
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,280
So I'm wondering how can I take best advantage

599
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,480
of having this big downtown office all to myself?

600
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Keep in mind, a coworker could show up at any moment.

601
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,600
That's from Unsupervised in Seattle.

602
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,400
You know, I used to be in this scenario.

603
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,880
When I was a disc jockey, a board operator technically

604
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,280
for the radio station over the weekends,

605
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,680
I would go in on the weekends and like literally

606
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,360
you're just a human being there

607
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,480
to make sure Brad Paisley keeps coming

608
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,920
and that there's no silence.

609
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,000
No, I'm sorry.

610
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,920
And when he does, he's like pushing backwards.

611
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,040
And I got too deep down the rabbit hole.

612
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,280
I ended up like bringing in my PlayStation 2

613
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
and hooking it up to the TV

614
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,920
and getting myself a whole little game station

615
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,760
and then people would come in and I'd have to look at him

616
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,600
and just like, listen, I'm busted.

617
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
You got me.

618
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,600
This is what I do.

619
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,880
You've got me.

620
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,960
So it has to look like work, I guess is what I'm saying.

621
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,000
Or be able to feasibly look like you're working.

622
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,080
They didn't cover if they have to work.

623
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,080
Like how much, you know, like everybody's got a job

624
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,320
that has a job, but do you have to work the whole time

625
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,560
or could you do your job in like half of the time?

626
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,600
You know, season one and two curmudgeonly Travis would say,

627
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,760
here's how you fill the time, you do your job.

628
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,480
But here's what season three Travis is gonna say.

629
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,280
Maybe every day you switch your desk with someone else's.

630
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,600
And I mean, everything in it, everything on top of it, right?

631
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,240
And then you just keep doing that every day

632
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,920
until everybody's desk is in a different place in the office.

633
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,840
Oh, fun.

634
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,720
Right?

635
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,480
I love these fucking pranks.

636
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
People come in and they're like, oh, oh yeah,

637
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,000
no, I guess I was over here.

638
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,880
And that's for you.

639
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,200
Videos of office pranks is my absolute best videos

640
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,520
that I can find putting post-it notes all over somebody's shit

641
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,240
or like flushing somebody's pictures of their family

642
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,960
down the toilet or selling all the computers

643
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
in the office for drugs.

644
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,400
Like pranks is my best.

645
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,800
That was my least favorite episode of The Office, by the way,

646
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,960
when Jim sold all the computers for drugs.

647
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,180
Yeah.

648
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:58,180
My good video on the phone is, I did Facebook today

649
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,540
and there was a video of a woman who yelled at a bear

650
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,340
to tell the bear to go away and was mean to the bear

651
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,820
and then said, I'm gonna spray you with pepper spray.

652
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,660
And then she pepper sprayed the bear

653
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,820
and then the bear destroyed her kayak as she watched

654
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,340
and begged the bear to stop, even though she was so mean.

655
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,380
The bear to stop, even though she was being mean to the bear

656
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,820
and she deserved it.

657
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,740
And then the bear destroyed her kayak

658
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,420
and she screamed at the bear.

659
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,500
Travis, what's your good video?

660
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,460
But I do want to point out why she posts that, lady.

661
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,820
Hey lady, your kayak got wrecked and you were mean to a bear

662
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,700
and you were like, save, post to Facebook.

663
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,580
I don't understand.

664
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,580
I just like the ones where like the kids behave like adults

665
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,860
and they like where kid talks and it's like,

666
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,460
you understand English.

667
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,500
Kids, kid driving on the highway.

668
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,700
Yeah, kid paying taxes.

669
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,540
Yeah, I love it.

670
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,780
I like the ones that are kids reacting to things

671
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,180
that I knew about, but they don't know about it

672
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,020
because I'm gonna die before they know.

673
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,460
Those drive me.

674
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,380
And they say it like, who is this?

675
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,140
This is the ape Donkey Kong.

676
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,500
I hate his barrels.

677
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,340
Justin will die before me.

678
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,260
And they say that every day.

679
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,140
Every one of them.

680
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,660
Love that.

681
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,380
Who is this?

682
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,380
This is looking at a Game Boy and they're like,

683
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,740
who could ever love this?

684
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,420
Probably someone who's gonna die before me.

685
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,940
If you know what this is, you're gonna die before I will.

686
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,220
Who is this music?

687
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,180
I don't like it.

688
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,660
Bel Biv Devo, I don't even know who that is.

689
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,580
Justin, your days are numbered.

690
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,620
I will live forever.

691
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,500
I want them to do videos like that

692
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,980
where they have like college kids who are like,

693
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,100
who did Nirvana?

694
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,020
But then next to the camera pans over

695
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,700
and there's like a three-year-old is like,

696
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,900
what is Snapchat?

697
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,620
And then at the same time the college student's like,

698
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,180
oh fuck, it's a circle, huh?

699
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,460
It's like a circle?

700
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,180
Got it.

701
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,660
Perfect.

702
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,260
I would like to see a version of that video

703
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,460
where it's me reacting to things that did happen

704
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,540
while I was also in high school

705
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,460
but I just was never privy to them

706
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,140
because I wasn't cool enough.

707
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,820
When it's like they play music that was popular in like 1996

708
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,500
and I'm like, I don't know what this is.

709
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,860
I do not know what this is.

710
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,060
Boy, we really got away from that question

711
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,740
but that happens sometimes here

712
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,180
on My Brother, My Brother and Me

713
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,660
and that's the kind of like twisted, again,

714
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,020
South Park humor that we ask you

715
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,860
to maybe think about supporting the show

716
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,780
with a donation by joining the MaxFun support circle.

717
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,020
Real quick.

718
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,860
You can go to maximumfun.org slash donate

719
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,180
and find out all the hot deets on that.

720
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,220
Let me tell you how it works.

721
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,580
So it works like this.

722
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,860
You go to maximumfun.org slash donate.

723
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,540
Then you pick a level that you are able to afford every month

724
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,940
and listen, that's important.

725
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,540
We know sometimes the spirit can move you

726
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,260
and you know what?

727
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,580
Sometimes you pick an aspirational level.

728
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,140
Don't do that.

729
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,100
We don't want you to do that.

730
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,700
We want you to pick a level you can afford

731
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,780
and it starts at just $5 a month.

732
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,260
You pick that level and then you pick which shows you listen to

733
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,100
and that is where your money goes.

734
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,460
MaxFun takes a small percentage to cover their overhead costs

735
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,820
but mostly you are directly supporting the shows

736
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,900
and the hosts that you love.

737
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
It's, I don't know of another system

738
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,940
that works exactly like this.

739
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,860
I mean, there's probably some crowdfunding ones.

740
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:23,940
But literally any sort of pledge based public radio system

741
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,100
works pretty close to this.

742
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,020
Justin, $5 a month.

743
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,700
Somebody joins us at that level.

744
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,820
What are they gonna get?

745
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,540
You're gonna get, I believe it's over 100 hours

746
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,100
of bonus content.

747
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,540
I actually calculated it this year.

748
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,380
I think it's like more like 125.

749
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,740
So like we're talking five days of bonus content for you to enjoy.

750
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,420
And that's from all the shows on the network throughout time.

751
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,060
So there's bonus MBMBAMs in there.

752
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,540
This year we did all our old great segments

753
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,300
like what would you even do if and monthly observances.

754
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,420
We got lots of bonus MBMBAMs on there.

755
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,940
This is our eighth year doing this.

756
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,180
But then there's bonus JJGOs.

757
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,380
There's bonus AdventureZones.

758
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,300
There's bonus Schmaners.

759
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,020
There's bonus everything.

760
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,820
Bonus Jonas.

761
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,220
Bonus Jonas is in there.

762
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,620
There's an AdventureZone, by the way.

763
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,300
Well, the one we did this year is really fun.

764
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,540
It's for Sherlock Holmes and a vampire

765
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,700
that is one of the aforementioned Sherlock Holmes.

766
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,300
The Justin DM that was really fun.

767
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,860
But there's also AdventureZone Nights,

768
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,100
an arc with characters that you can only hear

769
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,060
in the bonus content,

770
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,780
including special guest Lin-Manuel Miranda

771
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,460
playing Dungeons and Dragons with us,

772
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,020
I believe for the only time in his entire life.

773
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,540
Right, so $10 a month.

774
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,020
You're gonna get everything at the lower,

775
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,900
every time you step up,

776
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,380
you get everything in the lower level.

777
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
So at $10 a month, you get the bonus content

778
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,380
and you get a drive exclusive enamel pin

779
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,900
designed by Megan Lynn Cott.

780
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,220
We did this last year.

781
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,540
This year there's new designs for all the Max Fun shows

782
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,700
and you get to pick your favorite when you make the donation

783
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,940
and you get a Max Fun membership card.

784
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,660
The pin for us this year is based on our battle cry,

785
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,540
stronger together.

786
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,260
You can see it at maximumfun.org.donate

787
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,220
when you become a member.

788
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
It is powerful and it lets people know

789
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,340
sort of what you're all about.

790
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,940
And I believe I've seen some people talking about like,

791
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,540
oh, I can't choose between the pins.

792
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,820
If we hit our goal of 25,000 new and upgrading donors,

793
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,620
they will make pins available for purchase

794
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,660
for whoever wants them.

795
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,780
For people who donate at the $10 per month level.

796
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,100
Travis, $20 per month.

797
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,580
At $20 per month, you're gonna get the bonus content,

798
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,620
you're gonna get the pin,

799
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,780
but you're also gonna get the Max Fun family cookbook,

800
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,340
which is lovingly curated with recipes for Max Fun hosts,

801
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,060
anywhere from cocktails to desserts

802
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,340
and everywhere in between.

803
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,420
And also included in that,

804
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,260
you're gonna get a set of space themed cookie cutters

805
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,540
for you to use while I guess you make cocktails, you know.

806
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,580
Justin put in a recipe from our mom's chest bars

807
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,500
that were very, very, very tasty.

808
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,620
Dad apparently let us know that the recipe

809
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,260
for spaghetti-geddon, spaghetti-geddon is in the book.

810
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,500
Rachel put in her chili recipe

811
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,180
that we've talked about on Wonderful before.

812
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,100
So we got a lot of stuff in there

813
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,580
that you're gonna really, really get down on.

814
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,700
If you wanna make a like podcast comedy magic,

815
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,380
you gotta eat the spaghetti.

816
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,500
It is not as funny as you remember it.

817
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,140
So we have higher levels too.

818
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,020
If you have the means and you wanna go in

819
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,340
on those higher levels, we sure do appreciate you.

820
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,340
But really we don't care what level you donate at.

821
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,420
All that we care about is that you show your support

822
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,820
in whatever capacity you are able to show it.

823
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,780
It means a lot to us.

824
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,500
It helps support us and the network.

825
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,300
It has helped us turn this into a career.

826
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,540
This is Travis's full-time job.

827
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,500
This is what allowed dad to retire from the radio station.

828
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,420
The radio station last year

829
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,300
where he was working really bonkers hours

830
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,740
and was kind of unhappy.

831
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,340
And now he's just doing this full-time.

832
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,300
Now he's just doing Adventure Zone full-time.

833
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,100
And let me also be clear.

834
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,740
That's really amazing.

835
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,220
This is my only full-time job, but Justin and Griffin,

836
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,980
I mean, even though you also work at Polygon,

837
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,900
this is also full-time jobs for you.

838
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,860
I mean, between recording this show,

839
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,580
putting the Yahoos together and putting questions together

840
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,140
and Adventure Zone and editing Adventure Zone

841
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,580
and Justin doing Sawbones,

842
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,100
like we are all podcasting full-time at this point

843
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,900
and the reason for that.

844
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,460
Yes.

845
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,740
I'm not allowed to stop.

846
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,940
Yeah, ever.

847
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,660
No, it's important because I will say that not only,

848
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,380
listen, I would be lying if I said

849
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,380
the money didn't help make this a full-time job.

850
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,420
That is how jobs work.

851
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,940
But more than that,

852
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,380
it is knowing how much this matters to people,

853
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,860
directly seeing people every year tweet like,

854
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,740
I supported NBNB AM because I love it, right?

855
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,580
That lets us know, think about it this way.

856
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,540
We've been doing it eight years and we have 400 episodes,

857
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,660
which averages out to like 50 episodes a year.

858
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,060
So we aren't missing episodes when we can help it.

859
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,940
And the reason is we know how important it is to people.

860
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,220
We know that this show matters.

861
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,260
So we make it a priority.

862
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,140
We treat it like a job and that's important.

863
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,380
And it's a two-way street because when you donate,

864
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,340
you know that you have helped support the show.

865
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,500
Every time you listen to it from that point on,

866
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,580
you will know that you're part of the supporting team

867
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,220
and that's cool for you also,

868
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,140
as well as receiving these great gifts.

869
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,620
So maximumfund.orgs.donate.

870
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,740
Pick the level that's right for you.

871
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,420
Pick the shows that you listen to,

872
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,620
where you want your money to go.

873
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,100
And thank you all so, so, so much.

874
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,020
I wanna say two more quick things before we move on.

875
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,620
And that is it's important to note

876
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,460
that the goal is not just new donors.

877
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,740
It's also upgrading donors.

878
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,060
So if you've been a member before, thank you so much.

879
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,420
Can't say thank you enough.

880
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,820
But if you started listening to more shows over the year

881
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,140
and we have added a whole bunch of new shows

882
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,700
or maybe just the shows that you listen to

883
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,340
have filled an even more important part of your life,

884
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,700
then maybe think about it's time to move from five to 10

885
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,020
or 10 to 20 or whatever you wanna do.

886
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,380
And also, we also understand

887
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,740
that not everybody can afford it.

888
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,780
We totally get that.

889
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,620
That is very reasonable and we don't begrudge that at all.

890
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,180
But you can still help by going on social media

891
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,620
and spreading the word saying like,

892
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,340
hey, it's hashtag Max Fund Drive.

893
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,220
Make sure you go to maximumfund.orgs.donate

894
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
and consider supporting the shows you love.

895
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,140
That helps, that means the world to us.

896
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,540
So just there's so many ways you can help

897
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,740
and we really appreciate it.

898
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,460
How about a Yahoo?

899
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,980
Do it, coward.

900
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:30,900
Okay.

901
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,260
This one's sent by Morgan Davey.

902
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,580
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey, it's Yahoo Answers user.

903
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,540
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

904
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,820
I refuse, I refuse.

905
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,420
You have an avatar, you've gotta have a name.

906
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,100
You gotta have a fucking name.

907
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,400
Shit.

908
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,680
What?

909
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,580
It just won't load.

910
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,500
I'll call him Braxton.

911
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,940
Okay, for a second, Griffin,

912
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,300
I thought you were saying I'll call them.

913
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,500
Okay.

914
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,540
I'll call him, hold on.

915
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,180
Hey, who's this?

916
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,340
Yahoo weirdo, what's your name?

917
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,140
Braxton?

918
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,860
Great.

919
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,460
Braxton asks, Billy Joel costume?

920
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,540
I am doing a report as Billy Joel.

921
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,060
We're gonna get the fuck into that

922
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,940
before we get into the rest of the question, but okay.

923
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,820
I have to give a speech and dress up like Billy.

924
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,420
If I, you, would have any good suggestions

925
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,180
for what I could wear, that'd be great, thanks.

926
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,560
Okay.

927
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,460
What is the Billy Joel report that you're giving?

928
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,060
Is it a history class and you're doing like,

929
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,700
oh, we didn't start the fire and it's just like,

930
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,500
George Washington was the first president.

931
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,980
He did his best and he had wooden teeth.

932
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,480
Hey.

933
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,980
Or maybe it's a report on Billy Joel as Billy Joel.

934
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,780
Like you're Hal Holbrook of Billy Joel.

935
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,980
I love it.

936
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,140
Sir, this is US history.

937
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,980
Yeah, Billy Joel made US history

938
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,140
when he released his great album.

939
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,060
I was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

940
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,820
And one thing I know about me is I didn't start any fires.

941
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,180
The year was 1889.

942
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,340
I fell in love with an uptown girl.

943
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,260
Billy Joel costume.

944
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,740
What's gonna Billy Joel get across?

945
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,180
I remember when I was born and for the longest time,

946
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,900
I was a baby.

947
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,940
All right.

948
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,180
But Travis is sort of writing the report for them,

949
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,500
which is gonna be a very helpful sort of thing

950
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,860
when they listen to this episode,

951
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,660
but they're not gonna know what to wear to be Billy Joel.

952
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,340
Is a t-shirt that you have written,

953
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,340
I am Billy Joel on it, out of the question.

954
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,260
Hey, which Billy?

955
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,900
There's a lot of different Billys.

956
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,980
Nowadays, you're gonna go with kind of a black jacket,

957
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,820
black pants, black t-shirt,

958
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,580
black sunglasses, shaved head kind of Billy.

959
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,660
Now, if you wanna go back to the days,

960
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,780
get yourself some-

961
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,100
White wall tires.

962
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,820
Yes, white wall tires, so like big shoes.

963
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,060
See like Billy was into big shoes

964
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,580
and he kind of rolled up packs of cigarettes in his sleeves

965
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,460
and he had acid wash jeans, which were huge.

966
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,700
The still rock and roll to me look is very good.

967
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,020
It's like a bright reddish orange jacket,

968
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,620
white tie, black shirt, and just gigantic hair.

969
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,020
Just the biggest, poofiest, very, very big hair.

970
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,020
We could go early 90s, big colorful windbreaker,

971
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,100
hyper color tank top, JNCO shorts,

972
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,300
and sort of Birkenstock sandals.

973
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,660
And that's when he was like,

974
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,940
y'all remember that short period

975
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,540
where he had his own little sort of like musical alter ego

976
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,060
of max cool jazz?

977
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,740
So you could do the very short sort of max cool jazz phase

978
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,980
and that could be like a fun way of covering it.

979
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,460
My favorite part of the max cool jazz phase

980
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,980
is when the neighborhood kids would be like,

981
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,460
hey mister, what's the max stand for?

982
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,140
And he'd look at me with lower sunglasses

983
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,220
and he'd say, maximum.

984
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,940
And then they would know that he was playing cool jazz

985
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,340
to the very limit of the art form.

986
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,300
That's the coolest jazz we've ever heard.

987
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,260
So show up in your max cool jazz cosplay

988
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,340
and bring out your theremin, which people will be like,

989
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,500
he'd be on the stage and they'd be like, piano man!

990
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,420
And he'd be like, I don't have my piano.

991
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,220
I don't have my piano.

992
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,740
I'm the theremin man now, or thereman.

993
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,060
I'm the theremin man, max cool jazz.

994
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,020
And here's my new song, Space Aliens

995
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,700
is the name of my new song, here it goes.

996
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,620
Is there a question mark at the end of that, Griffin?

997
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,940
It's more of like a surprise.

998
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,980
Oh, okay.

999
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,620
Yeah, so I think really the iconic for me

1000
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,860
is the black jacket, black shirt,

1001
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,780
black pants, shaved head, sunglasses.

1002
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,260
Maybe you have like a, but that,

1003
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,540
people might think that you're like a cool hit man,

1004
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,820
which is aesthetic.

1005
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,660
And so I think you need even more.

1006
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,220
Maybe you have a small piano that you bring out there

1007
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,260
with you just so people know.

1008
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,380
What if you built a diorama that you stood in

1009
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,940
that demonstrated you walking by the river of dreams, right?

1010
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,540
And it was like, oh, okay, clearly

1011
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,060
that's the river of dreams.

1012
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,500
And you're walking by it.

1013
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,860
Yes, we can do this.

1014
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,540
All, Deb, all black, shaved head, loving it.

1015
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,260
You walk into the classroom soaking wet.

1016
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,340
Just douse yourself in the bathroom.

1017
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,740
And also you're carrying a big plate of spaghetti.

1018
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,020
And people will be like, what?

1019
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,620
And you'll be like, looks like I fell into the river of dreams

1020
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,500
while on my way to the scenes from Italian restaurant.

1021
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,820
Oh yeah, walk into your classroom and say,

1022
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,980
who wants some red and who wants some white?

1023
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,540
And just start pouring some wine for your classmates.

1024
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,220
For your high school class and that's good.

1025
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,460
And, but I'll tell you what, you walk in that class

1026
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,380
dressed up like Billy Joel, soaking wet

1027
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,260
with a plate of spaghetti.

1028
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,180
People will be like, that's Billy Joel.

1029
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,980
You fell in the river of dreams on his way to the river,

1030
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,740
on the way to the Italian restaurant.

1031
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,380
I know what you're doing.

1032
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,460
That's Dr. William Joel if I've ever seen him.

1033
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,060
I'm trying to have fun with you guys,

1034
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,820
but Travis reminded me that it's still rock and roll to me.

1035
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,580
It makes me so angry.

1036
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,420
Do you mean the song in which Billy Joel has a conversation

1037
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,020
with himself about rock and roll

1038
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,540
and whether rock and roll is still itself rock and roll?

1039
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,900
Yeah, it's so hot.

1040
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,580
It's just, you read the lyrics and he says like,

1041
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,100
nowadays you can't be too sentimental.

1042
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,300
Your best bet's a true baby blue continental,

1043
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,900
hot funk, cool punk.

1044
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,300
Even if it's old junk, it's still rock and roll to me.

1045
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,180
It is so, I love a lot of Billy Joel songs

1046
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,700
and I do not mean to dunk on the man.

1047
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,460
It is wild to me that he wrote that

1048
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,700
and he looked at it and he's like, that's a song.

1049
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,260
And then he took it to other people with instruments

1050
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,060
and they were like, you got a song on your hands, Bill.

1051
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,060
And then they put it out and then America was like,

1052
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,500
what am I hearing?

1053
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,380
Is this a song?

1054
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,460
Because it sounds like a song.

1055
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,060
And I'm the, I feel like the lone man on an island

1056
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,060
who's like, it's not a song.

1057
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,660
There's nothing, he said nothing.

1058
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,220
It fills in.

1059
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:07,860
What are we doing?

1060
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,380
It fits into a category of song that is one of my favorites.

1061
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,300
Oh, we're going to talk about this again.

1062
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,540
I should warn you before you go too deep on this,

1063
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,300
we talked about this exact category on our last song episode.

1064
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,940
Songs that reaffirm that rock and roll still exists.

1065
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,140
Yes, we can.

1066
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,460
Oh no, well my new favorite one,

1067
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,660
because I was listening to the new train song

1068
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,700
that is set to the music of No Joke, Heart and Soul.

1069
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,940
Yes, what are they doing?

1070
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,340
You didn't do a song.

1071
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,420
He forgot how to play piano.

1072
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,820
And the song is a self-referential song

1073
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,260
that references the song in third person

1074
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,820
that says, hey, play that song.

1075
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,340
Not this song, but that song.

1076
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,900
That other song, it's like it is train's version

1077
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,380
of the greatest song in the world by Tenacious D.

1078
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,420
It's not the greatest song in the world.

1079
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,060
It's just a tribute.

1080
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,500
It's just a tribute to that.

1081
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,700
And it made me start thinking about

1082
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,900
how many songs there are that are like,

1083
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,380
hey, Mr. DJ, put that record on.

1084
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,140
I want to dance with my baby.

1085
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:07,700
What record?

1086
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,500
You know the what.

1087
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,980
You know what I'm talking about.

1088
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,940
I'm talking about Max Cool Jazz's Kind of Blue 2.

1089
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,540
I think you can wear whatever you want

1090
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,220
for your Billy Joel report.

1091
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,060
But let me paint the scene.

1092
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,740
Teachers in front of class and they're like,

1093
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,180
Dylan, Dylan, it's time for your report.

1094
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,620
Has anybody seen Dylan?

1095
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:31,300
And then you smash it through the wall in your car.

1096
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,700
Griffin, we went the whole bit

1097
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,700
without referencing the most obvious joke.

1098
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,980
And then you get out and you're like,

1099
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,260
what's up, everybody?

1100
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,380
So, piano man.

1101
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,420
We went the whole bit without mentioning

1102
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,260
that he was married to somebody from West Virginia

1103
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,060
that we grew up with.

1104
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,060
And then he crashed his car

1105
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,060
into three houses in two years.

1106
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,940
Yeah, but I guess I'm, okay.

1107
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,500
Well, anyway, so that's it for that bit.

1108
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,140
Billy Joel?

1109
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,940
Hey, it's Billy Joel.

1110
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,980
I want him on.

1111
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,480
Joel.

1112
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:10,600
Jazz.

1113
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,700
I want him on.

1114
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,500
River of Dreams.

1115
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,220
Uptown.

1116
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,740
Uptown.

1117
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,140
This one isn't, real quick,

1118
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,220
this isn't for the Munch Squad specifically,

1119
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,340
but it is part of the podcast.

1120
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,060
Welcome to Munch Squad.

1121
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,380
It's a podcast within a podcast about what's hot,

1122
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,460
what's new in the world of fast food.

1123
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,580
Want to say, big Munch Squad, congratulations to Brad Reed.

1124
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,660
Just got promoted to chief development officer

1125
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,540
over at Captain D's.

1126
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,620
So congrats, Brad.

1127
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,020
He is moving up after being vice president

1128
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,740
of franchise operations.

1129
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,060
How do they not fucking call that like first mate

1130
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,340
in charge of development?

1131
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,980
You know what I mean?

1132
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,700
Well, because it's a publicly traded company, Travis.

1133
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,060
I think they probably want to handle things

1134
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,820
like other normal ones.

1135
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,300
No, I want to talk about Zaxby's.

1136
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,060
I literally don't know what word you just said, my friend.

1137
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,620
That's fine.

1138
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,380
Zaxby's is a chicken chain.

1139
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,260
Run by aliens.

1140
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,700
In the south.

1141
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,100
Hello, I am Zaxby.

1142
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:14,340
We have zapped your small birds with our laser guns.

1143
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,740
Mr. Joel.

1144
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,740
Mr. Joel, the Earth's last hope.

1145
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,420
Billy Joel, you'll never stop us now.

1146
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,740
What's that new sound?

1147
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,340
It's actually not a new sound.

1148
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,540
This isn't rock and roll.

1149
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,380
This isn't rock and roll.

1150
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,260
It is to me.

1151
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,780
Well, Bill, you can't just say that.

1152
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,220
Anyway, Zaxby's is a chicken.

1153
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,100
Who's that champion in the car with whitewalled tires?

1154
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,940
And why is he driving at our restaurant

1155
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,300
so fast and recklessly?

1156
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,460
Slow down, Mr. Joel.

1157
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,060
No, it's a chicken chain in the south.

1158
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:49,780
It's very good.

1159
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,340
I only get to enjoy it when I'm headed to the beach

1160
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,380
to get on island time.

1161
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,500
Me and the Smurls will always make a point.

1162
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,340
Well, I kind of bully them into it.

1163
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,140
They have a of driving through a Zaxby's.

1164
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,580
Not driving through a Zaxby's.

1165
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,540
I'm not Billy Joel.

1166
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,260
Driving to a Zaxby's.

1167
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,020
Can we leave Mr. Joel alone?

1168
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,420
We broke the seventh seal.

1169
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,340
The horn's on high blue.

1170
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,340
And then we knew that there were only jokes

1171
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,500
we were going to tell for the rest of the episode.

1172
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:16,740
Okay.

1173
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:17,860
Okay.

1174
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:24,740
Zaxby's has good news for Zaxby's fans.

1175
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:32,020
The zenzational, the zenzation salad is returning to Zaxby's

1176
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:32,900
for a limited time.

1177
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,340
My teeth already fucking hurt.

1178
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,500
And I've already only done it a couple of times.

1179
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,420
As requested by thousands of fans,

1180
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,660
Zaxby's is bringing back the zenzation salad

1181
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:47,220
at all Zaxby's locations in 17 states from April 2nd.

1182
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,460
Okay.

1183
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,300
So you've only missed a few days of it to July 1st

1184
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,500
with bright flavors and bold textures.

1185
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,020
The zenzation salad.

1186
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,500
Oh, God.

1187
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,020
It's really getting uncomfortable now.

1188
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,180
Guys, like make Z's over and over again.

1189
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:00,900
It really starts to get.

1190
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,260
No, I was in speech therapy.

1191
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:02,580
I know.

1192
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,260
Bad mouth feel.

1193
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:09,860
Combines indescribably great ingredients with Asian flair.

1194
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,940
Not a good word to describe food.

1195
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,300
Yeah.

1196
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,220
Indescribably great.

1197
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,820
But what's in it, Zaxby's?

1198
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,180
I wish I could tell you.

1199
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,580
We don't even know.

1200
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,580
There are no words in your human tongue.

1201
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,300
The zenzation salad is our most frequently requested

1202
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,180
limited time offer item, says Stephanie Gamble,

1203
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,940
vice president of menu innovation.

1204
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,860
And we continue to bring it back because guests love it.

1205
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,060
I can't begin to tell you how many times we've heard.

1206
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,180
I don't even eat salads, but I love the zenzation.

1207
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,300
So wait.

1208
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,420
Finally, a salad for people that wouldn't touch a salad

1209
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,260
with their neighbor's fork.

1210
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,460
They wouldn't get near it.

1211
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,900
But now you've got the one salad, the zenzation.

1212
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,460
It's been about four minutes now since I found out

1213
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,460
we were doing a salad one.

1214
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,340
And now my mind won't stop racing

1215
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,420
thinking of what they have put on this

1216
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,820
to make the texture so indescribable.

1217
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,060
I'm like, I'm thinking Takis.

1218
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,940
I'm thinking this one's maybe got Takis.

1219
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,740
So the zenzation provides sweet and savory flavors

1220
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:32,180
like sesame, pineapple, orange juice, ginger, garlic,

1221
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:39,540
soy, rice vinegar, honey, and brown sugar.

1222
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,260
And great textures from hand chopped lettuces,

1223
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,780
crispy wontons, crunchy Asian slaw, and a veggie roll.

1224
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,380
Add Zaxby's signature chicken fingers for a salad

1225
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,540
that's a perfect combination of the vibrant and the familiar.

1226
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,020
The reason I wanted to highlight this,

1227
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,540
and it's also for the quote that's coming up after this,

1228
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,900
but the reason I wanted to highlight this,

1229
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,860
they have not given you folks a list of ingredients.

1230
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,740
I want to make sure we're all on the same page here.

1231
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,900
You asked what was in the salad,

1232
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,860
and Zaxby's turn from its grim work

1233
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,060
looked you dead in the eye

1234
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,060
and gave you a list of different feelings

1235
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,500
that you're going to experience while consuming the salad.

1236
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,460
They're describing the salad from your point of view,

1237
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,820
not telling you what goes to create the flavors

1238
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,300
of sesame, pineapple, orange juice, ginger, garlic, soy,

1239
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,220
rice vinegar, honey, and brown sugar.

1240
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,900
They just have those flavors.

1241
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,660
Well, it's indescribable.

1242
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,020
There's so much fluid.

1243
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,740
This sounds all right.

1244
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,460
It sounds like a nice little Asian salad with chicken on it,

1245
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,180
and also there's some sort of spring roll in there,

1246
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,900
and that's kind of wild.

1247
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,940
But okay, Zaxby's, I'll play it with me.

1248
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,940
And I understand there's just a lot

1249
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,780
of sort of liquid content in there.

1250
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,620
I'm wondering if this is a sort of cold soup, a gazpacho.

1251
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,300
So here's the quote,

1252
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,580
and I know what you're wondering to yourself.

1253
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,740
Why doesn't Zaxby's offer this?

1254
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,380
If people love the Zenzation so much,

1255
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,500
why doesn't Zaxby's just offer it year round,

1256
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,460
like they do with the birthday cake milkshake, for example?

1257
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,620
The answer is this.

1258
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,260
For the Zenzation, Gamble says,

1259
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,540
we use four unique ingredients that must be inventoried,

1260
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,100
prepped, and monitored daily.

1261
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,600
What?

1262
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,180
The build is a different process than our typical salads,

1263
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,380
and it requires time.

1264
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,540
And it requires training and diligent reinforcement.

1265
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,040
What?

1266
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,460
Or it'll escape.

1267
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,540
Someone said we got a fucking pineapple thief on our hands.

1268
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,900
You think we can truck with a fucking salad burglar around?

1269
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,860
Scrubble, scrubble.

1270
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,700
Scrubble, scrubble.

1271
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,100
Give me that rice vinegar.

1272
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,860
You got fucking J.K. Simmons to come in

1273
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,420
and throw chicken fingers at people

1274
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,060
when they didn't diligently make the salad good enough.

1275
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,660
But it's worth it, as there's nothing more rewarding

1276
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,420
than bringing back a fan favorite

1277
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,020
and making our guests happy.

1278
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,820
So what they're saying is like, we could do this year round.

1279
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,540
It's very hard, and we're tired here at Zaxby's,

1280
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,540
and we'd rather not do it all the time.

1281
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,460
This is exhausting, what you're asking us to do right now.

1282
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,660
You know how big of a favor you're asking us to do

1283
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,060
by bringing back this salad, and yet you persist.

1284
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,980
It's like, I wish every fast food restaurant

1285
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,500
was this upfront about it.

1286
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,980
Like yeah, Szechuan sauce is back.

1287
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,260
We're not looking forward to it,

1288
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,540
because last time we tried this,

1289
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,780
a bunch of fucking nerds tried to burn down

1290
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,620
13 of our establishments.

1291
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,780
So we'll do the Szechuan sauce at great cost to ourselves,

1292
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,100
but like somebody brought a fucking sword

1293
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,180
into one of our restaurants last time.

1294
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,980
So we're not so wild about it, you have to understand.

1295
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,780
And those are just the people

1296
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,100
that didn't have a concealed carry sword license.

1297
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,820
There's probably a lot of undercover swords.

1298
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,940
I said they were cosplaying Rick and Morty,

1299
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,580
but they had swords, so I don't know, man.

1300
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,060
One last note here, Zaxby's does suggest,

1301
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,900
I know what you're saying, what about pairing?

1302
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,220
The entree with something.

1303
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,740
Zaxby's suggests pairing the,

1304
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,060
we got the Zamalier over here,

1305
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,940
and he suggests pairing the Zenzation salad

1306
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,220
with the exclusive Coca-Cola Freestyle mix,

1307
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,260
Southern Peach Fizzle.

1308
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,980
So in case you're looking for a pairing recommendation,

1309
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,700
that is what our Zamalier recommends,

1310
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,300
you of course are free to make your own choice.

1311
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,260
Okay, I'm gonna find out first of all

1312
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,180
what this restaurant is, where it is,

1313
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,140
how they do what they do,

1314
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,060
and then get one of these very wet salads.

1315
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,540
Get one single wet salad.

1316
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,700
How about a question, Juice?

1317
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,900
The high school in my town is performing Shrek the Musical.

1318
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,820
I wanna go see it,

1319
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,580
but I have no connections to the high school.

1320
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,300
I didn't go there, I don't know any students or parents

1321
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,580
of students that attend.

1322
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,620
Is it weird for me to go?

1323
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,340
How would a late 20s Shrek enthusiast go about doing so?

1324
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,460
An all-star in Woodland Park, Colorado.

1325
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,820
This is, they're doing it for you.

1326
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,300
Yeah, like you are, you just,

1327
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,180
is this where we're at, folks?

1328
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,140
I know, I'm with you and I understand you,

1329
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,700
and I am you.

1330
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,900
I get what you're saying, but like...

1331
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,980
Well, I don't know the Foo Fighters,

1332
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,300
it would be weird if I went to see them in concert.

1333
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,340
I don't know the Foo Fighters,

1334
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,180
and I don't know any parents of the Foo Fighters.

1335
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,980
I'm not making fun of you, I swear to God I'm with you.

1336
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,660
I don't know, Dave.

1337
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,820
So is it weird if I go see his show as the Foo Fighters?

1338
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,780
There is a certain, we have reached the point where

1339
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,940
I get that there is a perceived,

1340
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,380
and maybe it's not all bad,

1341
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,700
perceived like I'm not supposed to be there

1342
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,540
unless I'm connected to it feeling.

1343
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,020
Oh, high schools are the most, high schools are the most.

1344
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,020
Whenever I go, when we went back to Huntington High School,

1345
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,060
which is where I went to school

1346
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,140
to shoot stuff for the TV show,

1347
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,900
there is nothing like being in a school,

1348
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,540
even if it's one that you went to,

1349
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,300
that makes you feel like,

1350
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,300
especially in elementary school

1351
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,460
where everything's a little bit littler,

1352
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,060
and then you feel like the rampage gorilla,

1353
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,540
and you're just smashing through the hallways

1354
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,420
of the high school like John Mayer sang about in his song.

1355
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,660
He's like, I want to smash through the halls

1356
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,100
of my high school.

1357
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,220
I'll kick apart all the lockers and desks.

1358
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:23,540
It makes you feel like you're trespassing,

1359
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,180
and I get that.

1360
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,020
I think that's probably where they're coming from

1361
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:26,580
a little bit.

1362
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,820
I think that Shrek, Fiona, the whole gang

1363
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,060
would be thrilled to see you at the show.

1364
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,180
I think that that would be a delight.

1365
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,500
But you make sure you announce as you go in like,

1366
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,420
I'm just here because I love Shrek.

1367
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,660
Yeah, I love Shrek.

1368
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,700
I'm not a student.

1369
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,420
Donkey!

1370
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,180
What if we're wrong though,

1371
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,100
and they show up and it's all high schoolers and you,

1372
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,740
and at one point Shrek points in the audience

1373
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:58,740
and he's like, look at that perv.

1374
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,460
Interloper.

1375
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,180
Interloper, attack.

1376
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,260
Teens, attack, donkey.

1377
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,340
Maybe you walk up and say, I'm with Shrek.

1378
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,420
I know Shrek.

1379
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,460
Romantically.

1380
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:12,020
I know, I'm an invited guest of Mr. Shrek.

1381
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,700
I am Shrek.

1382
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,900
I'll be playing Shrek this evening.

1383
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,340
Oh, that's fun.

1384
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,940
So those stairs next to the stage,

1385
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,060
anybody can just go up those and say like,

1386
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,340
do you guys have a Shrek for tonight?

1387
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,940
Because I'd like to throw my hat in the ring.

1388
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,900
Yeah, I'd like to be,

1389
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,060
I heard you guys were doing Shrek,

1390
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,900
so I was just seeing if I could sign up to be Shrek.

1391
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,820
You just have to put a quarter on the edge of the stage

1392
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,660
to indicate that you have next.

1393
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,780
I'm next on Shrek.

1394
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,300
I'm next on Shrek.

1395
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,220
But listen, I will not eat a bug.

1396
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,260
I will not eat a bug and I don't want

1397
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,900
that goddamn scene-stealing donkey up here with me.

1398
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,540
I'll turn my earwax into a candle.

1399
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,300
I will wash my teeth with slime.

1400
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,660
I will not eat a fucking bug.

1401
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,460
Or a parfait.

1402
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,260
I don't like them,

1403
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,740
which makes you perfect for the role of Shrek.

1404
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,340
I'm not gonna eat a slime parfait

1405
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,620
because I'm a dentist in this town.

1406
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,500
People know who I am.

1407
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,460
They won't come see me.

1408
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,100
You try to get me up here to eat a bug.

1409
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,060
You trying to embarrass me?

1410
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,020
I'm running for mayor.

1411
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,420
Hey, I have a Yahoo Hero that we can do real fast.

1412
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:12,900
Yeah.

1413
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,100
Sent in by Brooks Oglesby.

1414
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,140
Thanks, Brooks.

1415
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,580
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1416
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,660
Maybe this one will load.

1417
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,980
Sawyer Babe asks,

1418
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,780
why is it called The Breakfast Club?

1419
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,740
What does the title have to do with the movie?

1420
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,220
Thank you.

1421
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:28,820
Thank you.

1422
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,180
They eat lunch.

1423
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,900
It's in the movie because at the end,

1424
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,980
Anthony Michael Hall signs their essay as The Breakfast Club.

1425
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,540
But why?

1426
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,420
That's fine.

1427
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,260
But why, Anthony?

1428
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,460
There's not a scene, I don't think.

1429
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,140
There is a scene where they think eat-

1430
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:43,780
Lunch.

1431
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,340
Like lunch.

1432
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,060
They eat lunch.

1433
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,740
This should be The Lunch Club.

1434
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,700
It should be The Lunch Club, Travis.

1435
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,820
There's not a scene where Molly Ringwald pulls out a bagel.

1436
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,580
There's a scene where they smoke a bunch of weed.

1437
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,540
They could be The Weed Club.

1438
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,620
They could be The Weed Club.

1439
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,060
They could be The Problems Club.

1440
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,300
The Bad Family.

1441
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,900
The Bad Family Crew.

1442
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,780
But they don't breakfast at any point.

1443
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,900
It's so weird.

1444
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,620
What if it turned out that that's why they were all in detention?

1445
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,740
Because outside of the detention thing,

1446
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,580
they are all in a club called The Breakfast Club

1447
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,140
where they would just get together and talk about breakfast.

1448
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:22,180
And one day they did that in a room where they weren't supposed to.

1449
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,460
And it's like, well, you have detention.

1450
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,940
And that backstory part is just never mentioned in the movie.

1451
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,540
Okay.

1452
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,040
Okay.

1453
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,260
I have some news.

1454
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,820
The original title of The Breakfast Club was The Lunch Bunch.

1455
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,900
That's a much better title.

1456
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,700
That's okay.

1457
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,740
That doesn't change the-

1458
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,060
That doesn't nullify us talking about it

1459
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:45,300
because they purposefully saw the off ramp and didn't get on it.

1460
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,060
And they're like, oh shit, what's the next off ramp?

1461
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,260
Breakfast, okay, oops.

1462
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:52,100
Do you think the problem was The Lunch Bunch just sounds too dang whimsical?

1463
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,580
And everyone's like, this sounds like a wacky spring break.

1464
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,180
Who's gonna get laid sex comedy?

1465
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,940
And then you get in there and it's like, oh no.

1466
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,940
They're talking about their problems.

1467
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,900
Serious family stuff.

1468
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,980
This is like if they called Forrest Gump like Jumping Man.

1469
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,780
Or Running Man.

1470
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,740
And he doesn't jump as much.

1471
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,820
It's not very much like a part of the...

1472
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,660
Thank you, Travis, for not really understanding the premise.

1473
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,380
I just wanted to make a joke because Running Man is already a movie.

1474
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,180
It does seem kind of like they filmed the whole movie

1475
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,100
and they didn't know what they were gonna call it.

1476
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:30,900
And someone's just like, can you pretend like we've said Breakfast Club a lot, Anthony?

1477
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,820
Can you pretend like we said Breakfast Club a lot during the movie

1478
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,900
and just kind of end it like that in a real confident way?

1479
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,020
Maybe it was a flood.

1480
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,420
Maybe he was supposed to say Lunch Club and he said Breakfast Club,

1481
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,340
but it was the only clean take they got.

1482
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,300
He was so hungry they filmed that last scene at eight o'clock.

1483
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,900
He hadn't had his yogurt.

1484
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,060
Or maybe they were gonna call it Lunch Bunch,

1485
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,420
but then when they were filming the movie,

1486
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,300
they were like, there's a possibility we can make this a trilogy.

1487
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,620
Yes.

1488
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,120
Yes.

1489
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,320
Yes.

1490
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:55,960
It's not too late.

1491
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,640
That actually makes a lot of sense.

1492
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,760
We can still make Lunch Bunch and Dinner Winners.

1493
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,560
It's about PUBG.

1494
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
The gang is there and they're playing PUBG together.

1495
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,440
He's one hit, Emilio.

1496
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:08,940
Push.

1497
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,640
Folks, that is gonna do it for us this week.

1498
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,600
Thank you so much.

1499
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,960
One last push, and I do mean last because we won't be with you again before the drive is over.

1500
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,000
My maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

1501
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,600
If you like our show and it makes you feel good to listen to it and you'd like to support it

1502
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,200
and support us in making more stuff, that's the address.

1503
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,640
Or and supporting like all the shows on the network or the ones that you listen to

1504
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,720
because that is an important point that your donation portion of it goes to Maximum Fund

1505
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:47,560
to help pay for their great staff and they make our lives so much easier day in, day out.

1506
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,480
But also like you choose the shows that you listen to when you sign up

1507
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,960
and those are the shows that get your money.

1508
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,240
They split it up.

1509
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,280
So like it's really important that you choose what shows you listen to,

1510
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,560
but know that you are funding those shows.

1511
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,840
You are part of the team of those shows, if you will.

1512
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:14,840
Yeah, it's again, like it means a lot to us and we can't imagine like doing this anywhere else.

1513
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:19,000
The Maximum Fund network has been a home for us for eight years now

1514
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,520
and has given us so much and you all have given us so much.

1515
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,680
And if you're new or you've been consuming more content,

1516
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,920
just think about going to maximumfund.org slash donate

1517
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,280
and helping us hit that 25,000 new and upgrading member goal.

1518
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,360
And yeah, thank you so much.

1519
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,320
Thank you so much.

1520
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,880
Thank you so much and thanks to John Roderick in the long winters

1521
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,520
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1522
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:47,240
It was so great, so great to have that and still is great.

1523
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,680
And thank you to Al Roker for-

1524
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,240
Everything.

1525
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:51,720
Everything.

1526
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,920
You know what?

1527
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,960
No, thanks to Al Roker.

1528
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,560
I'm tired of supplicating myself.

1529
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,320
He did me dirty out there.

1530
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,600
Thanks to Corey Cott.

1531
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,240
How about that?

1532
01:05:59,240 --> 01:05:59,720
Yeah.

1533
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:07,480
Thanks to Matt Doyle for not being there, but for being there.

1534
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,680
Always being there.

1535
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,480
Also real quick.

1536
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:14,280
So our Dallas and Houston shows are coming up this weekend when you hear this.

1537
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,400
And there are still some tickets left available, especially Houston.

1538
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,040
Houston, where are you, Houston?

1539
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,360
Houston, please.

1540
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,600
Houston, Houston, we have a problem.

1541
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:25,880
Please.

1543
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,920
Make sure to put in the subject line like Dallas show or Houston show.

1544
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:39,400
Also, I've got another Cincinnati Underground Society show coming up April 28th.

1545
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,520
The tickets are on sale now.

1546
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,760
You can get those at bit.ly KUSKEY 2018.

1547

That's C-U-S-S-K-E-Y 2018.

1548
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:53,080
We had a real blast at last month's show and I hope to see you out at this month's show.

1549
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,720
Bit.ly slash KUSKEY 2018.

1550
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,200
Yeah.

1551
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,480
And also the May shows are going to come up sooner than you think.

1552
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,080
So send in questions for those too.

1553
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,160
Speaking of May, we're going to be doing Sawbones,

1554
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:13,160
Still Buffering, and Court Appointed at the Columbus Podcast Festival on Saturday, May 12th.

1555
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,960
You can get tickets.

1556
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,600
The link is hard for me to find.

1557
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,320
But if you Google, you will find the way to get tickets.

1558
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,040
I don't have a punchy Bit.ly link like Travis.

1559
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:22,680
Oh, come on.

1560
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,440
I'm sorry, Trav.

1561
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,560
I'm just, I just can't.

1562
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,360
I just don't have one.

1563
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,520
But yeah, we're going to be doing those three shows back to back to back

1564
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,720
because if you come see us, it'll be fun.

1565
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,560
I need Yahoo's also for the live shows, please.

1566
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,680
Please get them in.

1567
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:34,920
Thank you.

1568
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,400
Thanks, Warriors.

1569
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,440
All right.

1570
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,080
Finally, Yahoo.

1571
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,320
This one was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

1572
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,800
Thank you, Merritt.

1573
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,800
It's Yahoo Answers user, Ashley, who asks,

1574
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:49,480
Hey, how do I get the wax covering on Babybel cheese out of my ear?

1575
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,880
My name is Justin McElroy.

1576
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,480
I'm Travis McElroy.

1577
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1578
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,880
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1579
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:07,480
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1580
