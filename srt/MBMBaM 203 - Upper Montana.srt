1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,160
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,000
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm your babiest baby baby, Griffin McElroy. Back in the saddle, fuck nuts. Sorry, I just wanted to

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,480
say back in the saddle. I just got back from a brunch with Arnani. Oh, how's she? She is doing

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,240
well. She is- has been in town for the week, uh, and we just got- we went to Black Sheep for brunch,

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,960
and I was instructed to give you guys these two kisses. Which- which one did I- The first one was

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,400
for Travis, and the second one was for Griffin. I wanted- I went to brunch, what did you have?

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
I wanted the second one, so I'm happy about how that turned out. Did that one sound more-

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,520
The first one was pretty dry, and if I'm gonna get an Arnani kiss, I want those wet smackers.

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,720
Is that a- is that a scared laugh, or was it an uncomfortable laugh? It's a little bit of- it's

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,120
sort of in the middle there. Um, Justin, your hands are on the issue. What did you have for brunch?

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:47,200
Inquire him. I- listen, I had chicken and waffles. Nice. The chicken is in, uh, Honey Nut Cheerios.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,320
Don't mind if I do. Not. Don't mind if I do. Like, wait, just like a bowl of cereal? No,

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,120
it's like ground up and fried in that. How about I do that with you? That sounds wonderful. What

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,680
did our sweet Nani get? Sweet Nani got blueberry, uh, uh, french toast. It was so sweet, she asked

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,920
for more syrup. There wasn't enough. She got sweet- She got sweet teeth. She got a bunch of sweet

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,200
teeth in those wet lips. Also, she told me that she's really into Arrow and is looking forward

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,840
to checking out Flashed. We can't- All the CW programming, Arnani is down with it, so if you've

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,920
got any questions about Arrow or the Flash, check out Arnani's podcast on TV with Nani.

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,040
She into Harda Dixie? Is she all caught up on Harda Dixie? Yeah, you know she's into Harda Dixie.

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,720
I think that's how she got her foothold in the CW network. Uh, listen, as funny as this has all been-

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,200
Has it? I want to help people. That's what we came here to do. It's been a while since we've

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,640
recorded an episode remotely. Want to say another huge thank you to everybody, uh, who came out to

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,080
the live shows at New York at the People's Improv Theater. Thank you. Thank you for all the gifts.

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I want to say thank you again to Prohibition Bakery. I've been talking about their

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,400
alcoholic cupcakes, like, since we got back. I've been preaching the good word. And that nice couple

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,440
from Florida that, like, shipped Diet Cheerwine to New York to give to us. Amazing. So many

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,880
sweethearts. So many sweethearts. And we got some, like, glorious, like, gourmet chocolates,

33
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,680
and I cannot remember who they're from. So if they're from you, send me an email or a tweet

34
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,880
and let me know so I can- Sorry, guys. Y'all send us too many gifts. Uh, and, uh, Justin Gray was

35
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,080
there. He gave us some art. Oh, yeah. That's that he- That shit's so- I'm framing that. Oh, and for

36
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,880
the- For the people that asked, the merch that was available during the live show will be available,

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:51,600
uh, for sale online as well, uh, but not until after the L.A. live show. Um, yeah. We'll be-

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,440
we'll be deploying those other two live shows and our upcoming L.A. live show, which sold out

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,600
in, I think, 11 minutes. So thank you for that, Los Angeles. Um, we'll be putting all those up

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,520
eventually, um, as- Yeah. As- As the need arises. We're trying to break it up because we know that

41
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,160
live shows aren't everybody's bag, so we're trying to, like, intersperse- I'm sorry that the audio

42
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,640
quality wasn't, like, awesome. We- We were hard pressed to find a good solution for that, um,

43
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,120
but that's- that's- And we originally had more time to tech the show, but because we did a 1.30

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,440
show- Yeah. We had to rush it 1.30. Good job, everybody. Well, and that's gonna be the episode,

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080
so thank you guys very much, uh, and we'll talk to you next week. This is the new face of my

46
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,480
brother, my brother, me. We can play for four minutes. Wait, well, we gotta do ads. So we'll

47
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,400
edit in ads between the two minutes of complaining. Two minutes up top, two minutes at the back.

48
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,560
I love nature boxing, but fucking hate everything else. Bleh. Let's help people. That's what we

49
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,680
came here to do. I recently had to kill some time waiting for a friend to get home and decided to

50
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,160
get some Taco Bell. Oh, the best way to pass time. I relaxed in my car in the parking lot

51
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,720
to listen to some bim-bam-bim-bam. Name of our show. Got it. Eat tacos while I waited for my

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,400
friend to get home. Once I was done with- I love this question. Once I was done with my tacos,

53
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,720
I was still hungry. Would it be weird for me to go back in and get some more drive-thru tacos

54
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
knowing that the girl in the window just saw me there like ten minutes ago?

55
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,360
Yeah, fucked up. I think you can pull it off- when you roll up to the window, you just say,

56
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,440
again. Again. That's- hit me again, bar taco tender. I'm gonna have to cut you off, sir.

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,800
You've had three Doritos Lopez. I think this is from fretful fourth meal, but I think you mean

58
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,000
fifth, technically speaking. If you have another fourth meal, that makes it your fifth meal or 4.5.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,080
Your eighth meal, possibly. I think it's wonderfully sweet of you to worry about this.

60
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,040
If you think that you are like the only person that day that did that, then you're a little

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,760
naive, my friend. Hey, Sheila. Yeah, I'm scooping back around for a double dip. Oh, Tony. Hi, sir.

62
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Welcome to Taco Bell. What would you like? Oh, you know what I fucking like. That same shit,

63
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,400
one moguian. Can I get the berry one moguian special? Barry, we have asked you repeatedly

64
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,240
to just order twice as much food, but I like it to stay warm. It's cold by the time I get to number

65
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,920
six. Let me get the number 18. Do you mean two number nines? One moguian. All right. I actually

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,520
mean six number threes. Actually, however you want to break it up, it's all pretty.

67
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,480
Can I get a 30 of your Doritos Locos, please? Por favor. Grazie.

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,200
How late is your friend that you had time to drive to Taco Bell, drive back to your home,

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,280
and then contemplate driving back to Taco Bell? You know what's the craziest part of this question

70
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,560
is, I got some time to kill, I'll go eat some shitty taco. Typically, you do that when your

71
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,000
gut needs sustenance or gym mats, which is the more accurate. I need to put ground up gym mats

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,160
in my tummy. We've had a lot of fun here today. I want to call BS on this question. There has never

73
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,920
been a human on planet Earth that has finished eating Taco Bell and thought, that's a decision

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,600
I'd make again. If I could play that again, I'd play it the exact same way. I think I'd really

75
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,640
play it one last time. Hey, you know what? You know what? I just did a perfect job.

76
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,720
I did a perfect job in that Taco Bell drive through. I think at that point, you have to go

77
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,040
back and just ask for a sack full of Senna twists or whatever they're called. Just like,

78
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm back for dessert. You tempted me with your dessert menu. Are Senna twists just churros that

79
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,680
they chopped up? Yes. They're just murdered churros. I wish they'd be more forthcoming about

80
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
that. I think they have real ass churros now, but it's like, you know, it's the Taco Bell style,

81
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
so they're like in Doritos. It's a bunch of cinnamon twists glued together.

82
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,640
I made you a composite churro. Enjoy it. We ground up Senna twists, then batter dipped

83
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,640
a chicken tender in it, then fried it. It's a churro. Here's the second one. That sounds baller.

84
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,240
It sounds fucking really good, actually. That's on the breakfast menu, I think.

85
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,080
Just put on a large mustache and a sombrero. That's racist.

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,240
It's a disguise. It's not. Yeah, super racist disguise. Wow,

87
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,040
somebody went to the McLemore school of fast food disguises. It was an accident. It was an accident.

88
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,120
I went to Taco Bell in a super racist Mexican costume. It was an accident.

89
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,440
Okay, you got to go through and say, I've traveled back in time to find myself from the past. Did

90
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,600
you see me come through here earlier? Also, can I get a composite churro? Can I have exactly?

91
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,520
I'll have what he's having. Past me, I mean. The only way I can track myself down is to eat the

92
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,800
exact same thing past me ate, and then see the feelings that leads, what buildings that lead.

93
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
Have you guys seen Looper? It's exactly that. I'll eat-

94
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,000
Except you're going to Taco Bell, so it's Pooper. I'll eat what he ate, and then get on the

95
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,920
interstate, driving the same direction he was driving, and then I will know where he stopped

96
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:30,000
to have diarrhea. Y'all want a Yahoo? Yeah. I think that helped.

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,720
Didn't. This Yahoo was sent in by EmeraldMember, level 14, Yahoo shaman,

98
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,480
Drew Davenport. Thank you, Drew. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Nick, who has a 0% score on Yahoo.

99
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,320
But he scored Nick? What? That's his username? His name is Nick. I just thought that that would go

100
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,840
quick. Oh, I don't know if they have to be unique, because there's somebody here named Michael,

101
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:04,800
which, and a Frank, and a Chantel. Anyway, Nick asks, how come my uncle thinks that my hobby is

102
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:14,160
stupid and weird? I am an elevator enthusiast, and I film myself going up and down in an elevator

103
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,960
and upload it to YouTube. I like riding high-rise elevators in office buildings, and I get a lot of

104
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,720
money in my hobby. My uncle thinks that my hobby is stupid and weird and is a waste of money. He

105
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,640
thinks that paying for gas and parking is a waste of money. Most of the time, I only have to pay $5

106
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,240
for parking at an garage in downtown of any city I go to. How come my uncle thinks that my hobby is

107
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,120
weird and stupid and is a waste of money? Listen, I want to be super clear here. Please. Because

108
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,400
if Roman Mars has taught me anything, there's some amazing shit when it comes to architecture,

109
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,400
and I imagine the way that elevators work, it's super cool, and you could find something like

110
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:01,280
old-timey, like they had an elevator operator, and they're super cool and awesome. The idea of

111
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,400
filming oneself riding an elevator for the enjoyment of others is the stupidest thing

112
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,520
I've ever heard. I don't give a fuck if it's a glass-bottom elevator that goes up Tokyo Tower

113
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,040
at night. Oh, it's so beautiful. I would not watch that fucking video on YouTube. Also,

114
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,840
that situation does exist because almost all elevators are little windowless coffins that

115
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,520
you lock yourself in for 20 seconds. Hey, speaking of, did you guys hear about Willis Tower?

116
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:39,360
Oh, but the glass- Oh, fuck. Yes. Holy shit. Willis Tower, uh, nay, Sears Tower in Chicago.

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,840
The tallest tower basically in the world. If we give in to calling it Willis Tower,

118
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,400
then what hope is there for our children? Sears Tower. Sears Tower has these glass overhangs

119
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,360
that were supposed to hold up to five tons, and you go out and you stand on them, and then you

120
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,720
just look down, and then it's nothing but net. And by net, I mean falling death. And you stand out

121
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,200
there. Justin Travis and I had giant tanooki balls, and we got out there like, what's up?

122
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,920
Just us in free space. And we took all kinds of pictures like, look how cool we are. We'll never

123
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,240
die. Somebody took a picture of their last week, glass broke in the bottom. Didn't shatter. They

124
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,680
didn't fall through, but they are crunch? Later. I guess I'll weigh five tons. Time to get on CrossFit.

125
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
Can you imagine being the employees up there when it's like,

126
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,040
Oh no, go, go, no, go ahead. Oh, come on. That little girl's doing it. What are you, a puss- Oh,

127
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,720
shit. I, I led to the death of a family of four. Not again. Do you know, like, how different my

128
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,960
life is now that I have a child on the way versus then? At that exact- Jesus Christ. My wife stuck

129
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,640
out behind me and scared the shit out of me. I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about

130
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,840
something else. It's okay. Hi. All right. Bye, sweetheart. Good radio. What just happened?

131
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Sydney literally stuck up behind me and scared- It's okay. We'll edit this part out. That's a nice

132
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
moment. I'm going to leave that in. That was a nice moment. I love it. I'm very frightful.

133
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,280
Talk about how much your life has changed. Yes. Oh, thank you. That's right. It's crazy how much

134
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,520
my life has changed now that I have a child on the way. When we did that initially, it was right

135
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,520
before our first Chicago live show and I, or our only Chicago live show, I guess. And I just jumped

136
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,120
out there and took the picture and didn't give it a second thought. Is that how that happened? I

137
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,120
wasn't scared at all. I was the one who was terrified. Travis was terrified. I mean, I don't

138
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,280
give a shit. Today, if you asked me to do that today, not only would I not take the stupid

139
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,360
elevator up to the top, I would like, who's that guy welding shut all the doors to the weird glass

140
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,240
breakable coffins? Oh, that's old man McElroy. This is what he does in his days. He tries to

141
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,680
keep people from dying 24 hours a day. That would be me now. No way I do that. Let's talk about this.

142
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,080
Does it matter? That seems like an irrational fear to me to like go up Willis tower and be like

143
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,560
afraid because really all it takes is maybe three stories and you're done. So three stories for me,

144
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:20,400
my bones, my lactose intolerant calcium deficient bones, two stories and I'm, I'm gonzo. I'm done.

145
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,040
Basically Humpty Dumpty. I am Humpty Dumpty with these fucking unbreakable breakable bones.

146
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Uh, anyway, elevator video monetization. What's this guy's secret and how can I get some of that

147
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,160
elevator video money? You think there's a market demanding this kind of coverage? He says he makes

148
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,760
lots of money doing it. Okay. He doesn't, but I think maybe what it is is for people who are

149
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,880
scared about it, that they can like get over it, check out what the elevator is going to be like

150
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,760
before they go. Or do you think it's a weird like fetish? Uh, always forever. Everything's a fetish.

151
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,320
Everything, every moment you see in magazines, television is fulfilling somebody's weird fetish.

152
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,920
I think it's like a big, big like cable fed pussy.

153
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,560
Cause if you think about like the, if you think about it, like if you think about like this,

154
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,200
if you think about it, then there's like, it's connected to like the pulley

155
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,600
by those wires could be like, like, um, fallopian tubes. That's why you said that dirty word very

156
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:32,720
quietly Griffin. What I'm saying is that women's it goes vagina, which connects the fallopian tube.

157
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,280
That's the wire. That's correct. And then the fallopian tube connects to the zygote and that's

158
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,880
where the baby comes out of. That's correct. Nailed it. And the clitoris is the button for the 13th

159
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:55,520
floor. Cause it does not exist. Oh, what? Maybe I'll try jerking off to this. Like maybe something's

160
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:02,000
got to work for you. God, what's it going to be? Gumball machines. I have entered a phase of my

161
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,080
life where I'm dating a lot. Nice. When I take nice, you're doing it. I take a late, uh, when I

162
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,320
take a lady out to a nice restaurant, where do I sit? Do I sit next to her hand holding or do I sit

163
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,640
across from her to look her in the eye and have room to eat my food? That's from which side in

164
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Wichita. Always across the table. I disagree. Disagree. Disagree. So I thought predictably,

165
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,560
predictably, I thought this would be the result. That's why I included this question. A disagree.

166
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,800
Here's the thing. Ditto. If I may, I agree with you. If it's like a first, second, third date,

167
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,520
I love sitting on the same side as Teresa and talking about all the other couples in the

168
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,000
restaurant. If you can't, if I'm, I'm, I'm literally, I know this is actually an old man.

169
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm literally at a point now where I don't hear as well. Like if I'm, if I'm across the table,

170
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,280
it, I feel like I'm shouting the whole time and I can't hear. I like to just snuggle right up

171
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,680
in that, in that other seat. Why waste a whole booth? We're not children. If we sit across from

172
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,960
each other, Teresa can see me eating, which is not, it's not good. Look, no, not for continued

173
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,680
marital bliss. The other thing I like about sitting on the same side is that I can demand

174
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,320
fruitlessly that the waitress seat another couple in the adjoining side of the booth.

175
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,440
Can you mix it up? Can you mix it up just enough to mix doubles?

176
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,360
We need euchre partners. Can you please?

177
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,360
We're, we're trying to make new friends at Max and Irma's.

178
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,560
I was just sitting-

179
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,000
Could you send out Max and Irma?

180
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,000
I've been sitting here like literally slack jawed with shock. I can't bel- I didn't think

181
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
I didn't think anybody did that. I didn't think anybody did that.

182
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:50,320
Eye contact is so much more, I'll just say it, erotic than hand holding. So you look into the

183
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,000
windows of her soul and you have that going for you. It's easier, like sound, you don't have to

184
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,520
like turn your neck to the left or right to like talk to them. Both of you have instant

185
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,520
bathroom access. That's not a joke.

186
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
I know it's not.

187
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm surprised that you, Justin, I'm surprised that you most of all, Tin Man,

188
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,320
that you're not keeping your exits wide, vis a vis bathroom.

189
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,000
Ah, do you think I'm ever on the inside? Let me disabuse you.

190
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,680
Well, now you've got a, your wife is pregnant. She probably goes to the bathroom

191
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,520
more than you, which is a fact that I never thought would be true.

192
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,880
I am happy to let her out. She can get out if she wants.

193
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
You're so kind.

194
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
That's, this is, I can't-

195
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,600
You don't make your pregnant wife crawl under the table. No, not unless I drop a breadstick.

196
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
I can't.

197
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,200
Then I do ask if she can hop down there right quick.

198
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,240
A little help?

199
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,440
A little help. Yeah, sorry Griffin, this is like, I don't, I don't like sitting across,

200
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,000
I feel like there's too much room, especially with like some of these big tables. It's like

201
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,440
really big and there's a crazy amount of distance and I don't like being that far from my wife.

202
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,920
Like, I just like us to be close to each other so we can chat.

203
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,880
Rachel and I only eat at intimate bistros because that's all that exists here in Austin.

204
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,560
It's all intimate bistros.

205
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,800
That could be, okay, so that could actually be, you may be kidding on the square here

206
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,160
and, and I've hit upon something.

207
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,480
All of the restaurants in Huntington have to be built to accommodate and

208
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
whatever the table equivalent of an airplane seatbelt extender is,

209
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,160
every table has to be fit to fit for that sort of

210
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,480
human, human frame.

211
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,880
Yeah.

212
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,760
That sort of frame.

213
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,560
And I think that that might be the problem is like, it's just so far in such a distance.

214
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:36,800
Yeah.

215
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,000
Plus they have to have all the room for all of the food.

216
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,840
Another thing, like you brought up snuggling and that's just crazy to me because like

217
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Rachel nor I like to be touched when our mouth is, is full of quinoa.

218
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,640
You know what I mean?

219
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,200
Like when I'm, when I'm jaw full of quinoa.

220
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,640
Well, no, I'm not talking about because my, my giant chompers might accidentally

221
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,320
remove one of their digits.

222
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,640
Okay.

223
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,120
Just me.

224
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,600
That's cool.

225
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,840
Because I'm not a fucking Wolverine.

226
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,080
Okay.

227
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,560
That's fine.

228
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,040
No, I mean like it's not, this is not touching time.

229
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Sometimes I, listen, I love my wife.

230
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,960
I'm sure that you guys too do love your wives.

231
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,640
Um, sometimes there are non-touching times.

232
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
Sometimes there are times where you're not.

233
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,240
But what about when you want to sensually feed each other?

234
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,080
That's a great question.

235
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,200
What about when you do want to sensually feed each other?

236
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,520
Then do it across the table from each other.

237
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,560
But then you risk like dropping the food on the table.

238
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,640
Some people are okay with that.

239
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,160
Some people are sensual.

240
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,200
That's not erotic.

241
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
That's a sloppy boy.

242
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,160
Some people are okay with maybe once a month letting a piece of food not get eaten.

243
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,760
Now here's the thing, Griffin.

244
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,080
I, I hate to disagree with you, but anyone who's ever eaten with me knows that I leave

245
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,440
quite the wake of debris around me when I am done.

246
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,520
Travis, I hate to disagree with you, but you don't hate to disagree with anybody.

247
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,160
That is correct.

248
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,040
I love to disagree with you, but.

249
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,160
Um.

250
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,560
But.

251
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:10,960
And.

252
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,560
I would say.

253
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,600
And here it comes.

254
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,200
And so, as I was saying, I think that when, when you first start dating,

255
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,000
you should always sit across the table because that's eye to eye contact,

256
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,680
conversation.

257
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
It's all keyed in the getting to know you process.

258
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,120
I think once you reach a certain comfort level with each other,

259
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,600
I actually usually kind of go the way of the seating.

260
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,800
If, if the, if the, you know, host or pulls out the two chairs beside each other,

261
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,840
I trust his judgment.

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,880
I go with it.

263
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,440
I am.

264
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
You trust his take on your relationship.

265
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah.

266
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,600
If he's like, oh, this looks like a side-by-side catty corner kind of thing.

267
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm like, okay.

268
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,360
Nailed it.

269
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,680
But in a booth, in a booth, in a four-seater booth, you guys will fucking just use one bench.

270
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,400
Oh God, no.

271
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
Oh God, no.

272
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,240
Oh God, no.

273
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,280
No, no, no, no.

274
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
No, I'm talking like a four top, you know.

275
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,760
Okay.

276
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,000
I was thinking about a booth and here I was thinking like my brothers are lunatics.

277
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,680
No, same side, same side.

278
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,800
No, same side of the booth.

279
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,400
Oh see, I, I, I think you are wrong there because that looks like you're waiting for

280
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
another person to turn into a ghost.

281
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,600
Or that you're just lunatic.

282
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,680
I would give that table a wide berth as I walked by to the bathroom for the third time.

283
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,160
Absolutely.

284
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,560
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,680
I don't care how it looks.

286
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,120
I love love and I love being with my wife and I'm not going to change for anybody.

287
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,280
If you sit on the same side of the booth with your wife, you guys have to practice and coordinate

288
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,000
that every time the server walks up, you guys turn your head in unison.

289
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,720
At the same time.

290
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes.

291
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,500
Yes.

292
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,760
We need nothing else to part.

293
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
We require more Sprite.

294
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,680
Also, we cosplay the code heads everywhere we go.

295
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,840
That's the other thing about it.

296
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,960
I was thinking that you, like a meet Dave scenario where you guys have little people

297
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,200
powering your human shaped starships.

298
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,040
No, you know, like the classic meet Dave and everyone will understand the reference.

299
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,120
Your Eddie Murphy starships are powered by Sprite.

300
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,880
Like in the movie, Meet Dave, sponsored by Sprite.

301
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,560
Did you see me, Dave, sponsored by Sprite?

302
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,880
Did you see Pluto Nash also sponsored by Sprite?

303
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
Do you know what would have been a better movie?

304
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,880
He's been deep in the pocket of big Sprite.

305
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,120
Yeah.

306
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,040
Do you know what would have been a better movie than Meet M-E-E-T Dave?

307
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,280
What?

308
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,600
Meet M-E-A-T Dave.

309
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:23,840
Yeah.

310
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,560
What's the plot?

311
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,400
Give me a synopsis.

312
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,280
He's made of meat and he thinks other people are all controlled by robots.

313
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,560
And he thinks that he's the only person that is actually flesh and bone.

314
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,600
He's insane.

315
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,840
Okay.

316
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,160
And he's Tony Shalhoub and-

317
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,320
And he's just cutting open people looking for their tiny-

318
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,680
He's cutting open people looking for the robots inside.

319
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,680
There's no Eddie Murphy in here.

320
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,720
Right.

321
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
He's looking for the little Eddie Murphy inside all of us.

322
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,120
Well, aren't we all?

323
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,400
And it turns out he's a serial killer and who should stop him but Batman.

324
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,440
Okay.

325
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
Played by Eddie Murphy.

326
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,160
Meet Dave, Gotham Knights.

327
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,720
Yes.

328
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,760
I don't- listen.

329
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Eddie Murphy can't play more than one role in the same movie at the same time.

330
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,520
What are you talking about?

331
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,240
Madman.

332
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,680
Madman.

333
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,360
He's everybody in Mad Men.

334
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,520
How about another Yahoo answer question?

335
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah, hit me.

336
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,160
I can't believe you sit on the same fucking side of a booth as your wife.

337
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,400
I don't want to keep-

338
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,240
She seems to like it, but this is probably one of those deathbed confessions I want to hear about.

339
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,800
This Yahoo was sent in by Anna Schlumbom.

340
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,280
Thank you, Anna.

341
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

342
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,160
Davis B.

343
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
0% best answers.

344
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,280
Lot of shitheads.

345
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,160
Davis B. asks, what are the top five best tuba brands?

346
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,920
I have- I have no idea what the best tuba brands are except I know Yamaha is probably good.

347
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,840
If Miraphone isn't in your top five, what do you think of it?

348
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
You don't want a Miraphone.

349
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,680
No.

350
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,800
You don't want a Miraphone.

351
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,120
You want to go with Blaster Phone.

352
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,800
Blaster Phone is really good.

353
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,520
It's a weird like sort of acoustic electric mix.

354
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
And they cost $4 at a gas station.

355
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
And it is a tuba shaped toy.

356
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
But you'd be amazed.

357
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,280
You'd be amazed at the kind of rich DBs you can get out of one of those bad boys.

358
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,840
There's also a button that makes it sound like a dog barking.

359
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
You don't get that on any of the other like upscale tubas.

360
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:24,960
No.

361
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,920
No, there's no dog barks in a Miraphone.

362
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,440
Yamaha does if you let a dog bark into it.

363
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,200
I like a nice inflatable tuba.

364
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,680
Interesting.

365
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
Not an especially rich sound.

366
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,520
No, but I mean it's much easier to carry.

367
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:37,760
Yeah.

368
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,160
And it can save your life if you like fall out of a boat.

369
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,200
Justin, did you- did you ever- I don't want to- I don't want to draw up any generalizations here.

370
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,560
You weren't a tuba man, right?

371
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,880
You were a coronet- a coronet fella.

372
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,320
No, I was a euphonium or a baritone horn.

373
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,920
And what's the difference between a baritone horn and a tuba?

374
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,640
The one you made up?

375
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,680
What?

376
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,720
No, it's just- they're just other low brass instruments are basically the same.

377
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,640
One's more for marching, one's more for concert.

378
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,720
At least I think.

379
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,000
I never paid that close attention.

380
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,280
I didn't learn all the notes.

381
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,800
But I learned maybe six or seven notes.

382
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,080
And how long did you play?

383
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,520
Blurt, blart, blurt, blart.

384
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,000
It depends on how- whether it was a whole note or a half note, Trav.

385
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,400
And then- can you give me a- can you give me a half note?

386
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,020
Half.

387
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,140
Okay.

388
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,240
There's a one, two, three, four.

389
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,740
Half.

390
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,600
Here comes the whole note, you ready?

391
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,240
Quarter note?

392
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
Quar- quarter- quarter.

393
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,200
What is it?

394
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,700
Quarter.

395
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,120
I got eight- I got eight notes coming, listen to this.

396
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,040
Eight, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight.

397
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,240
What's that?

398
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,200
Six teeth notes?

399
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,520
No, it can't be done, it can't be done, it can't be done.

400
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,680
Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six.

401
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Oh no, you summoned- you summoned the devil.

402
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,000
That is-

403
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,240
And now you have to have a tuba battle with the devil.

404
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
A tuba battle with the devil for your soul.

405
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,220
The devil is-

406
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,720
Blurt, blart, blurt, blurt, blurt, blurt, blurt.

407
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,800
Justin went down to Georgia.

408
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,720
It took him a long time because tubas are heavy.

409
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,840
He was pretty tired by the time he got there.

410
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,240
There, he took a little nap.

411
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Why didn't you guys go pro?

412
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,000
Travis, you were a tromboner, right?

413
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I was, a trombonist, please.

414
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,540
The reason I did not go pro with my trombone skills

415
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,540
is that there were three other trombonists

416
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,200
in my middle school band,

417
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
and what we did was each of us learned

418
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,020
one fourth of the song,

419
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,320
and then that person would play their part

420
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,080
while the other three just moved the slides up and down

421
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,960
until your part came around,

422
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,640
and then you'd pick it up and the other three would drop out.

423
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,160
Was there not like a clear,

424
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,240
like you're playing, you can call me Al,

425
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,080
and during halftime it's like-

426
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,880
No, because then you just put your mouth

427
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,160
to the mouthpiece and go,

428
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,760
boo-doo-doo-doo, boo-doo-doo-doo.

429
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,560
No, no, but I'm saying there would be like a clear,

430
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,600
like one of you is clearly better than the other,

431
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,440
so it'd be like,

432
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,440
ah, ah, ah, ah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

433
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,000
Chris Cumming was just amazing.

434
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,280
He was the trombone to stop.

435
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,760
Yeah.

436
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,720
And so we had to have a talk.

437
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,440
I think every trombonist is the trombonist to stop.

438
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,400
We had to have a little talk with Chris.

439
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,640
He was making us all look bad.

440
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,320
He said, hey, cool it out, hotshot.

441
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,520
I never did band.

442
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
That's weird, Griffin,

443
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,600
because you're probably the most musically inclined

444
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,440
of the three of us.

445
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,500
I mean, I used the instrument of my diaphragm.

446
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,040
My vaginal birth control device.

447
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,960
And he never got pregnant, so I was like.

448
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,640
No, you know, I wanted to,

449
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,440
but I didn't know where to even fucking start.

450
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,360
What I wanted to know was when somebody decides to do band

451
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
and they also decide that they don't want to do it,

452
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,840
but that they have to do it,

453
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,840
then do you try as hard as you can to get the piccolo?

454
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,380
Cause that seems like the fucking jam.

455
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,100
Just like carry around these two double A batteries.

456
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,080
All right, yeah, I can do that.

457
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,540
This is the crazy thing to me.

458
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,940
I remember very clearly the first day of middle school band

459
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,220
and the teacher said, okay,

460
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,980
what instrument does everyone want to play?

461
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,820
And 50% of the class wanted to play drums.

462
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,180
And 50% of the class wanted to play saxophone.

463
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,020
And that was it.

464
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,900
Well, that was during the Clinton, that was the Clinton.

465
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,420
She was like, okay, listen,

466
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,500
somebody's got to do trumpet.

467
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,380
Somebody's got to do trombone.

468
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,900
All of us really enjoyed the new musical phenomena

469
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,660
that is Dave Matthews band.

470
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
We did it.

471
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,140
But some of you, first off, we don't have any violins.

472
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,060
So you guys need to leave.

473
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,740
Cause neither of you ended up with what I would consider

474
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,780
to be a light instrument that I, and I don't hope,

475
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,560
I really hope I don't offend you.

476
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,020
A couple of lazy fucks can just like carry around

477
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,920
in the hot sun.

478
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,760
Here's what happened.

479
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,340
I did use my trombone for self-defense once.

480
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,180
Oh, I remember that.

481
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,820
It's the only fight you ever won.

482
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,660
That's good.

483
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,700
Here's the thing I wanted to tell you

484
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,820
about everything that you don't know from band.

485
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,980
Here's how I remember it.

486
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,460
I started learning to play trumpet.

487
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,220
That's how I got my start.

488
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,220
But my lips were too big to play trumpet well.

489
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,400
Oh, I see. It hurt me.

490
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,240
Yeah.

491
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,660
Which makes me think that maybe they don't assign,

492
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,540
maybe they just let you pick

493
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,440
because any self-respecting music teacher

494
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,020
would take a look at these luscious, luscious.

495
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,060
That you got from your nanny, clearly.

496
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,860
These luscious kiss machines and said like,

497
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,700
I don't know.

498
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,280
I think this is a baritone or euphonium man

499
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,460
and not a trumpet man.

500
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,500
So I flushed the, I wasted the best year of my life

501
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,780
trying to learn how to play trumpet.

502
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,700
Justin, I don't know when the best year

503
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,860
of your life is,

504
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,420
but it definitely fucking didn't happen

505
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,900
at Comac Middle School.

506
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,340
I just know they closed Comac.

507
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,900
You know that both Comac and Miller Elementary are no more.

508
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,020
Miller was turned to dust and Comac they,

509
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,440
we outlived, basically what I'm saying

510
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,700
is we outlived both of them.

511
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,540
Good.

512
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,360
So hooray for us.

513
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,200
Yeah.

514
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,420
Oh man, I'm gonna miss those blue streaks.

515
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,260
What even the fuck is a blue streak?

516
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,220
Get a better mascot.

517
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,380
Oh wait, you can't.

518
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,940
You can't, you're dead.

519
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,880
You're dead.

520
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,720
We beat you.

521
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,820
We beat you middle school.

522
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,820
You're the fucking shittiest three years ever

523
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,060
anyone has to go through.

524
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,240
If you're listening to this podcast

525
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,080
in your middle school,

526
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,560
first of all, that's awesome.

527
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,580
Second of all, keep on.

528
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,720
Just keep pushing.

529
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,320
It's the worst.

530
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,660
It's the absolute pits.

531
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,060
My little sister-in-law Riley graduated

532
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,520
and I looked at her and I was like,

533
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,360
I just want you to know

534
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,900
that you've finished the hardest thing you'll ever do.

535
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,740
Yeah.

536
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,560
There's nothing.

537
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,720
There's literally nothing.

538
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,740
There's literally nothing.

539
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,980
Trust me, I've gone out pretty far out ahead of you.

540
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,780
There is no point in your life

541
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,740
at which you go,

542
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,420
I am both dealing with as much shit

543
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,020
as I did in middle school

544
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,660
and also can't like, I don't know, drink or smoke

545
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,460
or drive a car or a boat.

546
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,220
And I'm slowly jizzing a little bit 24-7

547
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,260
and I don't understand why.

548
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:34,340
Listen, we start Money Zone with a danger box.

549
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,260
Every time I talk about how hungry you are,

550
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,860
how about you order some snacks

551
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,140
before you get fucking hungry?

552
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,640
I order them now.

553
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,480
I did.

554
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,680
I asked them to re-up my snack subscription this week,

555
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,380
but they haven't come in yet.

556
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,780
Nature box is, it's like, okay.

557
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,060
So you get hungry, right?

558
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,460
That happens to everybody sometimes.

559
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,560
Not me.

560
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,400
Okay.

561
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,500
And you want a snack.

562
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,540
So you go to the vending machine.

563
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,200
Oh my God, it's all chemicals and butter.

564
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,460
That's the only thing in that machine.

565
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,480
And a high fructose corn syrup is garbage.

566
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,320
Nature box is like that.

567
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,160
It's like a vending machine

568
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,660
in a cardboard box in your house.

569
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,620
That it doesn't-

570
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,460
But it doesn't have butter and chemicals.

571
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,820
It doesn't put money into it, it doesn't vent stuff in.

572
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,340
You just open the box and then you open the package

573
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,180
and then you eat it.

574
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,780
Oh, so kind of like a box.

575
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,620
Yeah, kind of like a box.

576
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,860
The more we live with this metaphor,

577
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,300
I feel like the shine's nearly off the apple,

578
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,140
but it doesn't have our official stuff.

579
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,340
And sometimes when you're trying to eat the pralines,

580
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,300
it gets stuck in the box and you have to shake the box.

581
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,140
Get out of there.

582
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,620
Oh, wait, it's a box.

583
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,720
I can just open it.

584
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,220
The nature box lets you pick the snacks you want.

585
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,100
You log onto their website, naturebox.com,

586
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,340
and you're gonna be able to pick the South Pacific,

587
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,980
plantain chips and everything, bagel sticks,

588
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,480
and the BBQ kettle kernels, the vanilla almond clusters,

589
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,900
French toast granola, that's what I like.

590
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,980
And you can, it's like a subscription thing.

591
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,460
You tell them what snacks you want

592
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,300
and they'll send them to you.

593
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,340
They're delicious.

594
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,620
Ooh, ooh, they're good.

595
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,340
I'm getting hungry right now just thinking about them.

596
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
And when they send them to you,

597
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,180
it's free shipping anywhere in the U.S., so.

598
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,300
Ooh, does that include the non-contiguous states?

599
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,260
I must assume so.

600
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,460
Does that include the secret states?

601
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,180
It does. Better than all of this

602
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,220
is that we can get you 50% off your first box.

603
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,780
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother

604
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,780
and you're gonna get fit and healthy and 50% off.

605
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,180
So it's a steal.

606
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,520
Don't wait.

607
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,580
Stay full, stay strong.

608
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,520
Get fed.

609
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,200
Do you think I just scared the shit

610
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,660
out of all of our listeners in the secret states?

611
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,860
They're like, oh no, he knows.

612
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,700
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

613
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,340
Tell all of my friends in upper Montana.

614
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,500
It's a secret state on top of Montana.

615
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,040
You didn't think anything was up there.

616
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,220
Beyond the fog, beyond the wall, beyond the fog wall.

617
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,060
What is that?

618
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,320
It's a secret state called upper Montana.

619
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,500
Our next live show is in upper Montana, by the way.

620
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,340
It's great.

621
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,980
We're in the badlands of upper Montana.

622
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,940
Inside the spiral cave.

623
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,940
All our attendees are gonna be goblins.

624
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,720
And we will be stoned as shit.

625
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,140
We had to bring our roto cycle

626
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,180
and we'll trade bottle caps for more water rations.

627
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
And it's gonna be a great show.

628
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,380
It's gonna be a really great show.

629
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,540
We'll all probably die.

630
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,200
Guys, you've tried Hulu on your computer.

631
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,100
I know that you have.

632
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,580
You're probably doing it right now as we record.

633
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,020
You're probably watching, I don't know, Survivor

634
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
or something.

635
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,900
Let me tell you about Hulu Plus though.

636
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,460
Cause it's a lot better.

637
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,520
With Hulu Plus, you can watch current season episodes

638
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,240
of your favorite shows like Family Guy, Parks and Rec,

639
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,360
Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

640
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,900
You can watch every episode of shows like Community

641
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,580
and South Park, but there's a lot more to it than that,

642
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,220
isn't there?

643
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,580
Yes.

644
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,400
Great, is there?

645
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,460
I'm glad we had this talk.

646
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,960
You can also, aside from just like your mobile device

647
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,160
or tablet or whatnot, you can also watch it on computer,

648
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,440
smart TV, Roku, Apple TV, Xbox, PlayStation,

649
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,600
pretty much like anything you have that you could stream

650
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,420
shit to, you can watch Hulu Plus on.

651
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,280
Can you imagine?

652
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,080
They have archived shows, like every episode

653
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,100
of older television programming.

654
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,240
It's not on the air anymore.

655
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,460
They have original programming like Deadbeat,

656
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,660
a comedy about a pot smoking guy that talks to ghosts.

657
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,940
Don't all pot smoking guys talk to ghosts, though?

658
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,500
They do, and if you think about how much you pay a month

659
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
for cable.

660
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,660
$800.

661
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,500
Yeah, and if you're not paying for like some kind

662
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,280
of DVR service, they come on and they're gone.

663
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,980
That's a wasted resource.

664
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,860
You're paying for shows that you don't get a chance

665
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,700
to watch.

666
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,940
With Hulu, it's just $7.99 a month, and it's always there.

667
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,020
So if you say, oh, I don't have time to watch the new episode

668
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,500
of Parks and Recreation, it's cool.

669
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,560
It'll still be there two hours later.

670
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,660
You didn't miss it.

671
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,580
From two hours later to up until the heat death

672
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,700
of the universe.

673
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,540
Yeah.

674
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,100
That's how long your episode's gonna last on Hulu Plus.

675
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,740
What if I don't wanna pay for it right now?

676
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,580
What's your fucking problem?

677
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,020
These guys are giving us money to talk about

678
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
how great their product is.

679
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,140
You could say like, I wanna pay for this right now.

680
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,940
Nothing's gonna stop me from paying for this.

681
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,140
Take my money.

682
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,700
But we are gonna stop you,

683
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,060
because you're gonna Hulu Plus comp slash my brother.

684
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,180
Whoa, wanna try that again there, speed demon?

685
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,020
Whoa!

686
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,620
Whoa!

687
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,900
Did you just have a typo in your mouth?

688
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,980
Did you just have a vocal typo?

689
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,860
Hulu Plus dot com slash my brother.

690
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,460
You know it's a good mental typo

691
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,700
when you are trying to correct it as you say it.

692
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,780
Dot com slash my bro for, oh shit.

693
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Sorry, I got off the home row.

694
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,700
Hulu Plus dot com slash my brother,

695
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,180
and you get two weeks for free.

696
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,860
Go there right now.

697
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,700
I'm tired of dealing with you.

698
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,140
One more quick thing I want everybody to do.

699
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,620
Go to WednesdayWolf.com and make the world stranger.

700
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,620
Oh my shit, this stuff is awesome.

701
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,100
Yeah, what are we talking about here, paintings?

702
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,020
Yeah, it's paintings, drawings, it's kind of,

703
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,860
it reminds me a lot,

704
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,940
have you ever read the book The Hungry Caterpillar?

705
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,780
If you took those little illustrations

706
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,980
and ran them through like an LSD filter.

707
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,660
Yeah, a lot of these paintings are painted with,

708
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,140
and this is a quote, watercolor, ink, so far so good,

709
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,180
and various bodily fluids, not yet convicted of murder

710
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,420
is what this person says.

711
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,020
Great, great, great.

712
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,420
Our friends RushFreshTick and Chris Plant

713
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,020
have a video series called The Cooperatives

714
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,820
and they were actually turned into a piece of art.

715
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,660
That hasn't come down from my brother and me yet,

716
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,200
but I'm holding that hope.

717
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,500
There's some really great,

718
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,460
genuinely terrifying stuff in here.

719
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,380
A lot of Pokemon, which I appreciate.

720
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,340
I might buy one of them,

721
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,700
but I don't wanna accidentally touch someone else's jizz.

722
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,220
Do we get a no jizz guarantee on some of these paintings?

723
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,140
Wednesdaywolf.com and make the world stranger.

724
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,580
Go, go, you gotta look.

725
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,420
Be free. Just go look.

726
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,660
Just go look at it.

727
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,660
I got a message for Zach Doring.

728
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,820
That's a guess on that pronunciation.

729
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,620
It's from Feliza Doring.

730
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,260
I bet I didn't get either of those right,

731
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,220
and I'm just trying.

732
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,180
You got one out of four so far.

733
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,980
Okay, Zatch.

734
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,940
I am so proud of everything you've done

735
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,580
in the last couple of years.

736
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,620
I love you so much.

737
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,140
Congrats on 10 years of service

738
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,580
and welcome to civilian life.

739
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,780
Love, KK.

740
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,820
P.S., deployment emails have been taken to a new level.

741
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,500
So that's-

742
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,340
I don't know what that means,

743
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,780
but it sounds intense.

744
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,820
Zach, thank you so much for your service.

745
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,700
It is not specifically outlined

746
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,860
if you were in the military

747
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,860
or maybe some sort of underground secret spy crime ring.

748
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,180
He was in the upper Montana police.

749
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,140
In the upper Montana mounted police.

750
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,820
He was a barbarian in the upper Montana police force.

751
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,420
He was a potion alchemist.

752
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,220
Thank you for your help up there.

753
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
You know, the potion alchemist,

754
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,340
they don't see a lot of like field time,

755
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,500
but it's just as dangerous

756
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,100
because they're trying new spells every day,

757
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,540
and those shapes can blow up in your face.

758
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,180
People think the Bolt Rangers have it easy.

759
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,020
No.

760
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,980
And you think that they just like,

761
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,420
the goblins see the fog wall

762
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,620
and they're like, we'll stay back.

763
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,780
No, they'll step to it.

764
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,460
And fucking Zach, King beyond the fog wall,

765
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,020
stays there and keeps us all safe for 10 years.

766
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,860
So really it's like,

767
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,980
thank God for the upper Montana mounted police

768
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,780
because they're doing it so you don't have to.

769
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
Right.

770
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,180
Yeah, yeah.

771
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,700
They're mounted on chocobos.

772
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,340
I want to go to this place we've created.

773
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,900
I know!

774
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,740
Now I'm sold.

775
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,140
Now I know how Tolkien feels.

776
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,140
What's up?

777
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,140
My name is Jasper Redd,

778
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
co-host of the Goose Down,

779
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,580
along with the lovely Kimberly Clark.

780
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,700
And we want to invite you into the comfort and groove

781
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,060
of our podcast that encompasses the arts and entertainment.

782
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,060
You can check us out at maximalfund.org,

783
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,340
also available on iTunes.

784
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,180
See ya.

785
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,020
See ya.

786
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,380
So I have been in my school's,

787
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,900
there are program.

788
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,740
Theater?

789
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,540
Yes.

790
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,380
I'm sorry.

791
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,700
That was a bad pace for me.

792
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,900
Why are you so bad?

793
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,780
How did you break up a word midway through in a pace?

794
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,040
So I have been in my school's theater program

795
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,900
for two years now,

796
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,720
and I've yet to click with my drama teacher.

797
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,020
He's the kind of guy who picks favorites from his students

798
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,060
and I am not one of them.

799
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,340
His favorite students are always the one

800
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,980
he recommends to people

801
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,020
and gives the best roles on auditions.

802
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,820
I'm not a bad actor,

803
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,340
but he never really notices me

804
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,980
or acknowledges that I'm just as good as them.

805
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,420
Do you have any advice for me

806
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,060
about how to make him notice me

807
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,700
or make him like me more?

808
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,320
That's from unnoticed actress.

809
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,220
I have good news for you.

810
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,560
He is giving you the greatest gift.

811
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,560
He is giving you the drive and desire to become famous

812
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,980
and shove it back in his stupid face.

813
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,460
And also he's preparing you for a career

814
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,980
of what is going to,

815
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,560
and I'm sure you're gonna make it.

816
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,300
Listen, a lot of people come to us

817
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,380
and they say, I got big old stars in my eyes, ow!

818
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,200
And then we say, yeah.

819
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,340
But for you, I know that you're gonna make it.

820
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,540
You are going to face a lot of neglect.

821
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,820
A lot of neglect.

822
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,900
A lot of neglect.

823
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,620
You think you've tasted neglect?

824
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,160
You don't know fucking anything.

825
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,900
It's gonna get so much worse before it gets better.

826
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,820
It'll get better.

827
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
And you're gonna make it.

828
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,020
Ooh, someday I'm gonna see your name in lights,

829
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,420
but before I'm gonna see your name in shit.

830
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,860
You are on the perfect arc for superstardom.

831
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,340
Think about every actor or actress you've ever heard from.

832
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,320
How many of their stories start with,

833
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,220
well, from a young age, I was coddled

834
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,520
and I was coddled by everybody.

835
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,740
And I had a super healthy upbringing

836
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,660
and everybody was really nice to me

837
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,100
and that's why I'm famous today.

838
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,060
No, you have to start with nobody acknowledging

839
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,260
your existence until you make it.

840
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,860
Do you think that's 100% true?

841
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,620
Do you think like, I think maybe Keira Knightley

842
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,200
was like, from the womb, like,

843
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,020
let's get the, oh, we gotta get this kid famous.

844
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,860
She was genetically developed.

845
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,420
We gotta get the kid famous as fast as possible.

846
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,580
Get her, get on the movie, quick, go, go, go, go.

847
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,420
Look at her face.

848
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,240
Throw the camera.

849
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,080
Is there anything in the camera?

850
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,740
Give me a camera.

851
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,780
I'll write the script as we go.

852
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,040
Look at that face.

853
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,840
Listen, if you want a Rambo, right?

854
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,220
You gotta raise a Rambo, right?

855
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,140
You don't coddle them.

856
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,100
You gotta raise a Rambo.

857
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,700
There's two kinds of actors in this world.

858
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,540
There's actors-

859
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,020
There's Keira Knightley and Rambos.

860
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,880
There's Keira Knightley and there's Rambos, right?

861
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,440
You're either a Knightley or a Rambo.

862
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,920
You're either so coddled that you take it for granted

863
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,000
that everything's gonna come to you.

864
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,840
You don't work hard.

865
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,640
You're not out there pounding the pavement,

866
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,120
6 a.m. cattle call auditions until you make it big.

867
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,960
You hit that thing.

868
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,100
Director goes, that person, they've got the look.

869
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,720
I want them in my movie, right?

870
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,080
And if you're coddled, yeah, yeah,

871
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,480
maybe you're a Keira Knightley,

872
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,160
but that's literally one in billions.

873
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,740
Well, I would say for everybody,

874
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,680
that's definitely one in billions.

875
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,040
I wanna teach you a valuable lesson, unnoticed actress.

876
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,600
I am sorry that you're acting teachers

877
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,560
and not giving you the attention

878
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,640
that you so richly deserve.

879
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,920
You have great hits and podcasts,

880
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,160
but you are given an invaluable opportunity right now

881
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,000
to realize that when you are doing this as a profession,

882
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,120
and it's gonna be a lot of times

883
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,880
when you don't get the attention you deserve,

884
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,160
and it's a great opportunity for you to focus on the work.

885
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,800
I don't know what the work is,

886
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,000
but I've heard a lot of people talk about it.

887
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,320
It seems like something you should be focused on.

888
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,280
You try to cry in front of a mirror,

889
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,380
and you do that for just hours at a time.

890
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,220
Just, ah!

891
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,580
Ah!

892
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,500
Yeah, and you gotta put yourself in the head of people.

893
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,260
You know, like what would it be like

894
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,180
to be a guy who didn't like Syria?

895
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,500
Yeah, I'm Matthew McConaughey.

896
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,900
All right, okay.

897
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,620
Okay, okay.

898
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,440
Nailed it.

899
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,340
So that was me, that's me,

900
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,160
and what you just heard was the work,

901
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,020
and I just became a little bit of a better actor.

902
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,860
Just like that.

903
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,060
Give me another one.

904
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,940
I'm the president, Barack Obama.

905
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,220
Hi, let me sign that bill.

906
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,040
Let me sign that bill.

907
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,140
Ooh, I don't know about drones.

908
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,140
So then that was more, now I could probably do him.

909
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,780
Now can you do Bronco-Bama?

910
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,500
Yeah, I'm Bronco-Bama.

911
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Let me hide, let me, ooh, look out for that rattler.

912
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,340
Hand me that bill to sign into law.

913
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,300
He's our Wild West president.

914
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,540
So now that's, I'm a little bit better.

915
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,700
I'm gonna go audition, actually.

916
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,260
I'm gonna stop the podcast right here

917
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,460
and go audition just as.

918
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,300
All right, quick edit.

919
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,640
Quick edit, let me just run out.

920
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,480
I got it.

921
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,640
What role?

922
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,260
Bronco-Bama.

923
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,780
The role of Bronco-Bama in a local auto dealership

924
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,300
commercial, I'm assuming?

925
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,820
Bronco-Bama, and it's in City Slickers 3.

926
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,920
Shitty Slickers.

927
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,860
It's called Shitty Slickers,

928
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,740
because they just, like, they know.

929
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,580
Yeah.

930
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,780
They know.

931
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,080
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

932
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,060
I want to see Shitty Slickers.

933
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,540
Yeah, now I really want to watch that.

934
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,420
Okay, so now I need to go to Upper Montana,

935
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,700
and I need to see Shitty Slickers,

936
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,820
and neither will ever happen,

937
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,340
because our ideas are too beautiful to exist.

938
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,500
Too often, people take movie titles,

939
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,020
and then they convert them into, like, porn movie titles.

940
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,140
I wish that more people would say,

941
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,860
but what if I just made a really bad version of this movie?

942
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,700
Yeah.

943
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,520
I'd call it Shitty Slickers.

944
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,360
Yeah, pretty good.

945
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,240
I mean, it's not a bad, it's not a remake.

946
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,980
Original script, written by that fucking dude

947
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,500
who writes all the X movies that are so bad.

948
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,520
If I wrote a show about four women

949
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,600
leading really boring, stupid lives,

950
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,220
I think I'd call it Sex and the Shitty.

951
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,060
Shh.

952
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,900
Shh.

953
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,740
Shh.

954
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,580
How about a Yahoo?

955
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,420
Yeah, please.

956
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,240
This Yahoo was sent in by Jackie.

957
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,080
Thank you, Jackie.

958
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,880
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

959
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,300
Is it too late to do Caroline and the Shitty?

960
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,140
Yeah, it's way too late.

961
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:08,960
Okay, fine.

962
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,500
Yeah, you're just doing City now.

963
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,260
I know, I've tapped this well.

964
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,460
This user's been deleted, been suspended from the Matrix.

965
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,300
Not like this.

966
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,120
Send Shitty.

967
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,960
Great.

968
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,220
This anonymous deleted user.

969
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,980
Do we, are we just gonna sit here

970
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,340
and think of other movies that have City in the title?

971
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,660
Yes.

972
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,500
Babe Pig in the Shitty.

973
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,920
I was just about to do Babe Pig in the Shippy.

974
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,860
Excuse me.

975
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,220
All right.

976
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,060
Okay.

977
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,100
Can we move on?

978
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,820
Yes, I have one other thing to say.

979
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,660
Sex and the Shitty 2.

980
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,100
The Legend of Curly's Gold.

981
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,940
All right.

982
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,760
Shitty of Angels.

983
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,600
Great.

984
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,500
Okay.

985
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,320
I'm trying to think.

986
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,160
Okay.

987
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,000
Can I do one?

988
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,840
Yes.

989
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,660
I need to think.

990
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,500
Wasn't there a,

991
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,340
what was the movie about the mouse

992
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,940
that Michael J. Fox had a voice for?

993
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,640
Stuart Little?

994
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,480
Stuart Shittle?

995
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,420
It doesn't have City in it at all.

996
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,380
It's nothing, it has nothing to do with City

997
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,700
and I thought you were gonna say New Jack Shitty.

998
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,080
Oh, that's New Jack Shitty.

999
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:13,920
All right.

1000
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,740
Okay.

1001
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,700
So this deleted user asks.

1002
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,520
Yes.

1003
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,860
Is there a way to incorporate a third nipple into sex?

1004
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,500
I have a third superfluous nipple below my left breast.

1005
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,540
Although sensation is diminished

1006
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,100
compared to my other nipple.

1007
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,740
I almost said regular nipples,

1008
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,020
but that's hateful, I suppose.

1009
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,300
That's offensive.

1010
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,140
My typical nipples.

1011
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,500
My tip, my tipicles.

1012
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,540
I still have enough sensation

1013
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,140
to enjoy it being touched by a woman during sex.

1014
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,700
However, during sexual encounters,

1015
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,380
who calls them that?

1016
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,820
Most of the girls I've known have been turned off

1017
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,420
or even slightly frightened by it.

1018
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,380
Oh, no.

1019
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,900
Is it really that bizarre to want stimulation

1020
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,600
in this third extra erogenous zone?

1021
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,060
Or should I feel guilty

1022
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,140
and regard this as a birth defect and not a blessing?

1023
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,180
Well, I learned a lot about third nipples

1024
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,380
at a wedding I went to recently

1025
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,580
from a friend who just left med school.

1026
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,220
He graduated, he didn't leave it.

1027
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,660
That like-

1028
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,780
I hope he left it after.

1029
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,000
Nipples, third nipples aren't like

1030
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,620
what I imagined that they were,

1031
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,280
what Hollywood has made them out to be.

1032
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,120
Which is like-

1033
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:24,940
You were picturing like a whole nother nipple.

1034
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,860
I was thinking about like areolas.

1035
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,540
But no, like any, like you can have just like

1036
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,460
a little bumpus, a little tipple right there

1037
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,120
as long as it's on the milk line.

1038
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,660
So we can be like down like on your belly

1039
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,740
as long as it's on the milk line, it's probably a nipple.

1040
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,760
And I'm worried because I have like a freckle there

1041
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,040
that I've always had.

1042
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,900
Maybe it's not a freckle.

1043
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,300
Maybe it's a little bit more insidious

1044
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,460
and a lot more erogenous than that.

1045
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,420
Maybe that's like your two and a half nipple.

1046
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,140
What if from, I think the problem with the women

1047
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,740
that you're dating is that they're not ready.

1048
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,340
But I don't think, I think you need to prepare them

1049
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,020
without spoiling it exactly what it is.

1050
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,380
So try this.

1051
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,580
Once you're, when you're at dinner,

1052
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,100
every once in a while, just start doing a little shake

1053
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,660
back and forth in your seat and sing like a little like,

1054
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,980
I have got a surprise for you.

1055
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,820
No.

1056
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:21,620
A little better, I have got something secret and special.

1057
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,900
There will be a moonlight revelation tonight.

1058
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,700
I hope that you like fun buttons.

1059
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,420
Don't make a mistake before 30 time

1060
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,620
or you're gonna miss this special surprise.

1061
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,260
All your friends will talk about my fun button

1062
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,780
that you've never got to see.

1063
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,440
Also, I'm fucking all your friends.

1064
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,900
Could you do something where every time

1065
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,260
like the waiter brings dinner, you say like,

1066
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,740
I don't know, do I want two broccolis?

1067
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,060
Well, I guess I want three.

1068
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,140
Cause that's one more.

1069
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,780
It's nice to have more, right?

1070
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,020
I don't think this is a curse.

1071
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,180
I think it's a beautiful blessing.

1072
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,740
Cause you will, this person categorically, mathematically

1073
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:16,740
will experience more erogenous pleasure

1074
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,140
than any of us could ever aspire to.

1075
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,380
I experienced more nipple pleasure this morning

1076
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,180
than you will in your entire life.

1077
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:29,180
Like when we reach the end and God tallies up our score.

1078
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,860
When he sorts the light into heaven by nipple pleasure.

1079
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,300
No, I mean, it's not, it doesn't have anything to do like,

1080
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,900
you know, St. Peter letting us in any, like a queue.

1081
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,980
I'm saying there's like a-

1082
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,900
But just in the book.

1083
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,500
I'm saying he's going to take it to the leaderboards, Mo.

1084
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,800
And then there's going to be nipple pleasure.

1085
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,580
And then this person will have beaten all of us by 50%.

1086
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,700
Well, Mike, a lot of our contestants today

1087
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,020
have experienced a lot of nipple pleasure,

1088
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,280
but the number one is this weird guy with three nipples.

1089
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,220
All right, let's go to that radical rock.

1090
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,160
Mo.

1091
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,180
Heaven in my mind, it's just an agro crack.

1092
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,580
And it's not like the basic agro crack.

1093
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,700
Fuck that basic shit.

1094
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,500
I'm talking about the global guts crack

1095
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,380
with like steam and shit coming off.

1096
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,820
Like the one that like, with like buzz saw traps and shit.

1097
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,380
And I imagine that as you walk up it,

1098
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,940
instead of hitting actuators,

1099
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,020
you're like high-fiving like Gandhi and like,

1100
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,740
just all the, oh, there's eye sign, high five.

1101
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,880
Gandhi, why were you so chill?

1102
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,460
Check the chest.

1103
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,740
Oh shit, I didn't know.

1104
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,820
Yeah, yeah, I kept it hidden.

1105
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,420
That one's not in the diaries, but you know.

1106
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,500
Do you think that if, I mean, if you have a third nipple,

1107
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,300
isn't that God's way of telling you

1108
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,420
you should invite another partner into your sexual liaisons?

1109
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,940
Because it seems like you'll never get full stimulation

1110
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,140
with just one measly part.

1111
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,820
Or one partner also has an extra nipple,

1112
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,740
six nipples, two bodies, one bed.

1113
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,140
Six nipples, two bodies.

1114
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,540
Because it's got to match up like

1115
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,460
when you plug a plug into an outlet,

1116
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,780
you just have the two-prong outlet,

1117
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,180
but you got the three-prong plug.

1118
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,020
You're like, it's not gonna work.

1119
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,740
That's why you gotta invite another friend

1120
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,540
who only has one nipple to be your sexual adapter.

1121
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,660
Nice.

1122
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,960
I think it's God's way of saying

1123
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,180
you could be a lot more laissez-faire

1124
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,060
with your nipple security.

1125
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,260
Because if you lose it, good news,

1126
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,940
back up, just scoot it up.

1127
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,460
If a girl.

1128
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,020
God, should I go skydiving?

1129
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,260
I don't know, fuck it.

1130
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,100
You got three?

1131
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,940
You got three.

1132
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,760
What's the worst that could happen?

1133
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,860
I'm gonna give you a bonus one so you could get risky.

1134
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,920
YOLO and also,

1135
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,980
hold on.

1136
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,820
Yep.

1137
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,640
Yuh.

1138
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,620
What were you trying for?

1139
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,380
Which is, you have three nipples.

1140
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,700
Whatever sound you made, it's like the foley work

1141
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,100
for the thing stalking me down a metal hallway.

1142
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,540
That's the noise you made with your nipple.

1143
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,740
That was the original song,

1144
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,140
but Drake couldn't find a thing to rhyme it with.

1145
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,580
You only have three nipples.

1146
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,420
Pfft.

1147
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,860
Crud.

1148
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,980
Well, folks, that's gonna do it for us.

1149
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,860

If you were at Max Fun Con this past weekend,

1164
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,900
you probably got a chance to hang out with him,

1165
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,840
you piece of shit.

1166
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,700
Sorry, I'm just jealous.

1167
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,140
I bet that'd be a cool life experience.

1168
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,980
No big deal.

1169
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,820
Not a big deal.

1170
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,140
Thank you to everybody else who came to our New York shows.

1171
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:06,980
Thank you so much.

1172
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,380
And everybody who's gonna be at LA,

1173
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,680
we can't wait to see you.

1174
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,300
It's gonna be nice.

1175
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,120
We love you.

1176
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,960
Bring money.

1177
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,620
Do you wanna thank Tweetos?

1178
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,320
Oh yeah, thanks to people tweeting about the show

1179

1180

who made some of our mom's famous chest bars

1181
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,020

00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,940
a video of a horse at us, which is fine.

00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,780
I'll take that.

I appreciate that.

Sure.

1191
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,260
It's a horse playing a saxophone, it looks like.

1192
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,100
Yeah, why not?

1193
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,140

Martin is an adorable baby who's tweeting about our show,

1200
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,060
so I'm not sure what's going on there.

1201
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,820
And everybody else, thanks so much.

1202
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,740
Let's shut it down.

1203
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,820
All right.

1206
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,860
It's by Yahoo Answers user Chief Keef, who asks,

1207
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,780

Well, think about it.

1209
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,100

My name's Justin McElroy.

I'm Travis McElroy.

1213
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,260
Cliff McElroy, you thinking about him?

1214
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,820
It's been my brother and my brother and me.

1215
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,860
Kiss your dad, spray on the lips, think about it.

1216
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,700
Just think about it.

1217
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,540
Think about it.

1218
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,380

Have you made vacation plans yet?

1241
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,140
The second annual Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival

1242
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,900
is ready to set sail this summer,

1243
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,300
and we want to see you on board.

1244
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,620

It all takes place July 25th through 28th,

1247

en route to Nassau, The Bahamas.

1248
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,540
And frankly, we've impressed even ourselves

1249
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,880
with this lineup of bullseye favorites.

1250
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,140
You've got Moshe Kasher.

1251
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,860
I was in an airport recently.

1252
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,840
You ever see somebody and you're just like,

1253
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,540

00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,140

Morgan Murphy.

1260
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,860
I don't know if you guys know what a facelift is.

1261
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,060
It's when they take your face skin

1262
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,860
and they peel it away from your face,

1263
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,220
and in that little space there,

1264
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,180
that's where they find your self-esteem.

1265
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,900
And besides them, Greg Barrett, Chris Fairbanks,

1266
