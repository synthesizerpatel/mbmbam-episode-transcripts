1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show from the modern

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,440
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin Andrew McElroy.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,040
Guys, what's still funny? Very little, it seems.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,600
What's still funny is the thing for me. You know what, Justin? I don't know about

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,240
funny. I don't know from funny anymore. What's still funny? We're supposed to punch

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,480
up, not down. Everybody's down. Yeah, we can punch side to side.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,440
I can punch you, and you can punch Griffin. Let's try punching each other.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:24,160
Lateral punches. Let's give that a shot. Okay, let me go. Travis, the noise of you

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,280
eating peanut M&Ms when we began was profane. But I did it off mic, Justin.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
No, you didn't, bud, because I just told you what you were eating.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,840
No, sorry, sorry. I did it off audience mic. The audience didn't have to. Just you.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
Just you, my brother. Yeah, but I got it.

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,760
I don't like this. I don't like us punching side to side.

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,720
No punching sideways. Travis, did you send questions?

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,240
We going to do those, or it feels... Maybe not questions this time. I don't know.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
Questions feels... Okay, let's talk about... Listen,

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,920
this is negative for everyone. Let's acknowledge something up front.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,720
This situation is negative for everyone to different degrees.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,280
Yes. This is not news to us.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:17,360
We are going to push forward in the best way that we can sort of manage in our sort of twisted...

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,040
Let's shut up. First of all, can you guys fucking wait for the South Park episode about this?

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Holy shit, guys. I said that fucking phrase out loud.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,560
Oh, no. But I don't think they're in production.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
I think everybody stopped production. See, you can't even get like a little twist

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,560
of South Park humor joke going right now. Hey, can I tell you guys something real

31
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,240
from the heart? Yeah, sure.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
I guess. I had a lot of funny stuff to say

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
about South Park, but go ahead, Travis. I know.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm so happy to be talking to you two boys. Oh, God, I know.

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,480
Because if I'm being honest, even though I spent time with my family,

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,960
I have spent a little too much time with myself. Oh, I see.

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,520
Yeah, last night, I found the entire season of Boy Meets World on Disney+.

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,160
So I was watching some episodes of that, which led me to thinking about the Lawrence Brothers,

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,560
which, and this is not an exaggeration for the podcast, I became very worried about the

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Lawrence Brothers. I hadn't heard from them in a while.

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,320
And I found myself having real emotional investment in making sure that the Lawrence

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,200
Brothers are doing okay. In the context of the global pandemic?

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,120
Okay, so you're just saying you're worried about early 2019 Lawrence Brothers.

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Yeah, I'm just saying I've kept up with most brothers in the game.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
I know what's going on, but we get the newsletters. Right, but the Lawrence Brothers,

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,800
I realized it's been a solid grip since I heard anything about those fools.

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,040
And I was worried about them, but they're Wikipedias.

48
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,520
It seems like everything's okay. Good, good, good.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,320
I think that's the secret, right? We're all anxious people.

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,680
And when I say all, I mean literally every person listening to this.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,240
And if you are listening to this and you don't have anxiety, what are you doing, man?

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah, give me a snoot of that. Yeah, let me have a huff of whatever

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
you're huffing, pal, because I would love to ride that Bronco.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,480
But, you know, it's maybe you can occupy your anxiety with something completely demented,

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,920
like what are the Lawrence Brothers up to? And then you can-

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,200
Griffin, let me be clear, not what are they up to? Are they okay?

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,720
Are they okay? Are they good?

58
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
Are they doing well? Are they-

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Here's the thing, it's three child actors in that family,

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,360
and all three of them seem to be doing okay, statistically.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,000
But they're in cloaking mode. Yes.

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,440
Here is one bad thing, is I will tell you guys up front,

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
I wanted to come hot with a fun segment.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,120
Not a lot of innovation in the fast food space right now.

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,440
Shoot, Juice. That innovation has ground to a halt.

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
And I know what you're thinking, it seemed to have been all upside so far

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
with this unpleasantness, but now there's a downside as well.

68
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,040
And it is fast food innovation has ground to a halt.

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,520
When we needed them most. I know.

70
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,200
Here's a new innovation, if any of the fast food industry is listening.

71
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,520
Yeah. What if it was-

72
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
And what excuse do they have? Yeah, right?

73
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,640
What if it was like food, but I went to the store and bought it,

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,760
and then I could make it at home, so no other human hands ever touched it?

75
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,480
That's them's groceries. That's groceries.

76
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
Yeah, you made groceries. You know what?

77
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,680
I knew it as soon as I said it, I was like, yeah, you're right.

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,040
Okay, what about this? A bigger drive-through window,

79
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,800
so like eight people can be getting food all at once.

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,720
We're veering towards food train, Trav.

81
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,040
So yeah, we've also covered food train.

82
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,280
Okay, food train, if you are not aware of the deep lore,

83
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,320
food train is an innovation where all the world's food would be art.

84
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,040
No, sorry, all the nation's food would be on a single train

85
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,920
that would be like a roving food truck

86
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,840
that could move along and expand or attract capacity as needed.

87
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,480
Yeah, right.

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,480
And crucially, it was staffed by sexy robots.

89
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,600
Yeah, because the full surface was so hot.

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Yeah, whose bodies were grills, and they all look like Mark Ruffalo.

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,640
I've watched this bit recently.

92
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,920
I forgot that part.

93
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,040
The sexy Ruffalo bots and everybody wanted to get on the train

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,720
because it looks so sexy and hot.

95
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,240
Would we be, as a nation, in a better or worse scenario

96
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,320
if the nation had heeded our warnings about food train

97
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,440
some three years ago or however long ago it was

98
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
when we sort of breathed that into existence?

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,920
I think one would fix the other.

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,400
I think one would fix the other.

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,480
Which one would fix the other one, Griffin?

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,800
Yep.

103
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,200
Oh, like Seabiscuit fixed all of us, that kind of thing.

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,680
But also how we kind of fix Seabiscuit, if you think about it.

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Thank you, we did.

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,520
We did fix Seabiscuit.

107
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,800
Because we made a movie about him,

108
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,640
and without that, he's just another horse.

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,560
Hey, do you guys think we could get a bunch of podcasters

110
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
together and make a viral video of us all singing

111
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,640
like Wild Honey Pie or...

112
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,120
Actually, I think we, Griffin, I hate to sort of tone police you,

113
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,480
I think we're switching back to popular.

114
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,800
I think we're gonna stop calling videos and stuff viral,

115
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
and I think we're just gonna start calling that popular again.

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, that's good, I like that.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,880
I like that a lot.

118
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,480
But we could do like, we could get fucking Joe Rogan

119
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,080
and do like Dizzy Miss Lizzy or like Eleanor Rigby or something.

120
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
That's so close-minded.

121
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,520
What about Sex and Candy by Marcy's Playground?

122
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,280
That could be super strong, and I would think that, Trav,

123
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,640
we would make that video, Travis?

124
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,040
Yeah.

125
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,200
And I think it would do something out there.

126
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,320
Well, because here's what I'll say,

127
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,840
here's what I see an opportunity for, baby boom, right?

128
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,560
Everybody was talking before this, there's not enough babies.

129
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,120
Everyone agreed.

130
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
I have not been particularly horny the past month or so, Trav.

131
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,560
Well, that's what I'm saying.

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,600
We're all locked up, but we don't have the hornet.

133
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,280
What if we do Sex and Candy and everyone's like, oh shit.

134
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,600
Oh, actually, yeah, let's reproduce.

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,160
Yeah, right?

136
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,640
They hear that, as everyone can agree,

137
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,200
Sex and Candy by Marcy's Playground is the sexiest song on Earth

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
because it's about the two things people like most.

139
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Right there on the 10, right there on the 10.

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,960
And so you hear Sex and Candy and you're like,

141
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,400
well, I really don't feel like it,

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,960
and I think we were supposed to socially distance each other,

143
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,240
even in our own homes.

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm not certain about that part, but-

145
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,720
I tried to convince my kids that that was the case.

146
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
They just weren't buying it.

147
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,320
Yeah.

148
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,280
So let's get Robert Kralwich on the phone,

149
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,320
and we'll get him to drop a verse of Sex and Candy.

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Justin, do you know him?

151
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
Or just the whole thing.

152
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
Get Robert Kralwich, yeah, that'll be our Imagine video.

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,280
It's just Robert Kralwich singing all of Sex and Candy front to back.

154
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,520
Yep.

155
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,680
Can I tell you guys the traveling thing

156
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
about some of these ideas that we tend to throw out there?

157
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,040
They're getting you too horny.

158
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,720
No, it's that I now have this bad part of my brain that's like,

159
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
what the fuck else are they doing?

160
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,760
You know, like we could get-

161
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,520
I've been thinking like, is this the moment that we should try

162
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,720
to get like bag some big celebs?

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:28,960
Yeah.

164
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,520
Like, yeah.

165
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,320
You know, business as usual for us, I mean, except if I can find the time

166
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,840
to keep coming down here and doing this.

167
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,040
But like, I know a lot of Hollywood and TV are sort of in suspension right now.

168
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,560
We had a couple of projects kind of thrown into disarray by this.

169
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,400
So we are speaking from a reasonably educated stance here.

170
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,240
Should we try to bag some big ones?

171
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
I think we could get a Richard Gere.

172
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Like that feels like a reach for not just like scale wise,

173
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
but also just like demographic wise.

174
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,640
I feel like a Richard Gere is out of our reach in many ways,

175
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
but maybe a Richard Gere type.

176
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not even saying necessarily Richard Gere.

177
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:17,840
We could-

178
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
No, Richard Gere's good, Trav.

179
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,400
Let's talk about that for a second.

180
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,760
Because what I like about that is extremely difficult to attain.

181
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,640
And I think also my best guess would be a very bad match for the energy of this program.

182
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,200
Between those two, I think that's an interesting submission.

183
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,080
Griffin, who do you have?

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,560
Can we get a- No, it's Richard Gere, Justin.

185
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,440
Because we're going to give Richard Gere podcast glow up, baby.

186
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,920
Yes!

187
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,360
We're going to turn this motherfucker into a real popular sensation on the internet.

188
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
It's really hard to not say that word.

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
And I think that we can make him good at Fortnite.

190
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
I think that we can make him talk about TikTok.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,080
I think we can make him whip a Nae Nae.

192
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
What up, GearHeads?

193
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
It's me, Richie Boy.

194
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,560
Coming at you live.

195
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,840
Be sure to smash that like and subscribe button.

196
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,720
GearHeads is good.

197
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,600
Smash that.

198
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,400
Smash them.

199
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,520
And I'm going to open up a box of small toys.

200
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,520
And this one's for kids.

201
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm Richard Gere.

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,960
What's in this box?

203
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,400
It's going to have some marbles and hard candies in there.

204
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
Hey kids, smash the like, bud.

205
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,840
I just got legitimately excited to watch Richard Gere open some blind bags

206
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
with complete enthusiasm.

207
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah, I got the new LOLs, glow ups, season three, rip them open.

208
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
This is advertorial content.

209
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
Just got to get that out there.

210
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,600
And remember guys, if you're not sleeping on Casper, you're not really sleeping.

211
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,520
Okay, so let's open these bags.

212
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,440
This is how we're going to whip this thing's ass.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
Is not saying what can Richard Gere do for us?

214
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,640
Yes.

215
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
But what can we do for Richard Gere?

216
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,840
Yes, yes.

217
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,240
And by Richard Gere, sometimes I also mean other people who actually need help in the world.

218
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,560
Well, sure.

219
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,960
Right now, hypothetically, we're going to start with making Richard Gere a top tier YouTuber.

220
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,160
And if I could just sort of do, maybe I get in touch with Ninja and I say,

221
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
Ninja, can Richard Gere be you for a day?

222
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,960
Yeah, that would be good.

223
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,120
And Ninja gets to live, trading spaces with Richard Gere and Ninja would be good.

224
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
Richard Gere has to go on and try.

225
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,760
If you just try to log on to Ninja's computer, if you can figure out how to start on Twitch,

226
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,600
you can phone three 13 year olds that you know and they can try to help you.

227
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,480
See, and he's going to fucking get it.

228
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,360
No, we're releasing this on Monday.

229
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,160
We're probably fine.

230
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,720
Fine.

231
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,480
Listen, I've seen some of our celebrities already.

232
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Listen, everybody's saying, imagine that was great.

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,240
We were-

234
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,800
We love that.

235
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
Not asked to get in on that.

236
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,400
I got to give a shout out to my man, Sam Neal, who we have talked about during the Celebrity Wine,

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
Why Not segment.

238
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,880
Sam Neal put out a video of himself and this is the entirety of the video.

239
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,520
Sam Neal says, hey, I'm doing okay.

240
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,120
Of course, he looks fucking great.

241
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,440
Yeah.

242
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,640
So sexy.

243
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,200
Out on his like vineyard, wherever, hold up like, well, I'm in isolation.

244
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
He's like, I don't know.

245
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,520
I didn't know what to do with myself.

246
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,360
So I washed all my shoes.

247
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
And then he shows a shot of all his clean shoes.

248
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
He's like, but I don't have anywhere to wear them.

249
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,960
But man, and then he picks one up and just gets a snoot fall.

250
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,280
He's like, man, do they smell good?

251
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,240
Anyway, hope your family is doing well.

252
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,160
Sam Neal, that's the best you got.

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
This is amazing because it's-

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,760
Man, you've been in isolation for four days and you're already washing your shoes?

255
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,280
It sets a bar for us, doesn't it?

256
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,040
Because I don't know the decorum.

257
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,080
I would love to make the world fucking laugh and share a Pepsi,

258
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,120
but I also don't want to be, you know, unrespectful.

259
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,800
But now I have a bottom, a baseline of like what I can put out into the world.

260
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,840
And it's me in my own vineyard, huffing my clean, expensive shoes.

261
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
That's the bottom of it.

262
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
Top of it is the imagine video.

263
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,040
Now I want to put out a video that's like me in my vineyard.

264
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,880
And I'm like, I'm in isolation and I didn't know what to do.

265
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,440
So I just did a bunch of research on the Lawrence brothers to make sure they were okay.

266
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
And then I just like huffed some pictures of the Lawrence brothers.

267
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,440
Like maybe I've printed out their Wikipedia.

268
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,240
And I say, man, this Wikipedia smells great.

269
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,160
And then I just eat the pages.

270
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,360
That's good too.

271
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Or we could have Richard Gere and Sam Neal have a grape fight in his vineyard.

272
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
But from six feet away.

273
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,600
From six feet away.

274
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,160
You got to.

275
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,960
Should we do a question just to get our sea legs under us?

276
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,360
I want to say one other thing.

277
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
Slightly more seriously, but it's on my heart.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
And I don't know how to like process this otherwise.

279
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,960
We have gone at, for the past, like let's call it nine and a half years.

280
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,240
We've tried, cause we've been doing the show for 10 almost.

281
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
Gonna be a big anniversary soon.

282
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,400
But we've been doing the show for a while.

283
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,400
And for the bulk of it and like most of our professional careers,

284
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,320
we've made it our goal, like try to have fun without hurting people

285
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,840
and trying not to like make things worse or make people feel bad really

286
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
is what I should say.

287
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,400
But I feel like everyone is in the same boat in a sense,

288
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,520
which should be like easier to make that easier.

289
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,960
But everybody's in very different boats

290
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,120
because it's going to impact everybody differently.

291
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040
So we're just trying, we're going to try.

292
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,600
I don't know.

293
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
It's a tough time.

294
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm obviously like, again, I have to put this like corollary and everything,

295
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,600
but like it's harder for a lot of people.

296
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
It's easier for some people, I'm sure.

297
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
So we're trying, we're going to try our best

298
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
and it'll be a learning process.

299
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
But like, we're not going to stop.

300
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,200
We can't stop.

301
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,680
No, we could.

302
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,560
We could.

303
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,160
I mean, yeah, but they canceled all our dang tours.

304
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,400
So we do have to keep the lights on.

305
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
To be fair, I've got nothing else to do.

306
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,840
Nothing else to do.

307
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,440
So please, you know, hang in there with us

308
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,640
and we will hang in there with you

309
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,200
and we'll get through this thing together

310
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
and it will continue to be like the show,

311
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,640
but it'll be different because everything's different now.

312
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,240
But we're still here to provide an oasis for you

313
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,800
in as much as we can.

314
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
Drink our cool waters.

315
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,680
Drink these calm, cool waters.

316
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
Drink a sip of these calm, cool waters

317
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,080
and we're going to do our best to make this fun for everybody.

318
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,960
Obviously, if you're already struggling,

319
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,680
I know a lot of people, especially in like service industries

320
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,600
and restaurants, bars, et cetera,

321
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,120
that are already like in pain and we love you

322
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,440
and hang in there.

323
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,960
Justin, that was very nice.

324
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,720
Thanks, Travis.

325
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,120
You like didn't, you barely even let me finish

326
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,680
before you said that.

327
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,120
So I feel like you had that queued up.

328
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,080
No, it's just so exciting.

329
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,200
I really didn't mean it.

330
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,360
I thought it could have been better.

331
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,240
Oh, well.

332
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Wow.

333
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,560
Okay, well, you can punch it up in editing.

334
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,000
Maybe add some strings.

335
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
Sure, let me add like some like.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,960
Oh, let me.

337
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,200
Woo, go Justin.

338
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
Woo, slam dunk.

339
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,480
Griffin, you can edit this in wherever.

340
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,440
Okay, and I'll drop that in.

341
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
And let me do this one.

342
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,120
You the man.

343
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,640
That was good.

344
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,760
My son's gonna wake up from his nap.

345
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,560
Travis, I have to ask you about these questions real quick.

346
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,600
What epoch of human civilization are they from, would you say?

347
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,760
They're from the before time.

348
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Okay, well, that'll be fun.

349
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,000
We have a limited supply of these bad boys.

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
Yeah, this is from all the way back March 16th.

351
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,440
Oh, I'm looking at currently.

352
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
Oh, and they're all titled,

353
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,480
roommate keeps drinking their own pee?

354
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,840
Question mark, question mark, question mark.

355
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,680
So this is like 1700 of those.

356
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,280
So that'll be a hot topic.

357
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I actually have a question here, can't, may I?

358
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,480
No.

359
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,000
Rittle me piss, boys.

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,960
Oh my God.

361
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
I'd rather drink my own pee.

362
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,480
It's the thing that's gonna get us out of this funk.

363
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,920
Rittle me piss, Justin.

364
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
I would argue that the thing that's gonna get us out of the funk

365
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,720
is doing the thing that you usually do.

366
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,440
But this is good.

367
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,280
Actually, I would rather do this now, Juice,

368
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
where it's at the beginning,

369
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,800
and then we can recover from it

370
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
instead of having it hit us in the middle

371
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
and knock us off balance.

372
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
Give me a feast,

373
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360
give me something I can really sink my fucking teeth into, Trav.

374
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,400
This one I find, I think it's revolutionary.

375
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,040
Are you ready?

376
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,240
Let me make a meal of it.

377
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,320
There are three ants.

378
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,800
The first one is at the front.

379
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,560
Second one in the middle and third one at the back.

380
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,720
The front one says that behind me there are five ants.

381
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
The middle one says that behind me there are three ants.

382
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,360
And the back one says that there are eight ants in front of me.

383
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
How can this be?

384
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,920
Holy shit, Travis.

385
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,680
I cannot even visualize what you are saying.

386
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,040
Do you need me to read it again, Justin?

387
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,280
I mean, I know the version of this riddle

388
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,800
where the numbers aren't just fucking number pasta

389
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,920
just kind of thrown in a bowl and stirred all around.

390
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,320
This one was sent to us by Michael.

391
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,200
Do you need to hear it again?

392
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,880
No, I mean, they're walking in a circle,

393
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,720
but why are there more ants?

394
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,520
Well, the one in front says behind me there are five.

395
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
The middle one says behind me there are three.

396
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,000
And the back one says in front of me there are eight.

397
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Did you guys give up?

398
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,120
Oh, they're walking in front of a mirror.

399
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,800
And it's a circle.

400
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,560
They're a circle walking in front of a mirror.

401
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,680
Good guess.

402
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,320
Good guess.

403
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,360
Justin, any guesses?

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
No, Travis, I don't have any guesses.

405
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
Well, the answer is simple.

406
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
They are all liars.

407
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,480
Okay.

408
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,320
You can't.

409
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,520
You can't do that.

410
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
This is why I love this because this is revolutionary

411
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
because this could be like, you know,

412
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,200
a father and son are in a plane crash

413
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,240
and the father dies and the son is rushed to the hospital

414
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,080
but when he gets there, the doctor says,

415
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,800
I can't operate on this child because he's my son.

416
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,520
How can this be?

417
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
Answer, he's lying.

418
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,040
We could just have all kinds of questions like this.

419
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,880
What can you put in a barrel to make it lighter?

420
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
A fucking lie.

421
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,720
A lie.

422
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,000
What's red and white and green all over?

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,560
Nothing.

424
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,680
I lied.

425
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,200
Travis has lied to you.

426
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,560
Okay, here's a question.

427
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,840
My friend is getting a vasectomy soon

428
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,560
and the doctor said he could choose any music he likes.

429
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,720
The doctor warned he would likely associate this music

430
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
with the procedure forever afterwards.

431
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,920
Any recommendations?

432
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,040
That's from Sniptoon.

433
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
I can only imagine.

434
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,800
Is that one?

435
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,360
Is that anything?

436
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,240
Well, Justin, it seemed like you were coming at this

437
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,280
from the position of let's put a stinker song in there

438
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,640
that you're not gonna be sort of like poisoned by.

439
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,600
You know what I mean?

440
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,120
I can only imagine.

441
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,320
But Justin, you seem to quite enjoy your set.

442
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
Yeah, that's what I was trying to capture

443
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,480
was the sort of spirit of rejoicing.

444
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,040
Oh, I see.

445
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
A hymn of sorts.

446
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
I wish I had had this option because my vasectomy,

447
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,920
the doctors just talked about a bunch of garbage,

448
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,840
a bunch of nonsense.

449
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,560
Do you remember?

450
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,360
Remember any of it?

451
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,160
It was in a sort of Twilight state.

452
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,560
Wait, they gave you Twilight sleep?

453
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,240
We did an episode right after I did it.

454
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
I'm sure there's like more details there,

455
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,360
but my brain has not held on to them.

456
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,680
I should go back and listen to it.

457
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,120
Is it just one song long?

458
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
It seemed much longer than that.

459
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,400
They're really...

460
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,600
What linked this song?

461
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
Is this like an American Pie sort of deal?

462
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,280
Or is it more of a...

463
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm gonna do In a God of DeVita, please.

464
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,200
Yeah, because I really want you to take your time down there, yes.

465
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,160
Justin, I'm assuming one of the things that the doctor said

466
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,520
when they were down there was something like,

467
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,040
did you get...

468
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,440
You gotta check out this dude's nuts.

469
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,480
Something like that.

470
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Did you see this dude's huge nuts?

471
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
Something like that.

472
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
I do remember him saying like,

473
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,240
wow, these are so regular.

474
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,120
Just a normal kind that everybody has.

475
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,360
This just right in the middle of the median.

476
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,400
The whole thing.

477
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,280
It's just so average.

478
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
You see him from the outside and you're like,

479
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,360
whoa, big nuts.

480
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
But you get in there.

481
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,680
Not that big, dude.

482
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,920
It's an optimal illusion, dude.

483
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,800
Can you believe this?

484
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,280
No, look at it.

485
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,480
Kind of cross your eyes.

486
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,040
It's a rhino.

487
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,120
Dude's got razzle dazzle on his balls.

488
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
So sick, dude.

489
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,920
Hey, hey, hey.

490
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,080
Start Amber by 311 over again.

491
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,880
It just ran out.

492
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
Flip the tape.

493
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,960
I got distracted.

494
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,920
I just remember I started chanting,

495
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,520
peer sit, peer sit.

496
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,320
Like I'm already...

497
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,280
It's fine down there.

498
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
Yeah, you're already there.

499
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,920
What's a good song to get of it?

500
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,040
I mean, Justin, were you hurting for a distraction?

501
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,920
Were you like, boy, I wish I had something else to think about

502
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,200
to get my mind off what's happening down there?

503
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,240
I was high.

504
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,920
I mean, I was high on drugs.

505
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,480
Right, right.

506
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,600
I didn't...

507
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
I don't want to...

508
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960
I was trying to fall asleep and I couldn't.

509
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
And they told me I couldn't fall asleep.

510
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
I didn't want to be around for it.

511
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
I wanted to step out of the building for a few moments

512
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,280
and come back to my ruined penis.

513
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,560
But I couldn't.

514
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,360
I couldn't.

515
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
I was like very present in the moment,

516
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,640
but there was just chattering away,

517
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,920
just talking, talking, talking.

518
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,720
Yeah, that's interesting.

519
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,000
I do remember them saying like,

520
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,520
I can't believe this guy's laughing.

521
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,560
That's the one quote I remember.

522
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,760
They couldn't believe that I was like,

523
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,440
chuckling it up.

524
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
What were you laughing about?

525
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,280
Can you remember?

526
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,000
No, I really...

527
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,640
My memory...

528
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
I feel like I did have memories at the beginning

529
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,040
and whatever, they have been replaced by,

530
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,200
I guess, like animal crossing strats or something.

531
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,760
I don't know.

532
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,880
You're probably laughing because at one point,

533
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,760
one of the doctors was like,

534
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,240
I need that clamp right there and can you hand me these?

535
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,880
And then he just kind of waited.

536
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
Just kind of waited.

537
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,560
It's rare that you have...

538
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,440
Doctor, you do this every time.

539
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,920
We can't.

540
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,200
This is our eighth vasectomy today.

541
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Please, please.

542
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,920
I like bro surgeon.

543
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,400
Bro surgeon's my new favorite guy.

544
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,280
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

545
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,920
I do remember this.

546
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
After they had given me the gas,

547
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,160
the doctor came in wearing a hooker shell necklace

548
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,520
and I was too late.

549
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
I just couldn't...

550
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,760
I couldn't stop.

551
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,200
At that point, it was like,

552
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
I can't stand up and walk out.

553
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,920
They were at a gas ring.

554
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm in for the ride of my life.

555
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
Here is a Yahoo sent in by Adrian Cowles.

556
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,680
Thank you, Adrian.

557
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,280
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

558
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,640
who I'm going to call famous.

559
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,840
Asks, in college,

560
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,680
what's the punishment for roughhousing in class?

561
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,000
And then that's the end of the question.

562
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,800
And we're not talking about fighting.

563
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
When you fight...

564
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,240
In high school, if you fight,

565
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,520
you're out of here, mister.

566
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,280
Like not in my school.

567
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,440
We're here trying to educate

568
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,000
and enrich these young lives and souls

569
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,160
so that they get to go to heaven.

570
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,120
And I'm talking about roughhousing,

571
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
which is kind of just rough play.

572
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,600
Pressing hard in your friend's armpit

573
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,160
and they fall over accidentally.

574
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,400
Like roughhousing, like a noogie.

575
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
Yeah, like a noogie, right?

576
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,320
Where you wouldn't necessarily say there's ill intent,

577
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,440
but if you found out later

578
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
that that person does not like you,

579
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
you'd be like, oh, okay.

580
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
This makes a lot of sense now.

581
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,320
Giving a friend a pink belly.

582
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,360
Too much.

583
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,560
Saying, friend, pull up that shirt.

584
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,480
But okay, but I'm in college

585
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,920
and I am learning about law

586
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,520
because I'm about to be a lawyer.

587
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,320
And my friend accidentally lifts up his shirt

588
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,440
and I say pink belly.

589
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,800
I give him pink belly.

590
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,240
Am I going to, what's the...

591
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,160
Like what is the lawyer professor gonna fucking do?

592
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
It's not how to get away with murder.

593
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
It's not how to get away with pink belly.

594
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,560
What if it was?

595
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,320
What if it was?

596
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,600
Welcome to my new show.

597
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,560
The perfect pink belly.

598
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,440
The perfect pink belly.

599
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,920
Wouldn't that be wild

600
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,280
if you just lift up your shirt and be like,

601
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,480
hey, okay, no one's gonna believe me,

602
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,280
but my belly's pink and it stinks

603
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,280
and I know one of you did it.

604
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,720
Let's show me your hands.

605
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
As one lone student just whistles

606
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,760
as they leave out the door

607
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,960
and then it's like, I put it all together.

608
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
The lights go off and there's a scream

609
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,920
and a chandelier falls.

610
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,760
Who punctured my belly?

611
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,560
Like candles.

612
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,240
One person has a pink belly.

613
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,920
Somebody pink to Donald.

614
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,880
Who did this?

615
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
Everybody put your hand print up

616
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,240
against the hand print on my belly quickly

617
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
before it disappears.

618
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,840
Don't have much time.

619
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm already moving past this inconvenience.

620
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,520
It couldn't have been me.

621
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,840
I had honey all over my palm

622
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
from that sandwich I received.

623
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,200
If I had pinked your belly,

624
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,880
there would be honey residue.

625
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
Yeah, and you were loudly announcing

626
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,800
right before the lights went out

627
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
how you were really enjoying

628
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
your super stinky sandwich.

629
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,760
Yes, so you see, it couldn't be I.

630
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,680
Reginald's slab belly.

631
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
You're being really quiet over there, Lawrence.

632
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,480
Oh, Griffin, you're Lawrence.

633
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, man.

634
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,040
Oh, yeah, dude.

635
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,720
Oh, man, pink belly, huh?

636
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,680
That's the pits.

637
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
Lawrence, I heard thou in the lavatory.

638
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,160
Why do you talk like that?

639
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm a foreign exchange student from the past.

640
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,720
I saw a lot of shit in mid school

641
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,920
and high school, vis-a-vis.

642
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,200
Did you call it mid school?

643
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,000
Vis-a-vis.

644
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,040
Yeah, vis-a-vis.

645
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,280
That's what the cool kids call it.

646
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,000
People doing a big fight or a wrestle

647
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,520
or horseplay in class

648
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,720
that got a little out of hand.

649
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,920
Once I did a horse playing class

650
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,560
that got out of hand,

651
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
I got detention in middle school.

652
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,080
I accidentally knocked the table over

653
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,560
and it grazed a young girl's leg

654
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,440
and I got written up

655
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,280
and on the pink slip, the teacher wrote,

656
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,000
in an effort to be cute,

657
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,720
Griffin flipped a table over

658
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,480
and mauled a young woman

659
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,320
who then had to go to the hospital.

660
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,520
Like, no, that was true.

661
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,560
And I wasn't trying to be cute.

662
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,600
I didn't appreciate that.

663
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
But I got sent to detention.

664
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,800
Nothing like that.

665
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,160
I don't think I ever saw anybody go.

666
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,520
Let's start here.

667
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,640
Does college have detention?

668
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,640
It has to, right?

669
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,840
Because if not-

670
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,560
You live there.

671
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,440
What are the fucking-

672
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,000
You live there.

673
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
What are the fucking stakes?

674
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,880
Maybe that's the secret.

675
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,600
Well, hold on.

676
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,120
If in real life,

677
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,400
let's take it one step further.

678
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,240
If in real life I horseplay,

679
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,360
I could go to jail, right?

680
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

681
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,880
They don't call it that.

682
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,920
When you do horseplay

683
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,360
and you hurt someone in real life,

684
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,120
they don't call it horseplay anymore.

685
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,480
No, they call it assault.

686
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,920
They call it assault.

687
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,560
And if I do that in high school,

688
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,000
I go to detention.

689
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,080
Why, Griffin, as you're pointing out,

690
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,720
is college this like safe,

691
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,560
uncanny Middle Valley thing

692
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,840
of just like horseplay here?

693
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,600
You're fine.

694
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,160
You're fine.

695
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,120
I want to know what dies in us

696
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
when we graduate high school

697
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,120
where we no longer feel like

698
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,880
doing an awful waffle to our friends

699
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
in the middle of our history class.

700
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,240
I don't get it.

701
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,160
Too much going on, I guess.

702
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
I guess beer, right?

703
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh.

704
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
Oh, man.

705
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,120
Is that it?

706
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,080
And probably beer?

707
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,680
Getting laid.

708
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,240
Well, I don't know about that.

709
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,600
Yeah, bro.

710
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,040
So I've gotten laid before

711
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,880
and wanted to do an awful waffle

712
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,160
immediately after.

713
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,920
Really?

714
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,800
Which my sexual partner was not into.

715
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,280
And so I had to quell those dark urges

716
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,760
back inside and write them down

717
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
in my sex journal.

718
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,160
Speaking of sex journals,

719
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,440
should we go to the money zone?

720
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:45,040
Let's go.

721
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
We do have a sponsor this week.

722
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
It is Honey.

723
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,280
I actually, you know what?

724
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,840
I installed this little doohickey

725
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,800
on my Chrome browser.

726
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,120
And I tell you, it has saved me

727
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,720
a fair bit of money.

728
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,760
It makes it really easy.

729
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,440
Actually, you install it.

730
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,400
There's just a few clicks

731
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,600
and you get it for free.

732
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,840
And then when you get to the apply coupons

733
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,280
part of the checkout,

734
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,520
Honey just checks a bunch of coupons

735
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,680
to see if there's any that will work for you.

736
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,160
And a lot of times,

737
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,280
I'm like, hey, here's one.

738
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,400
I'll save you a few bucks.

739
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,880
It's nice.

740
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,680
I saved like 10 bucks

741
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,120
off a pair of headphones

742
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,320
that I was buying.

743
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,520
Do you think they tried to call

744
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,960
the business money,

745
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,560
but then they mistyped it

746
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,160
that they had already spent

747
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,840
the dollars at GoDaddy?

748
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,800
That's probably it.

749
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,280
Honey works on over 30,000 stores

750
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,640
and they add more every day.

751
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,080
And with over 100,000 five-star reviews,

752
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
I mean, they gotta be doing something right.

753
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,800
You know?

754
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
It's a cool service.

755
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,240
You should check it out.

766
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,400
Hey, I'm looking for a music podcast

767
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,240
that's insightful and thoughtful,

768
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,320
but like also helps me discover artists

769
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,760
and albums that I've never heard of.

770
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,240
Yeah, man.

771
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
Sounds like you need to listen to Heat Rocks.

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,360
talk to influential guests about a canonical album

775
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,440
that has changed their lives.

talk about albums by Prince, Joni Mitchell,

778
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,520
and so much more.

779
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,600
Yo, what's that show called again?

780
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,400
Heat Rocks, deep dives into hot records.

781
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,480
Every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

782
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,760
I have a question for you guys.

783
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,260
Okay.

784
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,720
And we're definitely gonna like,

785
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,400
you know, we're gonna be, like I said,

786
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,960
it's gonna be a little mix.

787
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,440
Okay, grip it, not me.

788
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,360
Wait, who's first thing you'll grip?

789
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,720
Oh, well, I don't care if Travis does.

790
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,080
I saved it.

791
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,560
Okay.

792
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,920
Because I wanted to frame Justin,

793
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,960
but then he instantly was like,

794
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,440
it wasn't me.

795
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,920
Can we go back and like,

796
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,280
pretend it was Justin for a while

797
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,800
and do some jacuzzi?

798
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,840
That would be funny.

799
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,280
It would be funny,

800
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,720
but we've already kind of blown it.

801
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,680
Next time, next time.

802
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Next time, two of us will grip it and grip it,

803
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,040
and we will be up to the audience to decide.

804
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,800
Why do you keep, Travis, Travis, Travis.

805
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,360
Yeah.

806
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
Where does that voice, what part,

807
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,480
where does that voice deep inside of you?

808
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,160
It's Riddle Me, Piss Guy, and he won't leave.

809
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,440
It's like the third time Riddle Me,

810
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,560
Piss Guy has showed up this episode,

811
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,160
and I wish he would, here's the door.

812
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,400
It's me, Riddle M. Pissworth.

813
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,240
Yeah, get out of here, Riddle M. Pissworth.

814
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,200
I don't want you.

815
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,560
I want Travis.

816
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,400
But I paid to be here.

817
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,200
We love Travis.

818
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,920
I hate you.

819
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,520
Did you hear that, Riddle M. Pissworth?

820
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,120
They finally chose me.

821
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,880
Right before the unpleasantness began,

822
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,200
the last two big hit shows on Netflix that we got like,

823
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,480
I don't know if everybody on this call,

824
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,160
I'm pretty sure almost everybody on this call

825
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,080
got obsessed with at least one of these, right?

826
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,760
The last two big Netflix, like Sweep the Globe,

827
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,240
huge hits, was one, The Circle,

828
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,040
which imprisoned people in apartments

829
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,120
and forced them to only contact each other

830
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,320
through social networking.

831
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,960
Yes. Right?

832
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,680
The second big one right after that is Love is Blind,

833
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,840
where people were put into isolation

834
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,920
and forced to fall in love and marry each other.

835
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,160
Yes.

836
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,640
So my question is this.

837
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,760
Did Taco Bell, not Taco Bell.

838
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,400
Wait, what?

839
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,520
I don't know why I said Taco Bell.

840
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,960
Justin, no, hold on.

841
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,160
Well, why did you just confuse Netflix and Taco Bell, son?

842
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,800
I was thinking about Taco Bell's response to the unpleasantness.

843
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,680
Did Netflix get in right under the wire

844
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,520
or right before peak relevance?

845
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,400
That's my question.

846
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,880
Oh.

847
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,720
Did these show, the timing of these shows is wild either way.

848
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,440
It is wild.

849
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,800
And I hope if this passes prologue

850
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,440
vis-a-vis Netflix's programming,

851
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,640
I sure hope we don't hit,

852
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
I sure hope we don't get a bird box.

853
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah, I guess that's true, girl.

854
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,240
Now you're hoping that a real bird box doesn't happen?

855
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,680
But a Terrace House would be fantastic.

856
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
No, if Terrace House were to really happen,

857
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,640
that would be so exciting.

858
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,040
That would be so exciting.

859
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,560
Real people would live together

860
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,040
and get to know each other by living together.

861
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
That would be incredible.

862
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,200
Instead of a bird box,

863
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,160
I would rather we all do a To All the Boys I've Loved Before

864
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,600
is where I would rather be.

865
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,160
Definitely, definitely.

866
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,360
That's the world I wanna live in.

867
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
You know what world I wanna live in?

868
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,600
The Boss Baby world.

869
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,640
Justin, can you make them do Boss Baby world?

870
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,160
Uh, I guess I could try to get the world of Boss Baby going.

871
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,720
Okay.

872
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,080
You seem to know people, Justin.

873
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,680
I don't know how you're all connected, but-

874
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,320
Tell them.

875
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
I thought you said-

876
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,000
I want a munch.

877
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Squad.

878
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,200
I want to munch.

879
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,000
Squad.

880
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,520
Squad.

881
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,760
Okay.

882
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,240
You know, there's still gonna be one up in the mix.

883
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,760
Come on, they're not stopping.

884
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,520
All of the others will be turned,

885
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,080
but rising is still Taco Bell.

886
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,640
Okay, now it's-

887
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,360
See, I had my suspicions

888
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,960
when Justin had his Freudian slip of the tongue

889
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,440
that perhaps might be a munch slot on the horizon.

890
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,040
I had that Taco Bell time open,

891
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,400
ready to pull the trigger on it,

892
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,080
and I just went too soon.

893
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,720
Taco Bell-

894
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
I want to frame this for y'all

895
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
before I get into the press release.

896
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,120
I think that we're going to be talking about

897
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,880
the longest shell ever with the triple lupa.

898
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,360
Huh.

899
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,000
The ultimate reinvention of the fan favorite chalupa.

900
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,120
It's the triple lupa.

901
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
I guess what I'm thinking is

902
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,280
there had to be someone at Taco Bell

903
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,480
in the past couple weeks,

904
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,320
as bad as things have been,

905
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
I will tell you that there's someone

906
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,760
I've talked about in the past couple weeks

907
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,600
that at some point has had the thought,

908
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,880
man, now nobody's going to talk about the triple lupa.

909
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,280
Yeah.

910
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,920
Three shells, three flavors.

911
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,480
Huh.

912
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,360
The triple lupa triples the flavor

913
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,600
and doubles the beef in Taco Bell's

914
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,680
first tear apart menu item.

915
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,600
Tear apart menu item?

916
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:28,960
Terror?

917
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,880
Tear apart menu item.

918
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,160
I would argue any item at Taco Bell

919
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
is tear apart if you want it.

920
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,640
If you believe.

921
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,200
If you need it.

922
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,360
Yeah.

923
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,640
Taco Bell is no stranger to giving fans

924
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,240
more of what they love.

925
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,680
And now the latest reinvention

926
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,240
of the iconic chalupa gives fans

927
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,960
three times the reason to get excited.

928
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,320
Launching for a limited time

929
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,560
in participating restaurants nationwide

930
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,440
on March 12th.

931
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,000
Ooh.

932
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,500
The tr-

933
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,160
That's tough.

934
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,160
The triple lupa serves as a hands-on experience

935
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,080
with three mini chalupas

936
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,680
featuring three flavors

937
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,280
and double the seasoned beef

938
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,880
compared to the regular chalupa.

939
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Combining three mini chalupas

940
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,960
to create the longest shell

941
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,720
in Taco Bell history.

942
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
The triple lupa marks Taco Bell's

943
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,040
first ever tear apart menu item.

944
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,880
It takes all the elements of the chalupa

945
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,840
to the next level

946
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,880
with different flavors

947
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,560
in each of the mini shells.

948
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,120
Nachos.

949
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,200
Do you see how they've become mini shells?

950
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Solely solely by the fact

951
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,680
that there's three of them joined together.

952
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,880
Now they're mini shells.

953
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,840
It's bite size.

954
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,920
It's like they've made a flight of chalupas

955
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,000
but it's like a concentric flight.

956
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,280
There's nacho cheese on one end.

957
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,640
Chipotle on the other.

958
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
And a combination of the two.

959
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,120
Cheesy chipotle in the third.

960
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,840
Okay, fuck off.

961
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,600
That's not three flavors.

962
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,120
That's not three flavors.

963
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,200
That's a messy spot in the middle

964
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,280
where you can't separate the two.

965
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
Justin, can I ask you a question?

966
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,080
Yeah, I'm not.

967
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,200
Is it about the triple lupa?

968
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,320
Because it's all I care about.

969
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,720
I'm not as in touch with the quick service industry

970
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,200
as you are.

971
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,480
Was there ever a double lupa

972
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,920
or did they just skip straight

973
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
from single lupa to triple lupa?

974
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,800
Because if so,

975
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
I feel like they have missed

976
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,640
a very important milestone here.

977
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
There's a market there for the double lupa

978
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,800
for those of us who are scared of the triple lupa.

979
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,280
Yes.

980
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
If we can find a way to fill that niche,

981
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,560
fill the South Park niche,

982
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,440
we're gonna be in the money.

983
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,920
The double lupa is not on sale right now

984
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
but it's just called the double chalupa.

985
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
Okay, so it's two,

986
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,120
it's a double wide basically.

987
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,240
Yeah, if they-

988
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,640
Double chalupa.

989
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
But that's not the same.

990
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,920
If they were gonna skip ahead,

991
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
they should have just gone straight to the quadrupa.

992
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,280
Well, that's just two of those squished together

993
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
by a very strong man.

994
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,920
That's a good point.

995
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,120
Okay, so the triple lupa,

996
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,960
getting back into the mix here.

997
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,640
Since the introduction in 1999,

998
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
the beloved menu item has continuously transformed in shape,

999
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,080
form and ingredients to become the most reinvented

1000
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Taco Bell menu item of all time.

1001
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,200
Weird brag.

1002
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,040
We just can't seem to get this fucking thing right.

1003
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,720
All our fans agree.

1004
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,240
We can't get this one right.

1005
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,000
From flavor innovation like the Baja Chalupa in 2000-

1006
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
Which wasn't it.

1007
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,520
We know it's not a good idea.

1008
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,160
Which wasn't it, we know it wasn't it.

1009
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,520
We know we missed on that one.

1010
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,840
Don't tweet at us anymore, please.

1011
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,600
To size innovation with the double chalupa in 2017-

1012
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,640
What were we thinking?

1013
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,240
We blew it.

1014
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,840
At Taco Bell, we recognize and love the fandom

1015
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,000
that the chalupa has cultivated over the years.

1016
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,040
A fandom that is devoted to essentially a concept.

1017
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,520
Really, a brand name, really.

1018
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,160
Because this thing has been reinvented so many times.

1019
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,560
But fandom to me implies they're out there,

1020
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
people out there doing cosplay

1021
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,400
and writing fan fiction about the chalupa.

1022
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,280
Probably there is.

1023
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,120
It's an all new flavor and shell experience

1024
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,640
with the triple lupa.

1025
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
That's from Kristen Fudelan,

1026
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,360
associate manager of research and development at Taco Bell

1027
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,680
and lead product developer behind the triple lupa.

1028
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,080
The triple lupa's nationwide launch

1029
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,640
gives us the opportunity to celebrate the transformation

1030
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,240
of this beloved menu item.

1031
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,920
And we can't wait for everyone to taste

1032
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,960
this latest innovation.

1033
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,360
For the triple lupa's nationwide debut.

1034
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,920
I want to thank Taco Bell, honestly, kidding aside.

1035
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,680
I haven't thought about anything but the triple lupa

1036
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,720
for the past like three minutes

1037
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,000
and it's been pretty incredible.

1038
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,760
And this one is so long

1039
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
and there's no way they could have known.

1040
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,600
And they made such a long press release for this.

1041
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,120
Thank you.

1042
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,360
For the triple lupa's nationwide debut,

1043
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,200
Taco Bell is partnering with a brand

1044
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,920
known for serving up its own reinventions.

1045
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,520
Guess, right now, both of you guess.

1046
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,840
Oh my God, segue.

1047
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,200
Is that a brand?

1048
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,000
Travis?

1049
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,120
Just an invention?

1050
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,840
Oh wait, Tesla.

1051
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,880
I take it back, Tesla.

1052
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,400
Well, it's TikTok.

1053
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,720
Oh.

1054
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,200
The short form mobile video platform

1055
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,280
serves as the framework for the triple lupa's national TV spot

1056
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,320
and is the first time TikTok has partnered with a brand

1057
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,000
on a national advertising campaign.

1058
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,520
Shot in TikTok's full screen vertical video format,

1059
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,080
the ad spot follows the creative, unexpected,

1060
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,360
and joyful content the TikTok community is celebrated for,

1061
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,480
which I would assume is much less triple lupa focused now

1062
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,920
than it would have been two weeks ago.

1063
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,040
When I look back at our history with social trends,

1064
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,080
I'm proud of the fact that we are always leading the industry

1065
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,600
and pushing boundaries.

1066
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,160
Whether it's being the first on new platforms

1067
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,920
or breaking records on others,

1068
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,240
Taco Bell is constantly at the forefront of online trends,

1069
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,760
said Tracy LaRocca,

1070
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,640
senior VP of brand engagement at Taco Bell,

1071
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,040
who must have a very confusing job at the moment.

1072
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,640
The most natural step for us would be to partner

1073
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,320
with a brand like TikTok.

1074
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,040
Yep.

1075
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,880
The most natural step for our taco store would be to part...

1076
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,760
Where did it go?

1077
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,080
Oh, how did it get to here?

1078
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,480
Where the most natural step for our taco store

1079
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,720
is to partner with this small video because...

1080
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,920
Jesus, Justin, we can't say that exact sentence

1081
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,400
that you just said out loud about how did we get to here

1082
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,240
because it invites you to open up a door

1083
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,720
and do a pitch black abyss that I got.

1084
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,000
I actually got vertigo from like thinking about it

1085
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,520
and I had to close the door.

1086
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,960
I can tell you exactly how it happened.

1087
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,680
Are you ready for this?

1088
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,400
It happened like this.

1089
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:32,800
Yeah.

1090
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,720
Picture like a conference room table full of execs,

1091
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,040
some young, some not so young.

1092
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,440
One of them playing on his phone is Bradley.

1093
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,840
He never pays attention during these meetings.

1094
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,440
And Mr. Bell, who is of course the owner of Taco Bell,

1095
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,120
says, Bradley, what do you think?

1096
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,240
And Bradley, without thinking,

1097
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,600
just looks over and goes, TikTok?

1098
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,560
And that's how it was born.

1099
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,160
That's how most business happens.

1100
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,400
Yeah.

1101
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,080
Because of fucking Bradley and his malfeasance.

1102
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,920
And then Bradley said, TikTok-o and everyone lost their shit.

1103
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,040
I mean, that's probably it, yeah?

1104
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,800
Yeah.

1105
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh my God, I'm looking at a triple looper right now.

1106
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,600
Taco Bell was tweeting about this.

1107
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,920
The brand is encouraging fans to jump in on the fun

1108
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,800
by participating in an upcoming Taco Bell hashtag challenge on TikTok

1109
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,640
and plans to announce more details about the challenge in the coming weeks.

1110
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,440
I doubt it.

1111
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,360
Taco Bell will also be partnering with select TikTok creators

1112
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,560
to inspire fans to reinvent something themselves

1113
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,000
and share it on the platform.

1114
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,040
So yeah, that one hasn't gotten, I'm looking at Twitter,

1115
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,760
and that one hasn't gotten a lot of the traction

1116
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,160
you would sort of hope for on that one.

1117
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,920
That one hasn't gotten a lot of heat.

1118
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,320
I tell you.

1119
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,000
The best laid plans, huh?

1120
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,680
I'm looking at this wild taco caterpillar

1121
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
that they have put together for me.

1122
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,640
And the only one of these that I'm interested in

1123
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,840
is the liminal lupa, the centralized sort of middle of the Venn diagram.

1124
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,120
Give me that one.

1125
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,680
I want a service that will rip the liminal lupa

1126
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,960
out of the middle of this caterpillar and mail it to my house.

1127
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Now, what if I get one of these and I got two friends

1128
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
and one of the friends is like, I want cheesy.

1129
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,960
And the other friend said, I want Chipotle.

1130
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,920
But here's the thing, guys.

1131
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,240
I wanted Chipotle.

1132
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,880
I didn't want, now I'm stuck in the middle?

1133
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,640
With the, are we each supposed to get our own?

1134
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,480
I think you spend as long as you can arguing about that

1135
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,160
and then find another vine to swing to.

1136
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,840
Yeah, you just enjoy each other's company

1137
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,360
for the brief moment you have.

1138
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,520
I wouldn't call that enjoying company.

1139
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,920
Having a taco fight, Travis, is not enjoyable company.

1140
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,520
I'll tell you, Griffin, right now,

1141
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,120
I would love to have a taco fight with a human being.

1142
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,720
You'd love to have a taco fight, huh?

1143
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,880
Yes, that wasn't my wife and kid.

1144
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,360
I love my wife and kids, but we've had plenty of taco fights

1145
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,720
over the last couple of days.

1146
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,920
Yeah, it's not even complete.

1147
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,080
You know who's gonna win before you even get started.

1148
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,680
And it's BB.

1149
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,400
Yeah.

1150
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,240
I'm frustrated by another Taco Bell product.

1151
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,400
They got a new grande burritos.

1152
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,760
I don't have a price list about this one,

1153
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,520
but there's two new flavors of the dollar grande burritos.

1154
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,720
One of the flavor is called Loaded Taco Burrito.

1155
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,760
Huh, what are y'all doing?

1156
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,520
What are you doing?

1157
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,720
That's just two of the things.

1158
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,600
What are you doing?

1159
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,960
What if Taco Bell just tweeted like,

1160
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
hey, right now we realize no one's looking,

1161
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,440
so we're just gonna rename everything, everything.

1162
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,120
Because none of y'all are paying attention.

1163
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,720
We're gonna completely change our menu

1164
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,680
by the time y'all get back.

1165
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,520
Listen, we're innovators,

1166
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,680
and we are not afraid to make bold choices,

1167
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,720
and we're gonna move everything just one over to the left.

1168
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,560
Yep, and you won't notice.

1169
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,060
Good luck.

1170
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,680
Just get, you just go to the drive-thru

1171
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,120
and like, just give me a bag of sludge and bread, please.

1172
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,720
Yep, just whatever conflagration of that,

1173
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,080
whatever different permutations you have.

1174
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,480
Let me get a meat and bread.

1175
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,640
Does that say fettuccine alfredo?

1176
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,080
Taco Bell, what the fuck?

1177
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,840
Hey, wait, this is two soft tacos.

1178
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,200
Yep, you cracked the case.

1179
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,080
A conflagration is actually a fire,

1180
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,320
but that actually is a plumber, I think, in our situation.

1181
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,800
Anyway, this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1182
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,520
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1183
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,360
We hope that we could,

1184
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,920
and we'll continue to provide a little bit of cheeriness for you.

1185
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,960
Hopefully we won't spend as much time couching it,

1186
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,240
I think, next week.

1187
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,560
It would be wild not to sort of talk about it, I guess.

1188
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,600
We're just like everybody.

1189
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,760
We're fucking flying by the sea of our pants right now.

1190
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,480
We'll, you know, it's like things are,

1191
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,000
we normally record on Wednesdays and publish on Mondays.

1192
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,680
Like, it seems like things are so drastically different,

1193
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,200
even in like a four-day time span.

1194
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,640
But, you know, I really, I think we're gonna get through this.

1195
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,880
Like, we've been doing this show for almost 10 years.

1196
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,480
That's like, if we can do this show for 10 years, you know?

1197
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,120
Yeah.

1198
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,000
Wait, are you comparing talking to your brothers

1199
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,160
for an hour every week to a quarantine?

1200
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,080
I was just saying like the time shall pass,

1201
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,880
and we will figure out a new way of being.

1202
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,240
You're making it sound like once we hit 10 years though,

1203
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,720
we're out of the worst of it.

1204
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,220
Finally.

1205
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,040
I mean, I would hope we're out of the worst of this show.

1206
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,800
We're passing through the clouds now.

1207
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,640
I real quick just wanted to say,

1208
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
isolate yourself and wash your hands.

1209
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,880
This is the kind of thing where I still see people,

1210
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,160
even this far into the whole thing.

1211
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,920
I hate to be serious for a minute,

1212
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,400
but I see people saying, well, I'm not worried about it.

1213
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,840
Well, it's not about you.

1214
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,440
It's about everyone.

1215
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,200
And there are people that are worried about it.

1216
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,040
And the best thing that we could do right now

1217
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,360
is to self isolate and social distance

1218
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,280
and wash the hell out of your hands.

1219
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,080
Please do that.

1220
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,680
Yes, do that.

1221
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,880
I could just be a good citizen.

1222
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,680
Wash your whole body.

1223
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,840
A lot of people aren't gonna tell you to do that,

1224
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,520
but wash your feet and your butt.

1225
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,280
Like do your hands whenever you're near a sink,

1226
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,800
but don't forget about the rest of your body too.

1227
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,360
I'm worried.

1228
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,360
And here's one more thing I would say.

1229
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,600
This is just advice from somebody who's lived with anxiety

1230
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,760
for basically his whole life.

1231
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,800
Do your best to accept your scenario as it changes.

1232
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,400
Do your best to just embrace where you're at

1233
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,520
and be in that moment

1234
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,920
and don't let yourself get too far ahead

1235
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,280
because there's no way of knowing.

1236
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,640
And you know, we got today, so focus on today.

1237
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,160
And really, you know what?

1238
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,520
Really, seriously, look at your situation

1239
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,080
and say, how could the McElroy brothers address this?

1240
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,600
I need advice about the new nuance,

1241
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,120
the new meaningless things,

1242
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,960
the new meaningless conflicts in my life.

1243
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,960
And we will continue to address those

1244
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,320
because this is gonna be weird

1245
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,360
because a lot of us are gonna have

1246
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,760
a lot of the same meaningless conflicts in our life.

1247
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,440
The same meaningless challenges,

1248
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,280
the same easily overcome challenges

1249
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
that we can all sort of talk about

1250
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,120
and work through together.

1251
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,160
So, you know, let us know how we can help

1252
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,680
and we will continue to be there to advise

1253
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,000
through these challenging days until-

1254
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,320
Or as was the case in this episode

1255
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,880
to talk about Richard Gere and Taco Bell a whole lot.

1256
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,440
Yep.

1257
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,120
What if Richard Gere worked at Taco Bell?

1258
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,120
I think it would go a little something like this.

1259
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,160
Something like this.

1260
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,720
Something like this.

1261
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
My name is Justin McGrath.

1262
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,560
No, wait, no, wait, Griffin didn't say the thing.

1263
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,160
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1264
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,960
for the use of our theme song.

1265
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,920
It's a departure off the album,

1266
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,960
putting the days to bed.

1267
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,080
Thank you to Maximum Fun.

1268
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,760
Thank you to, just thank you to you.

1269
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,320
Let's do it.

1270
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,120
Let's do that final.

1271
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,440
Yeah, we got a final yahoo.

1272
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,880
You usually don't introduce the final yourself, Griffin.

1273
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,160
It's a weird transition.

1274
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,080
So let me do it also for you.

1275
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,560
Okay.

1276
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,080
Here comes Griffin with the final yahoo.

1277
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,440
I'm gonna do the final yahoo now.

1278
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,160
Here it comes.

1279
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,560
It's from Graham Roebuck.

1280
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:14,960
Thanks, Graham.

1281
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,480
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user

1282
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,320
who I am gonna call Picard

1283
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,280
because there's an F for it.

1284
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,800
Picard asks,

1285
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,240
can poems have curse words in them?

1286
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,040
My name is Justin McGrath.

1287
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,320
I'm Travis McElroy.

1288
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,360
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1289
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,200
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1290
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,840
Kiss your dad.

1291
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,600
We should change that.

1292
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,360
No, I can't.

1293
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,880
You shouldn't though, right?

1294
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,160
But your dad's fine.

1295
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,240
Everybody can kiss your dad's fur.

1296
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,280
You might not be fine.

1297
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,920
Yeah, I guess it's true.

1298
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,200
Do we need a new one?

1299
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,840
Kiss your dad from six feet away.

1300
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,600
That's impossible.

1301
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,120
Yell at your dad.

1302
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,600
Yell something affirming at your dad.

1303
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,840
Encourage it.

1304
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,360
Check on your dad with your phone.

1305
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,160
Check on your dad.

1306
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,200
Yeah.

1307
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,120
Send your dad the kissy face emoji.

1308
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,040
We'll just keep it.

1309
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,920
It'll be weird

1310
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,520
because in a few months,

1311
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,280
people have forgotten all about this

1312
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,960
and I don't wanna make it weird for them

1313
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,320
when they listen to the ending.

1314
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,440
Imagine those quotes around kiss and lives.

1315
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,120
Yeah, for yourself now, imagine that.

1316
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,840
I hate actually putting those quotes there, Travis.

1317
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,320
Yeah, you know.

1318
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,400
I want you to write it down

1319
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,320
and I want you to read it

1320
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,720
and then think about your actions and your sayings.

1321
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,920
Kiss.

1322
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,600
I would actually hazard to say

1323
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,240
that every word of it is worse with quotes.

1324
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,520
Like there's not a thing in there

1325
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,880
you put quotes around and it works.

1326
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,320
Kiss your dad.

1327
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,760
Kiss your dad.

1328
00:52:45,760 --> 00:53:04,320
Yeah, any words are bad.
