1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,880
I still think that sound needs some- I still think you guys haven't mastered that sound.

6
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,920
Welcome to 2013 Thorwatch 2013. More like 2014.

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:09,440
2013 get your hammer and start pounding us where my brother, my brother and me Thorwatch 2013.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:18,880
I'm Justin Thor McElroy. I'm Thorvis McElroy. And I'm just plain old Thor. Guys,

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,040
there's not a lot of excitement in the air this time around. I feel like as much as there was

10
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,360
the last Thorwatch. So I think that the three of us should just keep it low key.

11
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,760
Well, Griffin, I don't know what movie theaters you've been sitting in the lobby of,

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:45,680
but at my local movie theater, as I sit there and I listen and people are talking about Thor.

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Yeah.

14
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,640
Justin, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. We've had complaints and we would like it

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
if you would just stop sitting in movie theater lobbies for hours on end.

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,840
Just yelling, Thor, anybody? Anybody for Thor?

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,520
I should stop standing by the roof and clucking my tongue disapprovingly every time someone

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,040
purchases a ticket for Gravity or any other film that isn't Thor, The Dark World.

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,520
You should also stop breaking into the projection rooms and killing projectionists

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,600
and replacing all of the movies in the theater with Thor, Thor 2 and Thor Classic.

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,600
I just love Thor.

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,960
I know, but that's murder is what you're doing, is what you're doing there.

23
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,120
I know it's a lonely life that a projectionist leads and that they don't have anybody

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
that will miss them.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,280
But that's how you get phantoms.

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,240
But that's how you get phantoms of the Thor theater.

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,880
This year, this time, Thor is taking on his biggest opponent yet.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,880
Alzheimer's.

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:03,040
And he is teaming back up with Loki, his brother, who's also another handsome god,

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
and the two of them are really going to take it.

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,400
How's Natalie Portman doing, though?

32
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,880
She got really phat.

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,160
She's incredibly phat.

34
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,800
It's the weirdest twist in the movie is that she's really phat.

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
And not like actress Natalie Portman.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,800
She's in like a shallow howl suit.

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,000
And I think the message is that she missed Thor so much, she, etc, etc.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
I don't think that's a good, I don't think that's a good message.

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,680
I don't think the message of as soon as her, her god love left her.

40
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,760
She just, she tried to fill it up.

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,120
Well, this is also the same film that taught our children that hammers are toys.

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
So I don't know that you should look to it for guidance.

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,000
This is my brother, my brother and me, as you certainly gathered.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,880
It's a Thor Watch 2013 special episode all about Thor,

45
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,400
but it's also an advice show.

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,680
So before we get back to the God of Thunder, let's get right into the advising.

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
Dear brothers, I was just recently accepted into the Pennsylvania bar,

48
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,040
which means I'll finally be able to start looking for jobs as an attorney.

49
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
Man, my morning voice is like really good.

50
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,200
Can we point out that we're recording this at like an ungodly hour?

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,880
You're so welcome, everybody.

52
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Cause I got to, I got to, I'm going on vacation.

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,320
So we got to bang it out early.

54
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
Tell everybody what you're doing.

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,160
Fucking nerd alert.

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm going to London.

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,360
Yeah.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,480
You hear that, Doug?

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,520
I'm coming to London.

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,720
And he's going to fuck you.

61
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,080
I want to fuck you, Doug.

62
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,920
No, I'm coming to the, we're going to go to the new Punch Chunk show.

63
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,040
We're going to go to the Dr. Who Celebration.

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
But somebody stay at my house, so don't even try it.

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,360
Crooks.

66
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,760
I would, uh, so something about the bar, uh, there's an issue, however, as I'm full-blooded

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,160
Greek man and I am slightly overweight.

68
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,120
That's the way it's written.

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,760
There's like four-

70
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,200
Like the Sega theme song?

71
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:19,440
L, slightly overweight, which means, uh, for me, I wear a beer and almost constantly is full.

72
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,640
It is luxurious, but it is generally kept manageable and not at all frightening or

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,360
homeless looking.

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,560
My question is when I go to fancy lawyer interviews, should I shave the beard and go

75
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
with my fat baby face?

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
Or should I keep the beard?

77
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,880
Is it professional to go to interviews with the beard?

78
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
Will it make the potential employers jealous?

79
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,040
I have had wildly differing opinions from actual lawyers.

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,560
I was wondering if you brothers would be able to light the way to my path to full-time

81
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
employment and adulthood.

82
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
In grace and favor of the Lord, Pilferus Pleater in Pittsburgh.

83
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,760
It's not 1952, like beards have had a huge resurgence.

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
I don't mean that they're low-class at all.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,440
But among which communities has that resurgence truly found purchase?

86
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,160
Hipsters.

87
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
Well, there's that, but there's also like-

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,920
Greek lawyers, slightly overweight Greek lawyers is a big upturn.

89
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,480
Yeah.

90
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,000
I've been reading the trades.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
I've been reading the trades.

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,400
I feel like when I think about most of my bearded bros, they're party Dave's.

93
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,480
They're like-

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,760
Let me throw this out.

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,800
Psychiatrists.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,960
I guess.

97
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,520
I think you can get into psychiatry with a beard.

98
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,160
Travis, you have a beard right now, right?

99
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Yes, it's glorious.

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,320
It's glorious.

101
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I mean, it's not as full lushness, but I don't think you let it get there anymore.

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Well, I'm going to, I'm going to build because people don't usually do this,

103
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,480
but I'm going to do no shave November, but I'm going to do wizard beard.

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
If you're going to do no shave November,

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,160
you probably should have kicked it into high gear a couple of weeks ago.

106
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,200
Well, I'm actually going to do a wizard beard decade.

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
It's not as fun of portmanteau, but-

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
What charity are you raising money for in wizard beard decade?

109
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,400
Wizard beard for kids.

110
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,360
So this is a, this is a charitable organization

111
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,560
that just really needs to get some beards on some kid faces.

112
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,720
Basically, I have to grow my beard out 12 inches and then they cut it out

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,760
and then glue it on a kid.

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,480
Whether he wants it or not.

115
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,600
I saw that bat kid thing yesterday and I think it's so, so sweet

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,920
that they did that for that beardless kid.

117
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,040
You know, he doesn't have a beard, but he can be Batman.

118
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
You just took the nicest,

119
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,320
you just took literally the nicest thing I've ever seen happen in my lifetime

120
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,840
and you twisted it and you used it for comedy purposes.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,760
You just took the efforts of over 10,000 kindhearted volunteers

122
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,400
and then you took it and you put your butt on it.

123
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,840
Comedy.

124
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
What is comedy?

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,440
Lots of people have wondered throughout the ages as it happens.

126
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,200
It is apparently tragedy.

127
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,320
Tragedy plus 16 hours is what it is.

128
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
Plus your butt.

129
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Putting your butt on things.

130
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
I wanted to point this out to you guys.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,040
This is going to be a very, very specific, very, very local joke.

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,400
You know how there's like a weird recurring billboard in every town?

133
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Like why does this person own all the billboards?

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,320
For Austin, it's this guy named David Comey, the attorney that rocks.

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,760
He looks like the dude from Battlefield Earth.

136
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,960
He does look exactly like John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.

137
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,920
That's right, Travis.

138
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,480
He also kind of looks like unfrozen caveman lawyer.

139
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
He's got these really, really gross dreadlocks.

140
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,760
This like the pubiest pew-pew beard I've ever seen in my entire life.

141
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
His face is on every billboard.

142
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,960
He made some choices.

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,760
He made some choices.

144
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,240
So I think if you can manage your shit, move to Austin

145
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,240
and maybe you can be David Comey, the more demure bearded lawyer.

146
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,560
I think as long as you keep it slim and trim beard-wise, you're absolutely fine.

147
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah, if it looks like a cultivated zen garden on your face,

148
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
then your beard is appropriate for any situation.

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,760
Austin, maybe shave your basketball number into it.

150
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,360
I can't.

151
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,080
I don't think we should.

152
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,880
Limit your appeal.

153
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,200
Yeah, are you talking about like it would be so rich and full

154
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,120
that you could like sculpt it like a topiary into a number?

155
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
That'd be pretty dope.

156
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
Okay, you want a Yahoo?

157
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,400
Please.

158
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
This Yahoo was sent in by Julie Kin.

159
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
Thanks, Julie.

160
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Julia Family Account.

161
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,280
Don't even trip.

162
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,440
If you look for Julia's personal account, you're gonna find some shit.

163
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,760
This is her G-rated stuff she can share with the husband and the kids.

164
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
Julia Family Account asks, what's a good time to watch Made in Manhattan?

165
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,400
Anytime.

166
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm on Jennifer Lopez movie kick, and I can't figure out a good time to watch

167
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,240
what some of my friends consider one of the best romance movies of all time.

168
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
What is the perfect time to watch?

169
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,120
Also, where can I rent it?

170
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,160
Julia.

171
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,440
Julia.

172
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Julia, that last part.

173
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,680
Sweetheart.

174
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
Go take a big shit.

175
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,840
Sweetheart.

176
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,360
Go take a big drink of water, but keep the water in your mouth, then spin around

177
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,240
spitting wildly, and some of your water is gonna land on a copy of Made in Manhattan,

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,880
either on a device that has Netflix on it or just on the DVD,

179
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,560
because I'm pretty sure everyone owns that one.

180
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,520
I think actually if you go to Netflix and you search and you type in M-A-I-D space,

181
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,680
I-N space, M-A, it just comes up.

182
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,360
No, I'm not going to let you because I care about you.

183
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
No, it'll come up.

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,720
Actually, Julia family account, it's 3 p.m. on a Sunday.

185
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
This is not the right time to watch Made in Manhattan.

186
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,960
This isn't your moment.

187
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,240
We have locked it.

188
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,760
Maybe try again on Saturday.

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
Get some of your girls together.

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,280
Maybe get a bottle of naked, and let's get this train rolling.

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I think the best time to watch it is when you've recently had some sort of heartbreak,

192
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,760
no, like a love heart, not like a loss of a family friend, but like a loss of love.

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:47,520
When your heart is breaking and you think that there's no goodness left on this earth,

194
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,080
that is the moment for Made in Manhattan,

195
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,600
or also if you just want to masturbate to Matthew McConaughey.

196
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
Either one is fine.

197
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,440
Sure.

198
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,280
Well, for me, I don't know about you guys, those two events are not mutually exclusive.

199
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,080
Wow, that is an excellent point.

200
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,440
Typically one is, in fact, they're almost always paired, like a Napoleon.

201
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,320
You know, I think the perfect time to watch Made in Manhattan is during a bachelor party,

202
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,400
and tell your friends that you got a real hot and sexy movie to watch.

203
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,720
Boom, Made in Manhattan.

204
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
You think that that is what's going to set this party off?

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
You think that's going to set a bachelor party on fire?

206
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
Well, you know, a bachelor party, sometimes it can be all about the debauch,

207
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
you know what I mean?

208
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,560
More like debauchiller party, but then maybe you just need something to remind you

209
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,080
how lucky the groom is to have found love in this crazy mixed up world.

210
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,360
You're saying, Travis, that maybe you just need to cool down.

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Yeah, a bachelor party cool down.

212
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
It's an effective time to watch Made in Manhattan.

213
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,280
Oh, you should make it like that, the Dickens book from Lost that Desmond didn't want to read

214
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:05,600
until he knew he was about to die, so he would save it for the last moment of his life.

215
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,920
That's what you should do for Made in Manhattan.

216
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,640
Oh, my God.

217
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,000
It should be your death movie.

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,120
Like, the fucking asteroid's coming.

219
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,640
It'll be here and it'll be here in 110 minutes.

220
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,200
Like, perfo, perfo.

221
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
This is going to be great.

222
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,360
This is the moment I've been waiting for my entire life.

223
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
And then the tape is jammed.

224
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,880
There would have been time now.

225
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,880
I had all the time in the world to watch Made in Manhattan.

226
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,200
The government has got the NASA has figured out a way to stop the asteroid,

227
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,960
but it involves shooting every copy of Made in Manhattan

228
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,600
into the asteroid's heart and blowing it up.

229
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,160
Not my copy.

230
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm sorry, the event has failed.

231
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,200
Someone has slipped a copy of the backup plan into the missile.

232
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
They put it in the MRA.

233
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,680
They put it in the Made in Manhattan MRA as if we wouldn't notice, but the meteor noticed.

234
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,520
The meteor knows.

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,120
We're all going to die.

236
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Thanks, Julia family account.

237
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey brothers.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm a 20 year old university student putting myself through school

239
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
who's not digging it that much.

240
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,680
And I just received the news that I will be receiving 35 to $50,000 unexpectedly.

241
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,080
Whoa.

242
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,200
This is a life changing amount of money for me.

243
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,440
Wow.

244
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,680
Yeah.

245
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
Unaccustomed to wealth.

246
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
I haven't told anyone yet.

247
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,760
I intend to keep the list short.

248
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
Is it worth it to seek out advice?

249
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,120
Or should I just go ham and follow my dreams?

250
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,920
Is this $35,000 coming from a Nigerian prince?

251
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
That is a good question.

252
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Are you getting are this is important because you haven't finished school yet.

253
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,280
So maybe you haven't picked up the brain skills required to figure out

254
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,640
whether you're getting fucked or not.

255
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
But are you getting fucked?

256
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,000
I mean, I don't want to pry, but where do you unexpectedly get 35 to $50,000?

257
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,440
Doesn't matter.

258
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,120
We got to focus on what to do with it.

259
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,640
Here's what you need to make peace with right now in your own heart and mind.

260
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,920
This money is transient.

261
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
You're not going to be able to hold on to this lump of cash.

262
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,440
Oh, fuck that.

263
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,920
Fuck that.

264
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,240
No way.

265
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,840
You go live in the woods.

266
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,240
You go pick up a trade skill and live in the woods.

267
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
You can live off $50,000 for the rest of your life.

268
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,280
Get off the grid.

269
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,760
Real talk.

270
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,560
No, real talk.

271
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,360
Here's what you need to do.

272
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,200
You need to take that 35 to $50,000.

273
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:36,000
You need to put it in a savings account and then forget about it for like 15 years and

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,800
then boom.

275
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,600
One day.

276
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,560
Oh, shit.

277
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,760
We've had, you know, I need a down payment on the house.

278
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,280
I mean, my car exploded.

279
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,080
I know Paul.

280
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,440
He's not going to live 15 years.

281
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,800
He's got to.

282
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
He's got to make money.

283
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,200
He's going to die.

284
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,920
He's going to die.

285
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,920
I didn't want it to be like this, but I had a privilege.

286
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
This is how you tell me about Paul?

287
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,720
I cast the bones last night and I saw in them that Paul is going to die.

288
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,480
Man, I bet Paul loaded up this episode and did not know what he was doing.

289
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,200
Paul was so hypothetically young in 15 years.

290
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,680
I just hope he's not one of these guys that stockpiles episodes and watches.

291
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,200
I'll get to that one.

292
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,440
No, I've listened to a lot of sockets.

293
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,280
If you know Paul, if you know anyone named Paul, just burn him a CD with some of your

294
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,160
favorite episodes.

295
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,720
But especially this one, you should dip into this.

296
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,680
Wait, unless unless unless this is like the ring and once Paul listens to this episode,

297
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,760
that's when the timer starts on.

298
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,920
Oh, it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy because you said 15 years, 15 years from now, like

299
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Paul's just going to start living recklessly.

300
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,760
No, no, no.

301
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,600
Travis obviously has not seen the movie.

302
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,480
I think it would be like one Paul listens to the movie and the only way they can save

303
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
themselves is to have another Paul listen to it.

304
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,200
Guys, this is not only totally horrifying, this is going to be the greatest like promotional

305
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,440
campaign we or any other media thing has ever been associated with.

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,720
Oh, are you or anyone you know named Paul?

307
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,000
It's limited to just Paul's.

308
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,360
Yeah, our Paul growth is going to be our Lipson.

309
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,600
It's going to be like your top demographics are New York City, California and Paul's.

310
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,960
Paul's that very, very scared Paul's on a very tight timetable.

311
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:39,040
Gosh, I was looking at the bones again and I misread them and I think everybody's going

312
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,760
to die here in this episode.

313
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
Wait, what's going to happen?

314
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,720
The bones say especially people named Paul because like you got to get the groundswell

315
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
started somewhere and I think Paul's going to die super hard.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
Paul should feel a sense of immediacy.

317
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
Paul's get three days before they die.

318
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:04,720
But Trevor's, Douglas's, Hank's, Marie's, Susan's, Alyssa's are actually fine.

319
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
Alyssa's are okay.

320
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,200
When the shit hits the fan, they are going to be the only ones left standing.

321
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,520
Everybody else, you're going to die if you don't share the show with someone.

322
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,280
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
I'm sorry you had to find out like this.

324
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,200
Okay.

325
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,520
Jump back to what to do with this money.

326
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,760
Paul.

327
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,640
Here's the thing.

329
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,040
Imagine the comfort, the brain comfort you could live in knowing that you at all times

330
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,080
in your life have like a $50,000 question.

331
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,880
That would be pretty sweet.

332
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,320
Yeah.

333
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,560
Right?

334
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,280
That's a good point.

335
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,520
Yeah.

336
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,480
You know what would be great though is if you also bought like a thousand PlayStation Force.

337
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
That would be sweet too.

338
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,360
That would be pretty cool.

339
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,400
And then just kind of handed them out to people like Oprah.

340
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,960
Yeah.

341
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,920
Did you say Oprah?

342
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Well, to each his own.

343
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,320
No, it's not.

344
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,480
She has her, she has a pretty preset way of like doing her name.

345
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,480
I don't think-

346
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,200
A little hope in it.

347
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
It's not up to interpretation.

348
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,080
Every Oprah's got a little hope in it.

349
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,960
Seven days.

350
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
Clock's ticking.

351
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
Can you, should this person drop out of school?

352
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,720
It sounds like that they are asking for us to give them permission to drop out of school.

353
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,520
No.

354
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,000
No.

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,520
What you need to do is have your own local shark tank where you have business owners

356
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,080
come over.

357
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,440
But you only give out loans of like $1,500.

358
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,840
Yeah.

359
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,360
$1,500 is the max.

360
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,040
You play hard ball.

361
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,480
You listen to their pitch about their, I don't know, lemonade stand or whatever they want

362
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,200
to make.

363
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,120
And then you get them in debt to you.

364
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,560
Like, hey man, man, I will invest 1.5% in your company.

365
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,920
Hey man, I was down a big lots yesterday and they had this, they had this Cavaliers windbreaker

366
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,760
suit and I would, I would really like to get my hands on that.

367
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,640
It was $35.

368
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,360
What do you say, Dave?

369
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,280
What do you say, what do you say, Paul?

370
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,440
Well, listen, I, I, I, you know, I love the Cavs.

371
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,360
I love wind suits.

372
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,960
Uh, but the, the, the valuation is way off on this.

373
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
It is not, this whole wind suit is not worth $35.

374
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
What I'm going to give you is $10 for 50%.

375
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,120
I guess I can get the other 25 from, I guess, I guess I can like pay some driveways or something,

376
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,560
but I would really like the 35 to just, I'm just, someone's going to just scoop in and

377
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,120
snatch it up.

378
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,920
You know what I mean?

379
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,440
I can offer you 10% on the, the wind suit.

380
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
I can give you like a pant leg.

381
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,160
I can give you like a pant leg.

382
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,840
All right.

383
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,480
I think we got a deal.

384
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,280
Mark Cuban comes in and he's like, I'll do it.

385
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,560
I'll do it for free.

386
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,640
That guy doesn't know fucking anything about business.

387
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,920
Yeah.

388
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,280
Paul, get your head in the game.

389
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,080
Get your head in the game.

390
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,240
Your, your objective with this money is to get as many halves of windbreakers as you can.

391
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,520
And I think you can really stretch it if you, if you do it that way.

392
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,000
I would.

393
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,160
Well, don't stretch the windbreaker cause it's a very, now it's very fragile fabric.

394
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,480
Very fissile, very fissile material.

395
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,000
I would watch the fuck out of local shark tank.

396
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,080
I would watch the fuck out of it.

397
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,240
It doesn't even have to be Austin.

398
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
It can be anywhere.

399
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
I would watch it to death.

400
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,080
Just somebody get that together for me.

401
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
Thank you.

402
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,240
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

403
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
This Yahoo was sent in by Eric.

404
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,080
I do.

405
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,400
I do.

406
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
I shouldn't have spoken for Travis.

407
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank you.

408
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,160
I will allow it.

409
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,680
This Yahoo was sent in by Eric or Bachi ball or Bachi ball.

410
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,240
This is thank you.

411
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,880
Eric Bachi ball.

412
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
It's by Yahoo answers user.

413
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,840
Gothic skater boy loves.

414
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,000
That's me.

415
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,240
Is asked by Travis who asks Christian dads.

416
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,600
Would you let me date your daughter?

417
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,120
So already like not off to a great start.

418
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
Yeah, not, not super good.

419
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,240
And well, I'm meeting my girlfriend's dad this summer and I have reason to believe he

420
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,120
is very religious.

421
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,720
So yeah, here's some questions he might ask and how I will answer.

422
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,720
So everybody put your, put yourself in the shoes of Ted Christian dad.

423
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
My name is Ted Christian dad.

424
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,840
What is your goal in life answer?

425
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,720
Well, I'm planning to get a band and try to get discovered making post hardcore and maybe

426
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,000
even make my own clothing line.

427
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,240
But if that doesn't work, maybe you already blew it trying to major in music.

428
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,200
Okay.

429
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,240
All those are bad.

430
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,640
Go on.

431
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,320
Those are all bad answer.

432
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,240
Did you try to find the worst answer you could possibly find?

433
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,400
There wasn't a single good word in there.

434
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
The band thing.

435
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,240
Really?

436
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,800
They may be.

437
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,240
Maybe he's a progressive.

438
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
Ted may be an extremely progressive Christian dad.

439
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,000
You don't know Ted.

440
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,720
That's what I'm saying.

441
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
Keep an open, keep an open mind.

442
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,960
Let it all.

443
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,440
Okay.

444
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,160
All right.

445
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,840
Are you a Christian answer?

446
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,960
I'm not sure about that.

447
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm only a teenager and still trying to find out who I really am.

448
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,200
And I think one can't know whether they're Christian or not until they truly know who

449
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,840
they are.

450
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,960
Can't argue with that.

451
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,360
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,160
Skater boy loves.

453
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,840
Could you say that one more time?

454
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,720
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me puking in my mouth.

455
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
Listen, he's trying to figure shit out.

456
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,040
Skater boy skater boy loves based on his profile picture.

457
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,200
I'm guessing 15, 16 years old.

458
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Which, 15, 16 year olds, don't put pictures of yourself on the internet.

459
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,560
You're not, you're not ready for that.

460
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
He's trying to figure some shit out and there's no shame in that.

461
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,040
He's putting himself out there because he's obviously fallen very deeply in love.

462
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,600
Well, then when Ted Christian dad says, hey, are you a Christian?

463
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,040
He should be like, nah, pops.

464
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,720
But he doesn't.

465
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,440
No, that's what I'm saying.

466
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,280
We need to get through this because you guys are making me angry with your prejudgments.

467
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
My person to ask is,

468
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,040
I just want to add to your point, Griffin.

469
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,080
15, 16 year olds shouldn't put anything on the internet.

470
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,720
Not just pictures.

471
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,440
No, exactly.

472
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,320
Some internet tough guys will come along and make fun of you.

473
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,280
Yeah, unless the thing that you're putting on the internet is you like,

474
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,240
like falling off a table or like, I don't know, setting your hair on fire or something.

475
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
That's pretty good.

476
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,920
That's good stuff.

477
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,600
My personality.

478
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
Check this shit out.

479
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,560
Sweet, funny, sensitive.

480
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,720
The kind of guy that would put your daughter first and risk my life to keep her safe.

481
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,520
What's up now?

482
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,160
You fucks.

483
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,680
You two fucks, Justin and Travis, specifically you two.

484
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
Trying to shame this guy.

485
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,240
Trying to put salt.

486
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,200
Can you read it one more time?

487
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,480
Could you read the answer one more time?

488
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,800
Sweet, funny, sensitive.

489
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,400
The kind of guy that would put your daughter first and would risk my life to keep her safe.

490
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
Huh, that's weird.

491
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
You guys seem a lot more quiet during that answer.

492
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
Don't seem like you have a lot of...

493
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,080
Oh, sorry.

494
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,320
I was distracted.

495
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,360
I was watching Made in Manhattan on my computer.

496
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,240
I think that that's very sweet.

497
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,760
And I think that that's all a father wants to hear, unless...

498
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,160
Unless?

499
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:05,200
Unless he is so deeply into Jesus that you have defined him by how deeply into Jesus he is.

500
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,040
It seems to me that that is going to be a real deal breaker for him.

501
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,280
I don't understand your point.

502
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,320
If the kid is not into Jesus, he's not going to be down with him.

503
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,760
It would be like if my dad was really, really into ICP.

504
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,520
And so much so that if you were...

505
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
Our dad is definitely, definitely a huge...

506
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,040
Imagine the truth.

507
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,080
Imagine the truth.

508
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,680
And this dad is so deeply into ICP that when you talk about other people,

509
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,440
like that is how you identify him.

510
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,280
He's an ICP dad.

511
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,000
If you come in and you're like, I don't know if I...

512
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,800
I've taken Violet J into my heart yet because I'm still got a lot...

513
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,840
He's going to be like, sure.

514
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
You were unaffected at Juggalo Church Camp.

515
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,960
You were not moved to come down to the fire and make a dedication.

516
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,760
If you're not down with the clown, then you're not down with Stephanie.

517
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,720
Now please go.

518
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,640
We're painting Ted in a really negative light though.

519
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,040
I don't think that Ted is the kind of dad that is like this single faceted.

520
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,640
Let me say this kid's mistake.

521
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,480
I think he's had a very negative life.

522
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,640
I think maybe he plays...

523
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,600
His name is Ted.

524
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
I think Ted plays in the band at like a kind of a progressive church.

525
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,920
A lot of newsboys covers.

526
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,400
Yeah.

527
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,440
A lot of DC talk.

528
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,440
I think he's kind of hip.

529
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
I think he knows what's up.

530
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
He was like the first guy listening to Switchfoot.

531
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
I think he knows what's up a little bit.

532
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,480
So let's say...

533
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,080
He enjoyed Arrested Development.

534
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
He felt some of the material was a little blue.

535
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,480
It was a little blue, but a lot of it was good-natured family fun.

536
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,440
Political views.

537
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,320
I don't have any.

538
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,040
Gothic skater boy loves.

539
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,240
I mean, I guess he's just walking this middle path on everything.

540
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,080
At 50 to 16, that is the exact right answer.

541
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,880
I don't know.

542
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,920
I don't have any money.

543
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,400
Here's Gothic skater boy loves problem.

544
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,880
What's that?

545
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
He's painting too good a picture.

546
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,520
You know what I mean?

547
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,080
When you say to a dad, I'm sweet, good-natured, kind, I care about your daughter.

548
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,600
It's like, listen, you're 16.

549
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,040
What's the shit?

550
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,400
What aren't you telling me?

551
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,440
I think what he means...

552
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,000
You're saying every 16-year-old harbors a dark passenger.

553
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
I mean, they have something.

554
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,080
I'm saying what he needs is something that skews the attention away from the whole

555
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,320
I don't know if I'm a Christian thing and take it to like a shoplift.

556
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,920
You're telling me that sweet, funny, sensitive,

557
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,040
the kind of guy that put your daughter first

558
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,560
and would risk my life to keep her safe, that doesn't make up for that fact?

559
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,160
Also, he's not saying he's not a Christian.

560
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,600
He's saying he doesn't know yet.

561
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm saying you need to skew away.

562
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,120
You need a mistake in the prayer rug, right?

563
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,480
Because only God is perfect.

564
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,680
So you need some fatal flaw, something that says like,

565
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,920
it's like when you go into a job interview and they always ask,

566
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,040
what's your biggest weakness?

567
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,360
Type of music I listen to.

568
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,520
Well, I listen to stuff like Pierce the Veil, Sleeping with Sirens, Hawthorne Heights,

569
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,120
My Chemical Romance of Mice and Men, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus.

570
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,760
Oh, that's good, make up a bunch of bands and then Christian Ted won't know.

571
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,760
A Day to Remember, Bring Me the Horizon, plus I listen to a lot of brony music.

572
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,840
Oh, there it is.

573
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,680
Oh, there it is.

574
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,040
There's the flaw in the prayer rug.

575
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,520
I listen to the Price is Right Losing theme song exclusively.

576
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,960
That's the only song I listen to.

577
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,800
Does brony music is a genre?

578
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
I bet it's good.

579
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,120
Is it just songs from the-

580
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,240
I just want to get that out there.

581
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,920
I bet it's energetic.

582
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,480
Justin's just trying to get ahead of the fucking wave of emails that we're going to get.

583
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,040
We got to take a stand against something sometime, guys.

584
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,640
We're walking the middle road, just like fucking gothic skater boy loves.

585
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,160
I'm not judging you bronies.

586
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,920
I don't like that there's a specific genre of brony music.

587
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,960
I think that is weird, but I love you.

588
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,640
Video game music, the chip tune.

589
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,560
That is it, but that's an exclusive.

590
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,680
First of all, that shit's dope.

591
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,000
That's an entire medium though.

592
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,840
I don't think brony is like kind of a lifestyle in it, based on that show.

593
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,640
I think brony music would be cool to write because if you get into a pinch,

594
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,800
first off, there's so many My Little Ponies, finding a rhyme is always easy.

595
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,600
Secondly, if you're like, I ate a butter tart,

596
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,920
you know that you're just going to be able to dip into your bag

597
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,800
and pick out like Flutter Heart or-

598
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,080
Are you, Justin?

599
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,560
What?

600
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,080
Wait, hold on.

601
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,520
How are you this familiar with this universe?

602
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
I actually made that one up.

603
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,760
That one came from my-

604
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,760
Your own Flutter Heart?

605
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,040
From my own Flutter Heart.

606
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,280
I made up Flutter Heart, so it may not be real.

607
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,320
Don't make me get-

608
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,760
Hey, quick quiz, hotshot.

609
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Name three My Little Ponies right now.

610
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,040
This is what I'm saying to you.

611
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,880
That's not a good quiz.

612
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,680
You're trying to-

613
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,760
No, I started it with quick quiz, hotshots.

614
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,280
You're supposed to answer without thinking.

615
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,240
Let's try again.

616
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
Quick quiz, hotshot.

617
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,040
Three My Little Ponies right now.

618
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Long face, sweet stuff.

619
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,520
Kirsten.

620
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
I knew you were a brony.

621
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,000
Those are the three most popular, least well-known My Little Ponies.

622
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,640
How I dress.

623
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,560
Most of the time I wear skinny jeans and banties with a beanie and Vans.

624
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,320
Uh, but most other times I might want to go with a different look.

625
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,200
So I wear stuff like hipster glasses, fedoras, v-neck, and skinny jeans.

626
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,440
Duh, you should have stopped after I don't have political views.

627
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,280
Why, why, why, why did he feel the need to include skinny jeans in both scenarios?

628
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
No matter what, he's wearing skinny jeans.

629
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,480
Do you-

630
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
But sometimes I don't feel like wearing skinny jeans, so I just wear skinny jeans.

631
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
Do you do drugs or drink?

632
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,160
Well, no, I don't.

633
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
I have better things to do than get high or drink.

634
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,920
Like, dawg, based on your other answers, you wicked don't.

635
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,160
Like, so far it sounds like you super don't.

636
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,520
Yeah.

637
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,040
Why not just answer that question?

638
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,760
I would if I had any idea where to get it.

639
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
I don't know how to get it.

640
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,200
That's what someone asked me about.

641
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,560
I mean, I'm 16, dawg.

642
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,560
But I don't know where the window is because I'm 33 and I don't know how to get drugs at all.

643
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,120
I don't either.

644
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,920
Have any.

645
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,280
If you live in Austin, Texas, let me- send me a Facebook message or something.

646
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,360
I don't think anybody in Austin does weed.

647
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,960
No, that's probably true.

648
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,760
Interest, music, tattoos, sleep, Facebook, piercings, Van's Warp Tour.

649
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,200
Okay, so according to the answers I gave, would you let me date your daughter?

650
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,320
Justin, final answer?

651
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,200
Kirsten.

652
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,560
Travis?

653
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Yes, I would require her to.

654
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,460
Okay.

655
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,520
I want to make a point about gothic skater boy loves.

656
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,320
Is that what it is?

657
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,720
That's right.

658
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,680
I think- I think he is not a person, but I think he-

659
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm like, he's an idea?

660
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
No, he's a conceptual demographic created by a marketing department.

661
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,760
Kevin, can you tell me about the things he likes again?

662
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:04,720
Music, tattoos, sleep, Facebook, piercings, Van's Warp Tour.

663
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,440
So someone turned a Hot Topics store into a sentient human being.

664
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,680
Yeah.

665
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,320
Yeah.

666
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,160
And asked, can I date your daughter?

667
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,360
No, you're a brand.

668
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
You're not even a person.

669
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,920
You're a brand.

670
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,480
What do you like?

671
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
A Super Mario mushroom tease, novelty dice.

672
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,160
A spiked up poster where the girl's kind of pouring milk over her boobs.

673
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,560
Things with sloths from the Goonies on it.

674
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,800
Old Nickelodeon television show logos.

675
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,240
Studded leather bracelets.

676
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,440
Can I date your daughter?

677
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
Here's what I'm into.

678
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,920
Black light posters, things that make fart noises.

679
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,560
No Spencer's gifts.

680
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,600
Get out of here.

681
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,960
Those little plasma balls.

682
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,640
Can I date your daughter?

683
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,520
Things I'm into.

684
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,720
Little glass unicorns, tiny pewter figurines, engraved flasks.

685
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,040
Travis, I love you, but I don't think Excalibur is a chain.

686
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,440
I was actually going for things remembered, but thank you.

687
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,560
Can I date your daughter?

688
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,440
Things I'm into.

689
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,160
Pretzels.

690
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,520
Pretzels, cinnamon pretzels.

691
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,440
Pretzels with hot dogs in them.

692
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
Sweet pretzels, savory pretzels, spicy pretzels.

693
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,360
Well, you can't date my daughter because you're her aunt.

694
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,720
Oh, that's good.

695
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Does everybody have a store at their mall like Excalibur?

696
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,800
Like, is that a thing?

697
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
Can you explain what fucking Excalibur?

698
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,520
Like, there are four people getting this deep cut.

699
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,880
This is a store that sells, okay, in the-

700
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,120
I actually think we've talked about it before.

701
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,040
Really? But it's been a while.

702
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,720
It's got loads of glass figurines.

703
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,200
It's got, like, a lot of pewter dragons.

704
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,000
A lot of that.

705
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,320
A lot of glass figurines.

706
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,360
A lot of ornaments.

707
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,840
And on the back wall is just filled with swords.

708
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,600
Like, I don't-

709
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,800
And, like, throwing stars and, like, katana.

710
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
Ninja weaponry.

711
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,400
And then in the front, decorative chachis.

712
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,000
A lot of Marilyn Monroe.

713
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,280
A lot of James Dean.

714
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,880
Then on the back wall, swords.

715
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,080
That's Excalibur.

716
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,000
Chachis in the front, murder in the back.

717
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,080
I didn't want to tell you guys this, but Excalibur closed.

718
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,600
I know.

719
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,080
It turned it-

720
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,560
But it turned into a yogurt place.

721
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,080
That sells swords.

722
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,000
And then just ninja weapons on the back wall.

723
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,240
Yeah.

724
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,160
They couldn't get the swords off the wall.

725
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,680
Apparently those were for decoration.

726
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:38,160
Hey, let's go to the money zone.

727
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,000
Griffin, who's our first message for?

728
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,400
I don't know.

729
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,880
It's for Sam Ludwig.

730
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,240
Who's it from, Griffin?

731
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,440
Oh, God.

732
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,360
Travis.

733
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
From Will Ludwig.

734
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,360
Stumpers.

735
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,880
Go to the head of the class.

736
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,160
Hey, Sammy.

737
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,400
I didn't get you a present you can grab with your hands,

738
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,640
so here's one you can hear with your ears.

739
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,920
Now hurry up and get a PS4 so we can play some games.

740
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,800
This episode brought to you by PlayStation 4.

741
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
Crash Bandicoot 5.

742
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
Grab the wave.

743
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,040
We got another one to Lori Renner from Halstead Hal Larson.

744
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,080
Travis, read it.

745
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,440
Lori, happy birthday.

746
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,720
If you're in Denver-

747
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,360
Wait, hold on.

748
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,800
If you're in Denver, I hope this message finds you well,

749
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,280
having fun and getting a badass tattoo.

750
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,080
If you're back east with me, then I'll see you shortly.

751
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,680
I love you so damn much.

752
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,200
I don't think there's anyone else who could have road pizza with me

753
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,400
on the way back from West Virginia so we can get our Pokemon in time.

754
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,000
There was a lot of things I really liked in that last sentence.

755
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,840
That last sentence was one of the best sentences ever crafted.

756
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,200
Congratulations.

757
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,280
Hal and Lori came to my show.

758
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,560
Oh, cool.

759
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,440
Superman.

760
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
Yeah, it came all the way out there.

761
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,080
The good people.

762
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,400
And this is a message for Lori.

763
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
So I hope she really likes it.

764
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,120
And I hope she has a great day.

765
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,480
Tweet at me if you want to trade or battle.

766
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,020
Please do.

767
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,800
Guys, I'm so hungry.

768
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
Well, it's like seven in the morning.

769
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,920
Go eat breakfast.

770
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,880
I got those mid-afternoon munchers.

771
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,320
No, it's not mid-afternoon.

772
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
No, you don't have those at all.

773
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,440
I got those right now.

774
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,080
Okay.

775
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,480
I got mid-afternoon munchers and I don't know what to do.

776
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm cranking them.

777
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,400
Are you going to eat like some cheesecake or like some really fatty cookies?

778
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,880
Them cheesy blasters?

779
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,000
I went to the cheesecake machine, but it didn't accept my 20s on my Cougarands.

780
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,640
So I can't get anything from the cheesecake machine.

781
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,360
Even if I did, it would, you know, just make me fat.

782
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
Let me throw this out, Jase.

783
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,080
Nature box.

784
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,440
Nature box.

785
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Greatness awaits.

786
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,520
Griffin, tell me about nature box.

787
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,920
Nature box is a box that has great tasting and healthy snacks in it

788
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,680
that you send that you get sent to your door through internet.

789
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,440
And then from your door, it all goes in your mouth and you got it.

790
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,480
It tastes good.

791
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
It's got bags.

792
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,560
It's nature stuff.

793
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,760
So it's like rabbit food.

794
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,000
Shut your fucking idiot mouth.

795
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,440
Some alfalfa sprouts.

796
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,960
Now we're talking French toast, French toast, granola,

797
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,360
salted caramel pretzel pops, dark cacao almonds, and more.

798
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
All designed to leave you full and healthy.

799
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,160
If they can leave me healthy, I will buy their entire stock.

800
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,920
Guys, yesterday I had vanilla, macaroon, granola.

801
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,040
Shit, that sounds good.

802
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,680
That took me to flavor town.

803
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,440
Anyway, go to naturebox.com.

804
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,360

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Yeah, pass those over to us.

812
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,840
So go to naturebox.com.

813
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,560
You get great healthy snacks, 50% off your first order.

814
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,920
Go to naturebox.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

815
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,960
Normally when I'm eating, I like to stare at a wall in silence

816
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,040
and just listen to myself crunch or chew.

817
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,800
But sometimes I like to mix it up with a little bit of television.

818
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,720
Okay.

819
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,840
You know, when I do that.

820
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,560
Okay, thanks.

821
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,760
But I-

822
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,360
Do you want to read the next ad?

823
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,200
But I have my house led shielded from TV signals.

824
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,760
Okay.

825
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,000
And I think cable is run by the FBI.

826
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,280
So I can't watch traditional television, but there's a good news

827
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,800
because I'm wheezing off my neighbor's Wi-Fi

828
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,120
and I can get into Hulu Plus.

829
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,920
Okay.

830
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,000
That was a lot of stuff you just did there.

831
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
It streams in HD.

832
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,480
Even if the Wi-Fi signal is coming through two walls,

833
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,320
you can still-

834
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
One of which is made out of tinfoil.

835
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,720
They got everything.

836
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Saturday Night Live, Community, Family Guy.

837
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,360
Actually, those are the only three shows they have.

838
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,240
That's not true.

839
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,160
I think the service is going to grow from there.

840
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,040
They've got original series like The Awesomes and Moon Boy

841
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,200
starring Chris O'Dowd from Bridesmaids.

842
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,160
And also Thor, The Dark World.

843
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,760
Twist, Turn Back Around.

844
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,160
I'm not there yet.

845
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,560
Stop.

846
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
You're the shittiest at this.

847
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,600
I'm just saying Chris O'Dowd is in Thor, The Dark World.

848
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,080
Oh, really?

849
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,800
So if you catch Chris O'Dowd fever from Thor Watch 2013-

850
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,160
Then get checked.

851
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,880
Then get checked.

852
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,440
Get Hulu.

853
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,440
For only $7.99 a month, you can stream as many TV shows as you want,

854
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,160
but they don't need your money upfront because you're a friend of us.

855
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,640
You're cool.

856
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,680
You're with us.

857
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,240
You're going to go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

858
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,440
You're going to get-

859
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,560
That's all one word together.

860
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Huluplus.com slash my brother and get two free weeks.

861
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,880
Sergio Diaz plays in a band called Os Mutantes.

862
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,960
His life was changed the first time he heard Elvis Presley.

863
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
The great thing in the world, it is to discover.

864
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,320
I mean, there's nothing better.

865
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm Jesse Thorne.

866
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,160
My show Bullseye is about discovery.

867
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,760
We help you find the best music, the best movies, the best books,

868
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,920
and we talk to the people who make them.

869
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,120
It's Bullseye from Maximumfun.org and NPR.

870
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,080
Subway hacks.

871
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,440
Throwback, throwback to last week on the subject of subway hacks.

872
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,200
Real quick, we'll just knock this out real quick and we'll move on.

873
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
One way you can hack a Subway is when you order a pizza sub,

874
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,880
you can get a double cheese for free because if you look closely at the picture on the menu,

875
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,640
there are enough pieces of cheese poking out that the sub is supposed to be made with double cheese.

876
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,360
From there, you can argue that it's false advertising if they don't.

877
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,760
Also, don't forget the Subway always has Parmesan cheese under the counter.

878
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
No matter what they say, it's always there,

879
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,240
even if they don't ask you if you want it under the sandwich.

880
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,280
That's the DJ in BC, Canada.

881
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,200
Why is everyone trying to fuck everyone else all the time?

882
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,920
Uh, excuse me, Subway man.

883
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,960
Um, I know you've got Parmesan cheese down there.

884
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,640
My brother, my brother and me told me so.

885
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,920
I didn't know that I could make cheese demands because I've never eaten anything

886
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
where the cheese look like it looks like in the pit.

887
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,760
It always looks like a fucking,

888
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,320
like it's just been broiled by like artisanal French onion soup

889
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,960
and it never, ever, ever actually looks like that.

890
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,240
It's never caramelized.

891
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,280
What kind of cheese would you like?

892
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,480
Uh, brie, please.

893
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,120
Brie, I know you have it.

894
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,520
Okay, we have, we have white cheese.

895
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,440
We have white, we have yellow.

896
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,760
I know you got brie back there, motherfucker.

897
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,680
Don't even try to trip.

898
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,760
It's stingy on the monster.

899
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,560
Do this next one.

900
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,520
I'm a gay guy in my early twenties who occasionally uses Grindr,

901
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,880
the gay focused dating app.

902
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,600
Thanks, thanks guy.

903
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,680
We, uh, we, uh, we are hip to Grindr.

904
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,080
All right.

905
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Uh, to get my bang on and to pass the time on the bus on a board.

906
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,520
Question is this, is it appropriate to message a friend you know,

907
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
if you see him on Grindr?

908
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,840
Not in an attempt to get it on just in like a,

909
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,360
I see you there type of way.

910
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,680
Hey.

911
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,280
I have several friends message me like this and I find it uncomfortable.

912
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I'm out and I have no shame using Grindr,

913
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
but it still feels like an invasion of privacy.

914
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,680
Should I get over myself or should it be allowed?

915
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,280
A semblance of privacy while looking for sex things.

916
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,640
That's from Covert in Canada.

917
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,120
Uh, PS, I once saw my middle school math teacher on Grindr

918
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,600
looking for young hot power bottoms.

919
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,960
I did not say hello.

920
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,000
Then you fucked up.

921
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,560
Then you fucked right up.

922
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,600
Hey, Mr. Phillips.

923
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,200
You, you, who wouldn't want to just blast Mr.

924
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,960
Phillips for the story of it?

925
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,080
Here's the problem, Covert in Canada.

926
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,000
No, you don't get any privacy because you're on a website.

927
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,480
Like you're not just like minding your own business.

928
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Listen to fucking Edward Snowden over here.

929
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,640
Yeah.

930
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:54,720
Wow.

931
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,400
No, I'm just saying like, it's, it's not a privacy fit.

932
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,440
You can't be like, I'm on this thing putting it out there.

933
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,760
Yeah.

934
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,480
Oh shit.

935
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,120
Somebody found it.

936
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,880
You're saying, you're saying that Grindr

937
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,400
should be like the men's room.

938
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,440
It is.

939
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,320
Super is a men's room for men.

940
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,000
It's a men's room for men only.

941
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,600
No, it should be like the men's room where

942
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,000
you know other people in the men's room,

943
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
but you really should try not to acknowledge

944
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,720
that you're both using the bathroom at the same time.

945
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,200
Is that what you're saying?

946
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,280
I guess, but how do you say that to your friends

947
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,400
who like put you on blast and like,

948
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,360
hey, I see you on there.

949
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,480
How do you, how do you say like,

950
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,640
like I recognize that, but could you pretend not like.

951
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,480
The goofs that everyone does about Grindr,

952
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,520
those are on point, right?

953
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,680
Like I don't have this preconceived notion

954
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,040
that is wrong about Grindr,

955
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,280
about it just being like a fucking free

956
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,880
for all fuck fest, right?

957
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,200
That is what it, that is its intended purpose, right?

958
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,320
You're saying it's not like a, a relationship building.

959
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,520
That we're not taught, there's just site specific.

960
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Like if you're on Grindr, you're there to get down,

961
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,960
not to start a relationship.

962
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,360
Yeah.

963
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,240
I don't, I don't know.

964
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,520
I haven't used it myself.

965
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,240
Well, they haven't sponsored us once they do.

966
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,640
Oh shit, we will be all over that.

967
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,320
I think it's a little touch and go.

968
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,240
I think it's a little touch and go.

969
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,600
No, that's a separate website.

970
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,000
It's, it's the, there's no equivalent.

971
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
There's no, there's no metaphor I can use for this

972
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,320
because there's no like room.

973
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,320
There's no like place that you go to, to fuck.

974
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,000
Like that you like would see your, your,

975
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,080
your study buddy in and then they'd be like,

976
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,680
hey, sup, I'm here to fuck too.

977
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,880
I see you trying to fuck.

978
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,320
Cool.

979
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,120
Me too.

980
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,160
I don't want to fuck you.

981
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,720
I just wanted to point out that we're both here to fuck,

982
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,760
but not each other.

983
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,520
I mean, there is a metaphor Griffin.

984
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
It's like going to any club ever.

985
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,680
It's like when people go out to try to meet someone

986
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,920
at a bar or anything, it would be like walking up

987
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,040
to someone, you know, and like,

988
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
hey, you trying to have sex with someone tonight?

989
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,600
Me too.

990
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,320
What's up?

991
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,640
Like, Hey, that's not cool.

992
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,200
But it's like, but it would be, yes.

993
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,240
But like to a, to the hundredth degree, it's like,

994
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,440
but it's a fuck club.

995
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,680
It's specifically a fuck club.

996
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,560
It's like, I'm reading the description,

997
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,800
the learn more section of grinder.

998
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,320
And I have not seen the word relationship pop up once.

999
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,000
There is no mention of finding your forever love here.

1000
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,760
It's all about here is literally what it says.

1001
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,440
It says zero feet away.

1002
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,720
Our mission for you.

1003
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
Grinders different because it's uncomplicated.

1004
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,840
Wink and meant to help you meet guys while you're on the go.

1005
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,800
It's not, well, it's not your average dating site.

1006
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,200
You know, the ones that make you sit in front of a far away

1007
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,760
computer, filling out complex, detailed profiles

1008
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
and answering invasive, psychological questions.

1009
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,720
No fucking math.

1010
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,040
Mr. Phillips knows the fucking score.

1011
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,800
I want to blast a hot young butt.

1012
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,120
That's what do you, what do you like?

1013
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,400
What kind of movies do you like?

1014
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,600
Well, made in Manhattan.

1015
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,240
Also, I want to blast a hot young power bottom

1016
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,520
and I want to really blast it.

1017
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,360
If it's one of my students, so be it.

1018
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,640
So be it.

1019
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,120
I don't know.

1020
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,760
Come what may, you know, I think it's beautiful.

1021
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,160
Me too.

1022
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,600
I think it's great.

1023
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,960
Yeah, but I wouldn't want someone putting me on blast though.

1024
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,400
That's the thing, that's the question.

1025
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,240
I think it's great if you want to use an app to

1026
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,200
find people and hook up.

1027
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,320
It's 2013, man.

1028
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,840
Be safe, be safe about it.

1029
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,320
Be safe out there.

1030
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,080
The weird thing is person A that's like messaging person B

1031
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,360
and like, hey, I saw you on there.

1032
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,200
We're both doing it.

1033
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,160
It's like, yeah, you're also putting yourself on blast.

1034
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,480
Right.

1035
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,600
It's like opening your eyes.

1036
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,760
I was also just trying to touch and go.

1037
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,800
It's also, it's like opening your eyes during prayer, basically.

1038
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,840
If you saw me, you were there too.

1039
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,960
Grindr, it's like opening your eyes during prayer.

1040
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,320
Yeah, that's-

1041
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,520
Use the coupon code, my brother.

1042
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,720
My brother, get one free blast.

1043
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,200
Just kidding.

1044
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,080
They're all free.

1045
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,280
Have fun.

1046
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,480
Have a blast from the McElroy brothers on Grindr.

1047
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,280
If you see us on there, say, hey, say sup.

1048
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,240
We don't have to fuck, but just a little acknowledgement wouldn't hurt.

1049
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,840
And don't tell our wives.

1050
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,280
Do not tell our wives.

1051
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,320
Holy shit.

1052
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,200
Holy moly.

1053
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,200

Go watch the A&T M2.0 finale.

1070
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,320
Shit goes right off the rails.

1071
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,920
Shit gets a little tazy.

1072
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,240
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1073
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,920
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1074
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,160
Got a lot of tweets this week from people buying that album.

1075
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,120
And I can't, I just, that's such a good idea.

1076
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,160
It's such a great album.

1077
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,840
So go pick that up.

1078
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,600
You can find it at any fine music retailer, like cdnow.com.

1079
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,920
Also, apologies for the short episode.

1080
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,120
Justin's about to leave town.

1081
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,400
We're trying to get it in under the wire.

1082
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,960
Next one's probably going to be a little bit late because you're not getting back until

1083
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,360
like late, late, late next week, right?

1084
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,480
If I come back.

1085
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,440
If he comes back, if he doesn't hop in the TARDIS and just go and enjoy.

1086
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,000
And Griffin, last question.

1087
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,280
One last one.

1088
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Make it count to keep you safe in Europe.

1089
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,160
This Yahoo was sent in by Krista Whalen.

1090
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,640
Thank you, Krista.

1091
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Love Lazy, who asks,

1092
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
is it possible to make toast in a microwave?

1093
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,840
Please, I am craving toast, pregnant, and at work.

1094
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,880
I'm Justin McElroy.

1095
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,760
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1097
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,000
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1098
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,800
Kiss your dad.

1099
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:34,240
And my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad square on the lips.

And we're both the hosts of Stop Podcasting Yourself, which is a podcast from Canada.

1107
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,120
In fact, we won the best podcast in Canada two years in a row at the Canadian Comedy Awards.

1108
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,400
Sounds made up.

1109
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,600
It does sound made up.

1110
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,640
Even as I was saying it, I'm like, did that really happen?

1111
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,640
Here's the thing.

1112
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,040
Stop Podcasting Yourself is a very positive show about two people who hate absolutely everything.

1113
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,240
But we love you and you listening through all this promo.

1114
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,640
Ah, the people have already fast forwarded through this part of the promo.

1115
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,520
Anyway, thanks.
