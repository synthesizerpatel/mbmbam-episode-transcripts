1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,360
made an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
You know what that alarm sound means on my phone? Pony time!

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,800
It's pony time, everybody. Welcome to the pony time segment of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,160
This is the first time that we've properly called it that, although if you think about it,

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,480
we've done pony time maybe 700 times in the 303 episodes we've done this show. Pony time is a

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,840
special time of year where we talk about all the exciting horse races and the winners and just like

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,440
what's new, what's happening in the whole pony industry. Obviously, the Kentucky Derby, which

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,160
is what I call it, it's like a fun little pet name for it, has happened. And then of course,

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,400
the Preakness wrapped up last week. I like to call it the Freakness. Okay.

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Because I'm really excited about it. I get really freaked out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then of course,

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,080
I think the Churchill Downs. I said of course, but I don't actually know. I think the Churchill

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Downs are today. There's no part of the pony time segment where I fact check stuff, and maybe we'll

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,600
organically get to that point. But let's talk about the horses and what's going on. Nyquist,

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,960
very, very exciting. I'm looking at the Kentucky Derby results here. Looks like Nyquist pulled off

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,840
a commanding win. One and one quarters lengths ahead of Exaggerator, who I think we can all

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,280
agree is a piece of shit. Yeah, he's fucking exaggerated. Nyquist sounds like it should be

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,200
a sleepy horse. Because it sounds like Nyquil? Yeah. Well, it's actually a very, very fast horse

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
is the thing. Very awake and fast. No, no. I mean, maybe it's an ironic thing like when you call a

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,080
big guy tiny. I don't know if it's fast horses are getting so popular in these races now. Yeah.

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
It definitely seems to be the trend. Back in my day, everyone used to just have slow artisanal

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,360
horses. Yeah. Looks like, and of course, following them close behind four and a half horse lengths

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
behind. By the way, that's a wonderful measurement. Can I use that for other things? And I just bought

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,960
a new mattress. I wish I had thought to be like, I'm looking for one that's like three quarters

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,680
horse length. It's kind of fun if you think about the fact that like those people also know about

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
feet. Yeah. Like they all know about it. They know what they are. It's definitely some like cubit

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,320
shit, right? Where it's just like, oh, it's the length of my arm. Like, well, what about his arm?

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,840
Oh, it's the length of his arm too. Oh, okay. Some disappointing finishes in the Kentucky Derby,

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,200
like Gunrunner, Mohamed, Sudden Breaking News, Brody's Cause. Brody's Cause is

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,040
probably the best horse I've ever heard. Brody's Cause is more woven necklaces for everyone.

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,600
There's Danzing Candy, not Dancing Candy, Oscar nominated, Majesto. Majesto is probably-

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
Sounds like the one that we made up. Yeah. If there's one that we-

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
Well, no, if we were to make one up, it would be like Mama's Exquisite Soup Recipe.

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,040
That's true. That would be my horse. Majesto sounds like the horse couldn't decide between

40
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,960
being a racer and being a magician. Let me just hop over to the previous results,

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,480
see if Nyquist is still on that Triple Crown run and know that piece of shit exaggerator

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,600
snuck in like a thief in the night, took it away. Nyquist got beat by a horse named Cherry Wine

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,960
too. Nyquist finished third, Cherry Wine came in second. Cherry Wine didn't even fucking fight.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,360
Not fight, race. Well, it's kind of a fight. Didn't even fight in the Kentucky Derby. And

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,040
at that point, it's like, why are you- If you're not even going to go for the Triple Crown,

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,480
why the fuck are you here? I got the single crown. Go the fuck ho- I want to race and I

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,040
kept the horse from getting the Triple Crown. Good job. You're a fucking troll at this point.

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Like let him, let him approach glory. Wait, Griffin, in your opinion, what's better?

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,760
A Triple Crown earned or a Triple Crown given? Both are better than a Triple Crown stolen,

50
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,200
which is what Cherry Wine did. And it's technically what Exaggerator did. Exaggerator,

51
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,880
you lost the first race, dog. It's time to fucking get out of the race because you're not going to

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,320
win the Triple Crown. Are you suggesting that if, if any horse that wins, like if a horse

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,520
wins the first one, any horse that beats that horse after that is just like- A usurper to the

54
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,600
third crown. Being a real dick. To the Triple Crown. Real dick in a crown blocker. Some

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,240
disappointing finishes in the pregnants I'd like to go down, like Uncle Lino, Fellowship, Awesome

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,960
Speed. All very good. Oh, that's like, that's painful, isn't it? To name a horse Awesome Speed

57
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,880
and have it not finish. Yeah. In the top what, like three? Fucking dude finish ninth. It's okay,

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,240
Speed. I'm actually, we've revised the horse's name in light of recent events. That was just

59
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,480
called disappointment. I do want to talk about the, there were two very disappointing finishes

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,560
in the Preakness and those were the two horses that were destroyed because they died. They died

61
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,800
during the Preakness. There were two horses- At least one of them destroyed itself, right?

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,880
It, both were destroyed and I don't want to joke about it too much because it's very, very, very

63
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:38,000
sad. Again, that verb is not, it's, the verb is joyous. Yeah. But the act- It's triumphant,

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,640
I would say. It's a triumphant, yeah. But like, the thing it describes is very, very sad but

65
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
that's kind of a weird, kind of a weird ending to a sports event.

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
Like, how was the Broncos game? Well, they lost and Peyton Manning died.

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,200
In it, during it. How was it? How was, how was it? Oh, it was okay. Tony Romo,

68
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,480
he fucking died. He threw so hard that his body ripped in half. He threw so hard,

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,320
his heart just stopped and he died right, like literally right there on the 50 and then his team

70
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,560
fucking lost. Couldn't even win one for the Romo. He died. I know that they pay really close

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,520
attention to the genetics of a horse before they breed them. Yeah. Do you think that question comes

72
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,000
up like, so will it be fast? Yeah. Yeah. Very, very fast. So fast. Will it be like a beautiful

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,040
chestnut brown color? Oh, fuck yeah. Oh yeah, definitely. Definitely. Is there any chance of

74
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,400
it just like racing really, like, you know how it's gonna run really fast? Any chance of it dying

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,040
because of the speed at which it runs? I bet that the answer to that question is always this,

76
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,360
well, there's always a chance. I mean, God could just take it. You know what I mean? That's what it

77
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,520
is. God, God, the horses ran too fast and beautiful and God's like, not, not on the ground anymore.

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,440
Time to race amongst the clouds. You're pulling my chariot now. Yeah. Now the saddest part is,

79
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,080
uh, one of the horses that died, broke, broke its leg. Very, very sad. Was destroyed. It was a

80
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
Promethea, four-year-old Philly, died on the, died on the track. Very, very sad. The other one,

81
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,480
and this is even sadder, just died after winning a race, after winning a race, just like trotting

82
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,840
on back to the stall, died just instantly standing up. That horse's name was Homeboy Chris.

83
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,800
Can we fucking please, like, that's- Can we not spare the ones with the most beautiful names?

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,600
Is that not- I also, I guess I say it is a tragedy that Homeboy Chris fell in the line of duty. It's

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,600
sad when any, it's sad when any horse dies. Yes. But Homeboy Chris did win, which adds a little

86
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,400
bit of an epic spin to like, you win your race and then like, back in your stall, you know,

87
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,320
you close your eyes. Like that, there's a little bit of like, beauty to that. John Henry kind of-

88
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,040
Yeah. Yeah, right? Beat the steam engine and then, yeah. I've seen a lot of controversy. There's

89
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,120
been a lot, I've been following all the horse bloids and there's been a lot of controversy

90
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,160
that the Pimlico race course where the Preakness is hosted had a muddy track situation. That might

91
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,960
be why Nyquist didn't perform as well as everybody was expecting, but it also might be why two of the

92
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,640
athletes died. How have you done the- Tell me about the choices you made while making the turf.

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,800
They were apparently pretty bad choices because two of the athletes died. I also read at one point

94
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,760
that the problem might be that like, the horse, at least one of them, already had a bunch of injuries

95
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,720
and they just drugged it up real good so it could race good. Like, who's in charge of this shit?

96
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,160
Is there not somebody who's going, wait, what did you do? Oh, hold on. Yeah, no, wait, what did you

97
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,640
do? Get the fuck out. What's the other horse besides Homeboy Chris? It doesn't matter.

98
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,880
Yeah, I just needed a name. Prometea. Prometea. Do you think there's a part, like, as sad as it is

99
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,040
to lose Homeboy Chris, and I'm like, I'm still talking about it, nobody else, if Prometea is

100
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,440
watching from beyond the beyond, there's got to be a little bit of relief on Prometea's part.

101
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
Like, oh, thank god. I did not want to be the only horse that died at this thing because that would

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,800
be a hot topic. And now, like, two died, it's like, maybe not our fault? Yeah, and at least now Prometea

103
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,920
has the comfort of being, like, forever, like, a statistic. Like, well, there's one Preakness,

104
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,000
two horses, same day. Same day. Like, that- Yeah. Doesn't that- This has got to be the worst

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,720
Preakness, right? It requires definitely some, like, some kind of restructuring to your race program

106
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,720
when two of the contestants die. I'm not sure what the criteria is for judging the success or failure

107
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,880
of a Preakness organizer. I'm pretty sure two horses going on to meet their eternal reward

108
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,880
is probably a demerit or two. We need to- If your fucking Preakness has a KD ratio,

109
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,800
you fucked up, dog. If it were any other competition, like, how did the evening of

110
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,080
Jeopardy go? Well, bad news. Two of the contestants dropped dead. Oh, well, we probably need to look at

111
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,680
the buzzers or whatever because something's gone horribly wrong. Like, they were giving this guy

112
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,160
the job description. They said, okay, listen, it's an easy gig. All you have to do is make a big circle

113
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,720
that beautiful horses can run around on. And then the guy's, like, out the door and, like,

114
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,480
as he's getting this car, they're like, oh, and don't let any of them die on it. What? Don't-

115
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,920
No, listen, come back. Don't let your horses die on the circle. Okay, bye. Bye. Sounds good. Checks

116
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,600
in the mail. It's the exciting- I put a bunch of holes in there. Goodbye. It's an exciting thing

117
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,920
about horse racing, though, right? Because there can only be one winner, and there can only be one

118
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,040
triple crown winner, and sometimes there's lots of zero triple crown winners, and the rest of the

119
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,800
horses are losers. But then below that is a whole other strata of, like, super losers. I super lost

120
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:08,320
the Preakness. I lost the Preakness arguably the most one can lose at any endeavor. Now, listen,

121
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,280
I hope that nobody gets the wrong impression that thinks we think it's funny when horses die. No,

122
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,280
it's the saddest thing ever. If you were watching- That would fuck you up if you were watching that.

123
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:24,160
No way. I can't imagine. And we are respectful of it. I think I personally purchased the meat

124
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,680
of Homeboy Chris to share with my family. No. Friends and family. No. No. Somebody should eat

125
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,640
them, don't you think? Yeah. Like, very Dothraki, right? It is Dothraki. I mean, like, not the other

126
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,920
horses. That seems weird. That's messed up. But maybe Homeboy Chris was the stallion that will

127
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,320
mount the world or whatever and needs to be consumed by a child. I can't. It's been a long

128
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,880
time since I read it. Listen, let's get to the advice. We wasted like fucking 10 minutes talking

129
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,680
about that. That's what happens when you get us going on horses. Can we stop killing horses?

130
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
Can we please just stop? Can we reign that in maybe a little bit? Also, side note, when the one

131
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,040
that broke its leg broke its leg, it threw its rider and broke his collarbone. Let's look at

132
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
this whole thing again, huh? Let's take it back to the start. If you're going to be humanist pieces,

133
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,240
a shit about all this, then fine. There is a human cost, one collarbone. Now, of course,

134
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,400
when that person broke their collarbone, I don't think anybody walked up to them and swiftly

135
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,320
executed them. I don't think whoever was riding that pony was destroyed as well. I think they can

136
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,960
still, like, use their other arm to eat a hot dog, which they probably did later that day because

137
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,320
more is expected of them than just riding a horse. There's a more sort of cohesive human experience

138
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,360
there beyond the track, and we didn't afford that opportunity to homeboy Chris. If anyone's

139
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,440
listening and your horse breaks a leg and you're like, well, I'll take care of it. I'll fix that

140
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,080
horse. I will sea biscuit the shit out of that horse. Just call me. Okay, okay. Now it's time

141
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,440
for advice. I do want a horse, by the way, like legit. I've been thinking about it. But, like,

142
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
one that has a leg that doesn't work so it can just, like, chill in my office and just, like,

143
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:16,080
lay around. Right? Yeah. I got a significant couch in here. Yeah. All right. Tonight my boyfriend

144
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,040
took me out for dinner at the OG after a long day at work. Ugh, always goes down good. It was lovely

145
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,600
until we just hung out while we were trying to eat to tell us her life story. What? I went from

146
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,680
acknowledging response to one-word answers to a laugh, a hmm, finally just nodding my head and

147
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,240
hoping that each time she walked away it would be the last. She would finish the sentence,

148
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,880
walk two steps, and step back to say more. Oh my god. We gasped about being late for a movie,

149
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,760
paid, and booked out of there. Only the leftovers in the parking lot. How can we avoid this

150
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,440
situation? Slash, what do I do to make it end? Slash, am I doomed to live an OG-less life?

151
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,520
Please help ravenous Rebecca. There's a lot of variables here. I don't know if you were actually

152
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,240
late for a movie or if you were just, like... Sounds like a scam. Yeah, sounds like maybe you're just

153
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:18,160
dropping a line on it. Um, I don't think that this is... I don't think that this is necessarily

154
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,120
so bad of a thing for a person to do. Like, talk to you and make a... We get so many questions

155
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,320
coming coming from the other end of, like, uh... Well, we get less of them now because I think we've

156
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,080
made our stance pretty clear of, like, I want to know more about this person working in a service

157
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,520
industry, so how can I, like, talk to them? How can I... How can I become friends or, uh, how can I

158
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,360
date this person who I know who works in the service industry? It's rare that we get it coming

159
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,600
the other way where it's like this person in the service industry is coming on a little strong,

160
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
but, like, I don't necessarily think... I know you came there to eat and you probably want to,

161
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,320
like, eat and hang out. That's the... Griffin, that's the problem is there's three periods

162
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,640
to a meal at a restaurant. Before your food, during your food, and after your food. And before

163
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,720
and after, they can talk to me all they want, but once the food is there and I'm supposed to actively

164
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:18,320
be engaging my talking hole with food, don't talk to me. Like... This is absolutely untenable. I...

165
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:28,640
This is absolutely... Like, I'm sorry, there's no... Okay, I have a daughter. She'll be two in August,

166
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:37,360
okay? If I am at dinner with my wife, it is through some herculean schedule arranging,

167
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,720
like, Jedi mind shit where I've, like, tricked somebody into, like, caring for my child and I've

168
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,600
tricked my wife into thinking that it's okay for her to leave our child. And, like, it has been

169
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,040
quite a day, let me tell you. And if you decide that, like, in this brief 90 minutes that I get

170
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,840
to actually speak with my wife, that you would just like to pull up a chair and regale us...

171
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,040
Do a little dinner theater?

172
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
Yeah, do a little fucking masquerade to go along with my breadsticks.

173
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,440
And for the rest of the meal, I shall be Samuel Clivens. Enjoy!

174
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:17,120
Enjoy doing my one-man show, How's the Zeppeli? I don't think... I don't think if a person puts

175
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,240
themselves out there in the way that this... It sounds like this... This waitress put themselves

176
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,440
out there. I don't think it's cool to, like, take steps to shut that down necessarily,

177
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,480
but I totally understand what you guys are saying. And, like, the happiest moment in anyone's life

178
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,440
is not their, you know, when their wedding or their birth of their first child or

179
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
whatever. It's when you see that tray of food coming. Oh, and you count the plates,

180
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,280
and you count the number of people at your table, and you say, these numbers are the same.

181
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,640
The number of plates equals the number of people. I've cracked the code, and here it comes.

182
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,720
I've cracked the Piscetti code, and then the Piscetti gets there, and you eat it all up,

183
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
and it makes you so happy.

184
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,440
Yeah, it's good to order things with visual signifiers. Like, if there's a menu item that

185
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,120
has a large flag in it, I'll always get that, because then I know it's covered.

186
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,800
So I understand. I do. I think it's a... Yeah, it's a tricky situation, but I'll never feel it.

187
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,880
The problem is that it's never okay to be like,

188
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
and our interaction is done now. Please go away, waitress. Like, I get it.

189
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Yeah, because that's what ding-dong ass people do.

190
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,800
Yeah, but like...

191
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,400
But the Piscetti, no, the point is a great point, Justin.

192
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
There's no... You're a food prisoner.

193
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah.

194
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,880
Like, it's not like you can say, listen, this has been so fun, but from now on,

195
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,840
I'm just gonna go get my own refills. Is there a key or something to the soda machine that I need?

196
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,680
Okay, thanks. All right, I'm just gonna do my own thing.

197
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,000
Because like, it would be very nice, actually, now that I say that out loud,

198
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,920
if like both parties had that option. Like, you as a server should be able to say like,

199
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,800
listen, this is the pits. You are just the most disreputable human being.

200
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,560
Here's the key to the soda machine.

201
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,040
Yeah.

202
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,800
Are you good? Cool.

203
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,880
So like a Lyft driver or Uber system where like the waitstaff gets to rate you,

204
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
you get to rate the waitstaff, and then the next time you come in, they're like,

205
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,800
no, he's got like four stars. Like, no, I'm not waiting on him.

206
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,560
Like, you can wait on him because you're new.

207
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,280
I like the four star metric that you came up with there,

208
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,320
because a four star metric intimates that like most of the time it's fine,

209
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,280
but there was one or two times where it was not fine. And I want to know that story.

210
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,480
Because it was just not fine enough.

211
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,880
It was super not fine.

212
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,400
That they're down to four out of five, but not so not fine that they're like banned from the restaurant.

213
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,000
It's like 10 fives and then like two ones. And it's like, hey, two ones, come here.

214
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,440
Tell me what the fuck's going on before I sit down in that seat.

215
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,160
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

216
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,720
I just super quick just to actually give me an answer.

217
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,120
There's fucking no solution. That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

218
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,680
The good news is that eventually it's done and you can like go back again

219
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,960
and like hope that that person's not working or go somewhere else.

220
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,160
The good news is you're not trapped there for all eternity and you can eventually like leave.

221
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,520
Okay, I'm gonna come down other side of this.

222
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
You have no idea what kind of day that person's had.

223
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
Maybe they just need to rap about some stuff.

224
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
Yeah, but Griffin, this is a customer interaction.

225
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,000
It's Piscetti time.

226
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
The point that it's Piscetti time is not going to go away.

227
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,320
I get your point, but this is not like, oh, they were a little bit short with me.

228
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,240
Like I'm here to eat a meal with the person I'm with, not to act as your therapist for the day.

229
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
And I usually come down on that side of like, you don't know their life,

230
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,360
but like your job is to leave them alone and let them enjoy their meal

231
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
and come back when they need you.

232
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
Like that's the basis of your job.

233
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,680
Not to sit there and be like, and let me tell you a little bit more about me.

234
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,440
Like you're not, you don't need bedside manner as a waiter.

235
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,320
Oh, I totally agree.

236
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,960
I totally agree.

237
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
Could just be having kind of a hard day though.

238
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,080
Okay, how about this Yahoo!

239
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,800
That everybody's-

240
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,280
Yeah, this one was sent in by Rebecca Usich.

241
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,320
I'm gonna say Usich.

242
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,680
Thank you, Rebecca.

243
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

244
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,160
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

245
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,840
Let's call them Carly G.

246
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,080
Cause that's lower on the list.

247
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,880
Thank you Car-

248
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you for your bravery.

249
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Carly G asks, chicken soup for boys?

250
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,840
I was wondering if there were any chicken soup books aimed at boys, 14s.

251
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,040
Oh, I thought you meant like literal soup.

252
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,320
Special, yeah.

253
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,640
Mama's-

254
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
It's like a whole joke.

255
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
Mama's exquisite soup recipe.

256
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
Chicken soup just filled with like Hot Wheels cars.

257
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
I had a whole joke that instead of chicken and noodles,

258
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
it was chicken and doodles.

259
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
All right, all right.

260
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,200
Yeah, I'm gonna take that to Shark Tank

261
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,520
and see if I can get any investors.

262
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,760
For my money, it seems like boys, boy teens.

263
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,360
Boy teens.

264
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,600
Boy teens are why other people need those fucking chicken soup books.

265
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,520
Teen boys create the chicken soup market.

266
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,800
Please help me book, I've dealt with boy teens all fucking day.

267
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,840
The boy teens are like the common cold that has necessitated the soup.

268
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,760
As a publisher or author of the chicken soup books,

269
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,920
which I don't know if those books have authors

270
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,360
or if they just like take a bunch of shit out of Reader's Digest

271
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,600
and then they get somebody to chop and screw it.

272
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,200
I always assumed they were the first tentative experiments of a rogue AI.

273
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,080
Okay, yeah.

274
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
I always just assumed they had one

275
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,400
and then they just like control F, search doll, replace pronouns

276
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,360
and just like, well, let's change that to a he and done.

277
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
Because you would think my chicken soup for boys would be like,

278
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,880
don't put your fucking finger up there.

279
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,640
Don't scratch and don't tug on that.

280
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
Don't fucking, just fucking stop.

281
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,320
But the thing is, that book's too effective.

282
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,200
The whole chicken soup for blank economy

283
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
is gonna just collapse around me.

284
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,920
You know, the chicken soup for the boy teen soul

285
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,240
could just be one page with one sentence and it just says,

286
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,200
put it away.

287
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
You put it the fuck away, dog.

288
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
And that could apply to every situation.

289
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,200
I was a boy teen, put it away.

290
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,560
Just put that away.

291
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,600
Just put it away.

292
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,000
Physically.

293
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Whether that means your attitude or your wiener.

294
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,440
Mentally, spiritually, put that thing away.

295
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,000
I feel like that's such a powerful concept, Travis.

296
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,520
I feel like we could start, we could incorporate that into more of our,

297
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
just put it away.

298
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,440
Put it away.

299
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,400
Just don't anymore.

300
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,920
Do you guys want to know a quick, very true thing?

301
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,080
I'm gonna guess just based on sort of your whole role here in the organization

302
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
that you have Googled the chicken soup series

303
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,240
and you have an interesting factoid

304
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
about maybe the number of books that there are in this series.

305
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,000
No, not about that.

306
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,720
It's about the chicken soup for the soul brand large breed adult dog food.

307
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,040
What?

308
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,720
What?

309
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,960
Because food is more than just nutrition.

310
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,360
It's also about comfort, love, and appreciation.

311
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,040
Here's a fucking dog food with the chicken soup for the soul brand on it.

312
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,200
Chicken soup for the soul brand dog food.

313
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,640
You can't do that.

314
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,560
You can't have two different foodstuffs in the name of a product.

315
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,160
It can't be like, what's up?

316
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,720
This is Hamburger Helper's kid wine.

317
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,040
What?

318
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,640
Yeah, it's wine for kids, but it's made by Hamburger Helper.

319
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,480
What?

320
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,400
They're just-

321
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,720
Somewhere there was a board meeting or some kind of product pitch meeting

322
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,400
where someone went, yeah, sure, sure.

323
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,880
Because I'm like digging deep in Amazon

324
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,200
and there's some really, really good chicken soup for the soul books

325
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
that we're very much into.

326
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,040
But the weird thing about the dog food

327
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,360
is that you would think there would be some sort of in between licensing

328
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,720
that got them to that point.

329
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,040
But no, as near as I can figure, they made every book

330
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,760
and they haven't made it.

331
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,360
They're like, anybody come up with any other books?

332
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
What about chicken soup with the prisoner soul?

333
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,680
Nope, we did that one already.

334
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,840
What about chicken soup for the soul, a book of miracles?

335
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,520
Nope, it exists.

336
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,560
What about chicken soup with the soul?

337
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
I can't believe my dog did that.

338
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,960
Nope, it exists.

339
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,760
Who is that book for?

340
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,960
Okay, have we stopped making these for a specific audience?

341
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,080
They're getting like super duper specific.

342
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,600
What haven't we done, guys?

343
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,640
There's chicken soup for Travis Patrick McElroy's soul,

344
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
which I don't own.

345
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,040
Maybe, what if we did dog food?

346
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,160
Have we done napkins?

347
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,560
There is a game, there's a chicken soup for the game

348
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,480
and I bet it's fucking fun and shit.

349
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

350
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,040
It's not called chicken soup for the game, is it?

351
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,600
No, it's called chicken soup for the soul,

352
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
count your blessings, the game.

353
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
With an attitude of gratitude.

354
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
If it was from the number one best-selling series

355
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
as if there was any fucking doubt.

356
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
I thought it was chicken soup for the game

357
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
all about like how to seduce women.

358
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,840
Okay, part of me is just-

359
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,400
Mystery presents chicken soup for the game.

360
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
I'm disappointed to learn

361
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
that it's not called chicken soup for the game

362
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,320
because if they started to follow that naming convention,

363
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
they could literally sell anything

364
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,760
like chicken soup for the bowling ball.

365
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,880
It's a line of high quality bowling balls.

366
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,160
What's it have to do with chicken soup?

367
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,520
Fuck you.

368
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
Is the chicken soup for the soul brand dog food

369
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,960
chicken soup flavored?

370
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
I think it's just the books that nobody buys.

371
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Like, oh, nobody really bought chicken soup

372
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,240
for the boy grandpa.

373
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,040
So let's just chunk those up

374
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,080
and make some puppies eat them.

375
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,880
This is our new product chicken soup for the hamster cage.

376
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,880
Hey guys?

377
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,520
Yeah, Juice?

378
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
Can I just shoot a quick review?

379
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah, yeah, hand me-

380
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,080
Chicken soup for the soul board game.

381
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah, I would love to see-

382
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,880
This one comes to us from Seattle Mist.

383
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,960
We thought this game sounded like good wholesome fun,

384
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,440
but it constantly references pop culture,

385
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,560
which is annoying.

386
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
There are lots of people who pay little

387
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
or no attention to that kind of thing.

388
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,600
So unless you're really hip, in quotes,

389
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,560
on all the current fads, celebrities, and lifestyles,

390
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,320
you want to pass on this game.

391
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,120
We've tweaked the questions before to suit our family,

392
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
but it took a lot of tweaking

393
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
and now it sits on the shelf.

394
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay, hey, who wants to come over

395
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and play grandmom and peep pops fucking bootleg chicken soup

396
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
for the soul 2 rowdy XXX edition

397
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,040
with no references to pop culture?

398
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
What's grandma's favorite book?

399
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,640
The notebook?

400
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
No, no pop culture.

401
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,120
It's the Bible.

402
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,700
Idiot.

403
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
It's the idea of, they're talking about,

404
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
it's a shame because it could be a great game.

405
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
The idea of looking on the bright side of things is great.

406
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,760
That's why we bought the game.

407
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,000
One of our sons tends to be an Eeyore.

408
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Well, yeah, he's got parents making bootleg chicken soup

409
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,800
for the soul 4 games.

410
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,200
I'd say he has reason to be depressed.

411
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,840
Dear parents, might I watch anything, even PBS?

412
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,400
I'll take 321 contacted this way.

413
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,480
No, we're going to play chicken soup

414
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,720
for the soul our edition again.

415
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,560
But there's only three questions.

416
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,800
And all of them are, why are you sad?

417
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,760
Listen, we tried to play that chicken soup

418
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
for the soul board game.

419
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,880
It was so worldly and very secular.

420
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,040
It was a very secular worldly game

421
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,160
and we had to make our own bootleg version of it.

422
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,120
We're proud to present a new line of products

423
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,160
called potato soup for your spirit.

424
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,920
It's a whole new thing, different from that other,

425
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,920
let's call it what it is, shit.

426
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,360
What are you, firefighter?

427
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,200
Don't read that chicken soup book.

428
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,080
It's full of shit.

429
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,920
Potato soup for spirits, what the doctor calls for.

430
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,760
We don't reference anything in potato soup for the spirit,

431
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,880
except potato soup, which is referenced quite a bit.

432
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,200
They made dog food before chicken soup.

433
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,080
Yeah, well, what are they fucking gonna call it?

434
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,560
Justin, chicken soup for the chicken soup for the soul?

435
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,840
Chicken soup for the tummy.

436
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,120
Well, what if the chicken, okay, I gotta say.

437
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,840
What if the chicken soup for the tummy's soul?

438
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,160
Like what, does my tummy have a soul?

439
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,400
If you've been making a line of books and products

440
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,680
and dog food and bowling balls for like 200 years

441
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,320
called chicken soup for the boy grandpa

442
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,840
and then you release chicken soup

443
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,560
and it's not the best fucking chicken soup

444
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,880
that's ever slipped betwixt these lips.

445
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,560
Like, I think it probably discredits the rest of your,

446
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,400
like, I eat that soup and it's just okay

447
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,960
and I think like, well, maybe I don't need to know

448
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
what this book says about my firefighter soul.

449
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,000
It turns out they don't know shit about chicken soup.

450
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
Yeah, they don't have any idea.

451
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,480
They don't know what's fucking good for me.

452
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
It's all carrots, what?

453
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,920
This is just a can of carrots.

454
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,600
Do you think, is there a law preventing me

455
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,200
from reading chicken soup for the firefighter soul

456
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,840
or chicken soup for the grandma's soul?

457
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,000
Groups that I will never, I'm more likely

458
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,760
to become a grandma than a firefighter

459
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,840
but like, am I allowed to read the books not designed for me

460
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,120
or is there some sort of security like eye scanner or RFID?

461
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,800
You're allowed to read it

462
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,600
but they're just full of so much slang and jargon.

463
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,640
Like they've got, firefighters have like 18 different word

465
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,200
for like the embers that land on your nose.

466
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,720
But no word for snow.

467
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,200
But no word for snow, kind of weird.

468
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,280
Think about it.

469
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,600
And the grandma one is just like a lot

470
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,360
of like long since retired racist words

471
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,280
for really, well, any race, the whole rainbow of races.

472
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,360
The whole spectrum.

473
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,760
My dad just got the iPhone six plus, a large phone

474
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,320
and has been calling it his cocaine tray

475
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,200
in public and in private.

476
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,120
When I bring it up, he smiles and says,

477
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
oh, am I embarrassing you?

478
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
What do?

479
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
That's from Cocaine Confusing California.

480
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,560
God, that's so good.

481
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,360
That's really good, dude.

482
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,720
Your dad is awesome.

483
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,040
Yeah.

484
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,920
It's so good.

485
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,160
Have you considered starting a Dungeons

486
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,520
and Dragons podcast with him?

487
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,520
That's so good.

488
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

489
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,240
Am I embarrassing you?

490
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,880
I mean, confusing more than anything, dad

491
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,280
but chase your bliss, go for it.

492
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,120
It's a solid joke, milk it.

493
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,880
When he says, here's the way to get him to stop.

494
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,040
Next time he calls this cocaine tray, just nod

495
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,920
and be like, nice.

496
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,480
Nice, dude.

497
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,600
Nice, dude.

498
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,560
And then you take out your phone,

499
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,800
do a line of blow off of it.

500
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,400
While making intense eye contact with him.

501
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,720
Yeah.

502
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
And you say, you want to bump old man?

503
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,080
We'll go line for line.

504
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,160
Is that a thing people do?

505
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,360
Like you go shot for shot.

506
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
Is that a thing people do with Coke?

507
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
Only I've got to challenge each other

508
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,600
to like Coke races.

509
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,760
Yeah, it's like Lady and the Tramp

510
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,680
where they start on opposite ends of a line

511
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,360
and then they come together and they're nose kissing.

512
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,360
Don't nose kiss your dad.

513
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,120
Let's go to the buddy zone.

514
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,840
Justin, can I ask you a question?

515
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,320
Yeah.

516
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,200
How are you sleeping?

517
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,560
Not actually.

518
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,680
Cool, cool.

519
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,320
Thanks baby.

520
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,920
My wife, as you know, and maybe the internet doesn't know,

521
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,600
but is pregnant and so she has not been sleeping.

522
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,680
Congratulations.

523
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Oh, I forgot to tell you guys, sorry.

524
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,040
But so she's been sleeping infrequently

525
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,280
as pregnant ladies are like to do.

526
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,240
And I can tell you something,

527
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,680
we've got that Casper mattress

528
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,160
and I am not disturbed when she gets up

529
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,520
and isn't able to sleep immediately.

530
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,000
Okay, so then you just went a different direction.

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,640
What?

532
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,600
I thought you were maybe gonna say

533
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,040
like the Casper mattress is so great

534
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,880
that it can lull my otherwise bothered pregnant wife

535
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
directly to slumber town.

536
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,960
I really haven't asked her about it,

537
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,600
but like I've been continuing to sleep great.

538
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,400
Oh like, yeah.

539
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Straight through the night.

540
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,680
No amount of her tossing and turning

541
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
and wailing and gnashing of teeth

542
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,640
can disturb my slumber on a Casper mattress.

543
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,440
Casper mattress is incredible.

544
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,040
They send it straight to your door

545
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,120
and they, through whatever black magic they've done,

546
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,280
they're able to keep costs down

547
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,640
to the point where it almost seems unbelievable.

548
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,880
You can get a twin size mattress for as low as $500,

549
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,960
a king size mattress for only $950,

550
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,200
which is an amazing, amazing deal.

551
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,560
The mattresses are incredible.

552
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,760
They're incredibly comfortable.

553
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,120
I mean, since we got ours,

554
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,040
we've been sleeping better than ever before.

555
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,680
And it has a risk-free trial and return policy,

556
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,480
which means you can sleep on it for a hundred days.

557
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,880
And if you don't like it, you just return it.

558
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,360
And they're made in America,

559
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,240
which if you only want to sleep on American things,

560
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,840
you've done it.

561
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,720
What's the special offer you ask?

562
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,920
That's a good question.

563
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,600
Justin, what is the special offer?

564
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,040
What's the special offer, Trav?

565
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,920
Let me tell you.

566
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,720
Oh, okay.

567
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,040
I thought you were asking me, but I just asked you.

568
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,360
Yeah, I know.

569
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,920
I'm with you.

570
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,240
Okay.

571
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,720
NBA listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

572
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
if they go to Casper.com slash my brother.

573
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,600
And use promo code mybrother on one word

574
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,120
at checkout terms and conditions apply.

575
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,240
Go do that.

576
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,800
That's Casper.com slash my brother,

577
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,280
and then use promo code mybrother at checkout.

578
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,920
You gotta do them both.

579
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
Can I talk to you guys about Harry's?

580
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,800
Yeah, you don't need to.

581
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,480
I'm like a big fan, but go ahead.

582
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
I've never shaved before in my life, but-

583
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:50,800
Clearly.

584
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
So please, please tell me something.

585
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,680
Anything.

586
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,440
Free me from this beard prison.

587
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,560
You haven't heard of Harry's.

588
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,640
That's because you are a Harry,

589
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
like from Harry in the Hinder sentences.

590
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Guys, they should call it not Harry's.

591
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,000
Holy shit, Travis.

592
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
It's so fucking good, dude.

593
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,240
Thank you.

594
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,760
I just shit my pants.

595
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,040
Thank you.

596
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,960
Shit your pants good.

597
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,920
That's a shit.

598
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,720
That's a shit.

599
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,280
That's a shit my pants good joke.

600
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,840
Thank you.

601
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,200
Thank you.

602
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,720
Put it up on the board.

603
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,360
Thanks, guys.

604
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,240
So what is it?

605
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,400
It's a place where you-

606
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
I was gonna talk about it, but this is all fine.

607
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,080
This ad is going great.

608
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,840
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

609
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,680
It's the shaving thing.

610
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,040
We're supported in part this week by harrys.com.

611
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,720
You gotta ask yourself, hey, why are razors,

612
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,680
why do they cost $140 per razor?

613
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,240
And they're locked inside of like

614
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,040
Magneto's fucking mind prison.

615
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,400
And why are they so sharp?

616
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,320
And why are they so fucking sharp?

617
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
No, razors that you buy in the store are a piece of shit.

618
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,400
They're so overpriced that people are more likely to steal them.

619
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,240
If you make a razor cost as much as a television,

620
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,440
yeah, people are gonna steal those shits

621
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,720
because it's way smaller than a television.

622
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
Crime of the century, easy crime.

623
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,600
It's like, it's the copper wire of hygiene products.

624
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,760
Harry's fixes all of that.

625
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
They're good quality, German engineered,

626
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,960
five blade cartridges.

627
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Get a close, comfy shave, quality guaranteed.

628
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,720
You get a full refund if you're not happy with the shave.

629
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,560
And then the price, it's factory direct.

630
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,000
You cut out, you say, get the fuck out of here, Walgreens.

631
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,560
You say, get the fuck out of here, Dwayne Reddy.

632
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,800
Is it Reddy or Reed?

633
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,040
No one's quite sure who that is named after.

634
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,320
But anyway, you say, get the fuck out of here, Dwayne whoever.

635
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,280
Because these razors-

636
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,320
Dwayne the Rock Johnson?

637
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Well, no, I would never say that to him.

638
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,560
These razors from here, if they get in here, Dwayne and shave me.

639
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,560
I want a full body shave from Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

640
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,680
Not asking too much.

641
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,200
I don't think that's asking too much at all.

642
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,760
So they sell their blades at half the price of the leading brand.

643
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
They have a Truman starter set.

644
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,200
It's a great option for new customers.

645
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,880
It's an amazing deal for just 15 bucks.

646
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
You get a razor handle, moisturizing shave cream,

647
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,400
and three of Harry's five blade German engineered razors.

648
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,200

655
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,760
I've got a message for Steve Prittis.

656
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
It's from Beth, AKA Amp.

657
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,640
Awesome.

658
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,600
Amp.

659
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,640
Happy birthday to the only one who managed to melt

660
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,600
this once icy heart with cuddles and kisses

661
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,520
and the occasional cup of tea.

662
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,160
Love you always, Steve, my perfect boyfriend,

663
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,040
partner, and future husband, heart, sign.

664
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,880
From your cheesy girlfriend slash wife, Beth.

665
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,840
It's like a time traveling message in there, isn't it?

666
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,280
What are you talking about?

667
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,320
Well, because she says that Steve is her boyfriend,

668
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,360
and then she identifies herself as both girlfriend and wife,

669
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
as though she has become unstuck in time

670
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,520
and exists in both the present and the future

671
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,560
when they are married.

672
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,120
The time traveler's wife.

673
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,840
Maybe this is when they first meet.

674
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,640
This is the first time Steve has heard of Beth.

675
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,320
Oh, fuck yeah, the lake house.

676
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,040
Maybe this is when they move in together.

677
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,720
This is when they move into the lake house.

678
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
This is when they move into the lake house,

679
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,160
and they're like, I'm gonna go check out the bathroom.

680
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,800
Whoa, I'm in caveman times.

681
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,880
Get me the fuck out of here, Sandra Bullock.

682
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm trying, but I just can't get Ziggy to answer me.

683
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,960
Happy birthday, Steve.

684
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm not talking about fucking quantum leap again.

685
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,280
I got a message for Avital from Rishi,

686
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,880
and it says, the Tron won't accommodate my entire LJ entry,

687
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,520
wrote, so I quote, I saw him on stage

688
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,800
and he was singing out to heaven.

689
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,640
I swear, arms outstretched, so out piece of themself,

690
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,800
just so free, I started crying.

691
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,280
You, Avital Isaacs, wrote that

692
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,520
about Chris Martin at your Coldplay concert.

693
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,240
I'm laughing already, and it was all yellow, you lunatic.

694
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,280
That's amazing.

695
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
Oh, fuck me.

696
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,360
This is all time.

697
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,720
This is all time.

698
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Do you guys want to read it?

699
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,000
I feel bad that I got to read it.

700
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,120
This is so fucking savage.

701
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,160
Okay, wait, we each get to do, hold on, line readings.

702
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
Okay, go ahead.

703
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,560
Go ahead, Travis.

704
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,040
I saw him on stage and he was singing out to heaven.

705
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,760
I swear, arms outstretched, so at peace with himself,

706
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:49,200
just so free, I started crying.

707
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,400
This is the meanest thing anybody's ever done on this show.

708
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,440
It's like the meanest thing that anybody's ever done,

709
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,560
but it's like, it's bulletproof.

710
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,800
It's so fucking good.

711
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,600
It's Teflon.

712
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,520
Like, you can't, what are you going to do?

713
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Say you didn't write that on the live journal, you did.

714
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
You did put it on the live journal.

715
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,320
It's right there.

716
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,920
By the way, I'm sorry to hear that our Jumbotron 3000

717
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,240
cannot accept your full LJ entry, mbnbam at maximumfun.org

718
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
or Justin at teengoogle.com

719
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,760
if you want to just shoot that over my way

720
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:35,360
and I can enjoy it in its entirety.

721
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,240
Hi, are you a fan of Star Trek The Next Generation?

722
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,360
Well, that's weird because it's a corny show,

723
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,680
but my friends Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica

724
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,760
do a lovely podcast about it.

725
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,360
It's called The Greatest Generation

726
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,440
and it's on maximumfun.org.

727
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,560
I thought that this podcast was a bad idea,

728
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,920
but I was wrong.

729
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,240
Please listen to The Greatest Generation

730
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,160
on maximumfun.org.

731
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,080
Um, do you guys want to Yahoo?

732
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,520
No, because it's time for the hottest new feature

733
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,920
that is on my brother, my brother and me

734
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,400
and it's called Munch Squad.

735
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,520
I want to rock!

736
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,520
Fear has gripped my heart with its long icy hand.

737
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,920
You know how, okay, so Munch Squad is a new feature

738
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,720
on my brother, my brother and me hosted by Justin Marker.

739
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,760
You know how like you're always hearing

740
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,360
about great new fast food items.

741
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,920
Oh, fuck.

742
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,400
But you find out about them from somebody else, right?

743
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,880
Well, no longer because on my brother, my brother and me,

744
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,040
I'm going to be bringing you the latest

745
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,480
and greatest from fast food

746
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,680
and it's going to be direct from the people making them.

747
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,880
I'm not interested in what some YouTube commoner thinks

748
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,480
of the hottest fast food items.

749
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,160
I want to take it straight from the professionals

750
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,360
who are paid to know about this stuff.

751
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,840
Okay.

752
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,160
So I'm going to be bringing you the dirt,

753
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,840
the scoop, direct scoop

754
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,080
and probably there will be scoops of dirt

755
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,160
at least a few of these items, I would imagine.

756
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
I just want to get ahead of this

757
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,760
and I want to say you didn't tell us

758
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,560
about this ahead of time.

759
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,160
Correct.

760
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,880
Any crunching or munching you do into your microphone.

761
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,680
I'm not eating it.

762
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,440
This is literally just PR.

763
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,840
That's all I'm bringing you is the direct feed

764
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,360
from the companies making the product.

765
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,280
Oh my God, so you're not even eating the food.

766
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,400
I'm not going to get my fucking bite.

767
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,600
I'm not an expert like these people.

768
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,360
I'm not paid to know what's good

769
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,720
and what's bad in the world of fast food.

770
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,920
So during this segment,

771
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,520
you're just going to read PR bursts.

772
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,200
I'm going to read it with my own sort of like twisted spin,

773
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,960
which means yes, I'm just going to read it

774
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,640
with no editorialization whatsoever.

775
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:38,960
All right.

776
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,680
This first item, you're going to...

777
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,760
This has been sort of like...

778
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,000
Can we guess who the company is?

779
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,320
I imagine it will be pretty evident

780
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,360
if they talk about like...

781
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,520
Yeah, you will know this one.

782
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,040
I'm still going to guess, go for it.

783
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,440
Okay.

784
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,720
This is just a game for me.

785
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
If it says like so much cheese, you'll come.

786
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,920
It's like, oh, TGI Fridays.

787
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,640
The first one up is called the Naked Crispy Chicken Taco.

788
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:04,880
Okay.

789
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,080
It started getting tested in September.

790
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,360
Some people started showing up there.

791
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,480
BuzzFeed says that this is a Tex-Mex chain,

792
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,440
which is literally the height of generosity.

793
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,920
Yeah.

794
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,440
I mean, it's talk about.

795
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,120
This is a food business.

796
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,280
It's a food business.

797
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,640
It's a food repository.

798
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,520
This is a Tex-Mex adjacent restaurant.

799
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,000
So what's the Naked Crispy Chicken Taco?

800
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,560
Well, it's like a taco.

801
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,920
Hey, can I say something?

802
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,280
Bad fucking start.

803
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,640
Bad fucking start, but...

804
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,960
You know what, taco is a fucking thing.

805
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,600
What taco?

806
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,560
Okay.

807
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,360
Hold that image in your mind, but get ready to spin it.

808
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,640
It's like a taco, except instead of a crispy corn shell,

809
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,800
they have a very thin filet of fried chicken.

810
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,280
No.

811
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,480
And that is making up the shell of the...

812
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah.

813
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,960
That is the item which we were talking about today.

814
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,320
Just for you guys, if you're at home,

815
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,760
you can feel free to Google this,

816
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,240
but I went ahead and just dropped you guys

817
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,080
in a little image there in your Skype window.

818
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,960
You can check that out.

819
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,320
It is a very thin filet of fried chicken.

820
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,320
I hate every pixel of this fucking image you just sent me.

821
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,640
So let's hear about it from the experts, okay?

822
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,440
You don't want to hear about it from me, okay?

823
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,240
And they're just...

824
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,120
When is this going to happen?

825
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,400
Kat Garcia Taco Bell's senior manager of marketing says,

826
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,240
we're just planning what's the right...

827
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,280
We're just playing around.

828
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,360
We're just having fun.

829
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,640
We're just playing around, man.

830
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,960
Even we don't know when this is going to come out.

831
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah.

832
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,440
It got its start when Taco Bell's senior director of innovation,

833
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,840
you'll remember, fired for that position in disgrace in 2012.

834
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,560
Heather Mothershaw, who imagined a taco shell made from chicken Milanese.

835
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,760
One night when she was super duper, duper, duper high and drunk.

836
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,240
Simultaneously.

837
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,880
So this is a quote from chief marketing officer Marissa Thalberg.

838
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,240
I'm so, so sorry.

839
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,600
Please, God, forgive me.

840
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,880
Think of all the crazy firsts that have existed in time and civilization.

841
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,200
Dare we say-

842
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,480
Light bulb, flight, chicken taco.

843
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,040
Dare we say even the creation of the wheel probably-

844
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,360
No!

845
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,480
Go fucking home.

846
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,040
Go home.

847
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,640
Well, they did make the wheel out of a thin filet of fried chicken.

848
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,680
That's a really good thing.

849
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,680
So this has become a passion project of Steve Gomez,

850
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,760
Taco Bell's manager of product development.

851
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
He literally says it's a passion project, which like...

852
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,080
You think that's code for fetish?

853
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,000
Hey buddy, your passion fucking sucks.

854
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,840
Garcia said he was worried that consumers might think it's weird,

855
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,440
fair food or it's jester-y is his word.

856
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,560
I'm worried that the consumers might have the final thought

857
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,040
on this mortal coil of this is like fair food before they promptly die.

858
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,400
And he said, when you explain to someone,

859
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,920
they create a visualization in their mind.

860
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,200
But then you put it in front of them and you're like, try it.

861
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,880
And then it's like, okay, I get it.

862
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,720
I'm looking at a fucking Business Insider article about this taco.

863
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,000
And I think the way that Business Insider got tipped off

864
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,120
is this tweet from Twitter user Jock, J-A-W-K.

865
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,160
And it's a picture image of this fucking accident.

866
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,320
And the tweet says,

867
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,240
Yo Taco Bell, I found a location that had a taco shell made out of chicken.

868
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,120
It was so good.

869
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,320
Any more info on this?

870
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,480
So just to like walk through this person's day, they went to Taco Bell

871
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
and they're like, hey, welcome to Taco Bell.

872
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,200
What would you like?

873
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,440
Oh, by the way, I don't know if you're interested,

874
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,800
but we do have this essentially forbidden menu item.

875
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,440
You've never, I guarantee you've never had it before.

876
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,120
It's just like, we're having some fun with,

877
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,080
I imagine like the opening scene in Gremlins where it's like,

878
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,360
I don't really feel like a quesalupa or a taco or a burrito today.

879
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,560
Like, well, that's all we have.

880
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,880
Unless you want to try this like crazy shit,

881
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,920
unless you want to try this crazy garbage that'll death you.

882
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,200
That'll definitely kill your heart.

883
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,360
I like that he's asking for more info.

884
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,920
What fucking context do you need, my dude?

885
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,120
It's a fucking fried chicken taco.

886
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,960
My tweet to Taco Bell would have been like,

887
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,520
of course I ordered, like, of course I ordered this

888
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,880
because I'm like the beginning of Gremlins,

889
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,320
like my curiosity was piqued.

890
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,960
And I just want to know, like, here's the store number.

891
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,520
Send all these people to fucking jail.

892
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,560
And I just want to know,

893
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,920
will you be responsible for taking care of my family when I'm dead?

894
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,320
Yeah.

895
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,200
Certainly this franchise has gone rogue.

896
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,440
Yeah.

897
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,600
This is a rogue Taco Bell that must be put down.

898
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,400
At Taco Bell, they must be stopped at all costs.

899
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,040
Just want you to know, your employees have done this.

900
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,880
There's no punishment harsh enough,

901
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,640
so I really need you to think outside the bun.

902
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,720
Time to call in your treaties with the Burger King and put a stop to this.

903
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,800
I want to read you guys the fucking quote of the thing, the whole thing.

904
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,560
And this is from Garcia again.

905
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,440
We're back to Garcia.

906
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,360
I just love it so much.

907
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:09,120
Taco Bell has found in the test that the vegetables somehow managed to give the meaty,

908
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,560
deep fried chalupa a, quote, health halo in the eyes of consumers.

909
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,000
Quote, we were getting feedback like it's so healthy.

910
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,160
It's so fresh, said Garcia.

911
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,040
That really surprised us because it's fried chicken.

912
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,560
That's his quote.

913
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,840
That's Garcia's quote.

914
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,960
That really surprised us because it's fried chicken.

915
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,200
Do you think that it really surprised us

916
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,520
is not like how healthy people thought it were,

917
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,120
but like how easy everyone was to fool into eating?

918
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,200
Yeah, like every fucking time we think that we've crossed the Rubicon,

919
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,000
America's like, hey, there's another Rubicon up ahead.

920
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,720
Let's keep going.

921
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,760
When we debuted the chicken bad taco at some slug stores,

922
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,640
we expected to be run out of town on a rail.

923
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,760
But here we are, the mayors of Flavortown.

924
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
We don't know what's going on.

925
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,960
We were really surprised.

926
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,840
I would be surprised if the people who ate this experiment

927
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,200
knew there were vegetables in it.

928
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,520
Because I feel like it's a very human response,

929
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,720
certainly an American response to when I see fried chicken,

930
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,920
I have this like almost predatory like response of just like,

931
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,200
I need to put that in my throat like as fast as I possibly can.

932
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,440
And if there are vegetables in the way of that goal,

933
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,880
I will, of course, eat them.

934
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,600
But it's just like the path there.

935
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,560
It means to an end.

936
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,240
I would eat this.

937
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,960
So that's your much squatter for today.

938
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,160
I will consume this thing.

939
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,080
Well, of course, we're going to.

940
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,120
That's the thing, right?

941
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,600
Okay.

942
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
They said that every, Gomez says,

943
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,000
every year the benchmark gets higher and higher

944
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,400
for new big taco innovation ideas, says Gomez.

945
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,560
Is big taco capitalized?

946
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,320
I want to know who's fucking problem

947
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,280
that particular arms race is, Taco Bell.

948
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,120
Like that's your, that's on you.

949
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,880
You're in a race with yourself.

950
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,280
Yeah, we got Taco Cabana down here,

951
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,480
but they don't like, they would have to just be like,

952
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,440
it's a gun.

953
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,520
It's a fucking gun that shoots a taco into your tummy.

954
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,360
Del Taco, which is just one step away

955
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,720
from just calling themselves Bell Taco is like,

956
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,840
they're just happy to be considered

957
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,800
in the same like taco store discussion as the Taco Bell.

958
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,040
I don't know that anyone else is like,

959
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
we made a taco out of chocolate.

960
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,200
Like nobody's doing that.

961
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,640
Sorry, are you talking about a Choco Taco?

962
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,760
Well, I said it and then I immediately regretted it

963
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,440
because I knew a Choco Taco was a thing.

964
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,440
Let's see, we put taco meat inside

965
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,040
of a live alligator's mouth.

966
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,960
And now you consume the whole thing in one bite.

967
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,760
You fucking French the gator.

968
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,480
French this meat out of this alligator's mouth.

969
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,840
We call it a Croco Taco.

970
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,960
We call it a Bayou Blaster.

971
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,880
I want to hear you another Yahoo.

972
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,280
Okay, I got this one and it's from Morgan Davey.

973
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:55,840
Thank you, Morgan.

974
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,680
It's from Yahoo Answers user Bill who asks,

975
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,400
Bill launched his account on April 30th, 2016.

976
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,560
Just fucking wanted to get in before Yahoo goes away forever.

977
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,400
Did you guys see somebody in the Facebook group

978
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,360
or somebody emailed us that like got some scuttlebutt

979
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,920
from people like on Yahoo who were just like,

980
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,240
oh yeah, Yahoo Answers like we will get rid

981
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,680
of that shit as quick as we possibly can.

982
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,200
Oh really?

983
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,120
I'm saying it's not looking good.

984
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:27,920
Anyway, Bill asks, does space weed exist

985
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,680
in the Star Wars canon?

986
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,160
Fuck yeah.

987
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,960
Oh God.

988
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,800
Good question.

989
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,200
I want to hear about that.

990
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,440
Space Dojo.

991
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,080
The person most likely to really just like get bait.

992
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,320
Yeah.

993
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:42,960
Yoda, right?

994
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,600
Dude, Dago Bong.

995
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,240
Dago Bong is very good.

996
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,880
Good.

997
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,800
That's why Darth Vader sounded like that.

998
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,320
He's just hot boxing that mask.

999
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,520
Darth Vapor.

1000
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,600
Darth Vapor.

1001
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,200
Smoke instead of Snoke.

1002
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,320
Oh, okay.

1003
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,560
Okay.

1004
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,680
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.

1005
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,320
All right.

1006
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:06,880
Yo Dank?

1007
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,600
Well, I feel like we already did Yoda.

1008
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,360
Do you?

1009
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,200
Chewbonga.

1010
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,800
Chewbonga?

1011
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,760
Oh yeah.

1012
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,160
Bong Solo?

1013
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,320
Is that two?

1014
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,400
I feel like maybe we should do less of the Bong

1015
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,920
and maybe we should start telling jokes.

1016
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:25,600
Yeah.

1017
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,240
A joke would be good.

1018
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,920
By the way, if my fucking-

1019
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,280
This is me for the rest of the show.

1020
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:31,760
Go on.

1021
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,520
If my Twitter replies turn into a fucking Star Wars weed wasteland,

1022
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,680
I swear to God I'll do the whole service.

1023
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,720
I would delete my account.

1024
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,200
You'll come up and you'll find an egg in my place.

1025
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,960
I do not need that in my life right now.

1026
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,560
Do you guys think when Lynn wrote the song,

1027
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,960
wrote the music for that one scene of Force Awakens,

1028
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,360
he had to ask questions about the canon of it

1029
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,600
to really nail the song?

1030
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,200
And one of those questions had to be like,

1031
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,960
all right, we're in a good time party spot.

1032
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,760
People are definitely blazing on some space weed, right?

1033
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,880
And JJ Abrams was like,

1034
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,720
of course.

1035
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,400
Yeah, dude.

1036
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,680
Of course they are.

1037
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,360
You've just blown my mind, Griffin,

1038
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,240
because the fact of the matter is,

1039
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,880
with how much extended universe there is in this canon,

1040
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,320
there's definitely a scene of somebody smoking some kind of space opium.

1041
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,480
Well, there's the death sticks, right?

1042
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,440
Is that a thing?

1043
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,120
I believe you, Griffin.

1044
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,720
You could have said literally anything.

1045
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,280
Somebody tries to sell one to Obi Kenobi.

1046
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,880
That's what I call him.

1047
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,640
I just cut the wan out because I'm a busy guy.

1048
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,320
What about spice?

1049
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,200
Isn't that a thing?

1050
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,240
Spice in Star Wars?

1051
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,480
Probably.

1052
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,360
Guys, you're getting fucking way off track.

1053
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Of course there's drugs in the Star Wars universe.

1054
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,000
Of course there are.

1055
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,080
Han Solo is a fucking smuggler.

1056
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,560
Like, why do you think that job exists if he's not, like, peddling?

1057
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,360
Smuggler waffles.

1058
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,760
And everybody looks at Han Solo and he's like,

1059
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,880
oh, what a fun time guy.

1060
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,480
And I don't want-

1061
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,200
He's a drug runner.

1062
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,600
He's fucking-

1063
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,840
Yeah, he's like, hey, it's me, Han Solo.

1064
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,360
Dashing rogue.

1065
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,120
Anyway, here's some crack.

1066
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,040
Now, hold on.

1067
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,640
He's not the dealer, Griffin.

1068
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,280
He's just the-

1069
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,480
He's the mule.

1070
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:02,880
Yeah.

1071
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,080
Hey, thanks, sir.

1072
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,360
Hey, welcome to Kid Planet.

1073
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:05,680
Thanks.

1074
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,280
This is my luggage.

1075
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,080
All right, come on in.

1076
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,400
Thanks.

1077
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,760
Step, walk, walk, walk, walk.

1078
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,920
Hey, here's that crack for Kid Planet.

1079
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,200
Yeah, get that out there.

1080
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,840
Get that out there.

1081
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,400
Where's my-

1082
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,200
Where's my money?

1083
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,200
We'll get you the crack as soon as Chewbacca shits it out later.

1084
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,920
It's all ballooned up there.

1085
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,160
Yeah.

1086
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,840
Every time that Han Solo flakes on the rebellion,

1087
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,000
you have to remember that he is doing it to go trance for crack.

1088
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,720
Yeah, he's dead.

1089
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,800
He's back and he saved us as we attacked the Death Star.

1090
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

1091
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,680
Kid Planet.

1092
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:42,960
I got to go.

1093
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,000
Oh, it's Ice Planet Hoff.

1094
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,800
We haven't seen Luke in a while.

1095
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,840
I'm going to go out looking for him.

1096
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,520
And I'm going to go just drop off a few little crack nugs.

1097
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,560
I also got to go poach some wampa.

1098
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,760
You know, he was stoked when he heard it was the Ice Planet.

1099
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,560
He gets up there.

1100
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,880
He's like, well, this is not what I expected at all.

1101
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,680
This is a much more literal take on that concept than I sort of expected.

1102
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,240
Yeah, I bet he smuggled some really dope shit, though.

1103
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,960
Oh, no.

1104
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,560
Yeah, he smuggled robots and like fucking war heroes.

1105
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,040
And like he had those monsters in the worst scene in the new movie.

1106
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,520
But then like, then there was-

1107
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,440
How very much he drew a line anywhere.

1108
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,800
No, God, no.

1109
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,840
He's got to get to work where he can.

1110
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,440
It's definitely a competitive field.

1111
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,920
If somebody wants him to take crack to Kid Planet, like-

1112
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,760
Here's the thing.

1113
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,320
The thing that's crazier is when the new movie starts.

1114
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,000
Hustle's in the new movie, by the way.

1115
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,280
When the new movie starts, he's back on his grind.

1116
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:35,600
Yeah, no.

1117
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,520
He's in there hunting and you know he's moving that good stuff.

1118
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,080
Yeah.

1119
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,760
I got a shipment of Ewok gallbladders here.

1120
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,240
Keep it down.

1121
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:44,720
Keep it down.

1122
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,200
Keep it down.

1123
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,800
Shit's illegal on this planet.

1124
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,440
You smoke, though.

1125
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,000
Legal everywhere.

1126
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,480
Enjoy.

1127
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,840
I got to go deliver some crack.

1128
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,800
You smoke some of that.

1129
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,160
Oh, man.

1130
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,680
Why do you think those old guys are so happy all the fucking time?

1131
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,320
It's because their livers produce crack.

1132
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,520
That's where it comes from.

1133
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,600
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

1134
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,080
Thank you so much for listening.

1135
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,640
We have a few things that we just want to run through.

1136
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,240
If you're going to be at our live shows in early June in DC and New York,

1137
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,880
sadly, they're sold out if you don't already have tickets.

1138
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,480
But if you do have tickets, you're going to be there.

1139
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,280
Please send us questions to address at the show.

1140
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,560
Send in questions with DC Live Show or NYC Live Show in the subject line.

1141
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,120
All caps.

1142
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,080
We make sure to see it.

1143
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,880
If you're planning on asking us a question at the show,

1144
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,560
don't not send in a question because of that.

1145
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,080
Because honestly, we only get to three or four audience questions,

1146
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,960
and we always have tons of people waiting.

1147
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,640
So go ahead and send in your questions, and we'll answer them during the show.

1148
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,480
You all right?

1149
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,600
You get exhausted?

1150
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,280
I just thought you guys would pick it up and say something.

1151
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,760
You did great.

1152
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,960
You didn't leave any breaks.

1153
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,160
I was waiting for the end of your pain to sigh.

1154
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,680
Yeah.

1155
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,560
Yeah, I mean, that's it.

1156
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,920
I just did an interview on Uproxx.

1157
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,200
That was really fun.

1158
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,400
Yeah, that was cool, Travis.

1159
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,000
That made me feel like you're a big deal.

1160
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,320
It's nice to feel like a big deal for once.

1161
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,880
You can check that out.

1162
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,280
I'll tweet it, or you can just search like Uproxx with two X's and Travis McElroy.

1163
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:13,680
And it comes up.

1164
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,600
It was a lovely interview with David Pemberton.

1165
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,320
It was really good.

1166
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,960
So there's a bunch of other shows on the Max Fun Network.

1167
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,680
If you like this show, I guarantee you there will be at least one other show on the network.

1168
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,320
Probably like eight other shows on the network, though, that you'll really enjoy.

1169
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,880
I'm talking about shows like the Beef and Dairy Network.

1170
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,360
I'm talking about shows like Throwing Shade.

1171
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,360
I'm talking about shows like Jordan Jesse Go and Judge John Hodgman and Stop Podcasting Yourself.

1172
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,400
There's a ton of really good shows.

1173
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,960
If you want to hear us do more shows, go to McElroyShows.com.

1174
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,200
We've got a bunch of other podcasts like The Adventure Zone.

1175
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,280
We're about to start a new arc on The Adventure Zone.

1176
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,240
I would say it's actually a good time to get on because we're about to start a new arc.

1177
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,640
But I feel like at this point, you should probably start at the beginning or else you'll be lost.

1178
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:54,560
But I also want to plug Rose Buddies, which is the bachelor themed show that I do with my wife,

1179
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:54,960
Rachel.

1180
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,040
I'm very, very proud of this show.

1181
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,880
I love doing it so much.

1182
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,760
And a new season of The Bachelor starts tonight.

1183
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,800
It's actually The Bachelor, right?

1184
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,600
Inspired by you, Griffin.

1185
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,880
I got a group together.

1186
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,320
You're fucking kidding.

1187
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,840
And we're doing the draft and everything.

1188
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,400
Yeah, we have.

1189
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,440
So our last episode was a preview of this upcoming season.

1190
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,640
And then Rules for How We Do Our Fantasy League.

1191
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,440
It's so much fun.

1192
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,840
Yeah, that was our most recent episode.

1193
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,280
So you could listen to that today and be ready for the episode tonight.

1194
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,880
And then listen all season while we talk about it.

1195
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,320
Anyway, that's one of the shows.

1196
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,600
There's many, many other ones.

1197
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,200
I also wanted to plug one of my shows that's not on any network, a little independent show

1198
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,200
called Interrobang with Travis and Tybee, where we talk about things that are frustrating us,

1199
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,640
so maybe frustrating you.

1200
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:40,320
And it's a very honest, heartfelt, scary, scary show to make.

1201
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,000
And I really love doing it.

1202
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,720
And it's a great show.

1203
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,680
And people seem to like it.

1204
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,720
And I'd love for you to check it out.

1205
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,240
You can go to interrobangcast.com and check it out.

1206
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,960
Also, Justin and I are doing a series of Monster Factory videos.

1207
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,880
If you've never watched Monster Factory, it's videos that me and Justin do for Polygon where

1208
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,600
we make ugly, ugly, not ugly, they're beautiful characters in games that allow you to do so.

1209
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,360
And then challenging, challenging characters.

1210
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,640
Let me just fuck games up.

1211
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,520
And then Totino's friend of the family at this point, Totino's, who sponsored the McElroy

1212
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:14,800
family, Totino's Fun Hour here on my Bim Bam, has sponsored a three episode run of Monster

1213
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,400
Factory episodes, which we are conducting in Second Life.

1214
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,960
The second of those three episodes goes up today.

1215
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,840
And holy fucking shit, it turned out so good, Justin.

1216
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,440
Oh, really?

1217
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:27,920
Is it good?

1218
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,280
It's a good old episode.

1219
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,800
Yeah, so yeah, go check out Monster Factory.

1220
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,520
You can find it on YouTube.

1221
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,800
You can find it on Polygon's YouTube channel.

1222
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,960
You can just search Monster Factory and you'll find it there.

1223
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,880
You can also go to McElroyShows.com.

1224
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,720
Everything's there, including our contact and our Twitters and Facebook, everything.

1225
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,360
Thanks to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1226
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,640
off Putting the Days to Bed.

1227
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,040
It's a really, really great album.

1228
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,560
Get started listening to it now.

1229
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,000
It'll get pumped for the summer months.

1230
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,040
I know it's a band called The Long Winters, but you can listen to it for all seasons.

1231
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,800
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us?

1232
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,680
Oh, hell yeah, I do.

1233
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,120
This one's sent in by Aaron Keys.

1234
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,840
Thank you, Aaron.

1235
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,680
Aaron might need a nickname soon.

1236
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,320
It's from Yahoo Answers user Bruce.

1237
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,200
The Keyster.

1238
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,000
The Keyster.

1239
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,120
That's terrible.

1240
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,240
We'll come up with something better.

1241
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,120
It's from Yahoo Answers user, and this is all caps, so I am going to shout it.

1242
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,920
I apologize.

1243
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,420
Bruce!

1244
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,700
And then Bruce's question is also in all caps, so I'm going to have to shout it as well.

1245
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,660
I apologize.

1246
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,540
Bruce's question is...

1247
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,220
Is this Yahoo email support?

1248
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,460
My name's Justin McElroy.

1249
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,420
I'm Travis McElroy.

1250
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,700
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1251
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,900
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1252
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,620
Kiss your dad.

1253
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:48,820
Square on the lips.

Every Tuesday, we bring you Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine, a show about all

1262
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:17,300
the dumb, weird, terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

1263
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,460
You know, some light summer listening.

1264
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,100
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

1265
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,620
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

1266
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:33,780
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday right here on the Maximum Fun Network

1267
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:41,460
with Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine.
