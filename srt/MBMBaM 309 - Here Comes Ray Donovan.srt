1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. We usually come up with topical humor, quote-unquote,

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,200
for both. The only problem is all the topics, they suck ass. Yeah, a lot of the topics suck ass

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,920
this week, just like not a lot of real gut busters, but you know what? You don't come to

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,800
us for that. I'm of the opinion that things will improve. They statistically almost have to at this

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:29,760
point, but we combed the news, scrolled through several pages, and tried to find some happy

12
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,760
headlines to just brighten everybody's day. So good news. Good news. Ray Donovan's coming back

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,440
for big season four. Big fourth season. Fourth season for Ray Donovan and gang. First of all,

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:54,000
thank you Showtime Stars. I think that's it. Thanks to Showtime Stars for bringing us back.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ray Donovan, the handyman with a heart that fixes those around him just as he's fixing their windows

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,360
and stuff. Here's what I know about Ray Donovan. I saw a commercial once and he walked into a hotel

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,440
room and Jon Voight was sitting there and Jon Voight had a gun. Now, Ray Donovan's just there

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,320
to fix your fucking radiator, Mr. Voight. So maybe calm that shit down for like a second.

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:32,320
But you know what? It's back. It's back. June 26th. It premiered last night or Sunday depending on

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,360
whether or not you're recording this with us right now or you're listening to it in the future.

21
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,800
Fans of Ray Donovan rejoiced. Ray's back. Hey, Ray. Ray's back. A ray of sunshine, they said.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,920
Fuck. What kind of relationships for Ray Donovan in the fourth season of it?

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,760
Well, he's got eight kids and they're quite a handful, I bet.

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,960
Four from his marriage and four from his wife's previous marriage. How will the two

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,560
families ever come together? And one is the cyber clone of Jon Voight and that's the ninth child.

26
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,960
Four seasons should have big impacts on all the storylines and I think it's good news

27
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,560
for people who watch Ray Donovan that he's back. And I think I have heard scuttlebutt through the

28
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,200
grapevine that this will be that they finally caught up to the books. So now season four,

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
they have actually gotten ahead of the book. So there will be stuff happening

30
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,960
that you haven't been able to read about in the Ray Donovan universe before now.

31
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:48,000
So it should be all new, rough, raw, pure Ray. I heard a lot of rumors vis-a-vis

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,560
Liev Shriver's dick is in every episode as a contractual obligation.

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,040
But not attached. What they do is they photoshop it into pictures in the background.

34
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,160
And when you look in the mantle and you see like family pictures somewhere in there

35
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,520
is Liev Shriver's dick.

36
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,000
But it's another character and they call it Greg Donovan, which doesn't make any fucking sense.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,760
God, I love this show. I'm so glad it's back for a fourth season on Starz.

38
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,880
One time we saw Liev Shriver in Glengarry Glen Ross and during curtain call,

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,680
we were in the front row and my dad said, thank you. And Liev Shriver pointed at my dad and said,

40
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,760
no, thank you. So I'm really excited that Ray Donovan is back for another season.

41
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,440
Liev Shriver finally getting the respect that he deserves.

42
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,280
A Showtime or Starz agent was in the audience, saw that interaction and said,

43
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
that's the kind of class that I want to give a Ray Donovan to.

44
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
For four seasons, at least.

45
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,600
At least four seasons, if not eight.

46
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,280
You just can't go wrong if you're a Ray Donovan fan with the news.

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,880
The only news currently that is good for Ray Donovan.

48
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,600
Now is this going to be the season where he finally fixes his dad's very broken toilet?

49
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
It's kind of his white. It's kind of his white whale as a handyman, huh?

50
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
His white porcelain whale.

51
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,840
Yeah, he probably would fix it, but probably not the way 2016 is going.

52
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,600
He'll probably try to fix it and it'll blow up and cut his butt off.

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,240
I'll fucking...

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Ray Donovan, please don't die.

55
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,120
Please don't die, Ray Donovan. You're the only good thing the world has left, Ray Donovan.

56
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,640
I'm literally on my RSS feed right now, just looking for a little...

57
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,840
What the fuck? The Google RSS thing got shut down?

58
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
Fuck! What the fuck is happening?

59
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,600
It's okay, Griffin. Ray Donovan will fix us all.

60
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,480
Ray Donovan's back for four seasons.

61
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,000
Maybe Ray Donovan's fourth season premiere is the global moon landing

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
that we all need to unite as a people and remember there's more that unites us.

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you remember when we all used to have differences and problems

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,680
and we all used to fight about what I can't even remember?

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,560
But then Ray Donovan not only fixes dad's toilet, but also fixed us all.

66
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
But fucking, that's the thing, it brings us all together.

67
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
Everybody starts watching it and then Showtime or Starz jacks up the subscription fee,

68
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,920
leaving the three of us to start an underground Ray Donovan streaming network.

69
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,040
You can't stop the fucking signal, Starz or Showtime.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
One of those two.

71
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
One of you? Maybe both?

72
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,600
We're getting pretty excited about Ray Donovan.

73
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,000
You can have your episodes of Ray Donovan for $100 a piece.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,120
I'm Starz or Showtime.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,760
I'll probably just head to my local watering hole for one of the Ray days,

76
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,720
which is where they have everybody over and put Ray Donovan up on a big screen and everybody,

77
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,600
because you don't want to be left out when the spoilers start a coming

78
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,560
for Ray Donovan, the season four premiere.

79
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,280
Season four of Ray Donovan.

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,400
You can stick around for Ray Donovan trivia night, Ray Donovan karaoke.

81
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,320
You know, it's a whole event, you know, and I've made a lot of good Ray fans.

82
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,880
You know what I mean?

83
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Like, yeah, it's me and them, you know, we're in this together.

84
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,840
And then you get that Chris Hardwick hosted after show Donovan's boys.

85
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,720
Uh-huh.

86
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,800
And each week they have one of the children on, one of the nine kids on to talk about,

87
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
like, just what they're going through.

88
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
My dream is that somewhere Leo Schreiber is listening to this and saying,

89
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
oh, it's really nice.

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,320
Hey, thanks guys.

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,120
Thanks guys.

92
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
I'm glad I can help, you know, sometimes you question your impact of the,

93
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,760
your art on this world and it's nice to know that I've made a difference.

94
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,760
I don't know where you're getting some of the stuff about me being a handyman,

95
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,120
but art is interpretation by definition.

96
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,680
So maybe you're talking about a different show, but that's okay.

97
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,800
You know, press is press.

98
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,020
Yeah.

99
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,340
Press is press.

100
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,700
Go watch Ray Donovan.

101
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,620
Please, please watch Ray Donovan.

102
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,020
Season four.

103
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,180
Please watch Ray Donovan.

104
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,300
Please watch Billions.

105
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,220
Please watch Billions.

106
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,780
Please watch Ray Donovan.

107
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,940
Please watch, you can stop watching Homeland,

108
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,540
but watch Billions and Ray Donovan.

109
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,540
Who would have the fucking stomach for Homeland right now?

110
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,100
Nobody.

111
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,460
Yeah, that's, that's what I'm saying.

112
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,960
It's gone.

113
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,460
If they shot a new season in 24 right now, like Jack Bauer would go,

114
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,500
I don't even know what to do.

115
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,780
I don't know where to start.

116
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,660
I got nothing.

117
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,620
I got nothing.

118
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm going to go watch Ray Donovan.

119
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,420
It'll be him running around for 24 hours just gilling everybody.

120
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,780
Be cool, get on the ground.

121
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,280
Be cool.

122
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,220
I'll kill your family if you don't be cool.

123
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,460
Everybody just be cool for two seconds.

124
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,620
Just if we can hold out until June 26th, we can all watch Ray Donovan.

125
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,260
That's it.

126
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:09,140
The new season of 24 takes place from noon June 25th to noon June 26th.

127
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,980
And he's just trying to make it home to watch Ray Donovan.

128
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,580
Fucking Ray Donovan street team.

129
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,140
Oh man.

130
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,020
Sometimes when we, when we talk about stuff on the show,

131
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
it turns into a thing where people start like,

132
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,740
sending us all the like relevant, like every link ever that connects to that thing.

133
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,260
Please, please don't do this.

134
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,700
Please don't do that with Ray Donovan.

135
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,540
I want to keep it pure in my heart.

136
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,220
Give me that, drown me in Donovan.

137
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,300
Drown me, bury me in Liev Shriver.

138
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,420
I'm, I, I, this is it though, right?

139
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,540
This is the only one.

140
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,580
And this is the only little treasure that we've got now.

141
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,940
Yeah.

142
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,740
Thank you, Liev.

143
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,340
Let's do advice questions.

144
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,540
Yeah.

145
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,100
Cause I really, I really don't want to be a bummer,

146
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,420
but we're recording this Friday morning and some stuff just happened.

147
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,180
And we're, we're just going to do our best.

148
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,140
And by stuff just happened.

149
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,900
I mean, they announced Ray Donovan season four.

150
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,780
Please read a question.

151
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,500
I'm fucking dying.

152
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,420
Um, there's, uh, unfortunately there's Griffin.

153
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm looking through the news.

154
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,100
There's really nothing else.

155
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,220
That's, uh, didn't cheer anybody up or anything worth talking.

156
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,060
I want to merge squad.

157
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,940
Oh boy.

158
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,420
Yes.

159
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,380
Right when we needed it.

160
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,540
I want to merge squad.

161
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,180
Right there at the top, huh?

162
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,860
Well, it's, it's, it's fucking, it is literally breaking news, Travis.

163
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,180
The nastiest boy has come to roost.

164
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,460
Yeah.

165
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,540
We are, uh, fucking, I refuse.

166
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,820
I refuse to give into this current of negativity.

167
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,940
I refuse.

168
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,940
We will continue to be the Island, that bright Island in this river.

169
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,740
And right now this bright Island is going to talk about the Burger King Mac and Cheetos.

170
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,300
That's right.

171
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,660
That's right.

172
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,220
It happened.

173
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,980
Burger King.

174
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm trying really hard with my voice to make this sound positive and not also depressing news.

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,340
See if you can tell the times when I falter, they will be plentiful and noticeable.

176
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,900
Yeah.

177
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,980
I want to much Burger King.

178
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,260
This is the much squad.

179
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,460
Um, Burger King is adding the, um, Mac and Cheetos.

180
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,860
Would you call, would you call Burger King a featured player in the much squad segment?

181
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,460
If it feels like they're, they're really trying some stuff out.

182
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,180
They're really seeing what sticks on the old wall.

183
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,900
You know what I mean?

184
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,380
Yeah.

185
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,980
Which is the way that I didn't even get to talk about the Waparito cause they have gone.

186
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,060
So like also the Waparito just like two for that.

187
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,700
But let's talk about the Burger King Mac and Cheetos.

188
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,340
What is that?

189
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,740
Okay.

190
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,500
Well these fucking people took Mac and cheese bites, which are already an abomination.

191
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,740
They're like chunks of Mac and cheese that are fried.

192
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,940
You ever look at Mac, you ever look at a big bowl of Mac and cheese and think like, I would

193
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,340
love to stick my fingers in and on that.

194
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,100
It's deep fried Mac and cheese shaped like a large Cheeto puff and then coated.

195
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,620
Nothing we've heard so far.

196
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,740
Nothing we've heard so far and then, uh, coated with crispy Cheeto flavor.

197
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,660
What much squad is about is bringing you the direct line from these companies, uh, uh,

198
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,940
uh, that what they want to get across, you know what I'm saying?

199
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,860
Like what their message is because I don't care.

200
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,980
I know there's a bunch of people on YouTube that'll probably like review this item or

201
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,380
whatever.

202
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,460
I do not, I give not a crap about that.

203
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,540
Can I just say real quick, do you remember a time in like the mid two thousands when

204
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,420
it was all about like maybe people want salads?

205
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,580
Yeah, that was weird.

206
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,700
We've got like a walnut, cranberry, feta cheese salad and now it's like, Hey, trash

207
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,260
people, you know what?

208
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,300
Instead of those French fries, how about a little bit of yogurt?

209
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,180
Oh no.

210
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,500
You want to eat a literal trash bag full of macaroni and cheese, huh?

211
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:00,900
Okay.

212
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,060
Um, so this is the lead quote in, from the press release about the Burger King Mac and

213
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,460
Cheetos.

214
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,860
And I know they didn't, I know that they did this earlier in the week, but just in context

215
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,700
is pretty great.

216
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,220
Here's the quote, Mac and Cheetos make the previously unthinkable a reality.

217
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,940
Like, is that what we needed?

218
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,380
Is that, did you look at the global climate and say, Hmm, I think what I need to do is

219
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,100
make the previously unthinkable a reality.

220
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,660
We need to give everyone something to blame.

221
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,380
Hmm.

222
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,700
Gotta, I see, I'm reading another quote here and it's from Burger King food scientist,

223
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,900
Kenneth Bainbridge, who said, now we are all sons of bitches.

224
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,660
We have become Mac and Cheetos, destroyer of worlds.

225
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,380
Um, so it's pretty exciting news.

226
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,900
Um, this is, um, here's another quote.

227
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,100
This is, they don't give these to specific people, by the way.

228
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,860
They just say Burger King sad.

229
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,260
Wait, is it the Burger King?

230
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,020
The Burger King said for anyone who ever wished they could eat warm Mac and cheese, like they

231
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,380
do a bag of chips, Mac and Cheetos makes the previously unthinkable a reality.

232
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,620
Now with this cheesy treat, everyone can snack on the go when they're on route to the beach.

233
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,900
Good luck out there or during a summer road trip.

234
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Plan frequent stops, hope there's a rest area nearby.

235
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,820
You just ate Mac and, you ate a dookie bullet, my friend.

236
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,780
You ate Mac and cheese coated in Cheetos.

237
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,580
See you in 15 minutes, Mac and Cheetos.

238
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:52,020
I hope everyone needs to collect a lot of brochures for local attractions because that

239
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,060
is the opportunity that is about to present itself on our fun summer road trip.

240
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,740
Who's like, I just spent six months on the Atkins diet, get my beach body right.

241
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,860
And I'm going to unspool all of that hard work in the span of one Cheetos bite.

242
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,820
I like that.

243
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,580
For anyone who's ever wondered like or ever wanted to eat Mac and cheese like chips, are

244
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,780
they talking about like 42 people tops that have been like super stoned and they're just

245
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,700
like, I enjoy this Mac and cheese, but I wish I didn't have to use a spoon.

246
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,420
I mean, Travis, a few weeks ago, I probably would agree with your assessment.

247
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,100
But now I'm not so sure.

248
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,380
Maybe that's apparently a lot of people would like to eat Mac and cheese like chips on the

249
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,780
way to the beach, the beach.

250
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,940
Mom, I need to go in the ocean.

251
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,300
I'm fucking coated.

252
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,180
Stay there.

253
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,980
Stay there, Dylan.

254
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,500
You belong to the Merman now.

255
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,180
I wish that Burger King's whole line was like, we didn't want to do this.

256
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,540
This is not our choice.

257
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,220
We didn't want to do this.

258
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,340
You have made us make Mac and Cheetos.

259
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,860
Please, God, free us from this.

260
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,420
Where the Doritos, I've eaten Doritos Locos Tacos and now I feel like I am part of the

261
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,900
problem because I did not know when that product was announced, it would be such an enormous

262
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:16,340
destabilizing force in the in the food service industry because now contributed to it because

263
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,140
now fucking everybody's just like, what's the thing about Fritos hot dog?

264
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,260
That's nothing.

265
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,580
You can't about a corn dog that's made out of Funyuns.

266
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
That would actually probably be good soup.

267
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,540
That would be good as fuck.

268
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,740
Pepsi soup.

269
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,300
So I grab a coffee at the same coffee shop every morning.

270
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,220
This morning, when the barista took my change out of the register, he looked me dead in

271
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,100
the eyes and put my change into the tip jar.

272
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,420
What the fuck is going on?

273
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,620
It's like the fucking purge every day out there now.

274
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,740
I was flustered.

275
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,240
Yeah.

276
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,040
And my response was to put an extra quarter into the tip jar before taking my coffee.

277
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,940
You.

278
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,980
Wow.

279
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,280
Yeah, I guess that's one response.

280
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,720
I guess I wouldn't do the same.

281
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,640
I'm a little miffed in retrospect, but maybe it's not a big deal.

282
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,440
I mean, I was going to give my changes a tip anyway, so it shouldn't have mattered.

283
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,360
Should I have done something different?

284
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,360
Am I good?

285
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
And that's from the great Canadian coin couch.

286
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,760
And in Canada, they got those dollar coins, those two dollar coins, so that change could

287
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,880
have been a significant chunk of money, right?

288
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
Loonies and toonies.

289
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah, loonies and toonies, loonies and toonies.

290
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,600
It's a fucking-

291
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,840
Loonies, toonies, throonies.

292
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,280
Spoonies, boonies.

293
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,720
It's just theft.

294
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,520
It's corporate theft, but it's not-

295
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,720
Not only theft, Griffin.

296
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
It's not just theft, it's challenge theft.

297
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,680
It's theft that says, say something.

298
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,120
Say something.

299
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,160
You ain't gonna say something?

300
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,840
I'm the coffee guy.

301
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,680
You gotta have this shit.

302
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
You need this.

303
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,080
You need this.

304
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,000
And I need this.

305
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
And they just take your fucking phone.

306
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm gonna sell this on-

307
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,320
Put it in the tin jar.

308
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,400
Sorry, it's in the jar, bud.

309
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
Going on Craigslist tomorrow.

310
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,200
It's in the jar.

311
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't come back out of the jar.

312
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Once it's in the jar, I don't know what to tell you.

313
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,040
Phone's in the jar.

314
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,560
I'm gonna sell all your contacts to advertisers, idiot.

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
Here's your cup of mud.

316
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,040
You need this.

317
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Enjoy this shitty muffin.

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,480
This muffin-

319
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,360
Show your bad muffin.

320
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,760
This muffin's dry as fuck, but that's okay,

321
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,040
because it's the purge.

322
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,520
Take 10 muffins, just kick in the fucking display case

323
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,360
and start grabbing baked goods,

324
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,880
because no rule's just right.

325
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,960
Even in Canada, I thought you were cool.

326
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
I thought you guys were doing okay up there.

327
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,480
Yeah, I thought y'all were doing all right.

328
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,880
This is the problem.

329
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
You should be going to Tim Hortons,

330
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
because this shit would not happen at Tim Hortons.

331
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,440
That's true.

332
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,680
A local chain where there's accountability.

333
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,560
I agree with you, Trav.

334
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,160
This is the problem.

335
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,840
You go to those mom and pop shops

336
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,680
and they steal your change.

337
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,520
I've always said that.

338
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,800
I've always said that.

339
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,600
Don't trust local business.

340
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,760
The best advice we can give you is

341
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,600
don't let yourself get stolen from,

342
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,720
but that ship has sailed.

343
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,240
Is there any recourse?

344
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,840
Well, the second advice would be

345
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,760
if you do let yourself get stolen from,

346
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,280
don't also give them more.

347
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,680
Yeah, don't-

348
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,160
What?

349
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,440
Yeah, that's not a good way to go.

350
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
Does this appease you?

351
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,160
Might I return to your coffee establishment tomorrow

352
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,360
and face no judgment?

353
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,080
Evil happens when good people stand by and say nothing.

354
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,920
You should have taken all the money out of the tip jar

355
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,520
and said, well, it's contaminated now.

356
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,240
This is all mine.

357
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm not counting it.

358
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,360
Well, and Justin, super evil happens

359
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,920
when good people then help the bad people

360
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,720
do more bad stuff by giving them more money.

361
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,160
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

362
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,680
Is it possible that this coffee shop

363
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,440
is like a Dick's Last Resort kind of deal

364
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,240
where it's like, oh, the baristas are kind of rude to you.

365
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,200
That's the whole thing.

366
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,880
That's not, it's different though.

367
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
It's like Dick's Last Resort,

368
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,280
if they took your money and then didn't give you coffee

369
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,200
and then they took your phone

370
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,280
and they sold the contacts on Craigslist.

371
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,280
Basically, yeah.

372
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,360
It's criminal.

373
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,960
I would go to that restaurant.

374
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,920
Just to mix it up?

375
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,040
Just to mix it up.

376
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,080
And you know, just some days you just want to feel

377
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,200
like you're worthless.

378
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,400
You know, not for all day,

379
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,480
but just while you're eating food, you know?

380
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,560
You just want someone to treat you like garbage.

381
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,960
Have you ever been to Dick's Purge Cafe?

382
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
It's fucking great.

383
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,240
My brother went there and he got killed,

384
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,440
but it's fine because it's Dick's Purge Cafe.

385
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,360
It's perfect.

386
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,240
It's perfect.

387
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,400
They got a kiosk at the airport.

388
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,120
You can get purged right there before your flight.

389
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,680
You can get purged right there at this spot.

390
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,960
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

391
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,240
How about a Yahoo, huh?

392
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,160
Just give me like fucking a minute.

393
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,600
Can we just pause the show for a minute

394
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,920
so I can just look at a picture of Ray Donovan?

395
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,880
To just recharge the old batteries.

396
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,400
I gotta fill up the meter.

397
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,380
Okay.

398
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,840
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey.

399
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,400
Thank you, Morgan.

400
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,840
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

401
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,480
User Absidal who says,

402
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,400
how was hacking done before the internet existed?

403
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,600
Did people make their own internet?

404
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,280
Update.

405
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,520
I heard computer hacking was being done in the 70s and 80s.

406
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,920
I know the War Games movie was fiction,

407
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
but didn't it depict a true to life technique?

408
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,920
I think hackings existed since like the Donovan,

409
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,000
but it used to be just like one Gregorian monk would go to another one

410
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,320
and like open up the book he'd been copying over

411
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,560
and would write like, butt cheeks.

412
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,960
Got you again, Gerald, idiot.

413
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,880
I hacked your book.

414
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,720
I cracked your mainframe, butt cheeks.

415
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,600
I mean, hacking would be a lot different

416
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,840
if you showed up to someone's house and they're like,

417
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,480
can I help you?

418
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,560
You're like, yeah, I'm here to hack your computer.

419
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,840
Please, may I hack your computer, please?

420
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,200
Because I guess I don't even know what that word means.

421
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,720
I'm Ray Donovan, 1970s computer hacker.

422
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,920
I'm here to fix your toilet.

423
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,960
By the way, I need to get on your computer

424
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,640
to learn how to fix your toilet.

425
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,680
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

426
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,760
I've got all your files, by which I mean some numbers

427
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,160
that you made your computer add together earlier

428
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
because that's basically all it can fucking do.

429
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,440
It would be good in ye olden days

430
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
because you'd have abacus hacking,

431
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,720
which would be great

432
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,800
because it would just, you know,

433
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,280
you just screwed a couple beads.

434
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,600
Six, seven, nine.

435
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,760
Damn it, who took my eight?

436
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,200
Somebody took my eight beat away.

437
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,440
This shit used to be on punch cards.

438
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,320
That would be fun too.

439
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,400
You just fucking bite into it with your teeth.

440
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,880
Hacked it.

441
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,160
You're not going to run that program good at all.

442
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,480
Who melted all my wax cylinders?

443
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,200
Hacked.

444
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,640
Go to some hieroglyphic.

445
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,040
You fucking put your butt on it.

446
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,000
Ah, hacked it.

447
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,040
Hacked it.

448
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,520
Got you.

449
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,720
Got you Cleopatra.

450
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,920
You like that shit?

451
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920
What historical act does this urn represent?

452
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,040
Well, if you read the characters,

453
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,200
smash, you got hacked.

454
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,400
What's all this dust in there?

455
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,920
That's my dad's ashes.

456
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,000
Fuck, ah, Cleo, I'm so sorry.

457
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,040
I goofed up real bad.

458
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,720
I was just trying to-

459
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,920
It was supposed to be a hack.

460
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,040
Do you know what that word means?

461
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,320
I was just trying to hack it.

462
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,360
Oh no.

463
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,240
Oh golly.

464
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,160
Has anyone seen the script for Love's Labors 1?

465
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,360
Oh, sorry Shakespeare.

466
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,920
I hacked it.

467
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,560
I hacked your shit.

468
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,360
I hacked your script.

469
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,440
That means I threw it in the creek with all the swans.

470
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,880
The swans ate your script Shakespeare.

471
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,600
That one's on me.

472
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,840
Got drunk on meat and hacked it.

473
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,960
Nobody's ever going to read K2, King Lear 2.

474
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,080
Sorry.

475
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,200
Everything gets better.

476
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,920
King Lear 2.

477
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,680
By the way, K2 is a sweet name for that.

478
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,760
I hope other people pick that up after the Mighty Ducks movie

479
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,120
and Terminator.

480
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,480
People got into that for a while, huh?

481
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,000
I was thinking about that yesterday.

482
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,500
Equals?

483
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,600
Just the one letter and the number.

484
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,080
And then it was like, I guess we'll go see that.

485
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,200
I mean, we could say the whole thing.

486
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,000
It's not that hard.

487
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,560
This is not.

488
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,360
It's pretty easy.

489
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,040
If this is the hardest episode of this podcast we've ever recorded,

490
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I need there to be fucking like-

491
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,920
I need there to be a Better Call Saul style spin-off of Ray Donovan

492
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,400
starring Jon Voight and maybe he takes three of the kids under his wing

493
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,560
and there's two Ray Donovan shows on the-

494
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,880
Like, that's how fucking bad it's gotten out there.

495
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Travis sent a picture of-

496
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
Oh, cool.

497
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,240
Thanks, Trav.

498
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,800
Travis sent a high-res JPEG of Ray Donovan.

499
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,440
That's something I could just sort of look at whenever-

500
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,560
It's not even that big.

501
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,440
Thanks, Trav.

502
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,360
Wait, I fucking skimp on the bytes.

503
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,960
What are you paying by the byte?

504
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,240
This is a very small picture of- It's whatever I can Google, Justin.

505
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,280
I'm doing my best here.

506
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,440
Now, this is a big picture of Ray Donovan, but the quality is extremely bad.

507
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,600
I think I'd rather have small Ray Donovan with the fucking crispness

508
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,760
because this one prominently features the eyes.

509
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,400
Yeah, this looks like somebody took a picture with their phone of Ray Donovan.

510
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,080
The first one's like he's looking directly at me.

511
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,560
I'd love to get zoomed in on this picture, but I can't because it's so small.

512
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,080
Let's see if this one does you better.

513
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,880
Please stop sending me pictures of Ray Donovan.

514
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,360
I will not.

515
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,120
So I just sent you a picture of a man I just found on LinkedIn

516
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,040
whose name is also Ray Donovan.

517
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,320
Do you think it's based on his life?

518
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,440
Can you even imagine?

519
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,640
Maybe it's him.

520
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,800
I understand that we're pressed for time here,

521
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,800
but if you guys don't start sending me bigger, glossier JPEGs,

522
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,040
I don't think I'm going to be able to get through this show.

523
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,640
I need big, big pictures of people named Ray Donovan.

524
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,560
Justin, I can't afford glossy JPEGs of Ray Donovan.

525
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,600
Can you read a fucking question about,

526
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,760
but like try to fit Ray Donovan into it?

527
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:00,840
Okay.

528
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,240
Okay, I'll do my best.

529
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,320
It's got to be organic though.

530
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,360
I'm just really excited for the fourth season of Ray Donovan to start.

531
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm so excited.

532
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,200
I recently took a trip to visit my old college roommate,

533
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,080
Ray Donovan in his new city, New York.

534
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,120
I'm almost certain Ray Donovan takes place in Los Angeles.

535
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,600
Yeah, that sounds better.

536
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,400
I recently took a trip to visit my old college roommate,

537
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,520
Ray Donovan in his new city, Los Angeles, City of Angels.

538
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,360
His current friend group peppered me with questions

539
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,600
about how he was in college,

540
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
asking for additional details or explanation

541
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,040
of some of Ray Donovan's stories.

542
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,320
A couple of tales about Ray Donovan caught my attention

543
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,360
for an interesting reason.

544
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,960
They happened to me.

545
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,520
My old roommate, Ray Donovan,

546
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,360
has been using events from my life to regale his current friends.

547
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,400
Is this something I need to address?

548
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,720
Should I let it go and just allow this Gilderoy Lockhart

549
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,880
to profit from my experiences?

550
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,720
That says, help me brothers.

551
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,640
That's from Who Lives Who Dies Who Tells Your Story.

552
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,480
How fucking sick was your life in college?

553
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,640
Probably pretty good.

554
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,240
Like, it sounds like you don't, yeah.

555
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,120
You should be careful before confronting Ray Donovan.

556
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,320
Yeah, that's true.

557
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,120
Like, what did you, like, one time I ate an ATV.

558
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,400
That's weird because Ray Donovan said he did that.

559
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
So who's lying here?

560
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,720
That's weird because if you tell that story to his friends,

561
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,560
like, they're gonna think that you're the liar.

562
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,880
That sounds really similar to the story Ray Donovan told us

563
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,320
about the time he ate a go-kart.

564
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,560
I think he might be full of shit.

565
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,880
Wait, did you say you ate a dune buggy?

566
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Wait a minute.

567
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,160
Wait a minute, hold on a second.

568
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,920
Do you think that this is a scenario in which,

569
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,120
sometimes you tell a story enough

570
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,560
that it starts to feel like your own.

571
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,280
This is like a psychological thing

572
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,920
where you eventually, like, tell it enough

573
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,160
that it feels like it's yours.

574
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,200
Okay, I hear that, I've heard that said so much

575
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,400
and it may be true,

576
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,840
but to me, that defense always sounded like you're saying,

577
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,080
I lied so much, I did so much lying,

578
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,680
that it's basically the truth now.

579
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,200
Rather than being angry, you should feel bad for them

580
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,520
when they heard you were coming to visit.

581
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,320
Think about the farcical mid-90s Steve Martin movie level

582
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,800
of twists and turns and hoops they'd have to jump through

583
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,920
to get ready for your visit.

584
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,200
Like, the trailer starts with like, you're coming when?

585
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,280
And then they have to like take down all the photos

586
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,680
all the Photoshop pictures of you and John Voight

587
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,200
that they put up to try to make it seem

588
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,240
like they actually met John Voight

589
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,320
when it was you that met John Voight.

590
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,360
It's like mixed nuts, but with less murder.

591
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,400
Cause I don't know if you guys remember

592
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,240
in that Christmas time movie,

593
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,760
they fucking murder a guy, mixed nuts.

594
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I think if you are visiting this person at most once a year,

595
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,280
this is not a problem that affects your life in any way.

596
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,800
I think that this is like more of an issue

597
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,360
that you need to take stock for future

598
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,440
of like your relationship with this friend

599
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,000
where you're like, how many things have they said to me

600
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,800
that were a lie?

601
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,920
But like, all this would do if you would confront this

602
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,960
is like make you seem like a turd, really.

603
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,040
I mean, this person's trying to build a new life

604
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,120
in a new city and they're trying their best, man.

605
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,280
Making friends in a new place is hard.

606
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,160
Yeah, you gotta lie.

607
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,360
You just gotta lie a lot.

608
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,280
Like if you're gonna, you can't make a few friends

609
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,160
without breaking a few lie eggs is what they say.

610
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,360
I'm not saying it's ideal.

611
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,320
This is clearly a crutch that this person has fallen back on.

612
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,560
Sure.

613
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,480
But like, I don't think you're doing any,

614
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,320
I don't think that this is hurting anyone.

615
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,880
And I think you like confronting them

616
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,560
or going to their new friends and be like,

617
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,240
hey, all those stories were mine

618
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,200
would only serve to like vindicate you in some way.

619
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,360
Like unless it's in some way,

620
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,800
I can't predict hurting their new friend group

621
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,640
that your friend is telling these stories.

622
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,680
I don't think you benefit anything

623
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,280
by calling your friend out.

624
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,640
Trav, I think you're completely right.

625
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,200
Unless, unless they were trying to save you

626
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,720
from being in the extremely unenviable position

627
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,560
of being the person that they told

628
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,080
all their college stories about

629
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,640
and then you've come to visit.

630
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,600
Like if his every story before your business has been like,

631
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,960
and then crazy Rick was like boogity, boogity, boo.

632
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,840
And he burnt down the garbage can

633
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,360
and he pushed it down a hill.

634
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,520
Like all these crazy stories about you,

635
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,000
when you get there, everybody,

636
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,520
there's gonna be so much pressure.

637
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,600
Everybody's gonna be expecting you

638
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,920
to be like so wild and so nutty.

639
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,000
And now you could just be like Sancho Panza.

640
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,040
Just be like, man, I don't know.

641
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,760
I don't know what stunt this guy's gonna pull next.

642
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,520
But I'm just happy to be here for it.

643
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,760
You would roll up to LA and they'd be like,

644
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,480
what do you guys wanna do?

645
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,760
Should we go go-karting?

646
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,920
Come on, eat that go-kart.

647
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,680
No, I actually, I've got a meeting in the morning.

648
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,680
So I need to turn in and I'm, I've got gird now.

649
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,040
I've got gird so I can't eat any more go-karts unfortunately.

650
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
That's kind of just sort of a one-time deal.

651
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,160
Every person in their life

652
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,800
can only eat and digest a single go-kart.

653
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,040
So make it count kids, don't throw away your shot.

654
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,240
That's what Hamilton's about.

655
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,080
And it would be like that one full house episode

656
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,480
where Joey was inexplicably a substitute teacher

657
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,680
in Michelle's class.

658
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,360
And Michelle told all her friends

659
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,680
about how sick the bullwinkle impressions are gonna be

660
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,040
as soon as Joey showed up.

661
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,280
And then he showed up as like a normal teacher.

662
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
And it was like, all the kids were like,

663
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,400
man, this guy sucks.

664
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,280
I don't know why you thought he was gonna be good.

665
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,680
I was promised some dang bullwinkle impressions.

666
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Yeah, you promised like the really fucking hot puppetry

667
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,600
and sick bullwinkle impressions.

668
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,960
The idea that that would have been more cool

669
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,800
than showing up and just being a teacher

670
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,320
is so baffling to me.

671
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,280
Nowadays in 2016, like that episode would be like,

672
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,440
guys, you're gonna love it.

673
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,720
My uncle Joey's coming.

674
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,000
He's gonna teach the class.

675
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,200
And he's got a bifurcated tongue.

676
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,240
You're gonna love this shit.

677
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,800
It's awesome.

678
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,960
He looks like fucking reptile from Mortal Kombat.

679
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,920
You're gonna love this shit.

680
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,600
Show him the bifurcated tongue, Joey.

681
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,520
And he's like, it makes it so much better for pleasure.

682
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,120
And it's like, Joey, we're 10.

683
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,880
Joey, we're 10, Joey.

684
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,760
Joey, no.

685
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,120
Joey, we're 10.

686
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,720
Put on an episode of Ray Donovan

687
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,040
and let us take our nap time.

688
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,960
Yeah, but who can take a nap

689
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,800
when that fucking peep song kicks in?

690
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,760
You know the one.

691
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,720
Yeah, the one that's like-

692
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,080
Trav, how does that go?

693
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,240
Ray Donovan.

694
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,120
Right, it's like a slow pan of him

695
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,800
driving down the Hollywood Boulevard

696
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,200
like pointing at all the babes and dudes.

697
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,600
Yeah, and then stopping to fix the toilet

698
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,400
as everyone goes, ooh, and lowers their sunglasses.

699
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,880
That's Ray.

700
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,200
Well, you know they changed the theme song for season four.

701
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,320
So it's like, hey, now here he comes.

702
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,440
It's Ray's day.

703
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,320
It has like a much more-

704
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,080
And then they freeze as he like jumps up

705
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,680
and does kind of a yay pose.

706
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,320
He's making his way in LA.

707
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,200
It can be hard out there for a janitor.

708
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
It's like crash zoom to his face

709
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,640
and he's just like, point me to the toilet.

710
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,520
Point me to the toilet.

711
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,560
I'll fix it right up.

712
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,200
I hope Ray Donovan never dies.

713
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,080
Ray Donovan, the only good thing going on in the world.

714
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,920
How did it get so bad?

715
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,480
It's like 24 seven purge.

716
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,040
I thought that was a fictional movie.

717
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,160
Here comes Ray.

718
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,400
Fixing it all.

719
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,240
Ray, can you fix my toilet?

720
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,600
And then this fucking toilet reality.

721
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Ray Donovan, here he comes.

722
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,360
Don't look at the other stuff.

723
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,200
The other stuff fucking sucks.

724
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,320
Crash zoom, point me to the toilet.

725
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,360
Point me to the toilet.

726
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,560
I hope I never die.

727
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,960
Please don't cancel my show.

728
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:22,040
Everyone needs this.

729
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,880
We should start a preemptive Kickstarter

730
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,200
to make sure that Ray Donovan never gets canceled.

731
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,120
I don't know.

732
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,400
We're thinking about canceling.

733
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,800
Boom!

734
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,840
Two million dollars.

735
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,560
Stop right there.

736
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,400
At this point.

737
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,520
Okay, first off, Travis,

738
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,960
we're going to privately fund Ray Donovan.

739
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,480
We're getting ourselves on the show.

740
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,680
They don't get the money until we definitely get to be in every shot.

741
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,560
That's thing one.

742
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,400
Ray's fund three new neighbors.

743
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,920
The McBird brothers like,

744
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,240
I don't think you'll be able to fix this one, Ray.

745
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,600
Cut to end of episode.

746
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,960
You fix this one, Ray.

747
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,120
That's it.

748
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,160
We just need two lines every episode and I'll be happy.

749
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,240
Spoken in unison like a Greek chorus.

750
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,680
What if Showtime just cancels it?

751
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,280
Because Hope is so cruel.

752
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,440
And they don't want us to have any of that.

753
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,240
So they just cancel Ray Donovan preemptively.

754
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,760
We'll get it streaming on CISO.

755
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,640
We'll do our own sweeted version of Ray Donovan.

756
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,000
Dibs on Ray Donovan.

757
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,960
I call Ray Donovan his penis.

758
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,760
I'm the toilet.

759
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,560
We're all the toilet today, fellas.

760
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,680
Let's go to the money zone.

761
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,040
Okay, my brother and my brother need supported in part by harrys.com.

762
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,360
Have you ever asked yourself why razors are the only products in the drug store?

763
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,200
They're locked behind a plexiglass case.

764
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,160
It's true.

765
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,880
It's a pain in the butt to get at them.

766
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,240
But that's not the...

767
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,680
That's because they're really overpriced.

768
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,280
Harry's isn't.

769
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,480
Harry's gives you a fair price for really great blades.

770
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,120
And you know what?

771
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,280
They've been sending me new blades as they come in

772
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,640
and their new handles are really, really nice.

773
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,760
Hey, there's another good thing.

774
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,720
Ray Donovan and the improvement of Harry's handles.

775
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,520
It's like a katana, this shit.

776
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Like it feels good to the touch.

777
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,440
This is Hattori Hanzo's deal.

778
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,920
You know what?

779
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,320
A lot of times if I'm getting a sub quality shave with expensive blades,

780
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,000
you know, like it's been a couple of shaves

781
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,760
and they're not cutting as well as they used to,

782
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,160
I would just power through because they're so darn expensive.

783
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,880
Now you know what I do?

784
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,160
If it's Harry's and once that blade starts to wear down,

785
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,960
I just pop it off.

786
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,760
I treat myself to a smooth shave every single time I shave.

787
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,400
Harry's has a Truman starter set.

788
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,880
It's a great option for new customers and an amazing deal.

789
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,120
For just $15, you get a razor handle,

790
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,880
moisturizing shave cream and three of Harry's five blade

791
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,000
German engineered razors, but it gets better.

792
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,880
You're not gonna pay $15.

793
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,800
Harry's is gonna give our listeners $5 off your first purchase

794
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,920
at harrys.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word.

795
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,960
That's harrys.com.

796
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Make sure you use the code MYBROTHER.

797
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,400
Travis, so you're talking about Trunk Club

798
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,560
because I know that you're wearing that shit on the reg.

799
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm actually wearing my jeans from Trunk Club right now.

800
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,800
Um, we've had questions on this show a lot before where people have said like,

801
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,680
I don't know how to dress.

802
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm an adult who doesn't know how to dress.

803
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,520
Well, the good news is that there are people in this world who do know how to dress

804
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,840
and they will help you figure it out.

805
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,720
And suddenly it will all seem so easy to you.

806
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,160
And those people are Trunk Club.

807
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,680
How it works, and I think that this is absolutely genius.

808
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,480
And that does not sound sincere because I, Travis McElroy,

809
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,320
have a really hard time sounding sincere.

810
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,280
But it really is a genius process where basically you talk with a stylist

811
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,560
or you go on and tell them what you need on the website.

812
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,720
They send you all the stuff.

813
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,800
You try on the stuff.

814
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,840
You keep what you like.

815
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,440
You send back what you don't.

816
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,800
And you only pay for what you keep.

817
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,320
So like you're not stuck with a shirt that doesn't fit right

818
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,400
or pants that you don't like the look of.

819
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,520
You only keep what you like.

820
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,680
It's a smooth, easy process.

821
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,680
And like I said, they have stylists who will help walk you through this shit

822
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
so you're not feeling like you're on your own going,

823
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,320
I don't know, are these shorts even cool?

824
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,120
Who knows about socks and ties and stuff?

825
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,480
Well, Trunk Club does.

826
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,960
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

827
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,800
You type in your measurements, share your likes and dislikes,

828
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,200
and your stylist will help get you set up.

829
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,280
It's not a subscription service.

830
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,840
So you won't be stuck paying for the stuff every month,

831
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,400
even when you don't need it or can't afford it.

832
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,120
You just get what you need and then you get out.

833
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,720
You get your own.

834
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,960
Like I said, shipping is always free

835
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,280
and you have 10 days to try on the clothes and send them back.

836
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,200
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and check it out.

837
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,520
Every day, my office window is right next to our mailbox outside.

838
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,840
Every day, the mailman comes and he dunks that mail in around 11 am,

839
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,200
which is the current time.

840
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,720
While he stares you dead in the eye.

841
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,360
No, and he's always fucking talking.

842
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,680
He's always on a hands-free Bluetooth earbud.

843
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,520
Like I'm not being hyperbolic.

844
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,920
Literally every day, all six days a week,

845
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,040
that he comes and he dunks that mail.

846
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,080
He's always talking.

847
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,640
It's like, who are you always talking to?

848
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,120
Are you just constantly on some sort of like CB radio

849
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,120
with the other male people?

850
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,360
You know, they actually do have this.

851
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,200
I know taxi drivers have those.

852
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,960
Like basically group chat lines,

853
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,400
usually with other people who speak their native language

854
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,840
if they're not native English speakers.

855
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,040
And they just kind of like chat all day.

856
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,000
It's kind of nice actually.

857
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,440
When I'm traveling for work though and I like call Rachel,

858
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,520
I'll talk to her for like maybe 15, maybe 20 minutes

859
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,680
about like how our days were and then bounce.

860
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,840
A fucking mail shift, it's gotta be what?

861
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,440
Like eight hours at least.

862
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,560
And you just constantly ate out.

863
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,400
What do you have to talk about for eight hours?

864
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,040
The mail's pretty-

865
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,880
Seven hours of no, you hang out.

866
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,920
No, you hang out.

867
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
The mail's pretty good today.

868
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,040
Anyway, I got a person.

869
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,480
Lots of magazines.

870
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,160
Midway, before you read the jumbotron,

871
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,720
wouldn't it be like mailman's got to take a lunch, right?

872
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:49,960
Yeah.

873
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,120
Wouldn't it be sweet if you're the next house

874
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,720
at like the one he was going to do right after his lunch?

875
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,040
You just see him sob outside and get our sandwich like,

876
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,000
ah, sorry.

877
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,680
Just sit on the lawn and enjoy sandwich and lemonade.

878
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,960
I'm just going to eat this sandwich.

879
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,760
I'm on break.

880
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,240
Our mail?

881
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,280
No, you can't have your mail.

882
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,680
Our mail?

883
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,400
I'm going to read your mail.

884
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Our mail comes at 12, 15 PM every day.

885
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,920
Always got fucking mayonnaise on it.

886
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,800
I have no idea.

887
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,840
Got some jumbotron messages here.

888
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,680
Folks, the jumbotron inbox is over full, I would say.

889
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,640
Stuff to the gills.

890
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,320
Stuff to the gills.

891
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,720
So normally we would point you here to how you get jumbotrons

892
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,600
on the show, but I think we're like full up through January?

893
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,240
Is that right?

894
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,240
Which is nuts.

895
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,840
Thank you so much for your support.

896
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,760
But we say this all the time.

897
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,800
It really will be a while before you can get a message on the show

898
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,280
now.

899
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,600
Anyway.

900
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,760
So go buy a jumbotron on Adventure Zone, or Sawbones, or Bunker

901
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,680
Buddies, or Canterbury Dog.

902
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,000
I don't know.

903
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,720
Still buffering.

904
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,680
Sawbones doesn't offer the jumbotron service, but still buffering does.

905
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,400
OK.

906
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,520
Schmanners.

907
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,360
I do the jumbotron alone on Adventure Zone.

908
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,480
I don't know if you guys ever listen back to those episodes after I edit them.

909
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,000
But it's all like almost every jumbotron is like a player writing a message to their DM,

910
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,400
or a DM writing a message to their group of players.

911
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,000
It's like almost exclusively.

912
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,800
That's pretty sick.

913
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,440
It's fucking great.

914
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,680
Yeah.

915
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,800
Anyway, OK, here we go.

916
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,640
This message is for Roger, and it's from Roger.

917
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,760
Roger, this is another option for like places to put this energy.

918
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,560
Roger says to Roger, hey Roger, it's you, Roger.

919
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,560
You're a little drunk, which is probably for the best, because this will be more fun if

920
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,680
you don't remember it.

921
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,760
I just wanted to say, hang in there, buddy.

922
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,000
You're doing your best, and you've come very far.

923
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,080
Keep on trucking, Deuterino.

924
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,760
Also, everyone needs to know how amazing your dog Pistachio is.

925
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,240
Team Stachy, remember to floss.

926
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,280
Love, drunk you.

927
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,560
I love this for a lot of reasons, but also anyone who listens to Can I Pet Your Dog will

928
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,760
know that Allegra's dog is also named Pistachio.

929
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,320
I love that there are two Pistachios in the world, and I assume maybe it's the same dog.

930
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,560
Yeah.

931
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,600
And it's got some kind of shared ownership thing that I was not aware of.

932
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:05,160
I love that this is just like really inconsequential memento, like really low stakes memento.

933
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,800
Right.

934
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,680
You've got to remember, your dog fucking rules, go Patriots.

935
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:17,480
There had to be more than a few Rodgers when this message started who were like, wait a

936
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,200
minute, did I?

937
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,760
Uh-oh.

938
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,400
Uh-oh, uh-oh, did I, hope there's nothing to be, oh, Pistachio, okay, it's not me.

939
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,680
My dog's name is Pecan.

940
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,320
Fucking great.

941
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,600
Cool.

942
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,560
I've got a message here from Daniel Ford to Christine Ford, dearest wife of nine years,

943
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,600
dearest wife of nine years, I was kindly asked to edit the first version of my anniversary

944
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,320
message to you before it was read by the Macroys.

945
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,840
It's probably for the best.

946
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Happy anniversary, hint, it mentioned Hercule Poirot.

947
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,720
I don't remember, I don't remember turning that one down, but the only thing I think

948
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,160
is that we knew we'd have a hard time saying the name Hercule Poirot.

949
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,040
And if I know one thing is that Justin hates Hercule Poirot with a passion, so we probably

950
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,320
had to cut it out just so Justin didn't get, you know, didn't boil with a white hot anger.

951
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,480
Actually, the weird thing about that is that I mentioned, I referenced Hercule Poirot

952
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,800
in the last episode.

953
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,000
That's very strange, right?

954
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,280
Maybe that's why we had to edit it, because we only got one free mention.

955
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,080
The only thing I can think-

956
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,360
We did it twice, the Agatha Christie estate would charge us for it.

957
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,240
The only thing I can think is that that first message was like, dear Macroys, please read

958
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,160
this in your Hercule Poirot voice.

959
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,400
Oh, look at my weird balls.

960
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,480
Ah, we can't, you can't make us say that.

961
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,160
You can't fucking make, I'm not some sort of circus elephant.

962
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,680
Are you troubled by lack of astute yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

963
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,520
Do you experience feelings of laughter and enjoyment when you hear three friends go off

964
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,880
on stupid tangents?

965
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,000
Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, ghost, or totally rad party

966
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,440
dude house cat who really only exists as a sound effect?

967
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,600
If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then pick up your podcast listening device

I'm pretty sure we don't have the rights to this song.

976
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,880
Do you guys want a yahoo?

977
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,800
Yeah, that'd be great actually.

978
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,520
This one's sent in by game recognized game Rachel Rosen.

979
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,000
Thank you, Rachel.

980
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,040
It's by yahoo answers user Lord Minecraft.

981
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,880
All right.

982
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,320
Who asks?

983
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,960
Sure it is.

984
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,840
God, Notch has a lot of free time now, huh?

985
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,440
Uh, if a person owns a piece of land, do they own it to the center of the earth?

986
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,440
Wow.

987
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,480
Well, can you really own land?

988
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,560
That's a good point.

989
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,680
Yes, I do.

990
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,640
Oh, okay.

991
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:01,880
Cool.

992
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,800
That's a great.

993
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,120
That's a great question, Travis.

994
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,080
Yes, absolutely.

995
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,640
You can.

996
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,000
And Justin and I do.

997
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,920
Oh, I should do that.

998
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,040
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

999
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,440
Um, yeah, you know, I got a, I got a plot and, uh, the question is if it goes down,

1000
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,640
like, do I own the earth gets smaller as you get down closer to the center of it.

1001
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,040
Right.

1002
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Like if you own like a little cone of it, like the surface area is the biggest area

1003
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,160
than the inner core.

1004
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,440
But do I own like, I don't know what it would be by the time you get down there,

1005
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,560
like maybe a half foot of the inner core of the fucking planet of that white, white,

1006
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,000
white, hot phosphorus magnet magma or whatever the fuck's down there.

1007
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,520
Do I own that shit?

1008
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,080
Is it mine?

1009
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,000
Because if not, someone could buy the earth under your house.

1010
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,680
And make a little mole house under there and have fucking parties all the time.

1011
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,240
And it's like, oh, I hate my mole neighbors.

1012
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,080
Oh, I know what, here's the thing.

1013
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,000
What about, what about the air above?

1014
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,200
Do you own a tube that extends from the center of the earth to the end of the universe?

1015
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,720
Jesus, that's like infinite.

1016
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,840
How big is your plot?

1017
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,320
Um, infinity expanding square feet.

1018
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,200
It's pretty great.

1019
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,640
It's pretty cool.

1020
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:16,680
I love it.

1021
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,880
Every time a plane flies over my house, I own it for two seconds.

1022
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,760
I own it and everyone and all the things on board.

1023
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,400
It rules.

1024
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,960
You're mine, Cloud.

1025
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,640
Cloud, you belong to me, son.

1026
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,800
You belong to me from 1111 to 1111 and 30 seconds.

1027
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,280
That's right.

1028
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,200
Big flaming idiot.

1029
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,240
You're mine.

1030
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:35,800
You're mine.

1031
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,480
Give me a, give me a tan, stupid.

1032
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,160
Set my DVR to record Ray Donovan.

1033
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,120
The sun, son.

1034
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:49,240
Son, do you, do you, uh, uh, uh, you own the, the, so you own the part of the earth

1035
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,440
that is at the inverse of that, right?

1036
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,920
Yeah, bro.

1037
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Crust mantle, the whole shit.

1038
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,960
I know, but like on the other side too, right?

1039
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,400
If you imagine as a, as a, as a, like a, uh, uh, uh, not conical.

1040
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,120
Yeah, no, a cylindrical.

1041
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:11,160
Okay, tubular, a cylindrical tubular like portion of the earth.

1042
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,240
I mean, this stands to reason because you own like the, the very surface, you own the

1043
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,520
grass, you own the dirt, you own what's below the dirt.

1044
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:27,000
So like keep playing it down and you actually own a square of land on the other side of

1045
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,720
the earth.

1046
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:27,880
Yeah.

1047
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,040
Well, actually Justin, what most people don't know is when you buy land, you're actually

1048
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,600
entering into a partnership with a person on the opposite side of the earth that owns

1049
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,240
that land.

1050
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,480
It's like, can you, can you cut your Bush's person living in Taiwan, please?

1051
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,440
You are making my tubular space of earth look bad.

1052
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,600
And someday I will come visit that other end of my tooth.

1053
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,480
Ah, beans guys.

1054
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,320
I just checked the map and, uh, fuck my shit's just like in the middle of the Indian ocean.

1055
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,080
I don't have anything over there.

1056
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,720
The Merman.

1057
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,840
And I guess I got some, a little bit of the Indian ocean.

1058
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,280
So I got whatever fish or whales or just live down there.

1059
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,320
Man, that sucks.

1060
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,920
I was hoping to at least get a little bit Australia or maybe the Southern tip of Africa

1061
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,760
or Madagascar or something fun.

1062
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,000
Everybody wants Madagascar Griffin.

1063
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,480
You know, I'm looking at the movie came out pretty much all of America is just all Indian

1064
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,280
ocean over there.

1065
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,000
So fuck that's a, that's a raw deal.

1066
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,320
It's not great.

1067
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,520
Um, do you guys want to Yahoo?

1068
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,800
Oh, we're on one already, huh?

1069
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1070
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,600
The president designated Stonewall as our first national monument to tell the story

1071
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,840
of the struggle for LGBT rights.

1072
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,480
That's good, right?

1073
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:41,880
Yes.

1074
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,520
Good stuff.

1075
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,960
That's good.

1076
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,960
And who's there to cut the ribbon on that monument?

1077
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,920
Leo Shriver.

1078
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,560
Leo Shriver.

1079
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:47,800
Wow.

1080
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,880
And he's all got, he's dressed up in full Ray Donovan cosplay.

1081
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,000
Griffin, that's just a suit.

1082
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,000
Well, he's got his toolbox with him.

1083
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,560
So he's holding the plunger.

1084
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:06,440
So I think he's carrying a broken toilet on his back, which is mostly symbolic because

1085
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,280
he doesn't really have a toilet on his back in the show, but like it always weighs them

1086
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,520
down.

1087
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,480
You know what I mean?

1088
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,440
It's like Halloween, like you're not going to recognize him unless he has it on there.

1089
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,720
Here's another question.

1090
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,800
I just love Ray Donovan so much.

1091
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,240
That's the only thing about it is how much I love Ray Donovan in the show.

1092
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,160
This is a good one.

1093
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,800
This will be fruitful discussion.

1094
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,560
My girlfriend finds it strange that I prefer to drink directly from the tap rather than

1095
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,720
take out a glass to get a drink of water.

1096
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,560
I tell her that sometimes I just want a couple of sips of water and it's easier to drink

1097
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,400
right from the tap when I want rather than taking out a glass and dirtying it with my

1098
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,040
mouth.

1099
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,120
She argues that I can leave the glass out with the water I don't drink for later, but

1100
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,000
I prefer not to have a dusty room temperature water later on.

1101
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,200
Am I the weird one for this?

1102
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,800
Thank you.

1103
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,120
That's thirsty for advice in New York City.

1104
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,520
Okay, there's two different questions.

1105
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,480
Question one, are you weird for drinking straight from the tap?

1106
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,840
Question two, are you weird for not wanting a left out glass of water for later?

1107
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,400
Answer to question two, you are not weird.

1108
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,080
The glass sits out, whatever germs and dust are in the air, get on it.

1109
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,720
And I don't care what science tells me or someone says that that's not true, I know

1110
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,960
that there are germs floating around everywhere landing on my water and I don't want to drink

1111
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,440
it later.

1112
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,000
If I drink water that's been sitting around for like a day, I know.

1113
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,840
Like, let's not pretend like, you can call science bullshit on that.

1114
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,760
I know, I can always tell.

1115
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,600
That's gross, stale water, no thanks.

1116
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,920
I would say that you're giving into a primal instinct to drink water from the tap.

1117
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,440
You want to drink running water because there's a higher likelihood that it will not be full

1118
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,080
of garbage.

1119
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:52,920
So you wanting to drink running water is actually your evolutionary instincts trying to preserve

1120
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,080
you.

1121
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,920
You know, Bear Grylls says don't drink stagnant water.

1122
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,400
You got to drink water that flows because stagnant water will be full of germs and bacteria

1123
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:01,880
and shit.

1124
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,800
And so drink it.

1125
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,000
Have you ever seen a deer drinking out of an old glass of water?

1126
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,680
No, because the deer knows better.

1127
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,960
You know what I do, if I drink, if I get a glass of water out, I'll get it out, drink

1128
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,920
the water I want.

1129
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,120
Sometimes I have half full, sometimes three quarters full.

1130
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,240
It's my water.

1131
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
And then I'll drink as much as I want.

1132
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,240
I try to drink a lot, you know, water is so important.

1133
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:27,640
And then I'll dump out what I don't drink and I'll put the glass back in the cabinet.

1134
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,440
It's just water, right?

1135
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,880
Well, what?

1136
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,520
It's just water.

1137
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,120
Well, here's the thing, right?

1138
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,680
What's on that?

1139
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,800
What is different?

1140
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,160
What has changed chemically about that?

1141
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,360
I mean, your mouth touched it.

1142
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,880
Yeah, your fucking lip touched it.

1143
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,760
Okay, my mouth touched it.

1144
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,200
My wife smooches me.

1145
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,280
So she's obviously not freaked out about that.

1146
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,640
And the other part is just water.

1147
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,480
What's the harm?

1148
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,680
That's fucking ironclad, bro.

1149
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,320
Yeah, there's no there's no.

1150
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,120
Yeah, it's rock solid.

1151
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,760
There's nothing.

1152
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,720
There's no reason.

1153
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,360
Sure.

1154
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,480
I can't help but no reason.

1155
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,720
I can't help but feel that you're maybe in your own very small way.

1156
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,160
Just moving the needle a little bit closer to purge the purge side of things with this.

1157
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,400
This is not my intent.

1158
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,200
This is not my intent.

1159
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:12,120
And I should mention if it helps to counterbalance, I always am drinking from my Ray Donovan collectible

1160
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,880
cup set that I got at Burger King.

1161
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,560
So if that helps.

1162
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,840
Those are self-sterilizing.

1163
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,640
What if people come to your home?

1164
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,040
Do you point out the ones that you've gunked up with your trash?

1165
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,440
Good question.

1166
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,280
Because I'm going to be in your house for a while this fall.

1167
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,160
And I would like to know, I would like to have some sort of roadmap.

1168
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,760
And by the way, this is the second episode in a row where I've requested information

1169
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:40,760
on how to avoid interacting with things that have been inside of your immediate family's mouth

1170
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,680
and around your mouth and around the mouth.

1171
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,760
Because, oh man, I love you guys to pieces.

1172
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,280
But I'd rather not.

1173
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,720
Sure, I get that.

1174
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,080
Touch that or have that or be, oh God, or be in or around my mouth.

1175
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,560
Before we wrap, I would like to take a moment of sincerity here.

1176
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:03,560
Because I know that if you're listening to this, you may be a little bit freaked out,

1177
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,480
maybe a little bit down, maybe a little bit whatever.

1178
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,840
And we rarely get this earnest on the show.

1179
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,280
But I feel like it's important.

1180
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,640
And because I'm not getting this message from a lot of people and I wanted to make sure

1181
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,720
that if you're listening to this show, then you're getting it from somebody.

1182
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,560
Shit's been whack before.

1183
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,960
Shit's sucked before.

1184
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,640
If you look at the grand span of history, shit sucked a lot, a lot, a lot.

1185
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,400
And then there were good days after it.

1186
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,520
If you think back in your life to moments that you've had, I bet there are moments that

1187
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:37,400
you've had in your life that have sucked a lot, lot, lot worse than whatever's happening

1188
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,520
in the world sucks right now.

1189
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,800
You have had sucky days before.

1190
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,600
And then after those days, you've had good days.

1191
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:49,560
And I want you to remember that no matter how crappy and scary and shitty and confusing

1192
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,040
things might be, things have seen that way before.

1193
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,760
They've seen that seen that way before for millennia.

1194
00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:01,240
And afterwards, we still manage to create Ray Donovan and a bevy of other points of

1195
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,560
light.

1196
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,400
I'm with you about these wonderful cycles.

1197
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,680
If if Ray Donovan gets canceled, I'll bring the whole thing down.

1198
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,640
No, no, no.

1199
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,480
Listen, if Ray Donovan gets canceled, all bets are off and you can disregard me as a

1200
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,760
madman, but we're in the end times for the moment, for the moment.

1201
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,040
And that is all you can be in when you're scared about the world and you're scared

1202
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,080
about everything going around you.

1203
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,760
Look at the moment that you're in right now, right this second, and remind yourself that

1204
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,120
that is all you have.

1205
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,280
And right now, maybe it's OK.

1206
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,120
Maybe it's not.

1207
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:36,600
I don't know.

1208
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,320
Maybe you're getting like, I don't know, like slow steamrolled over like an Austin

1209
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,240
Powers movie or something, but probably not.

1210
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,200
Probably things are all right.

1211
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,400
And you will get through this the same as you've gotten through things before and the

1212
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,120
same as we as a people have gotten through things before.

1213
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,560
Shit sucks.

1214
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,680
It won't suck forever.

1215
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,720
Even if this moment sucks, there's another moment on the way.

1216
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,120
Yeah.

1217
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:58,520
Yep.

1218
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,280
Now, just things you can do.

1219
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,040
Just get off Twitter.

1220
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:07,240
If you can't get off Twitter, don't get on Twitter and then talk about how the world

1221
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,200
is ending because that's not helping anything or anybody.

1222
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,160
And there's plenty of people already doing that.

1223
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,960
So you don't need that covered when things are bad and things aren't great.

1224
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:24,520
Being on Twitter will do absolutely no good for anybody because it's kind of a I'm not

1225
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,000
saying don't inform yourself or whatever, but like it's just an echo chamber of people

1226
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,320
all talking about how the apocalypse is coming.

1227
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,360
And that's not that's literally it's psychically damaging and it is negative helpful.

1228
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,160
So like figure out a way to be proactive.

1229
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,960
But it don't.

1230
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,120
Twitter's not that way because Twitter's the fucking Twitter's just where things don't

1231
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,560
put any stock in anything you read there.

1232
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,440
The fact that somebody says on Twitter that the everything shit in the world's falling

1233
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,240
apart probably is not true because it's on fucking Twitter.

1234
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:55,880
That's a good point.

1235
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,880
You disregard everything else on Twitter 24 hours a day.

1236
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,640
Please do not give credence to the things that scare you or the things that piss you

1237
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:03,800
off.

1238
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,840
It's Twitter.

1239
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,000
Fucking delete the app and move on with your life.

1240
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,240
But keep following us because we do have a lot of great content coming your way.

1241
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,120
Watch the tags.

1242
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,080
Watch the tags.

1243
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,800
Mind the tags.

1244
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,120
A lot of Ray Donovan based stuff.

1245
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,040
A lot of fan fiction we've been writing.

1246
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,400
Anyway, is Ray Donovan potentially like a highly super problematic show?

1247
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,000
And just like, oh, man, I hope not.

1248
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,720
Hey, listen, if it was that problematic, it wouldn't have made it three seasons.

1249
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,680
That's all I'm saying.

1250
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,080
Right.

1251
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,360
It's got to be doing something.

1252
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:34,680
Right.

1253
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,000
So I'm reading a headline here.

1254
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,040
Why is this horrible show going to its fourth season?

1255
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,880
Everybody hates it.

1256
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,520
Oh, no.

1257
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,000
Oh, God.

1258
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,720
What have we done?

1259
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,760
Ray Donovan sets back the Equal Rights Movement 30 years.

1260
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,640
Damn it, Ray Donovan.

1261
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,440
How are you?

1262
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,960
I mean, it's a powerful show.

1263
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,520
No doubt.

1264
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:53,640
No doubt.

1265
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,280
No doubt.

1266
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,800
The ability to change hearts and minds.

1267
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,640
Anyway, that's going to do it for us.

1268
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,600
Chin up, motherfuckers.

1269
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,800
My name's Justin McElroy.

1270
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,080
Oh, we're not going to do the rest of this stuff.

1271
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,880
Thanks to John Roderick.

1272
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,320
We're not going to do like the wrap ups.

1273
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,760
I'm just mentioning that my name's Justin McElroy and I want you to chin up, motherfuckers.

1274
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,240
I have been worried about your branding, Justin.

1275
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,200
Yeah, it's back.

1276
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,400
The brand is back.

1277
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,640
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the server theme song.

1278
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,960
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1279
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,680
It's an amazing song and we love it so much.

1280
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,240
And thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters.

1281
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,440
We want to say thank you to MaximumFun.org for hosting the show.

1282
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,920
Go check out all the other amazing shows on there.

1283
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,800
We got a bunch of new ones and lots of good ones that have been around for a while that

1284
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,200
maybe you've been waiting for your opportunity to check out.

1285
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,080
This is it.

1286
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,800
Go check it out.

1287
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,920
Treat yourself this week.

1288
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,120
Find some way to do something nice for yourself.

1289
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,360
Go get a cheap massage or something.

1290
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,320
And you know what?

1291
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,920
Do something nice for someone else.

1292
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,160
Yeah.

1293
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
And it's not a distraction, it's not an avoidance.

1294
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,280
You only have the moment.

1295
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,240
Make your moments good.

1296
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,920
You can't, you probably can't get, you probably can't

1297
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,040
calk up whatever cracks have formed or whatever.

1298
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,520
Like you can do your part, but just like don't, you know, don't obsess over it.

1299
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,920
Just go out there and get rubbed on for an hour or so.

1300
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,880
And you know what?

1301
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,080
If you find yourself like drawn and you want to put something on Twitter,

1302
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,800
maybe rather than putting more negativity out there in the world, pick somebody that you like,

1303
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,440
somebody you're a fan of or someone you're a friend of and say like,

1304
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,880
hey, I think you're great.

1305
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,200
Yeah.

1306
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,240
Something as simple as that.

1307
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,040
Let's put a little bit more positivity out there in the world

1308
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,880
because that's what we need more of really.

1309
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,840
And in my opinion, positivity breeds positivity.

1310
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,960
And you go out there and you say something nice to someone and you make their day.

1311
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,000
And maybe that's all the power you have is to make one person's day.

1312
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:39,240
Like.

1313
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,720
But that's better than ruining 10 people's day.

1314
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,480
Like Ray Donovan says, this HVAC unit isn't going to repair itself.

1315
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,760
Exactly.

1316
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,840
Uh, uh, let's, uh, have a, uh, final.

1317
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,360
Oh, Max Funconese.

1318
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:52,840
Super quick.

1319
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,240
Oh yeah.

1320
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:53,480
We'll be there.

1321
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,560
It's in September, the weekend before Labor Day.

1322
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,280
Go to maxfuncon.com, I believe.

1323
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,680
And you can, uh, get tickets to that.

1324
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,400
It's going to be really fun.

1325
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,000
And we hope that we, uh, can see you there.

1326
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,840
Oh, and our Boston shows are coming up.

1327
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,760
Start sending in your questions for that now.

1328
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,840
Put a Boston live show in the subject.

1329
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,160
Please.

1330
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,680
So we can have those ready for you.

1331
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,080
One definitely super last thing.

1332
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,280
I mean, at this time, uh, I opened up a PO box here in Austin.

1333
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,400
Justin and Travis have one and I want to have one.

1334
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:25,640
Uh, uh, so if you want to send, send us stuff, me or Rachel stuff for maybe a Rose Buddies fan.

1335
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,120
Uh, that's our bachelor, bachelorette podcast.

1336
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,640
You can send stuff to Austin.

1337
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:35,960
Uh, just send it to PO box 66639 Austin, Texas 78766.

1338
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:42,280
Again, that's PO box 66639 Austin, Texas 78766.

1339
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,080
Uh, we'll get that put up on macro shows.com so you guys can find it easy.

1340
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,560
You know what?

1341
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,360
Just to like blow through, just to take cheer base day up a little bit.

1342
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,800
I know we're running long, but whatever.

1343
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,760
Uh, we got some mail.

1344
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,480
I'm just going to blast through real quick to tell you guys that there's good stuff

1345
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:55,800
happening.

1346
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,840
Good people out there.

1347
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,320
Uh, Chris is a member of the little Debbie family.

1348
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:04,680
The family that runs little Debbie and send us a box, like a giant ass box of little Debbie

1349
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,920
snack treats because we talked about them on the adventure zone.

1350
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,080
Okay.

1351
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,920
Cool cool stuff.

1352
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,560
Cool cool stuff.

1353
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,480
So when you said us, you meant you, cause I'm never, I'm not going to taste those little

1354
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:13,720
Debbie.

1355
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,880
So actually what you just did is you purged me a bit and you took some joy out of my life

1356
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,520
knowing that a little bit.

1357
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:24,360
Alexandra and William are getting married, uh, and, uh, later this year and they told

1358
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,160
us to save the date.

1359
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:32,040
Uh, had a, uh, Amy Kittle graduated from, uh, high school at East Hamilton.

1360
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,160
We're super proud of her.

1361
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,640
She wanted us to know Alex and Aaron are getting married later this year in Washington DC.

1362
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:37,960
Hell yeah.

1363
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,560
That's going to be fucking great.

1364
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:46,040
Uh, Timothy and Mariah sent us, uh, a postcard with a beautiful picture of horses on it.

1365
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,760
Uh, we got Maria and Nick sent us a postcard that congratulates on 300 episodes.

1366
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,160
It's got a really cool raccoon on it.

1367
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:53,640
Hell yeah.

1368
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,160
Just grand.

1369
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,480
Love it.

1370
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,720
Travis sent me some tax, uh, some receipts.

1371
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,040
That's not useful, but you know, stuff's happening out there.

1372
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,720
People, it's good stuff.

1373
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,360
People have also sent me stuff, but I didn't know we were going to do this.

1374
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,040
So I don't like have a here.

1375
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,160
Learning, loving.

1376
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:09,400
Yeah.

1377
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,840
Um, you don't want to send me stuff too, but that's the reality.

1378
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,920
Enjoy your day.

1379
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,960
Enjoy your moments.

1380
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,480
Enjoy each other very much.

1381
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:17,720
Yeah.

1382
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,920
And, uh, there's lots of great, um, my brother, my brother McGeer at topotico.com.

1383
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,320
Shut up.

1384
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,240
This final one was sent in by Dana S.

1385
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,040
Thank you, Dana.

1386
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,240
It's from Yahoo answers user Xylon who asks.

1387
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,720
Why doesn't the grand Canyon have rides?
