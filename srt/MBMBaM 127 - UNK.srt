1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,680
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era. We have a

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,680
very serious message to begin this week's show. On November 6th, you have what is perhaps your

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:09,040
most important responsibility as a citizen. On November 6th, if you use standard two-day

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,480
shipping on Amazon, that's the day you're going to need to order your birthday presents for Travis

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,800
and I to get here by November 8th on our birthday. Because, I kid you not, anything that arrives on

10
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,080
November 9th or later goes right in the trash. Just throw it away. You might as well get them

11
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,880
kindling, because that's all that it's going to turn into. If you send me a Kindle, I will burn it.

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
Try to get that Kindle in by the 8th. Try to get that one in under the wire.

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,440
If the Kindle's in on the 9th, it's kindling. Otherwise, just send them a bunch of rolled up

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,880
phonebook pages. Something to fuel the flame. Justin McElroy, P.O. Box, 54, Huntington,

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:03,360
West Virginia, 25706. You got to get those gifts in early, folks. I want to go to the post office,

16
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,320
and when I go to retrieve my mail, I want it to be like, ugh, this guy.

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,840
Oh, and like the old time, they pull out a bag of fan mail, you know, and just slap it down on the

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,360
counter. Big Miracle on 34th Street style sacks of mail of people who believe in me.

19
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,280
I believe in Justin. I actually don't send, like, postcards. I have no use for that. That has no

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,920
resale value. How are you going to get these gifts that are sent to our Huntington-based mailboxer,

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,640
Travis, who also shares your birthday? Well, I'll get them to him on the holiday.

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, you'll get them on the Christmas tip. Get them on the Christmas tip. Maybe a little

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
re-gifto. I will try to restrain myself from burning them.

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,520
Man, I wish my birthday was the same year as your guys.

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,560
That would be sweet, if it was like a my brother, my brother, me birthday

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,480
spectacular. I mean, it basically is. Haven't we talked about legally changing that before?

27
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
You've got to be able to, like, legally change your birthday, right?

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,720
Yeah, I mean, legally, you can get in a time machine, and then when my parents were about

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
to bone down on... Hold up, hold up, hold up.

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
Let me do the math real quick. July? It would have been, like, July 17th, right?

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Then I would kick in the door and be like, can you guys please chill on this, please,

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,320
for seven months? Can you chill on this for seven months? Pick whatever day you fuck to

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,920
make Justin and Travis... Keep the fire alive.

34
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Keep the fire alive till then. It's February. It's like around...

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,960
I don't want to think about this. It's Valentine's Day.

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,960
It's Valentine's Day. I don't want to think about this.

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,320
I'm just saying there's a very special basket involved.

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,280
Like anything else, I want to think about anything else. Let's talk about...

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,800
It's important, though. Hey, you guys, it is important. Get out there. Get out to vote.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,360
Rock the vote. Get out to vote. And when you're out there,

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
vote for Obama. It doesn't matter who you vote for,

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,200
as long as you vote for Obama. You've got to vote for Obama.

43
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,800
The other guy is just the worst. He's just the pits.

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,080
That guy seems kind of like the pits. How do you not get this by now?

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Watch a TV. Anything.

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
Anything. I don't want to get political here,

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,880
but it seems like you should probably vote for Obama.

48
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,680
The line is clearly drawn in the sand. One is the good guy,

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,320
and the other guy is the fucking smoke monster from Lost.

50
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,680
Like, you know the score. You know the score.

51
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,240
I saw a video on the internet of Romney supporters at an Ohio rally,

52
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,080
and every one of them was lighting garbage cans of trash on fire

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,400
and then dumping it on kids. That's every person.

54
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,160
Straight talk. Heard this come up on the local radio station.

55
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
Mitt Romney coming to, I think it was Columbus,

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,200
and performing with him on stage, Marshall Tucker Band.

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,720
Then Obama coming to Cleveland, performing with him,

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,640
Jay-Z and Bruce Springsteen. How you got to fucking vote for Romney?

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,200
Pretty good. Did you guys see the clip where

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Mitt Romney was, he didn't know he was being filmed, and he was at the beach,

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
and he unbuttoned his shirt, and then in his stomach,

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
there was a little glass window. There's a little glass cage

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
with a talking brain in it, and Mitt Romney is crying.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,960
As it turns out, Mitt Romney is crying. Did you guys know that Mitt Romney,

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,200
did you see the clip? It was Huffington Post.

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,840
It was the front page, just in big red letters. It said,

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,320
Crang? With a question mark, and then there's a picture

68
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
of Mitt Romney's windowed torso.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
Listen, that's just the liberal media, you know,

70
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
trying to sell him as a robot body with a brain in his tummy.

71
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
Yeah. No, he does have that,

72
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,760
but he insists he's not crying. He'll own up to the fact that

73
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,640
there is a brain inside his stomach. Everyone with a brain inside their

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,520
stomach isn't Crang. That's kind of bigoted for you to say.

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm actually surprised to hear you say that.

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Travis, is it just abysmal for you right now,

77
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
trying to watch TV, trying to get your TV on?

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,600
Do you mean because I have to deal with the fact that there are current events

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
going on around me at all times? Well, no, because you're in a swing-

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
You're in the swingin' estate.

81
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
The swingin' estate, yeah.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,040
It is bad. Here's the only thing that makes it better.

83
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,680
The only thing that makes it great is listening to the ads where they've

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,840
tried to capture real people who are like, you know, as a mother.

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,680
But even better, they'll try to act like they just plopped a microphone down

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
in the middle of the kitchen table, and you're just over here being like,

87
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,280
yeah, I don't know about this Romney guy saying he's gonna cut spending for kids

88
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,720
and stuff. I mean, I guess as a mom, I hate that.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,640
There's literally one where it's like, well, let me look it up real quick.

90
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,440
And you hear her typing on the keyboard and saying like,

91
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,400
Mitt Romney, federal spending for education.

92
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh, oh, no.

93
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,920
This is hardly ideal.

94
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,240
I don't like this at all as a mother. Well, let me-

95
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,200
Hold on. Obama financial aid.

96
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,120
Click, click, click, click. For students.

97
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
Oh yeah, I like this. Oh, a video clip.

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
And then you play it and you hear Obama talk.

99
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,560
It's like the best because someone out there is listening to it going,

100
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
how did they get this audio?

101
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
How did they make a radio of internet?

102
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,520
That's why not just say, go to our internet and it's going to be,

103
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,040
you're going to have all your questions answered.

104
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,880
Travis, do you feel a sense of superiority over Justin and I,

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,320
because your vote is technically worth two of Justin's votes and roughly 18 of my votes?

106
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,600
Yes, indeed. I do.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
I want you guys to know this.

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
It's like you have like dodeca suffrage.

109
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
Like it's so much, so much doper than mine.

110
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
So much liberty. Griffin, which way is Texas going?

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
No, no, no. Texas, are you kidding?

112
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
This place is the hotbed.

113
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,040
Texas can't make up its mind not only between Dems and Repubs,

114
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,400
they want the Greens.

115
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
They want the, they want the Libbers.

116
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
Are they going to go for Gary Johnson?

117
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,600
Everyone. They don't know who to vote for.

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't like that. It would be so great if the entire country, 49 states,

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,880
you know, are split between Romney and Obama,

120
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,840
and Texas just is 100% every single vote for Gary Johnson.

121
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,920
Yeah, why not? It could happen.

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,360
Keep Texas weird, because all of Texas is like Austin, right?

123
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Please, right?

124
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
Let's get to the questions.

125
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm ready to help people.

126
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,640
I'm in like a helpful mood now.

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,240
I told people how to vote.

128
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
Now I want to tell them how to live.

129
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
We didn't actually tell them how to vote.

130
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,320
We just said, go do that thing.

131
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,480
I hate to tell you guys this, but if you're not regged yet,

132
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,880
you're probably in a big old heap of trouble.

133
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,120
Just lie to your friends and say that you did do it,

134
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,280
because that's probably what 80% of the youth of our nation are going to do.

135
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,680
I spend a lot of time working out of a coffee shop.

136
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,480
I'll go there, work for several hours, often getting at least one refill.

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,000
I tip well in the first cup and then normally end up paying exact change

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
or something close to that for the refills.

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
Is this an okay thing to do or should I be tipping every time,

140
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
especially considering how much time I spend there?

141
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,280
That's from Confused in Oh God,

142
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,600
the barista is right behind me reading over my shoulder.

143
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
Oh, man.

144
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I have such good insight on this.

145
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,240
Yeah, because Travis has been royally screwed by people.

146
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,680
I think the fact that you're tipping at all makes you saint-like.

147
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah, you're way above.

148
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,400
This is the deciding factor on this question.

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,160
When you say coffee shop, do you mean like a Starbucks?

150
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,960
Or do you mean like your local tiny eight table coffee shop

151
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,360
on like the second floor of a building?

152
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,800
Because the difference is at a Starbucks,

153
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,960
you're not stealing real estate from someone.

154
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,240
If this is like a restaurant coffee shop where they do food all day

155
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
and this is the only thing they do

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,360
and you're taking up a whole table to yourself while you work

157
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
on your spreadsheets or whatever,

158
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
then you're taking business away from the coffee shop.

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,400
You should be tipping every time.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
There's a cafe like that and a Starbucks like that

161
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,360
like a block and a half from my house.

162
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
I like to get out of the house because I work from home,

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,160
but I can't spend more than like a half hour there before I feel like

164
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,520
this is not my beautiful house, you know?

165
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,840
It's people wheezing the Wi-Fi.

166
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,520
It's people that use the internet and they don't have internet at home,

167
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,760
but they need it for like school or they need it for work

168
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,320
and they go and use the Wi-Fi and then tip a buck and think that that's fair.

169
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,840
I come here, I go to those places whenever my Wi-Fi does crap out,

170
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,720
which I have Grande here in Austin,

171
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
which goes out every time a bird flies over my house.

172
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,520
So, it's quite frequent, but I still, even under those pretenses,

173
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,480
it's like I feel like I am just crashing out of Bud's,

174
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,800
only I don't know my bud very well,

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,800
and my bud didn't really give me permission to come over.

176
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
I just sort of showed up on my bud's doorstep.

177
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
I actually just showed up inside his living room,

178
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
didn't knock or anything, walked right into my bud's place,

179
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,920
and kicked up my feet and wheezed his Wi-Fi juice.

180
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
I don't tip at coffee.

181
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,520
Do you really?

182
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,000
Excuse me?

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
Ooh, Justin.

184
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,760
What?

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,280
You're walking a fine fucking line.

186
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,200
Well, you know, I use my credit card for everything.

187
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,600
If there is a blank on a credit card receipt for tip,

188
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
I don't care what service you've just performed.

189
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,080
I don't care what you did, amputations, car repair, whatever.

190
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,320
If there's a tip slot, I will put a tip in there.

191
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
I don't think Starbucks isn't doing that yet.

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
I always feel like at Starbucks or any coffee place,

193
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,680
like the tip jar is like a, it seems like so unorthodox,

194
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,560
like they're sneaking it up until the manager gets back

195
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
and then they're going to hide it again.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,840
I don't like that clandestine tipping.

197
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
But this is the thing.

198
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,360
This is why if you're at Starbucks, fuck it.

199
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
Whatever you want, get yourself a small coffee

200
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
and then sit there for eight hours.

201
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
Fucking go outside and pick up the trash can

202
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
and throw it through the window

203
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,640
and then fucking throw it to the ground.

204
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,000
But I worked in a small coffee shop here in Cincinnati

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,320
and there were only about 12 tables.

206
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,560
We'd have someone come and order a coffee

207
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
and literally sit there for eight hours.

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,920
They'd be there my entire shift.

209
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,200
And then duder like felt completely comfortable

210
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,280
when I walk over and like, hey, can I get you something else?

211
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,240
Giving me the cold shoulder and acting like I was bothering him.

212
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,400
Like that always bothered me.

213
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,680
Like, dude, you realize that like I make my money on tips.

214
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,360
So ground rule, just don't be a cock about it.

215
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,600
Like if you're going to chill at your bud's place

216
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,720
that you don't know very well,

217
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
you wouldn't like when he showed up and be like,

218
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
hey man, I've got to get to work.

219
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,480
Be like, like, can you move your car?

220
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
Oh, fuck.

221
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,320
And also don't fucking sit at the eight-seater by yourself

222
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
with your laptop and your single cup of coffee.

223
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
Pick the smallest table in the restaurant and sit at it.

224
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,800
Stay out of everyone's way

225
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,960
and don't like kick off your shoes and get real comfortable

226
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,640
because I've seen that and it's awful.

227
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,200
We need to do, we need to release a new like Emily Wall Post

228
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,520
or how to make friends and influence people.

229
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,080
Only it's like, if you are going to be a dick,

230
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,880
like how to just at least minimize the impact on your community.

231
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
How to be the least amount of dick

232
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
while still acknowledging that you are in fact going to be a dick.

233
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Anytime you go into any place of business,

234
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
even when you're giving him your money,

235
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,080
you are inconveniencing him.

236
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,760
You are in an imposition.

237
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,080
Yeah.

238
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,760
Because what you have created,

239
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
and this is capitalism really,

240
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
is that if you go into a place,

241
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,400
the owner of it is never going to be there ever

242
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
because it's 2012.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,720
So what you are doing is basically creating a situation

244
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,760
where you are helping a third party

245
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
who is not involved in the transaction.

246
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,680
They're the only one who's happy about the transaction going on.

247
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,920
So you're inconveniencing the person

248
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
who you're directly interacting with

249
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,640
because they do not,

250
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,960
I mean, they may in some sort of trickle down sense

251
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,760
benefit from the transaction, but not really.

252
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,640
That chain is far, far too long to see the top link of.

253
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,160
Yeah, you can't get there.

254
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,280
You do not see where the juice is being poured

255
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,880
so that it may trickle down to you.

256
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,200
And this is why the only two things

257
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,680
that show that directly to the person you're dealing with

258
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,960
are tips and commissions.

259
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
The best thing you can do-

260
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,200
That's the direct way that you tip a dollar

261
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,480
every time you get a refill.

262
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
Just think of it like a bar.

263
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
Every time you get a drink, that's a dollar, right?

264
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,400
And so if you get three refills,

265
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,720
the person had to make three trips for you,

266
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,160
that's $3 tip.

267
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't care if your coffee only costs $3.

268
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
If you throw that person 50 cents on your $3 bill,

269
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
you're an asshole.

270
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
And hey, if you do a big tip on your first tip,

271
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,400
just split the tip.

272
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,720
Normally, that's a bad idea, but in this case, it's okay.

273
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,840
What if you, can we do like, give them 50?

274
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560
Like give them a 50 at the top of the month

275
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
and then just sort of post on it.

276
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, I tell you what,

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,280
when I worked in a hotel running room service to people,

278
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,800
I brought this dude like,

279
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I think it was like two glasses of orange juice

280
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,480
in the morning for him and his lady

281
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,800
and dude tipped me like 40 bucks.

282
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
Oh, and did you go in and-

283
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
I gave him a little love.

284
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,120
And then the rest, but then the rest of the day,

285
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,440
like he called down, I'm like, yeah, what you need?

286
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,480
You got it.

287
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,560
You want all the salt packets we have?

288
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,600
You've got it.

289
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
Guys, I just came up with an idea.

290
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,440
You go to this coffee shop a lot, right?

291
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,040
So let's say you're going in there,

292
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,280
you're going in there 20 times a month,

293
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
you're getting two drinks every time,

294
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
40 drinks a month, right?

295
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,440
Go in there at the top of the next month

296
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,320
and lay a $50 tip on the bar.

297
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,760
Like we're talking with those tips

298
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
that they're gonna write into Reader's Digest

299
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,240
and tell about that time they got this enormous tip

300
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
when they really needed it.

301
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
Like you're gonna seem like

302
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,640
some sort of weird eccentric benefactor, right?

303
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,760
And then make sure everybody in the coffee shop

304
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,880
sees your face.

305
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
This is essential.

306
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
If you can get them to take a picture with you

307
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,560
or something and then never tip again,

308
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,080
that strategy is gonna pay for itself

309
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
in a month and a half.

310
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,680
Is it because in three years

311
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
when you're still going to that coffee shop-

312
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,120
They've had eight different turnovers

313
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,160
with like 20 different people.

314
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,880
Don't you know me?

315
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,960
I'm 50 Buck Billy.

316
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
You know me.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
Hey, don't you know me?

318
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm the guy everybody talks about.

319
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,320
Remember, they wrote a Christian song about me.

320
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,680
Like 50 Buck Billy,

321
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,880
you have drank literally 5,000 cups of coffee.

322
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,840
We are at this point talking about a 10 cent tip.

323
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,120
You are a joke.

324
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,960
You are a joke to me.

325
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

326
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,920
Just give me a free coffee.

327
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,360
I can't tip you right now.

328
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,080
Was our math good?

330
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,280
Nope, it's one cent tip.

331
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,520
Yeah, Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

332
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,240
That's what I need.

333
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
I'm feeling embarrassed for doing a bad math.

334
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,120
Your math was real close.

335
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,720
It was all for one decimal place.

336
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,480
Everybody does a bad math sometimes.

337
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,240
How about this?

338
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,360
Oh, this is Jermaine.

339
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,160
Thanks.

340
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,280
This one was sent in by Jermaine.

341
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,560
This one was sent in by Mitch Reeder.

342
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,120
Thanks, Mitch.

343
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,920
It's by Yahoo!

344
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,680
It's user Tristan who asks,

345
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,760
I get a boner when I drink coffee.

346
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,080
I'm sorry.

347
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,880
One more time.

348
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,040
I get a boner when I drink coffee.

349
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,440
Left the N out of drink and also coffee with one E.

350
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
So I am almost 14.

351
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,800
And to help me wake up each morning,

352
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,240
my mother does one half cup coffee plus one half really hot water

353
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,600
plus one packet hot chocolate mix plus whipped cream.

354
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,120
That sounds good.

355
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,760
By the time I sip it down to half a cup,

356
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,120
it is cool enough to guzzle.

357
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,520
So I do while it is actually warm.

358
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,840
The problem is when I guzzle it, I get a boner.

359
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,680
And when I do, I get really horny.

360
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
And this morning, I actually got horny.

361
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
And then it turned.

362
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
Then noticed my hard on.

363
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
I am wondering what is causing this.

364
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
I will pick a best answer.

365
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,920
I will pick a best answer.

366
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,440
Pardon.

367
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,520
You're 14.

368
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,480
You should be more perplexed that the first half of the coffee

369
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
doesn't give you a boner.

370
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Yeah, you know, it's a better question to say.

371
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,440
What kind of hard lifestyle is this kid living that he's having trouble waking up in the morning

372
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,000
at 14?

373
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,200
Oh, mom's got to have my morning.

374
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,960
I had a late night working a graveyard shift.

375
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,440
Who knows?

376
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,520
But I think a better question is why hasn't this woman

377
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,640
been marketed this boner potion that she has alchemically discovered?

378
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,480
This is Jackie's Boner Brew.

379
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,080
It's locally made here in the Wisconsin area.

380
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,640
And actually, a local woman discovered this when she noticed that her 14-year-old son

381
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,520
was sailing at half mast after he drank down the second half.

382
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,280
Gosh, you got to guzzle it.

383
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,240
You got to guzzle it.

384
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,880
That's the trick.

385
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
It's the timing things.

386
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,080
If you guzzle the first half and then sip the second, you'll never have a boner again ever.

387
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,800
You know his mom's going to get suspicious when he's like,

388
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,040
yeah, thank you for making this mom.

389
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm just going to let the whole cup cool off.

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,080
I really am going to just slam this down.

391
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
Could I have eight cups of it, please?

392
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
And no questions asked.

393
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,280
Man, if guzzling really gives this kid a chub,

394
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
he is in for a hard collegiate life.

395
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
There's a lot of that man.

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
Slam that beer.

397
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,080
No, I'd rather not.

398
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,960
I'd rather not.

399
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
Come on, let's make a waterfall.

400
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,520
You seriously don't want to watch this?

401
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,160
You wouldn't like me when I was guzzling.

402
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
I need a place to hang my coat.

403
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
Kyle, do a keg stand.

404
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,680
It's also possible that it is the combination of the caffeine and the sugar

405
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,680
that this kid is consuming that's making his heart just fucking race.

406
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,800
It's just like, oh, boner.

407
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,000
So if you gave this to anyone older than 14, they'd instantly die.

408
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,240
There's a reason for this.

409
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,160
The caffeine opens up your capillaries, right?

410
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,920
And gets the blood flowing and lets it flow downtown.

411
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,240
I think it's the scientifically speaking.

412
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,800
Those are all scientific words you used.

413
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,280
In your downtown area.

414
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
Yeah, your dorsal downtown.

415
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
Here's the ish.

416
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,680
Do we know if this kid is butt chugging?

417
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,640
Sorry?

418
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,040
Is that not in the additional details?

419
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,600
Let me see.

420
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,040
No, it doesn't say anything about gaping.

421
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
Is there any answers to this?

422
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
Is there any wisdom that will-

423
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,800
Someone says, you're 13.

424
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,960
Almost anything will give you a boner.

425
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,760
Good point.

426
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,360
If it is continues for a couple of years, then you ask for answers.

427
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,240
As for now, enjoy it while you have it.

428
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,080
That's such a fucking weird thing to say to a teenager.

429
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
You've got boners?

430
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,880
Don't miss out.

431
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
Solid, solid.

432
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,720
From the ages of 12 to 17.

433
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,360
When I got a boner, it was not a thing to be enjoyed.

434
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,040
It was a thing to like, well, fucking now this is on my plate.

435
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,520
Now.

436
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,240
That's the thing.

437
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
In that age range, you never get a boner and go, yeah, finally.

438
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
Yeah, I finally get it up.

439
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,840
Like, no.

440
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,560
You pray for the brief moments when you do not have a boner.

441
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Oh, if only, if only I could have a brief respite.

442
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,560
Yeah.

443
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,840
You just pray the teacher doesn't call.

444
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,920
Rigamortis has set in.

445
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,960
Oh, if only God would release me from this curse.

446
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,640
I, I, I, I'm super creeped out by the enjoy it.

447
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,120
Like, what do you mean enjoy it?

448
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
Like, how do you want me to enjoy my boner?

449
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,120
Oh, you gotta sketch it.

450
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,360
You gotta go home and sketch that for the last.

451
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,560
It's so beautiful.

452
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,840
I must draw it.

453
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,880
Go get Greg Kinnear from as good as it gets to come by and sketch your boner as you sit

454
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,280
bathside.

455
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,400
Is this fucking guy saying, like, because in 50 years, your dick's gonna be soft like

456
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,760
a bowl full of jelly?

457
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,160
Like, what?

458
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,880
You get out there.

459
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
You just have all the sex you can now.

460
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,600
Don't worry about consequences or repercussions.

461
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,960
13.

462
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,200
How loose is Yahoo Answers, like, comment policy that somebody's not like, oh, there's

463
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
a, there's a pedophile.

464
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,200
Let's get him.

465
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,040
Better question.

466
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,200
Just jump back real quick to the question itself.

467
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,800
The kid saying that he noticed he had a boner after he was horny.

468
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,960
I would love to be there for that slew thing.

469
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,120
What is this?

470
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,560
What is this feeling?

471
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,960
I am feeling mentally aroused.

472
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,840
Now, if I see just so I'm clear, why did you want to be present inside his head?

473
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,880
I don't want to be there.

474
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
I don't want to be there for the event itself.

475
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,920
Travis, I'm going to call the Yahoo Cops on you.

476
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,000
You mean you want to being John Malkovich him so you can see through his eyes as he

477
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
is deducing this problem.

478
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,240
Yes.

479
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,800
What would happen if Starbucks started carrying this, this boner brew?

480
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,120
Well, people would stay there for hours and hours and hours.

481
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,120
Listen, the tip situation would definitely be improved.

482
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,800
And I, that was a double entendre.

483
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,120
Just enjoy your boners, everyone, while you still can.

484
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,960
The love of God.

485
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
When the rapture comes, all of our boners will be taken away.

486
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,400
That's November 6th.

487
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,920
Enjoy your boners, guys.

488
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,480
That's what carpe diem literally translates to.

489
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,200
Seize your dick.

490
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,920
Gather ye boners while you may.

491
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm a recent college grad.

492
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,840
I've been working a robot automation technology company for the past four months.

493
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000
My boss's boss is a female.

494
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,960
She usually wears business casual clothes.

495
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,400
Today, she wore a skirt and boots and vaguely reassembled a cowgirl.

496
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,960
I wanted to say, you look nice today, or I like your outfit.

497
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,480
I didn't say anything because I don't want to look like a suck up.

498
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,160
And I thought it might come off as creepy.

499
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,160
My desk is close to her office, but we typically don't interact throughout the day.

500
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,720
Usually, we only say hello when passing each other in the hall.

501
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
Did I make a good choice by not saying anything?

502
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,720
And should I keep my mouth shut, or is it okay to compliment a woman at work,

503
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,520
whether she is my superior or not?

504
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,480
And that's from Dan.

505
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Well, the Lilly Ledbetter Act stipulates that you are not under any circumstances

506
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,680
allowed to talk to any female ever at work.

507
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,280
I think.

508
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,960
Yes, that is the law.

509
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,640
You can tell one female to pass along to another female that you like her boots.

510
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,760
Well, actually, you have to go through HR.

511
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,280
You have to file a formal compliment request.

512
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,000
You can formally compliment someone in your workplace.

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,120
Precisely.

514
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,360
But it has to sit in a folder for six months, and then it can be delivered,

515
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
by which point your hair looks great today means nothing.

516
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,040
What the fuck are you talking about?

517
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm wearing sandals.

518
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,200
What are you talking about?

519
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,880
I quit this job three months ago.

520
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
Now, here's another point that we should consider.

521
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,760
When you said HR, I thought you said a jar.

522
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
I thought you said a jar, too.

523
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,920
You put it in the compliment jar.

524
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,640
You float it downstream, and then it buries itself in the mud till the winter thaw.

525
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,560
At the end of the month, someone from the human resources department comes together,

526
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,000
opens up the jar, everyone sits around in a circle, and he reads off nice things.

527
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
That actually sounds incredible.

528
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
Well, but the trick is you can't put any names on it.

529
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
So it's just like someone's hair looked really nice this month.

530
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
Yeah, but it would be pretty obvious, you know?

531
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,760
Somebody's mole is clearing up really nicely, and it'd be like, oh, well, that's Janet.

532
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,800
Could you guys, I mean, is that, I really don't know what's okay for men and women anymore.

533
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,880
I don't think, I don't, I would like to think that I like your outfit, or those are some

534
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
killer boots, as long as you enunciated.

535
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Well, you're not like, you're not like her friend on Sex and the City or something.

536
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,120
You're not like, ooh, work it.

537
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,760
Yeah, but I mean.

538
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,320
Girlfriend.

539
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,160
But I also like to think that there's certain dates, like, I would never walk in wearing

540
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,120
a new sweater and someone would be like, oh, it's a great sweater, and think, well, that

541
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
is sexual harassment.

542
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,880
No.

543
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,040
Yes, but the question is, just put the compliment through this filter.

544
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,640
If it's the same, if you would make the same compliment to a man as you would to your boss,

545
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
I don't think the superior thing plays into it.

546
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,800
Oh, it definitely does.

547
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,040
I think it's like, oh, does it?

548
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,240
Okay, well, we'll have to talk about that.

549
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,560
But I think that if it's, if you would feel comfortable giving the same compliment to

550
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,080
a dude, then you're totally, then you're totally fine.

551
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,680
I think compliments are great.

552
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Now, here's the question you risk.

553
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,160
There are two parties involved in this, right?

554
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,960
It's not just intent is only half the battle.

555
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,440
It's also knowing this person well enough to know how your compliment is going to be

556
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,320
absorbed.

557
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,880
That's the thing.

558
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,400
Now, this is a fair point, because there's a good chance that while it may not bother

559
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,560
you or, but like, oh, it's so tricky too, because here's the thing, Dan.

560
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,040
If there is even a moment's hesitation in your brain before you say it, it's not going

561
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,880
to come out smoothly and pleasantly.

562
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,560
No, that's the problem, right?

563
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,480
Hey, booting it up.

564
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,760
Them shoes, they're so good.

565
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,560
I'm going to last you like a heifer.

566
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,760
Hey, cowgirl, ride on them fashions.

567
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,440
What is it like on legs?

568
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
I'll just see myself out.

569
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,080
If I could borrow a box to collect my things from my desk.

570
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,560
If you do not know this boss, I would not make the first thing you say to them a compliment,

571
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,320
because if you were on the street and you saw a stranger and you're like, hey, I like

572
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,800
your outfit.

573
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
You kind of look like a cowgirl.

574
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,240
The very first thing that's going to run through their mind is like, oh, this person's

575
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,280
trying to stick.

576
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,880
This guy's trying to stick is what it's going to be.

577
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
And that is going to create some intensity on my friend.

578
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,120
What if you balance it with like a veiled insult followed by a compliment?

579
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
Like, usually you look bad, but today you look great.

580
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,520
You throw down a neg, like a pick up.

581
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,400
Just to balance it out.

582
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,360
And then you leave.

583
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,240
You don't wait for a response.

584
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
You leave.

585
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,280
And so she sits there going, I, I don't, I just don't know how I feel.

586
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,600
I need to promote, I need to promote this man.

587
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay.

588
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
And then you put on a big, silly, you put on a big, silly hat and you maybe shave your,

589
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,480
your beard into like the creepiest facial hair imaginable.

590
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,040
Go on.

591
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,720
Then you, maybe you wear a big pendant.

592
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,360
Maybe you wear some.

593
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,680
And you're, you're the unpredictable guy in the office.

594
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,040
Mystery.

595
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,720
The unpredictable guy, the pick up artist.

596
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,520
I, now Griffin, you think, I, I think that this is, I think we have stumbled on the proper

597
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,080
answer here.

598
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,000
If you have a relationship with someone in any, no matter how casual it may be, if you

599
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,880
have a relationship to where you would feel comfortable saying that, then I think it's

600
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,200
fine.

601
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,840
The fact that you thought, hmm, maybe I shouldn't compliment her and maybe I should write into

602
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,400
that advice show and see what they think.

603
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,360
I think that's your, that's smart Dan telling you that, hey Dan, maybe just get back to

604
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,840
filing.

605
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,480
Maybe get back to programming Skynet.

606
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,640
Across the board, this is a good rule of thumb that like, if you're out in the world and

607
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,360
you want to compliment that cute girl across the way in the shop and you hesitate and your

608
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,560
brain goes, oh, I don't know.

609
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,920
Your brain is as smart, if not smarter than you are at any given point, you should listen

610
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,400
to him or her and not do this thing.

611
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,800
That's a problem with social interaction though.

612
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,920
Like this is the problem that I get into is I think I'd like to pay that person a compliment.

613
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,760
And this is like man, woman, whatever.

614
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,160
I just want to be a pleasant person in society.

615
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,760
I have to like think through every, it's like the ocean's 11 of social interaction.

616
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,440
I have to have like a plan for every, what if he only speaks Spanish?

617
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,040
What if she is drunk right now and I can't tell?

618
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,960
Like I have to have an angle of egress.

619
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,360
So you say like, hey, I really like your boots.

620
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,200
And then they turn around and there's only like a guy in a SWAT outfit standing there.

621
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Like, did you say that like, no ma'am and you walk away and then you go and you stand

622
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,440
outside by the fountain and I have, I stuff a Chinese man in a box.

623
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,720
I sneak him into the back room and let him come out and like, he jumps out of the box,

624
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,000
leapfrogs over her.

625
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,880
She says, what?

626
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,320
And you yell nice boots.

627
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,200
And she turns around.

628
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
She's been so distracted by the Chinese man runs away.

629
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,800
Brad Pitt's there.

630
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,840
He's eating a sandwich.

631
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,520
Meanwhile, Casey, I was like, he's driving the getaway truck, but is he?

632
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,280
No, it's one of the robots you built down.

633
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,520
Yep.

634
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,200
The robot explodes.

635
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
The woman feels very good about her shoes.

636
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,720
Is that Rob Reiner?

637
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,760
Oh, he's wearing a beard.

638
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,320
It can't be.

639
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,280
It's a fake beard.

640
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,040
Also a fake Rob Reiner.

641
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
Also a fake Rob Reiner.

642
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,160
Did you see Ocean's 14?

643
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,320
Yeah.

644
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,680
It fucking sucked.

645
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,240
It was, it was really, really, really bad.

646
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,720
It was 12 minutes long.

647
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,240
It was really more of a short film.

648
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,640
I love those edits though.

649
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,040
Really.

650
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,880
I felt cool while watching it.

651
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,120
Yeah.

652
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,160
I actually don't pay someone a compliment unless I have, I do have to have my angles.

653
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,320
I have to have my angles of exit like on lock before I say anything to someone I don't know.

654
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,240
Sometimes it's the window.

655
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
So you gotta make sure you're low to the ground.

656
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,800
Low story.

657
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,800
I was at a hotel at a breakfast buffet a couple of weeks ago and I went to the,

658
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,160
everyone in my room was still asleep.

659
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,400
So I was going to get them to go box.

660
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,200
And I actually asked the woman if they had boxes like that.

661
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:15,840
Like as I was walking out of the dining hall, like I just wanted to, if she said no,

662
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,800
my trajectory was already like taking me out of the awkward situation.

663
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,600
I was like gone.

664
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,680
I just also want to jump back to how your brain works, Justin,

665
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,440
in that asking for her to go box is an awkward situation.

666
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,000
If you have to go boxes, no, and then you guys just share an awkward pull along.

667
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,360
Like we've known each other for nearly 30 years now.

668
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,800
Do you not know how this works?

669
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:48,240
If she says they don't have to go boxes, I'm an uncultured simpleton

670
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,040
who doesn't understand the breakfast buffet ways.

671
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,560
Like that's my day.

672
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,280
Suddenly a guy who can't do breakfast buffets, right?

673
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,640
She's going to look at me like a fat guy who needs to like grub out later on some Belgian waffles.

674
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,880
So I need to take a to go box of waffles.

675
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Did I eat enough waffles?

676
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,880
That's like the whole, going to be the whole thing.

677
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,840
I fucked up my exit yesterday.

678
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,880
Oh, Friday I was, I early voted and it was at this huge empty mall.

679
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
It was like this mega voting center.

680
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,240
And while I was like in the booth, it was like in a row of other booths.

681
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,960
And as people were finishing up, like submitting their polls

682
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,080
and walking away, this woman was giving them my voted stickers.

683
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,360
And she would say, did you finish voting?

684
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,080
And they'd be like, yeah.

685
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,840
And she'd say, well, congratulations.

686
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,640
Do you feel great?

687
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,920
That's really, you should feel very proud of yourself.

688
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,160
Thank you for coming out and doing your duty.

689
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,840
And then I finished mine and she was, did you finish voting?

690
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,480
And I said, yep.

691
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,360
And she said, here you go.

692
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,320
And she put a sticker on me and I stopped.

693
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,080
I came to a dead stop and like waited for the deluge of praise for doing my civic duty.

694
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,360
And like it didn't come.

695
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,800
And the moment only lasted for maybe a second and a half.

696
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,160
But I felt like such a shithead because it was very, very obvious

697
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,080
that I was waiting for my pat on the head.

698
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,200
And so I just kind of had to like pivot 90 degrees,

699
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,440
which I did sort of like a robot and then walked out of the room, shame face.

700
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,720
I felt like such a piece of shit.

701
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,040
I wanted to get in line and vote again, but they don't let you do that.

702
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,040
Just in the hopes that you might get a compliment on that second pass.

703
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,680
You're really taking this seriously.

704
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,480
I just, it was so hard.

705
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,200
I need, I need positive reinforcement for doing basically anything now.

706
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,040
I hear here's positive reinforcement, financial reinforcement.

707
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,280
That's right.

708
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,200
We're financially reinforcing ourselves talking about sex toys.

709
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,520
It's a sad week here on my brother, my brother and me.

710
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,840
Sad week because this so ends as far as we know for now, at least.

711
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,400
This is the season ender.

712
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,600
This is the season finale of our Extreme Restraints promotion.

713
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,800
I prepared a special, a special game for you guys on this.

714
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,280
The final edition of our Extreme Restraints.

715
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,960
Extreme Restraints.com by the way is an adult superstore.

716
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,240
They have toys.

717
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,640
They have anything you could dream of.

718
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,880
They are essentially, they are the only game in town.

719
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,800
Don't fucking take your business anywhere else.

720
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,840
It's, it's, it's child's play.

721
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,520
Not that children should have access to, you know, electrode butt balls or anything, but.

722
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,020
Right.

723
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:46,480
So I, for this last, this last edition, I prepared a quick game where I am going to name an item

724
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,440
and you are going to tell me whether or not is it, whether it is by Extreme Restraints.com

725
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
or is it a product of my imagination?

726
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,560
Okay.

727
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,200
Are you ready?

728
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,700
Yep.

729
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,980
Okay.

730
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,200
First up, Master Series Extreme Chastity Cage.

731
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,560
That's definitely, I have two of those, so it's definitely real.

732
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,800
Yeah, that's, that's Extreme Restraints.

733
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,520
I know for a fact.

734
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,200
Slappy Master butt paddling thing.

735
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,320
Now, now, now you may have lost it.

736
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
It may have come off the rails when you mumbled thing at the end.

737
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,520
I, I just wish that somebody would, some brain trust would get together and finally name

738
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,960
what it is when the, the thing it is that you butt paddle with.

739
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,160
You know, the side paddling thing.

740
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,920
Ah, if only we could figure it out.

741
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,880
I guess we'll never know.

742
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
As imagined.

743
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,800
Pussy Crusher Extreme Latch.

744
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,520
That is not a verb that I want ever done to any pussy ever.

745
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,480
How'd it go last night on, on your blind date, Steve?

746
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,680
Crushed it.

747
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,200
We got together.

748
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,400
We went to this really charming vineyard and we crushed up pussy for pussy wine.

749
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,800
Do you remember that one, that one episode of I Love Lucy where she was standing in that

750
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,240
thing, just crushing all those pussies?

751
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,800
We did that.

752
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,360
Yeah, it was like.

753
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,280
We did that, but not with grapes.

754
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,320
With human pussies.

755
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,200
But not with grapes, with human pussies.

756
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,320
So what's your vote?

757
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,120
I think it's real.

758
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
I think it's real too.

759
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,360
No, it's fake.

760
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,920
I made it up.

761
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,800
Damn it.

762
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I was wondering how a latch would do crushing, but go on.

763
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,480
The Cockrider Masturbator.

764
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:20,880
Yeah.

765
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,840
That's gotta be real.

766
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,240
Clearly.

767
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,360
Okay.

768
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,800
Now here's an interesting thing that I, I do want to mention.

769
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,880
They have an electric paddle on here.

770
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,440
It is a, it is a paddle that you spank.

771
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,240
You know, your, your lover, uh, and.

772
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
It can also be used for home defense, I assume.

773
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,720
Well, no, this is the thing.

774
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,000
And this is not a joke.

775
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,240
I have this already, but it was marketed to me as an electric fly swatter.

776
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,160
I am 150% sure it is exactly the same thing.

777
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,320
Have you not wondered why after you smack the fly, it has the bitch written out across its face?

778
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,560
And also the fly has also the fly has ejaculated.

779
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:11,120
Easy access neoprene restraint system.

780
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,160
That's real.

781
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
That's totally real.

782
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm adding all of these to my Amazon wishlist.

783
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,400
Oh wait.

784
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,920
It's not on Amazon.

785
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,120
Gotta hit up extreme restraints.

786
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
Do you guys have extreme restraints prime?

787
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,280
It's like, it's like Amazon prime.

788
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,360
It's like Amazon prime, except instead of doing shipping faster, someone comes to your

789
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,280
house and fucks you with the thing that you bought.

790
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,160
Mm-hmm.

791
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,000
So here's what I want you to do, friends.

792
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I want you to go to extremistraints.com.

793
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm going to conduct this little experiment with my brothers right now.

794
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,280
I want you to go to extremistraints.com and I want you to look up the electric paddle.

795
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,160
So boys, I'm sending you a link to the electric paddle in our chat right now.

796
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,720
So I want you to look at this and take it in, okay?

797
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,120
Okay.

798
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,360
Okay.

799
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,240
Okay, you've clicked this link, right?

800
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,560
Uh-huh.

801
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,520
Okay.

802
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,920
So what we're looking at here is a, like a tennis racket, except the handle is long.

803
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,640
It looks like it's probably got a slot for maybe some double A's in there.

804
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,600
And you put that in there and then you press a button and then electricity.

805
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,920
Now I'm sending you a link to the amazing electric bug zapper available on Amazon.

806
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,840
This is precisely, this is precisely the same thing.

807
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,320
It is exactly the same thing.

808
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,440
It is so nice in this world when you can find a multitasker.

809
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,000
You know what I mean?

810
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,200
Thank God, right?

811
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,280
You get the, get the electric paddle, that's going to give somebody a jolt

812
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,400
and also use it as electric fly swatter.

813
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,880
Now I am sending-

814
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,840
Now imagine this, because imagine the humiliation, the last thing going through that fly's head,

815
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,640
when he's like, oh please, oh please tell me that wasn't on someone's ass.

816
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,040
Yeah, but that's what it was.

817
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:54,400
I am sending you guys now a link to a handheld tortilla warmer.

818
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,600
Okay.

819
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:57,840
Right?

820
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,040
Yeah.

821
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,240
Pretty much the same exact, we're looking at the same model.

822
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,760
We encourage you and my brother and my brother and me to A, buy all of Extreme Restraints products.

823
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,680
B, don't use the same thing that you use to electro sex your ass to heat up your taco shells.

824
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,200
Please.

825
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,600
Please.

826
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,840
I don't ask for much on this show.

827
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,960
And when you do go to ExtremeRestraints.com use the coupon code MIDDLIST

828
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,680
because you're going to save 20% on that electric foul.

829
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,120
That's going to save you enough money to buy three of these bad boys.

830
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,720
Guys, I know what you've been doing.

831
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,960
You've been waiting for Christmas, holding out.

832
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
I don't know the coupon code is going to be good much longer past this week.

833
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,600
I have no reason to believe-

834
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,680
Even after this week, it will still be good for 10%,

835
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,920
but it will never be good for 20% unless we continue to do more spots.

836
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,360
Hey, was it something we said?

837
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,600
Hey, Extreme Restraints.

838
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,680
Hey, Extreme Restraints, can we patch things up?

839
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,080
Like, let us know of all the bullshit because there's been so much of it.

840
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,080
Was what-

841
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,160
Was it when we mocked the sex flash slammy?

842
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,080
We didn't realize it was so close to your hearts.

843
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,040
Do you guys want Yahoo?

844
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,560
Absolutely.

845
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
More than I want my next breath, pretty much.

846
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,520

Thank you, Caleb.

848
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gail A who asks,

849
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,920
What's a good pet name for an uncle?

850
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,800
What's the role or title in other languages?

851
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,600
Slangs?

852
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,200
Is there a difference whether your uncle is from your dad's side or your mom's side?

853
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,400
Include things like when kinders and kids-

854
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,000
When kinders and kids mess up the pronunciation and it comes out like,

855
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,800
My anki.

856
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,920
Got a fave pet name for your fave uncle?

857
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,440
I hate this so much.

858
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,240
Do you guys know my favorite pet name for one of our uncles?

859
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,800
What's that?

860
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,360
Mark.

861
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,840
Dave.

862
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,480
Dave.

863
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,520
Adult Dave.

864
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,080
Chris.

865
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,640
Like, how do you- that person-

866
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
Grown ass man, Mark.

867
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,680
Grown ass Dr. Mark Wahlberg.

868
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,800
Like, why- he's a fucking-

869
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,920
Listen, uncle.

870
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,200
Uncle Felipe, I've been wanting you to be my uncle for a long time.

871
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,480
You and me get closer.

872
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,320
So I came up with a pet name for you.

873
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,760
You're kind of chunky, so I'm going to start calling you my chunkle.

874
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,160
You're my chunkle now.

875
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
Have you ever noticed that you have a body odor problem?

876
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,160
From now on, you're my stunkle.

877
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,880
Stunkle's not bad.

878
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,760
You're my funkle.

879
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,720
I used to live with a guy named Jacob Dunkle.

880
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,880
And his- the very name of which apparently makes Travis laugh.

881
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,600
It does.

882
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,800
I love Dunkle.

883
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
I saw Dunkle come out of the Argo.

884
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,280
Oh yeah?

885
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,760
Did he like it?

886
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,640
Yesterday I was going to-

887
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,160
What was the Dunkle- how many Dunkle-

888
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,520
How many Dunkle stars did he give it?

889
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,840
He didn't give any.

890
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,880
He did say that you need to respond to his Facebook messages.

891
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Because he said you kind of left him hanging on a few of those.

892
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,480
Oh man, he said it like four months ago.

893
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,360
You need to get back with Dunkle.

894
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,480
Dunkle, I'm sorry if you're listening.

895
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,920
If you're listening and you probably aren't-

896
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,560
He keeps up.

897
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,520
He told me he listens.

898
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:55,760
Yeah.

899
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,600
So now you have no excuse.

900
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,840
Anyway, he has to like enjoy things and then say that they were a slammed dunkle, right?

901
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,240
Yeah, yeah.

902
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,200
Definitely, definitely.

903
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,720
But he- I can't remember if this actually happened or if we just wanted it to happen.

904
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,920
Like for him to have a sibling that had a child and then he would be Funky Uncle Dunkle

905
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,200
or Funky Unky Dunky or any combination of those three things.

906
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,200
Funky Unky Dunky.

907
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,720
Oh god.

908
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,680
My Uncle Nemo we lovingly call Unk.

909
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,200
He makes it sound like a caveman.

910
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,680
I like that too.

911
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,120
He is a Cro-Magnon.

912
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,400
Hey, did you- So who's bringing what for Thanksgiving?

913
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,640
Well, I'm bringing the Pecan Sandies and is anybody bringing cranberry?

914
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,400
Oh yeah, we assigned that to-

915
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,080
Hey everybody, Unk's here.

916
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,120
Sorry, just stepped on a duck.

917
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,000
Just so I could double check in your fiction,

918
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,360
did someone buy a package from Nabisco Pecan Sandies

919
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,520
and thinks that's a sufficient Thanksgiving offering?

920
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,720
That's how he's set with Asai.

921
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,040
And what's Steve bringing?

922
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,120
He's bringing Pecan Sandies again.

923
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,000
I think if someone's gonna bring Pecan Sandies, it's gonna be Unk

924
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,680
because he does not sound like somebody who is graced with color yet.

925
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,600
He's just gonna pull one out of the back of his van

926
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,800
where he just has stacks and stacks of packages of Pecan Sandies

927
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,240
that he bought when the Piggly Wiggly down the street was going out of business.

928
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,960
Just so I'm clear, is Unk actually Encino Man?

929
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,400
If Unk is toilet- if Unk is toilet trained,

930
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,840
then we are all like one step ahead of the game.

931
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,800
To be fair, Unk is not really related to either my mother or my father.

932
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,600
He's more of a friend of the family, by which I mean a bear.

933
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:43,920
Okay.

934
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,240
This has been the greatest Thanksgiving of my life,

935
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,960
except for when that bear tore my arm off.

936
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,360
But God, I love my Unk.

937
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,400
You mean Unk?

938
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,200
I'm not gonna talk bad about Unk under my roof.

939
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,160
Unk is the same.

940
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,240
He's the only thing that got me through 9-11.

941
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,440
How old is this bear?

942
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800
He's an old-ass bear.

943
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,720
Bears only lived at like age seven.

944
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,240
We all know this to be true.

945
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,360
This is Unk Jr.

946
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,800
Excuse me, Unk Jr.

947
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,520
Son of Unk.

948
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,680
His forearms are just as powerful as the original Unk, make no mistake.

949
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,360
His large claws have torn all our tapestries, but we love him very much.

950
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,480
But they've also torn down the emotional walls that was keeping my family apart.

951
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,320
You know, we went three Christmas sets without speaking until Unk showed up.

952
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,560
They say a bear's strength has no limits,

953
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,240
and we finally put that to the test when we used him to rebuild our home,

954
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,520
and by which we mean our love.

955
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,440
He was strong enough to hold his family together.

956
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,640
You lay off Unk.

957
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,880
Every year at Thanksgiving, he brings honey, and we love him for that.

958
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,320
And he always pushes it forward a little shyly, as if to say,

959
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,200
this is all I could do, and goddammit, you've done enough.

960
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,400
He and his son always talk about how they like to wipe their ass with really soft paper.

961
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:04,960
I hate it.

962
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,680
I hate it.

963
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,320
You know what?

964
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,360
He missed my wedding because he got captured and sent to the zoo,

965
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,040
but I wasn't angry at him.

966
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,160
How could I say angry at him?

967
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,840
I would love, I would straight up love the next time I see him.

968
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,440
I would straight up love the next time we see like our grown ass man,

969
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,560
Uncle Dave, our dad's older brother, to just be like, hello, Unky,

970
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,680
and then just see if I can like just get past it

971
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,840
without it being a thing that he stops me on and goes,

972
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,040
whoa, what the fuck was that?

973
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,480
Oh, you'll be able to tell if Travis ever does that at our house when I'm in the room

974
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,880
because you'll see me throwing myself through a plate glass window and running down the street.

975
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
You will turn to talk to Justin, only he will be a Justin shaped cloud of dust.

976
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,640
Got too weird, had to dip.

977
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,040
Please don't.

978
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,200
Just a tiny Asian man here.

979
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:51,680
Please don't.

980
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:51,920
What the fuck?

981
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,960
I want to tell you guys, we're talking about talking about awkward conversations

982
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,000
and I wanted to share with you guys my brother,

983
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,520
my brother and me awkward conversation that I had this past week.

984
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:14,160
I ran into an older lady who is tangentially, I think, familiar with what we do.

985
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,240
She actually said, do you still do your internet radio comedy?

986
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,080
And I said, gathering what she said from those context clues, I said, yes.

987
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,920
That's like calling pizza, like, do you still eat bread cheese sauce?

988
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:29,840
Yes, I do.

989
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,480
Yes.

990
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,200
And then she told me that a mutual friend is going to be touring with Landau Murphy,

991
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,520
West Virginia native and America's Got Talent winner, Landau Murphy.

992
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,680
And then asked if we should not inquire to see

993
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,800
if maybe we would make a good opening act for Landau Murphy.

994
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,640
She said, does your audience crossover with Landau Murphy?

995
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,600
Almost definitely.

996
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,040
Almost definitely.

997
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,240
I think so definitely.

998
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,200
In fact, we've already been in talks with his people and our people.

999
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,160
The specific blend of uncomfortable I looked when Sidney came over and found me.

1000
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,320
Just curled in a ball on the ground crying.

1001
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,160
She knew, she said, somebody asked you if you share a demographic with Landau Murphy again.

1002
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,480
Do you have some sort of life alert system set up with your wife where like,

1003
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,320
if someone comes over and is like, hey, I used to go to church with you,

1004
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,360
what kind of comedy do you do that you can press that button

1005
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,440
and she would kick in the door like a Secret Service agent?

1006
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,360
It's wife alert.

1007
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,160
It's help, help I'm awkward and I can't walk away.

1008
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,000
I just like collapse into a protoplasmic heap on the ground.

1009
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,800
Just push the button.

1010
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,560
I have fake seizures before and I'm not above it.

1011
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,840
Do you ever wish that you would get like famous enough

1012
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,240
that you could just do that kind of thing and get away with it?

1013
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,000
Like, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, no, that it's fine.

1014
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,720
Cannot.

1015
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,200
Because you can.

1016
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,600
Cannot.

1017
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,640
That's how that guy came up with Borat.

1018
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,200
Somebody came up to him, he's like, hey, I heard that your comedy show's still

1019
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,280
doing pretty good, what do you guys talk about?

1020
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,520
Then he's like, very nice, how much?

1021
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,160
Borat, goodbye.

1022
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,120
Then he walks away.

1023
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,880
Kazakhstan, and then he sprints out of there.

1024
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,080
I want to actually try that.

1025
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,280
You're going to do a Borat impression to try to end a conversation?

1026
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,720
Because I can totally see that working.

1027
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,800
Yeah, I think that's a time-tested method.

1028
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,680
How about another question where we answer it?

1029
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,520
That sounds good.

1030
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,160
How novel.

1031
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,560
I recently joined a dating site and met someone.

1032
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,280
We went out for a couple of weeks, but ultimately she decided we'd split and be friends, and I agreed.

1033
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,200
Yeah, probably, that's probably the best.

1034
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,560
Still fighting it in court.

1035
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:51,200
Yeah, now she seemingly regrets the decision and why I still think being friends is the right choice.

1036
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,760
However, I have about two months left on my paid subscription to the dating site,

1037
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,480
but I don't want her to think me heartless if I start using it again.

1038
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,960
I genuinely like this person and don't want to hurt her feelings.

1039
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,840
Should I use the dating site or am I being a jerk?

1040
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,800
Yes, you should use it.

1041
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,080
I'm from semi-single in Cincinnati.

1042
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,080
Yes, you should use the dating site.

1043
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,880
Of course you do.

1044
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,480
You paid money for it.

1045
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,800
And you owe this person nothing.

1046
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,200
You met them on a dating site and went on, what, like five or six dates and it didn't pan out.

1047
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,840
You weren't married to the person, you didn't get divorced, it didn't pan out.

1048
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,480
Yes, you should keep using the dating site.

1049
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,840
How is she going to know that you, it's not like if you use a dating site,

1050
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,720
it's not like fucking Facebook where it's like, Ralph poked this girl,

1051
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,080
but literally in real life poked her with his donger.

1052
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,440
Did you hear this, Susan?

1053
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,560
Susan, you see this?

1054
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,960
He's moved on.

1055
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,000
He's moved on.

1056
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,160
You have two moved on requests.

1057
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,280
You know what, in fact, that might just be a really awesome website.

1058
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,320
If it was like, hey, tough love, we're going to help you get over this person,

1059
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,520
you're still pining over by updating every time they get in.

1060
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,280
Well, that is actually Facebook.

1061
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,040
Facebook actually, what's great about Facebook is when you, you know,

1062
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,080
when you date someone, you are an active participant in their social media landscape.

1063
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,480
And even after you break up with them, Facebook doesn't,

1064
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,600
Facebook's like, but I thought you guys were forever.

1065
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,120
And Facebook will like show you like, you know, your ex-

1066
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,200
Wait, who's this new girl he's with?

1067
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,880
Your ex checked in.

1068
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,280
Your ex checked in at Uno's Pizzeria.

1069
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,320
Like, great, great.

1070
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:28,960
Thank you.

1071
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,960
I'm glad she's, can you let me know?

1072
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,520
Like, give me some sort of pizza review from my ex?

1073
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,800
Cause that would be fantastic too.

1074
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,760
She ate a whole pizza by herself.

1075
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,880
You made the right call.

1076
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,720
Yeah.

1077
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,200
She's kind of freaking us out right now.

1078
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,800
She's been to Uno's three times a day for the last week.

1079
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,160
She's the mayor of Uno's.

1080
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,400
Thanks, Facebook.

1081
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,920
That's not a four square distinction.

1082
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,640
They had a vote.

1083
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,120
She was democratically elected the mayor of Uno's.

1084
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,680
She's the deciding vote for the Uno City Council.

1085
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,640
Yeah.

1086
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,760
You just, it's so, those dating sites like thrive on anonymity.

1087
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,280
You could fuck everyone, everyone on the dating site,

1088
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,440
dudes and ladies all together.

1089
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,720
And none of them would know about any of the other people.

1090
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,680
Congrats.

1091
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,560
It's basically just a big, it's basically eyes wide.

1092
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,600
Shut up that bitch.

1093
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,600
Like you, you know,

1094
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:27,840
I mean, okay, translate it, translate it to like a much bigger like question.

1095
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,360
This is like saying I dated a girl in a town that I lived in.

1096
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,640
It didn't work out.

1097
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,800
Now I can't ever date in that town again.

1098
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,480
Cause I'm afraid she'll find out and think I'm heartless.

1099
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,360
She could ostensibly cause she could meet somebody else in the town on like match.com.

1100
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,280
It's a fucking, it's a, it's a masquerade fuck fiesta.

1101
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,960
No one's ever going to know.

1102
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,240
No one is, that's their tagline.

1103
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,560
That's actually, that's their tagline, masquerade fuck fiesta.

1104
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,240
Masquerade fuck fiesta.

1105
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,280
No one has to know.

1106
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,480
No one will know.

1107
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,880
Get your dick wet and wet and wet and wet.

1108
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,520
Quietly, quietly wet.

1109
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,720
It's like you're some sort of ninja fuck assassin.

1110
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,480
Nobody is ever going to hear you.

1111
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,760
You are like the wind.

1112
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,240
You will come in, fuck and be a ghost.

1113
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,440
Fuck like the wind.

1114
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,680
Fuck like a ghost here at match.com.

1115
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,160
I met my wife on match.com, but before that I ghost fucked 38 women.

1116
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,000
I ghost fucked 38 women in the same month I met my wife.

1117
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,800
I'm so happy.

1118
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,480
Good luck getting that on a business card.

1119
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,080
That's a hell of a tagline.

1120
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,360
I don't think they could fit all of it.

1121
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,720
The words you said.

1122
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,560
It's all abbreviated.

1123
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,120
It's an acronym.

1124
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,080
It's the best job I ever had.

1125
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,560
Just love bringing people together and then hiding one of the people.

1126
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,760
It's like the underground railroad of hookups.

1127
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,320
You're helping people out of relationships secretly under the cover of night

1128
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,160
and bringing them to a safe relationship where they can be free.

1129
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,920
Welcome to our wildlife preserve where we keep people that just got out of a relationship

1130
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,320
till they are strong enough to provide for themselves.

1131
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,160
Please no pictures.

1132
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,880
They all fuck, but you don't need to know about it and they don't need to know about it.

1133
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,400
When you're on an online dating site, you're fucking people.

1134
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,760
And even you don't know about it.

1135
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,440
Calm down.

1136
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,080
Get off it.

1137
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,600
Get off the smut, everyone.

1138
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,320
Hey, everybody.

1139
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,120
Can we get off the smut?

1140
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,720
If you're going to use a dating site, use OKCupid because it's free

1141
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,560
and that brings all the nasties out.

1142
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,880
You guys know about that weird divide, right?

1143
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,000
A match you have to pay for.

1144
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,680
And so people there are like, I'm looking for someone who can be my significant other.

1145
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,760
And then OKCupid is like, I want someone that will let me poop on them and possibly.

1146
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,320
I think that that has always been implicit to me in the name.

1147
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,400
OKCupid's like, all right, OK.

1148
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,760
I want to poop on these sunglasses and then have you put them on.

1149
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,400
OKCupid, whatever you say.

1150
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,160
Let's see what's up, I guess.

1151
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,920
Match.com is like, hey, let's use science to make sure that you find your soulmate.

1152
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,160
OKCupid is like, hey, you like scat?

1153
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,880
Hey, I'm not talking about fast talking like Jason Mraz.

1154
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,320
Although Jason Mraz is into it.

1155
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,200
Here's his profile.

1156
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,720
Have you dreamed about pooping on Jason Mraz?

1157
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,480
You won't see that shit on match.com.

1158
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,560
You will literally see that shit thanks to our special shit spectrum.

1159
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,640
You're going to see you're 99% friend, but 2% shit buds.

1160
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,720
That's 101% friends.

1161
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
You say you always want to date Billy Zane.

1162
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,840
He's not on here, but we have a bald guy that will leer at you.

1163
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,080
He calls himself the Phantom.

1164
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,560
How's that?

1165
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,320
How's that work?

1166
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,760
OKCupid, you're the boss.

1167
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,200
Thank you for listening to our comedy podcast, my brother and my brother and me.

1168
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself and enjoyed your time here.

1169
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,640
That's our main goal.

1170
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,120
Thank you to the people tweeting about the show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

1171
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:09,440

You can find a lot of other clips there, MBMBAM minis.

1178
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,440
Two calls to action.

1179
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,080
One, if you have a special personal message you want right on the show or a commercial message,

1180
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:43,920
you can scratch those itches at maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

1181
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,720
You want a birthday shout out for like-

1182
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,760
Birthday shout out, romance shout out, biz shout out.

1183
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,440
That is the place that you go to do it.

1184
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:57,040
Other thing, our email is MBMBAM at maximumfun.org.

1185
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,680
Send in your questions.

1186
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,680
Also send in your Yahoo answers that you find.

1187
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,440
There was hardly any this week.

1188
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,920
And I understand that there was some power outages in certain parts of the country.

1189
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,600
But really, that's no excuse.

1190
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,800
Speaking of which, we here at My Brother, My Brother and Me would ask that you take a moment,

1191
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
take a few seconds, go to redcross.org.

1192
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:22,160
Maybe give to some of those people that are still without, still struggling,

1193
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,120
still need a food, water, shelter, what have you.

1194
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,640
Go and make a difference.

1195
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,080
And if someone could confirm for me,

1196
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,920
I saw pictures yesterday of fire-powered cell phone chargers being used in New York.

1197
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,560
If someone could confirm for me whether or not those are real.

1198
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,760
That's neat.

1199
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,000
I want it to be real so very badly.

1200
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,720
Do you guys think you would thrive in that sort of environment?

1201
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,560
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1202
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,040
I think that it would be far too easy for me to go full native.

1203
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,360
I think you would go full blown like,

1204
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,520
Travis, did you make leather armor?

1205
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,800
Yep, I did.

1206
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,280
Sometimes we goof on Travis.

1207
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,520
Sometimes there is literally no human being I would more want

1208
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,160
going out and foraging and protecting my village than Travis.

1209
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,840
Travis would flourish in that environment.

1210
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use Our Theme song.

1211
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,960
You want to do that again, but I won't mumble so much.

1212
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,200
Yeah.

1213
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,720
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use Our Theme song,

1214
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,720
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed, which now bookends the show.

1215
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,120
You know what?

1216
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
There's a lot of logic behind that.

1217
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,520
It volts up nicely, but it also descends nicely.

1218
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,320
You know what I mean?

1219
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,880
And it's like, I don't want to bring the show to a dead stop.

1220
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,040
I want there to be some descending action.

1221
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,200
And that is exactly what the song brings.

1222
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,720
So thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters, very much.

1223
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,320
I also want to shout out, check out on Twitter, Make Sharp Stuff.

1224
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,000
We retweeted the link, but they are putting out a book and they asked us to contribute on it.

1225
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,160
So if you want to check out a little excerpt of the thing we wrote, it's on there.

1226
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,800
It's called On the Mayan Apocalypse and Endless Shrimp.

1227
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,280
Also, in all seriousness, you guys, on the 6th, get out and vote.

1228
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,960
If you're registered, get out there.

1229
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,200
Do it.

1230
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,440
Seriously, for Obama, for real, though.

1231
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,840
Yeah, preferably for Obama.

1232
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,200
Definitely, definitely want to send me out a B-Day prez.

1233
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,120
That's just P.O. Box, 5400-2576.

1234
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,080
I mean, just get that out there.

1235
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,320
By which it means a birthday president.

1236
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,360
Yeah, and do send it on the 6th, because if it gets here before,

1237
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,520
again, we'll throw it in the trash.

1238
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,280
Definitely needs to arrive on the 8th.

1239
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,400
I was just kidding about if you want to vote for Rami, I guess that's okay.

1240
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,960
Just don't tell us about it.

1241
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,520
Yeah.

1242
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,000
And hey, if you're a Max Fund donor,

1243
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,600
you can vote for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for all I care.

1244
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,160
I can't pronounce the gentleman's name, but, you know.

1245
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,880
Was that scat?

1246
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,760
I'm a scat, man.

1247
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,360
You can vote for Jason Mraz if you want.

1248
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:55,280
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

1249
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,040
Hey, everybody, come on and listen in close.

1250
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,960
It's listen to me, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

1251
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,880
Scatman time.

1252
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,560
It gets funnier every time you do this.

1253
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:12,240
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

1254
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,880
You know, I fucking stayed at the same hotel.

1255
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,960
Last time I was in New York, I stayed at the same hotel as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

1256
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,760
It's true.

1257
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

1258
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,920
I was at the Warwick, and that's where Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stayed.

1259
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,200
I'm sorry about his name.

1260
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,680
I feel bad every time.

1261
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,040
It's not coming from a place of racism.

1262
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,120
It's coming from the fact that Justin doesn't know how many fucking syllables are in this dude's name.

1263
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,360
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

1264
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,040
I'm so certain there are no Bs.

1265
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,320
But he keeps sneaking in different syllables every time.

1266
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,200
That's my favorite.

1267
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,600
Did you guys know that Scatman died of throat cancer?

1268
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,680
Hey, let's bring it down for a minute, you guys.

1269
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,800
What crueller fate could there be than to take his own instrument, you know, to claim him?

1270
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,760
His final words were,

1271
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,800
I see Jesus.

1272
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,560
Travis, did you know that Scatman John used scatting to, oh, and like mouse scat.

1273
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,280
Did you know that he used it to overcome a stutter?

1274
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,760
That's amazing, Justin.

1275
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,360
Are you, do you have like a Scat Facts website pulled up?

1276
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,520
No, like I know that about him.

1277
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:23,840
Okay.

1278
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,200
I know that about Scatman.

1279
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,640
Now, when you are Scatman John, does that mean that there are different Scatmen,

1280
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,560
and you get the title and it's like an honorary thing?

1281
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,520
It's like Doctor Who.

1282
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,960
Yeah, it's basically, I'm the Dread Pirate Scatman John.

1283
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,280
When Scatman dies, he regenerates into a new Scatman played by a new actor.

1284
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,360
Okay, listen, we were trying to end the show.

1285
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,880
We've given people enough funny.

1286
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,800
They have their fill.

1287
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,960
This final Yahoo was sent in by Michael Allen.

1288
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,760
Thank you, Michael.

1289
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ali Suleiman, who asks,

1290
01:00:51,280 --> 01:01:00,000
Can you send me some free Yu-Gi-Oh cards?
