1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,600
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, and it's an advice show for the Modron era.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Justin, for a second, it kind of sounded like you were starting with like a Yakov Smyrnov thing

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,480
there. Hello, hello America. Is that still, is that still topical? Yakov Smyrnov, is that?

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,560
My name is Chester Bengleton. I come from other country.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,080
Okay, I guess follow-up question, is it also now deeply problematic,

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,680
and maybe has it always been? Hugely, hugely, wildly.

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,560
Defo.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,280
Oh, good.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,920
Have you? I mean, but his show is like so wildly patriotic in its best length.

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
And so incredibly xenophobic.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
It's weirdly very xenophobic. It's like he got in and he was like,

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,640
that is it, everybody. Nobody else different. I'm the last one. Everybody else figure out.

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Yakov Smyrnov looks at Borat and he's like, that's too far.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
You've gone too far.

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
Wait to ruin it for the rest of us.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Becoming Dracula a little bit.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:02,080
So sorry that we missed the day of days. We try to come out with an episode on every 420.

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,640
And honestly, y'all, we just couldn't get it done.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,880
I tried to do April 20th episode, but then I got high.

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,320
So, and that's when we could have done.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,120
That's when we could have done, but we did.

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Do y'all remember that song is all about responsibilities this person had,

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
but they didn't end up doing them.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,280
It's a cautionary tale.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,720
It's a cautionary tale. And it's really a powerful anti-drug message.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
If you think about it. Yeah.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,120
Cause it's like I was supposed to pay my rent and then I got high

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,680
and then I got evicted from my apartment and lost my job.

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
And I was supposed to read at the library to kids, but then I got high.

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,440
Yeah. I was supposed to take my heart medicine, but then I got high and I died teens.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,640
And now I'm a ghost warning you from beyond the grave. I know the cush is fun.

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,960
But then I got high.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,560
A lot of people are excited for the episode we got coming up here in about 17 episodes

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
because it will be the 420th episode.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,040
And I don't know how to start laying the groundwork to not disappoint those people

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
because of how, just how profoundly detached we are.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,240
I feel like to make a weird pop culture pull,

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,480
it kind of feels like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,440
when the demons like don't celebrate Halloween because it's so cliche.

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,520
I feel like for our 420th episode,

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,240
we should just make it devoid of any jokes about dank nugs and blunts.

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,840
Alternative idea.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,240
And I had this last night and I was thinking about it.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
We, instead of putting up a proper episode,

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,320
just take all the audio out of an episode of Family Guy and put that up instead.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
Is that now?

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,280
Justin, you know some things about entertainment law.

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,920
Yes.

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,600
If I put up just 23 tight minutes of Stewie and Brian,

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,680
just thinking about these two clowns makes me start rolling,

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,600
even when I'm not on the cush.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,760
It's a great question, Griffin.

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,320
You can do that.

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,800
The one issue you do need to be careful of

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
is you gotta make sure you have the audio from the commercials in there as well

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,680
because that's the only way it counts for them towards that money.

63
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,440
And that's Seth's money, guys.

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Hey guys, I'm not here to take Seth's money.

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,640
That's his money.

66
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720
So you gotta leave the commercials in it on that one.

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
Let me ask you a question.

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,520
What if, instead of just straight taking all the audio from one episode,

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,160
we did a super cut of an hour of all of the uh and er sounds

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,720
from a bunch of episodes of Family Guy?

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
Oh, a Family Guy.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
I kind of thought you were going to say our podcast

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
because there's a lot of source material.

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,520
No, no, no.

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,720
All Family Guy, and you just hear all the different voices,

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,520
most of them Seth, and you just hear all the uh, er, uh, ah, uh, eh.

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,840
What if we did just one episode of my Bim Bam

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
where each of us brought an episode of Family Guy

79
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
and just tried to recap it as much as we could?

80
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,320
Like a book report?

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,680
Yeah, a book report, and we could talk about all the great cutaway jokes,

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
and we could talk about the baby trying to kill the mom.

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
Do you think America would listen to a podcast called

84
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
that Great Family Guy Humor?

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,240
This is us recapping individual select episodes.

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,480
Oh, we call it Extended Family Guy.

87
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,840
That's good.

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,200
Nuclear Family Guy.

89
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
We'll keep workshopping it.

90
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
I'm just so sorry we missed.

91
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
I didn't do really any good weed humor.

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,600
I tweeted one thing at like 4.05 on 4.20 thinking like,

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,920
okay, and then in 15 minutes a punchline,

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,240
and then I didn't. I didn't.

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,480
I forgot. Then I got high.

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,280
I was gonna tweet something so funny, but then I got high.

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,040
Snoop on the evening of 4.19 tweeted,

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,520
don't forget to leave milk and cookies out for me tonight.

99
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,960
That's pretty good.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
It was, I had a very good chortle.

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
We leave it to the professionals,

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
the professionals who know where weed even comes from.

103
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Thank you.

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
The ground from Gaia.

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
It comes from Gaia.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
I keep telling everybody it's natural.

107
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,520
Even John Boehner now is on the crazy wave.

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,640
Does he party?

109
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,200
Yeah, now he's in the industry.

110
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
He's in the biz now.

111
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm so worried that someday when she is much,

112
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,480
much older and understands language,

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,880
that BB is gonna write a tell all book

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
that reveals my horrible secret

115
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,720
that I don't know where to get weed from.

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,800
And most of these jokes are based on nothing.

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah.

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
I'm just so afraid that everyone's gonna find out

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,240
my nasty truth that I didn't do as much drugs as I said I did.

120
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,760
And I don't know where it came from, this idea,

121
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,560
or why every time anyone sees the number 420 in the wild,

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
or on the same topic, the number 69 in the wild,

123
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
and they make sure to snap a pic and send it to me.

124
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
Because both those numbers are not numbers

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
that reflect the core of my being.

126
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,880
Do you know what I mean?

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah.

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,920
That's the thing is the McElroy brothers,

129
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
we don't celebrate a lot of artifice.

130
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,080
And like the only artifice and irony we have

131
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
is that we are cool.

132
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,680
It's that we think that we are edgy in any sort of way.

133
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
Any sense.

134
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
Like I'm almost to the point where I could get it

135
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,640
for my glaucoma.

136
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,000
Like that's about where I'm at on the scale.

137
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
So let's help some people.

138
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,280
Oh, by the way, Texas, if you came out last weekend,

139
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,560
is that, was it last weekend?

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,440
Yeah.

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,280
Yeah.

142
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,400
Yes, last weekend.

143
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,960
Thank you.

144
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,240
That was very fun.

145
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,320
You were all good eggs.

146
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,200
And thank you to everybody who came to the Moon Tower Show,

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,160
the Schmaner's Moon Tower Show.

148
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,800
Oh, that was good.

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
Oh, it was so good.

150
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,040
Good.

151
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,080
It was amazing.

152
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,040
Do you think maybe we could,

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,560
do you think maybe we could open with a Yahoo?

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
Cause I got four Yahoo's this week that are all club bangers.

155
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm very excited about.

156
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,520
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles,

157
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
who is so deep in the game right now,

158
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
just like crushing it, crushing it, crushing it.

159
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Thank you so much, Adrian.

160
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,080
Well, on their way to earning a nickname perhaps,

161
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,120
or a tagline.

162
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,600
Getting there.

163
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user NickA07, who asks,

164
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,640
how do I be brave on the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror?

165
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,480
Well, good news.

166
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,040
It's not that anymore.

167
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Now it's the Guardians of the Galaxy prism break extreme.

168
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,520
Not in Florida, baby.

169
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,040
Oh, really?

170
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,360
Yeah.

171
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
It's still a big drop, right?

172
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
It's still a big scary drop.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
And I don't think.

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,880
Yeah, but now there's a raccoon sitting next to you,

175
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,680
holding your hand.

176
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,760
Okay, well that might help.

177
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,520
But let's imagine that wasn't true.

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,840
This will be my first time going on a drop tower ride,

179
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,720
especially at Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

180
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,600
Is that what it's called?

181
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,120
I felt like I don't want to go on it because I'm scared.

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
And I am tired of being scared.

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
But my mom's said she's going on it,

184
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,280
but her back hurts.

185
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm worried something could happen to her

186
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
if I don't go on with her.

187
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
IDK, what to do when the time comes?

188
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
What should I do?

189
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
Should I go on with her or not?

190
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,800
How do I be brave for this ride?

191
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,760
How do I feel safe?

192
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
I am just afraid what it will feel like

193
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
when I float off my seat in the air when dropping.

194
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,840
I do worry too much, lol.

195
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,080
Seriously, I need help.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
Okay, wait.

197
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
We'll get to that in a second.

198
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
What does this person think that they are going to do

199
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
to help their mother's back while they're there?

200
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
Just hold the spine.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,760
Hold the spine upright while the drop is happening

202
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,000
and try to cushion the tailbone when the ground hits.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
I think it's wild that this is a ride

204
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,320
where you plummet 10 stories

205
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,320
and then come to an immediate zero miles an hour stop.

206
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
Yeah, by hitting the ground.

207
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
By hitting the ground, it's extremely dangerous.

208
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,760
And I guess, hey, you know what?

209
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,880
I just figured out where they get all the fucking ghosts from.

210
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,000
And it's the former writers of the ride.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,520
So it's cool that Disney World has two exits,

212
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,960
really, if you think about it.

213
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,440
The main one in front of Mickey's castle.

214
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,640
And then the Tower of Terror,

215
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,960
which is sort of a more permanent exit.

216
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,840
I'll tell you what not to do.

217
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,320
If you're asking me about Tower of Terror etiquette,

218
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
I can- Not etiquette.

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,240
Fear.

220
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,520
But I'm gonna tell you what not to do.

221
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,440
I went on the Tower of Terror, Teresa and I went,

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,080
and it kind of hovers at the top for a second

223
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,920
before plummeting to your death.

224
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,880
Hovers at the top.

225
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,760
And just before it dropped,

226
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,400
somebody let out a blood-curdling scream,

227
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,760
before it dropped.

228
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:40,800
And everybody's emotional ride was ruined by that.

229
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
Because everybody just turned around and went,

230
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,160
and then it dropped.

231
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,800
I thought you were gonna say

232
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,120
they let out a blood-curdling toot.

233
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
Which might be nice, actually,

234
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,520
because somebody toots and you're like,

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,480
oh, who did,

236
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,960
whoa, at least I'm falling out of the fart cloud.

237
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,460
Yeah.

238
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,040
So that could be something

239
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
you could be grateful for the drop,

240
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,880
because it's like,

241
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
oh, Mickey, get me out of this fart cloud.

242
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
It is Mickey, right, who does it,

243
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
pulls the drop lever?

244
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,840
Yeah.

245
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,600
He appears out of nowhere and is like,

246
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm here.

247
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
Goodbye.

248
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,460
You're fucked.

249
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,460
Peace out.

250
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
Hold on to your mom's back.

251
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
Don't forget to hold your mom's back.

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
Tootles, bring me the hemorrhoid donut.

253
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:29,920
Tootles, bring her mom's back.

254
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,280
I got this one wrong.

255
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,400
This is how I get my kicks.

256
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,480
Be careful.

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
My mom's spine telescoped on this one.

258
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,760
Now, which one was that?

259
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,040
Who was that, Griffin?

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
That was Donald.

261
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,080
Now, here's how Donald went.

262
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,960
Oh, please give me Donald.

263
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,520
That would be actually much scarier.

264
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,200
Oh my god, drop it, drop it, drop it.

265
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,680
I can't.

266
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,120
Kill me, kill me.

267
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
Escape Donald, the ride.

268
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,640
Is it possible to...

269
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Do you know what would make

270
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,320
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror

271
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
a hundred thousand times scarier?

272
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,120
What?

273
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
If one out of every 20 rides,

274
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
or maybe it's 50-50,

275
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
it just operates like a normal functioning elevator.

276
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,480
Ah, that would be good.

277
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,760
It takes you up to the top,

278
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,400
and then it's like, here we go.

279
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,760
And then it slowly lowers you back down to the ground.

280
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
And you get a little speech about expectations

281
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,200
and disappointment.

282
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,840
But then, you don't know which one you're gonna get, right?

283
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,600
I just made it scarier, they're not less scary,

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
which is what this person asked for.

285
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,240
Griffin, how about this, right?

286
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,520
50-50, one time it operates like a normal elevator,

287
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,880
which is it starts to drop,

288
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,200
but then it opens on like every other floor,

289
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,640
and someone goes, oh, you know what,

290
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,680
I'll get the next one.

291
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
And like, so it's just kind of like,

292
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
oh, we did, oh, oh.

293
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
And you keep thinking the drop is coming,

294
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,960
and just like Skrillex,

295
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,320
you gotta wait for that drop,

296
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
and it never comes.

297
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,080
Oh, I mean, I can't stop thinking of ways

298
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
to make it scarier,

299
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,920
but I'm thinking about my own

300
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
sort of real life elevator fears.

301
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
And obviously getting stuck is bad.

302
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
That's one way to make it scarier,

303
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
is if it also sometimes just like stopped.

304
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,720
But what if the doors open on one floor,

305
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
and there was a big family,

306
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,600
all with a bunch of suitcases,

307
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,880
and you knew they were gonna try

308
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,480
to all squeeze on the elevator.

309
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Oh, no.

310
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,960
Hey, listen to this one.

311
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,400
Listen to this joke I got.

312
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,040
All right.

313
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
What if on one floor it opened up,

314
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,320
and there was a guy, and he was in a suit,

315
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
and his suit just had a bunch of summer squashes on it,

316
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,280
and his name was Reginald Q. Summer Squash,

317
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,480
Summer Squash, and he kind of did his thing.

318
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,000
Now, what's his thing, Justin?

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,880
What's his thing, Juice?

320
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,920
Can you describe the...

321
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,480
Exactly.

322
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,640
Oh, okay.

323
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,840
He's his own thing.

324
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm really glad you said that, Justin,

325
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,880
because I was gonna make a goof

326
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,640
about like you're on the elevator,

327
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000
and you know you have to get somewhere important,

328
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
but a whole bunch of like people

329
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
that just got out of the pool,

330
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,480
and are still like dripping wet get on,

331
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,980
and you're trying.

332
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
But your thing about someone in a...

333
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
Let me get this again.

334
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
Summer Squash suit.

335
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,200
Was that it?

336
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,320
Now, is he by himself?

337
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,160
No, there are two sort of spooky entities with him

338
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,600
to be decided later.

339
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,840
I gotta say, this does remind me of Saturday Night Live bit.

340
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
Haven't seen it.

341
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,840
Yeah, well, it was very similar.

342
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,360
Go to bed early on Saturdays.

343
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,520
Typically got a newborn, so...

344
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,520
The bit was called Gilly.

345
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,600
Oh, okay.

346
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,880
Yeah, that was back before I had kids.

347
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,380
Gilly.

348
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,320
You unloved child.

349
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,800
I'll scoop up Gilly.

350
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,680
If no one else here will love the Gilly sketch,

351
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
I will take care of Gilly.

352
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,520
Please climb into my satchel, Gilly.

353
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,960
I'll carry you through the wasteland.

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,240
I'm here for you, the sketch, Gilly.

355
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
My favorite on Saturday Night Live

356
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,840
is when someone's doing an impression of somebody,

357
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,240
and that person actually shows up,

358
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
and it's so embarrassing.

359
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,840
How could you do this?

360
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,800
How did you not know that Hillary Clinton was right there?

361
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,600
You didn't know.

362
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
I'm right behind you.

363
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,960
Catherine McKinnon was doing an impression of her,

364
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,720
but then the actual Hillary showed up.

365
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
How awkward.

366
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
Catherine McKinnon, is she your third grade teacher?

367
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,520
Are you on that formal of a basis for this, McKinnon?

368
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,440
You think I'm just gonna be all chummy and be like,

369
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,200
yo, Kate, what's up, buddy?

370
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,760
Special K.

371
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,520
How about a question?

372
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,200
I recently made some new acquaintances

373
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,280
who live just a few blocks away from me.

374
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,120
My friend and I were recently at their place

375
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,560
working on a project,

376
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,400
and we commented on their beautiful enclosed porch,

377
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,360
to which they replied,

378
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
oh yeah, you're free to use it anytime,

379
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,400
even if we're not at home.

380
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
I was shocked by this offer,

381
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
but laughed it off as if they're just joking.

382
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
However, my friend said she planned to drop by

383
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,200
and knit on their porch later this week

384
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
when they are at work.

385
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,920
Am I right in not hanging out in the home of someone

386
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
I don't know very well when they are not there,

387
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
or am I missing out?

388
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,280
That's from porch squatter in Portland.

389
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
This is unacceptable.

390
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,600
It's clearly unacceptable

391
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
because we could get into a debate

392
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,880
about where does house start?

393
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,080
For me, I feel uncomfortable walking in front

394
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,240
of people's houses on the sidewalk sometimes

395
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,760
because if their kids go out there

396
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
and do chalk drawings on it,

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,280
that's house, baby.

398
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,680
I sometimes feel weird driving by a house

399
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
and looking at it too long.

400
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,960
Mm, yeah.

401
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,520
And then your little gold tooth shines and sparkles

402
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,840
because you're planning to steal all their treasures.

403
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,920
Oh, the idea of someone,

404
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,760
I just feel 24 seven,

405
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,920
someone assumes I'm casing the joint.

406
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,480
Yeah, for sure.

407
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,840
So I think we could get into a debate

408
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,760
about if porch is house,

409
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,680
except for the fact that it is an enclosed porch.

410
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
When you put walls around it,

411
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,760
hey gang, when you put walls around it,

412
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,440
that's a house, baby.

413
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,240
This is true.

414
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Think about the difference

415
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
between garage and driveway, right?

416
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
That is basically driveway outside,

417
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,640
garage inside.

418
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,920
That's a house.

419
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
And now that's a house.

420
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,240
If I took my kitchen and did sort of a open concept,

421
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,680
that's not what the term traditionally means,

422
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,520
but I knocked down all the walls in the kitchen

423
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,960
and put up screens instead

424
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,320
so that everybody could smell all the great pies

425
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
and cookies I'm always making,

426
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,560
then that's still house.

427
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,600
Do you know what I mean?

428
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
You can't just go in someone's house

429
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,400
when they're not there.

430
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
End of discussion, it feels like, right?

431
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Is there a discussion to be had?

432
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
You do have the direct,

433
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,440
the person did directly say,

434
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,280
feel free to use my porch whenever.

435
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,680
I did do this in college though.

436
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,480
I would go to Jason Eldridge's house

437
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
and we would all sit on his porch and use his grill.

438
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,240
Even if he wasn't at home, and he was always at home,

439
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,280
so this is theoretical,

440
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
but if he wasn't at home,

441
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,440
if he was at Arby's or Office Depot or something,

442
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,800
then we would just sit on his porch.

443
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
But I was younger then.

444
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
It was a different time.

445
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,880
I think there's an exception to be carved out

446
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,560
for weed and EverQuest dens,

447
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,840
which is kind of what Jason's house was,

448
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
I feel like, for you guys.

449
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,400
At that point, it's more of a community space.

450
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
It's more of like a neighbor.

451
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
It's like 18 to 24,

452
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,400
what we would traditionally think out of as a hangout.

453
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,160
Yeah, it's your peach pit.

454
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,320
Rather than like somebody's family home.

455
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,840
Yes, it's a non-starter.

456
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,960
Let me hit you with this,

457
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,680
how do you guarantee that they're not home?

458
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,440
Because you gotta be sure.

459
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm talking about you,

460
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,680
you need to break and enter first just to make sure nobody's home,

461
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,920
and then lock the doors up as you're leaving,

462
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,200
and then you can hang out on the porch,

463
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
because can you imagine hanging out on the porch,

464
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
and then somebody walks outside like,

465
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,800
what the fuck are you doing?

466
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,080
I'd rather have that than for me to be sitting on the porch

467
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
and somebody comes home from work

468
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
and they've had like a terrible day at work,

469
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
or like their boss yelled at them,

470
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,280
and they didn't get their shit done,

471
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,160
and it's just like,

472
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,880
hey buddy, just me reading on your porch, drinking some lemonade.

473
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,320
You sure do look rough.

474
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
And it's just like, get the fuck out of here.

475
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
This is my fucking castle.

476
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Eventually, you're right, Travis,

477
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,760
if you do this every day,

478
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
eventually there will come a day

479
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
when they're like, get off my porch.

480
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
I need this porch today.

481
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
This is important right now.

482
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
Did you schedule this?

483
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,760
I hung up a thing and it says mine on every day.

484
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,480
Get out.

485
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,760
That's the reason I get it.

486
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,720
Every day, get out, the reason I couldn't do this

487
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
is because it's not in my house.

488
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
I'm like a toddler with the number of accessories

489
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,840
that I require.

490
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,120
What if I got there and I realized that my Pepsi Max,

491
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,040
because it was in a useless 20 ounce plastic bottle,

492
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
got warm because all plastic bottles do instantly

493
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
the second you take them out of refrigeration.

494
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,160
It got warm and now I have a warm drink.

495
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,800
What do I do now?

496
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,080
Well, I guess I drive home.

497
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,840
I guess now I have to get in my car

498
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,960
and drive back to my house.

499
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,640
Also, the problem is that they invited you to use the porch.

500
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,560
So if you don't use the porch, it's gonna be rude.

501
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,680
You gotta do something pretty heinous on that porch

502
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,000
to get that invite revoked.

503
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,360
Do you know what I mean?

504
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,320
And then you won't have this problem anymore.

505
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,440
So I don't know what that looks like.

506
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
I don't know if that means leaving a bunch of ham slices

507
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,000
all over.

508
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
I don't know if it means leaving a bunch of roast beef slices

509
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,000
all over.

510
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,560
I don't know if it means hiding pepperonis.

511
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,360
Unless.

512
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,520
Unless.

513
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,020
Unless.

514
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,360
Unless you start making improvements to the porch

515
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,520
because Justin's made me think like maybe you set up

516
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
like a mini fridge out there, right?

517
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,320
You make enough improvements until now it's fair use

518
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,360
and it's your porch.

519
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,240
It's our porch.

520
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,160
I've remixed it fair use.

521
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,760
It's a fair use porch.

522
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,560
Yeah.

523
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,360
That could be good.

524
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,800
What if you buy me a mini fridge I hate

525
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,920
and then I can't just,

526
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,240
I was gonna get a mini fridge next week.

527
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,880
Now you've bought me one I hate and I can't justify it.

528
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm stuck with this one.

529
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,320
It's got room for half a Coke.

530
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,520
The other half sticks out the top of it.

531
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,920
It only cools the bottom half of the can of Coke.

532
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,960
Why did you get this terrible fridge?

533
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,800
It was on sale.

534
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,040
There's three baby teeth in it.

535
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,600
Like what?

536
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,320
Does this use?

537
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Was this someone who was storing baby teeth in?

538
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,680
It only cools half a Coke?

539
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,280
Maytag has a new fridge

540
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,040
and they put the baby teeth right in there

541
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,080
because it's supposedly soaked up the stink really good.

542
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,840
I don't know if you ever smelled the baby tooth before

543
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,000
but good God.

544
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Yeah, it's rough.

545
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,400
This Yahoo was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

546
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,960
Thank you, Graham.

547
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,640
It's Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks,

548
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,720
how do you, let me read a voice.

549
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,640
How do you eat a hot dog in a fancy way?

550
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,560
And then there's a picture of a hot dog.

551
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,960
Just for reference?

552
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,240
Yeah, it's a big Frank, big thick Frank.

553
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,120
Big Francis.

554
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,040
With a line of mustard on it.

555
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,720
How do you, excuse me.

556
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,960
I'm going to the marina later

557
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,440
and some of my fellow business,

558
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,840
I don't even know what like fancy people sound like.

559
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,240
Maybe it's like Downton Abbey,

560
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,960
but an episode where they all crush some dogs.

561
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,680
You know what I mean?

562
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,040
So like Matthew comes in, he's like,

563
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,120
Uncle, look what I've discovered from the Americas.

564
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,680
They're like our sausages,

565
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,160
but they don't taste like any sort of discernible thing.

566
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
They call them wieners.

567
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
They call them wieners like a dick, uncle.

568
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,880
So I've invited the Duchess over for dogs

569
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,200
and I'm trying to figure out how not to get mustard

570
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,280
on my fancy boy gloves.

571
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,240
And I tried biting into one of them

572
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,840
and it expressed a juice

573
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,240
that managed to get all over my frock.

574
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,320
And so uncle, uncle, help me eat the hot dog in a fancy way.

575
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,360
There's no scene in Downton Abbey

576
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,120
that would not be improved by one or more of the characters

577
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,640
enjoying a hot dog as it continued.

578
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,960
What if just once there was a really dramatic thing,

579
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,400
you've lost it all, how could,

580
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,560
and as it panned across there's just a servant

581
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,600
sitting in a chair and he's eating a hot dog

582
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,360
just as it like just kind of goes past in a tracking shot.

583
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,560
And you're just like, wait, hold on.

584
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,600
Is that the under butler just eating a hot dog?

585
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,080
I think that guy's eating a hot,

586
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,360
is Lady Crawley eating, oh my God, it's a hot dog.

587
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,240
She's got like five of them on a paper plate.

588
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,160
That's the episode.

589
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,760
She's an American.

590
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,800
And so she can eat the dogs and bring them all in

591
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,440
and she'll be like, oh, you guys are gonna love this.

592
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,040
I don't know, it looks like one of our sausages,

593
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,400
but it stinks a lot.

594
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,880
She's got like a paper plate of hot dogs

595
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,840
and like a two liter of like store brand root beer.

596
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
And like that's it.

597
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,400
That's it.

598
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,800
And then maybe the servants are all eating it

599
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,480
and all the rich people are like,

600
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,280
I would never eat the hot dog.

601
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,600
A hot dog, how could you?

602
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,240
You've heated the dog, it stinks so bad.

603
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,880
Why do I wanna eat it and watch baseball?

604
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
And then they all do.

605
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,480
And then they're like, you know what, pores?

606
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,200
Maybe we have more in common than I initially thought.

607
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,440
Now hand me a, do we drink the hot dog water?

608
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,680
What do we do with the water left over from the hot dogs?

609
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,600
Bring me more tubular meat.

610
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,960
Give me a split bun and some tubular meat.

611
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,200
And then they decide that only they can have hot dogs

612
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,520
and they don't let the servants have them anymore

613
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,400
because now they're-

614
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,720
You can have this lobster and filet mignon.

615
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,120
Give me another one of those round boys.

616
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,200
And then there's an episode

617
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,480
because Lord Grantham is only eating hot dogs

618
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,600
and it's been three weeks.

619
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,320
He just loves them so much

620
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,360
but it's the only thing he'll put into his body

621
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,520
so that he's become wracked with illness.

622
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,040
And then World War II happens.

623
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,440
And then there's no more hot dogs.

624
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,280
They gotta send all their hot dogs to hands.

625
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,840
To the war effort.

626
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,360
The Titanic sank.

627
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,480
There were 20 tons of hot dogs on the Titanic.

628
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,160
No.

629
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,000
Did someone think of the hot dogs?

630
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,200
All of those round boys at the bottom of the ocean

631
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,040
getting eaten by those fish.

632
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,360
How much better would Titanic have been

633
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,080
if at the end an old woman threw a hot dog into the ocean

634
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,440
and you watched it for 40 minutes

635
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,440
as it disintegrated in the water

636
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,640
and then it sunk and it landed on the jewel of the ocean,

637
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,440
the heart of the ocean.

638
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
How do you eat a hot dog in a fancy way?

639
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,360
If I ever saw somebody with a knife and fork

640
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
I would call the police.

641
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,680
So that's out.

642
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,120
So that's out.

643
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,480
I think you dip it in water to help you eat it faster.

644
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,360
That's what Kobayashi-

645
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,080
I'm sorry.

646
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,400
You've watched Joey Chestnut do his work

647
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,000
and then you thought,

648
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,640
wow, what a fancy fucking gentleman.

649
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,840
What a fancy bully.

650
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,320
You've thought that.

651
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,280
That's the thing.

652
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,400
Think this way Griffin, right?

653
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,480
Have you ever been impressed by someone eating hot dogs

654
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,640
outside of a hot dog eating competition?

655
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,160
No, but I've never watched a hot dog eating competition

656
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,600
and thought anybody there was fancy in any way.

657
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,560
Well, it depends on how you define fancy, doesn't it?

658
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,920
Because yeah, if you're talking fucking Downton Abbey, no.

659
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,800
But if you're talking like skateboard trick fancy?

660
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
If there's no fancy way to eat a hot dog,

661
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,360
then the best you can do is get it over with

662
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,520
quickly so you have more time for like cotillion classes

663
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,840
or what the fuck ever fancy people did.

664
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,400
I see.

665
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
So if you blaze through the dogs,

666
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,200
then it's like you have plenty of time to go like,

667
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,880
you know, polish your shoes or-

668
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,440
Yes.

669
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,680
If you pair the hot dog eating with a fancy thing.

670
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,160
Why?

671
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,960
If you, oh.

672
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,560
Hot dog, why?

673
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,060
Why?

674
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Why?

675
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,260
Okay, so-

676
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,540
The meat might not be fancy, but boy, this-

677
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,780
Name a wine, name a wine, name any wine.

678
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,220
The Chardonnay that we-

679
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,420
You pair it with Chardonnay.

680
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,580
You would not, oh, hot dog with Chardonnay, Justin.

681
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,860
I just wanted to say, I Googled hot dog wine

682
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,020
and the top result is the Marshall Hall of Fame Cafe

683
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,220
in Huntington, Virginia.

684
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,140
I don't know if they have a dish.

685
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,500
Don't boil it in water.

686
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,860
Boil it in wine.

687
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,940
Boil those wieners in wine.

688
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,300
Make them wine-ers.

689
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,620
Oh, these Franks will get you fucked, dog.

690
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,220
Oh my God.

691
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,260
These are Griffin McElroy's 100% alcoholic hot dogs.

692
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,540
You're going to love these.

693
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,340
I bet the Dave Matthews Band wine pairs really nicely

694
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,140
with a hot dog.

695
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,660
If you're going to Frank down,

696
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,260
I think maybe have some of the Dave Matthews Band wine.

697
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,220
That would be so good.

698
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,820
Or maybe some of Sting's wine.

699
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,460
Yeah.

700
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,380
Wait, can we go back to the Dave Matthews Band wine?

701
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,900
Cause I just got there and it's,

702
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,660
it'll drink you under the table and dreaming.

703
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,140
Thank you.

704
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,700
There it is.

705
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,780
Yeah, it took me a second, but I wanted to circle back.

706
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,820
Okay, good job.

707
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,220
Those are many fancy ways of being a hot dog.

708
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,540
And now I would welcome you all right this way.

709
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,780
Through the adjoining chamber into here, the money zone.

710
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,780
For cigars and brandy and hot dogs.

711
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,100
I want to tell you about Casper.

712
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,220
Then do it, coward.

713
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,580
Casper, one, supports my brother, my brother and me,

714
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,020
but also supports you while you sleep.

715
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,380
I have a Casper mattress.

716
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,700
I have a Casper mattress, I sleep on it.

717
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,580
When I, this is very good.

718
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,340
Yeah, listen, this is not a joke.

719
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,020
When we tour, I love getting out there,

720
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,620
seeing the fans, doing our goofs, hitting the road.

721
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,740
But you know what I don't love?

722
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,460
Being away from my Casper mattress.

723
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,820
Now here's the thing you're thinking.

724
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,060
Oh, this sounds too good to be true.

725
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,460
It must be super expensive.

726
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,340
No, no, no.

727
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,300
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out

728
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,780
the middleman and sells directly to the consumer.

729
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,260
It's a great deal and a great mattress.

730
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,300
They combine multiple supportive memory phones

731
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,700
for a quality sleep service with the right amount.

732
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,140
And you're thinking, oh, what?

733
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,980
Right amount of sink or bounce?

734
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,380
No, no, no, both sink and bounce.

735
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,540
And you can be sure of your purchase

736
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,700
because Casper is 100 night risk-free sleep audit trial.

737
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,580

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,020
Can I tell you about Audible?

745
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,100
Do you use Audible as much as I do?

746
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,980
Because I use it.

747
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,860
I use it more.

748
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,140
I probably use it most.

749
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,100
How much do you use it?

750
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,540
Go ahead, Justin.

751
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,900
I love Audible.

752
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,660
They have lots of books that you can listen to

753
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,460
and it's much better than podcasts

754
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
because at the end of listening to a podcast,

755
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,060
you're like, uh, fine.

756
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,260
At the end of listening to a book,

757
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,460
you're like, I'm better.

758
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,940
I've grown.

759
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,180
I'm a better person now.

760
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,500
Audible has an unmatched selection of audiobook

761
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,340
and spoken word audio products.

762
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,100
Audible is the internet's leading provider

763
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,700
of spoken word entertainment.

764
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,180
They're great for helping you be a better you

765
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,460
whether you wanna feel healthier,

766
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,340
get motivated or learn something new.

767
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,460
Our listeners might enjoy,

768
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,860
what am I listening to right now?

769
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,260
I don't know.

770
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,580
You just set up that reading books makes you better

771
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,380
and so good luck.

772
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,980
Can you find one?

773
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,100
Well, I just wanted to pick one to highlight.

774
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,620
I know, but it's gotta be a book

775
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,740
that when you read it, it makes you better.

776
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,980
You know what's so good that I just finished actually?

777
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,420
Jake Gyllenhaal reads The Great Gatsby.

778
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,620
So good.

779
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,540
He does an amazing reading of it.

780
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,140
I read it.

781
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,580
Did I read it just so I could listen

782
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,500
to the book club episode of A Flow for the Magic Tower?

783
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,020
No, yes.

784
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,660
But Jake Gyllenhaal does a magnificent job with that.

785
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,980
Can I recommend one?

786
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,220
Yeah.

787
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:43,180
I really liked Vincent D'Onofrio reads Guy Fieri Family Food

788
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,460
125 Real Deal Recipes Kitchen Tested Home Approved.

789
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,420
Man, Griffin, I gotta go get a fucking towel

790
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
to clean my computer, you dick.

791
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,060
You got him.

792
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,940
Let me recommend a whole bunch.

793
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,340
I recommend Stiff, The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers

794
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,140
by Mary Roach.

795
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,260
It's very educational.

796
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,220
Allison Rosen just put out a book

797
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,460
that's about tropical attire encouraged

798
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,740
and other phrases that scare me.

799
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,620
It's very good.

800
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,860
I just accidentally played it.

801
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,420
And you can find basically, I think,

802
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,580
all of the Poirot novels or the Agatha Christie's Poirot novels

803
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:26,220
read by Hugh Frazier, who was in the Poirot Masterpiece Theater series.

804
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,500
It's really good.

805
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,380
Highly recommend.

806
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,060
I actually have another.

807
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,700
I have a real one.

808
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,500
Hey, literally, time out.

809
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,700
Stop the show, because I have to stop this recording

810
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,940
so I can clean my computer.

811
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,340
Oh, God, Justin.

812
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,700
Because it's fucking covered in coffee.

813
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,740
Because you're dumb ass dumb garbage.

814
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
I actually, I have a real recommendation

815
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,660
if I can do it real quick, because my other one was a joke.

816
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,300
But I think the audible would appreciate it more

817
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
if I gave a real recommendation.

818
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,580
Now, we just stopped for five minutes

819
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,540
so I could clean my stuff.

820
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,740
No, this one's not a joke.

821
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,460
This one's not a joke.

822
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,660
So it's not going to make you laugh so hard

823
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,140
you spill your coffee.

824
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,820
So it's OK for me to go ahead and get some coffee.

825
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,300
Yeah, get a big sip.

826
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,420
I'm just getting some coffee here.

827
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,340
Yeah, a big sip and hold it in your hands.

828
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,060
So what I want to recommend is actually,

829
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,820
so Maggie Smith from Downton Abbey,

830
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,260
it's funny we were just talking about it,

831
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,660
did a reading of Guy Fieri Family Food,

832
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,100
125 Real Deal Recipes Kitchen Test at Home Proved.

833
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,300
That was really good.

834
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,700
And she reads it.

835
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,020
The trash can nachos will move you to tears and diarrhea.

836
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,620
OK, let's end on a real one,

837
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,380
because I was really excited when I found this.

838
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,740
The Series of Unfortunate Events series.

839
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,100
Read by Guy Fieri.

840
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,660
It's really good.

841
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,180
As read by Tim Curry.

842
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,380
Oh, that's even better.

843
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,260
Yeah, is that real?

844
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,540
Yeah, it rules.

845
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,060

or text my brother to 500-500 to get started.

850
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,140
And I read that last bit,

851
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,340
so I think Travis should read the first Jumbotron here.

852
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,460
OK, this is for Joe, and it's from Candace.

853
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,740
Hi, boobles.

854
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,620
Yeah, that's right.

855
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,140
I said boobles.

856
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,740
I'm sending my message of love

857
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,860
and caring out on the airways for the cutest babe ever.

858
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,620
Love, your sweet, sweet girlfriend, Candace.

859
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,780
Um.

860
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,900
Deal with it.

861
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,700
Deal with it.

862
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,580
Handle it.

863
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,660
Why did I take such an aggressive tone?

864
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:20,940
I don't know.

865
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,140
Boobles read with that, and now I've said it.

866
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,780
But read with that sort of that fury, that passion.

867
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,860
It was really something to behold.

868
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,940
I think maybe it's a that's right,

869
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,020
because it kind of reads as if someone just said,

870
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,900
what did you say?

871
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,060
And I was like, yeah, that's right.

872
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,260
I heard you reading that, Travis.

873
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,980
I thought, this is the episode that's gonna get us the webby.

874
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,020
Here's a Yahoo.

875
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,660
Nope.

876
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,260
Here's a Jumbotron.

877
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,400
Yeah.

878
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,780
Here's a Jumbotron for Zach, and it's from Fred the Human,

879
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,820
Kaz, Elden Toss Cobble, Donara, Nethgoria, RIP,

880
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,660
and Morniel, who say, this is the unskippable cut scene

881
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,700
where you get a Jumbotron,

882
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,540
so don't jump in a portable hole

883
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,140
and fly away on a spectral horse.

884
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,660
What's this?

885
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,860
What are they talking about?

886
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,980
It's so fanciful.

887
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,220
A portable hole?

888
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,380
It's magic and fanciful.

889
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,620
I feel like I'm in a real Harry Potter book.

890
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,540
Thanks for putting up with us

891
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,980
and for introducing most of us to D&D and Taz.

892
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,740
Happy whatever holiday is closest

893
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,260
to when the McElroys read this.

894
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,300
So Earth Day.

895
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,100
Welcome to Earth.

896
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,700
Welcome to Earth.

897
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,200
Day.

898
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,320
Day.

899
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,900
What if he had said that?

900
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,660
Because it was Earth Day when it happened.

901
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,540
Welcome to Earth Day.

902
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,140
Welcome to Earth Day.

903
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,420
Or what if he had punched me and said,

904
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,620
like, welcome to Good Burger.

905
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,860
Home of the Good Burger.

906
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,460
What if you kissed him instead?

907
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,300
I have something I'd like you two to read.

908
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,580
It's called What If You Kissed Him Instead.

909
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,620
Let me do this one.

910
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,300
This is for Ryan W. and Josie G. from Alphazor.

911
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,460
Josie, you almost crashed a car

912
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,860
because the tower was too dang tall

913
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,500
and then you used Shelby's towel.

914
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,900
I hope no student of yours, yo, teaches you

915
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,100
and I'm lucky to be your friend.

916
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,220
Happy B-day.

917
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,100
Ryan, happy B-day

918
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,460
and thanks for being such a great brother.

919
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,340
I'm really proud of you

920
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,540
and I love you a lot.

921
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,940
I just wish you listened to my bim bam

922
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,420
so you could hear it.

923
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,340
Just shouting into the void.

924
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,300
Just screaming at the night sky.

925
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,800
Brother!

926
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,000
Brother!

927
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,300
I communicate to you through podcasts.

928
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,100
You don't listen to.

929
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,180
Welcome everyone to the live wrestling

930
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,260
spectacular in Los Angeles.

931
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,260
So far the world's most boring wrestling

932
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,980
podcast has been destroying the competition.

933
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,140
Isn't there anyone who can save us

934
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,740
from this travesty?

935
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,660
Wait, could it be?

936
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,940
It's tights and fights.

937
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,700
The perfect wrestling podcast.

938
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
Tights and fights is here to save us

939
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,620
from the monotony of boring wrestling podcasts

940
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,300
with hilarious conversations.

941
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,340
Woke trips through the history of wrestling.

942
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,100
And joke about the finer points

943
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,940
of people wearing spandex.

944
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,780
What a match!

945
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,220
And the tights and fights podcast

946
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,660
will be back every week.

947
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,060
Thursdays on Maximumfun.org

948
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,060
or wherever you get podcasts.

949
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,060
Please, these hosts have families.

950
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
Tights and fights.

951
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
Podcast.

952
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:20,060
Tights and fights.

953
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,020
Excuse me, gentlemen.

954
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,300
I have a game.

955
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,100
A very fun game.

956
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,060
Is it a new bit?

957
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,060
It's a new bit.

958
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,020
It's a new game.

959
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,780
I think we can only play it once.

960
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,140
I don't know if it's going to be recurring.

961
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,340
It might, you know what?

962
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,540
We could probably play it more than once.

963
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,620
I am going to give you-

964
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,860
Do you think Ellen said the same thing?

965
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,220
Like, I've got-

966
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,020
I'm gonna dance.

967
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,100
I've got this, I'm gonna dance once.

968
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,100
We'll see.

969
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,380
You think Jimmy Fallon was like,

970
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,620
I'm gonna do a game with you,

971
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,140
Dwayne, the Rock Johnson,

972
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,580
but this is the only one.

973
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,820
So don't ask me to do any more games.

974
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,220
No, this is a game that I'm going to play with you.

975
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,140
I'm going to play with you.

976
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,140
This is called Celebrity Wine, Why Not?

977
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,900
Okay.

978
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,740
That's the name of the game is Celebrity Wine, Why Not?

979
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,460
Okay.

980
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,020
And you can spell it however you think is like funniest.

981
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,980
I'm not a big pun guy,

982
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,500
but I'm going to name some celebrity wines

983
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,060
and their score from Wine Enthusiast.

984
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,700
Their rating from Wine Enthusiast.

985
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,900
What's that scale go up to, 100?

986
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,860
It is a scale of 100 and like straight.

987
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,300
I'm just going to be straight with you.

988
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,660
There is no wine on this that rates below 82 points.

989
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,100
Oh, okay.

990
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,140
So it's like 82 to 100.

991
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,900
How bad do you think your wine would have to be

992
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,020
to get like a one?

993
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,580
Would it just be like water and like dirty water?

994
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,100
I think Coke Zero gets a one, not wine.

995
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,340
To give you some sense of what we're talking about,

996
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,460
how limited the scale is here,

997
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,340
we're actually talking about 82 to 95 is the scale.

998
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,180
If it's 82, it fucking sucks.

999
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,380
Like we can all agree they're on the video game review scale.

1000
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,620
If it's an 82, it's fucking garbage.

1001
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,100
So I'm going to have you, here's the game.

1002
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,300
I'm going to give you a,

1003
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,220
I have a list of celebrities

1004
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,100
that I'm going to share with you boys right now.

1005
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,340
And you are going to be able to pull from this list.

1006
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,580
We're not going to share this with the audience

1007
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,700
so they can get,

1008
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,180
it'll be a little bit more out of left field for them.

1009
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,820
I think.

1010
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,500
So I'm sharing this list with you

1011
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,100
and these are all the celebrities

1012
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,540
that are in my list here.

1013
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,820
So I am going to tell you the name of the wine.

1014
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,220
You're going to tell me the celebrity

1015
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,460
and then you're going to guess the score.

1016
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,020
The score.

1017
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,740
Okay, okay.

1018
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,300
Yes.

1019
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,100
Are you ready?

1020
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,420
Yes.

1021
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,780
Some of these will be easier than others.

1022
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,300
The name of this wine is 2007 Discovery Series Chardonnay.

1023
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,380
That's Mike Ditkas.

1024
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:59,580
It's not Mike Ditkas wine.

1025
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,140
My Ditkas football touchdown juice.

1026
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,740
I'm going to say Drew Barrymore.

1027
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,140
It does.

1028
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,340
You're both incorrect.

1029
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,700
It's Dan Aykroyd.

1030
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,020
Damn.

1031
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,980
Dan Aykroyd made the 2007 Discovery Series Chardonnay

1032
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,020
from Sonoma County.

1033
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,460
Wine Enthusiast gave it a,

1034
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,820
I'm going to say,

1035
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,980
I'm going to say 83.

1036
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,380
Not good.

1037
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,180
87.

1038
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,020
Holy shit.

1039
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,580
Griffin McElroy, 83 points.

1040
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,500
It's one step above toilet wine.

1041
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:25,900
It is.

1042
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,340
83 exactly.

1043
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,740
Booyah.

1044
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,580
You got the exact right thing.

1045
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,460
So guessed it.

1046
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,820
So where'd he go wrong?

1047
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,900
What'd he do bad to get there?

1048
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,020
It's tart and jammy with acidic one-dimensional flavors

1049
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,260
of pineapples, vanillas, and butterscotch.

1050
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,380
Now I will say this.

1051
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,700
I don't think if you're,

1052
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,740
I don't want to call Wine Enthusiast on their bullshit,

1053
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,220
but you can't say it's got one-dimensional flavors

1054
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,060
of pineapples, vanilla, and butterscotch

1055
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,980
because it sounds like Dan has summed it up

1056
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,020
at least three discrete flavors there.

1057
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,900
But they don't have distance, Justin.

1058
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,060
It's like two different pineapples.

1059
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,100
Like, fuck you guys.

1060
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,980
Seriously.

1061
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,100
With the 83 though,

1062
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,940
it sounds like my boy Dan took some pineapples

1063
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,100
and like vanilla pudding and butterscotch,

1064
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,420
blended it all up in a food processor,

1065
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,980
and then dumped that into some three buck chuck.

1066
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,820
83, are you fucking kidding me?

1067
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,820
And 83 betwixt these lips?

1068
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,780
No way.

1069
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,340
No, no way.

1070
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,980
We have standards.

1071
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,020
Okay, this, I want to do an easier one.

1072
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,300
Number 99 Icewine Cabernet Franc.

1073
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,060
Number 99 Icewine, you say?

1074
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,460
Number 99 Icewine Cabernet Franc.

1075
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,780
Oh, this is Mr. Jeffrey Gordon.

1076
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,100
I would also say Jeffrey Gordon.

1077
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,900
No, it's Wayne Gretzky.

1078
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,420
Oh, is that his number?

1079
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,300
Icewine.

1080
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,540
Yeah.

1081
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,740
Yeah, didn't see that name on the list.

1082
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,700
Yeah, now name me the score that Wayne got for his wine he did.

1083
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,900
I'm going to say 99.

1084
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,620
Oh, that's perfect.

1085
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,300
I'm actually going to say 89.

1086
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,380
Wayne got 92 points from one and two.

1087
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,380
This is very good ice wine.

1088
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,340
Holy shit.

1089
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,100
Wayne, you shouldn't have.

1090
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,300
A medium cherry in color with notes of raspberry jam.

1091
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,100
Wet stone.

1092
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,260
Tastes like a wet rock.

1093
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,980
I love it.

1094
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,180
93 points.

1095
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:19,900
Hey, Wayne, your wine tastes like wet rocks and ba-da-ba-ba-ba.

1096
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,780
I'm loving it.

1097
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,540
Thank you, Wayne.

1098
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,580
2014 Casa de Metz.

1099
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,500
Thompson Grenache from Santa Barbara County.

1100
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,460
If it's Santa Barbara, I do think this one's Drew Barrymore.

1101
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,500
I think it's Drew Barrymore.

1102
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:44,940
It's Emilio Estevez's Casa de Metz 2014 Thompson Grenache from Santa Barbara County.

1103
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,460
Wine Enthusiast gives it a...

1104
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,060
94.

1105
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,820
86.

1106
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,540
92 points for Emilio.

1107
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,020
The bottling shows very fresh cherry juice and dried roses,

1108
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,380
as well as inviting splashes of Dr. Pepper cola nut.

1109
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,820
Hold on.

1110
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,460
Hi, I'm a professional wine critic, and this tastes like Dr. Pepper.

1111
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,420
Hold on.

1112
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,180
Who the doctor is in this bottle?

1113
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,220
Let's do one more.

1114
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Let's do the highest.

1115
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,060
No, I don't want to give that away.

1116
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,420
Here's one.

1117
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,220
2014.

1118
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,580
One more?

1119
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,460
One more again?

1120
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,620
And what's the city of origin?

1121
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,980
I'm going to tell you...

1122
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,700
Oh, it's Pinot Noir.

1123
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,300
Vin de France.

1124
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,140
French.

1125
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,740
Chateau de Thigne 2014.

1126
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,020
And the name of the person is actually in this wine,

1127
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,740
so I can't read the whole name of the wine because that would be cheating.

1128
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,700
Okay, so...

1129
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,260
One more time.

1130
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:51,900
Mike Dicke.

1131
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,180
The name of it?

1132
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,180
Chateau de Thigne.

1133
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,300
It's Drew Bledsoe's Chateau de Thigne.

1134
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,420
Chateau de Thigne.

1135
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,380
I'm going to say...

1136
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,860
Wait, can I change wine?

1137
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,220
I'm going to say Gérard Depardieu.

1138
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,980
I'm going to guess Bas Skagg.

1139
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:14,060
It is Chateau de Thigne 2014, Gérard Depardieu, Pinot Noir, Vin de France.

1140
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,420
Wine Enthusiast gives it a...

1141
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,500
87.

1142
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,020
82.

1143
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,580
Holy shit, Travis McElroy.

1144
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,780
87 points with its attractive red fruit flavors.

1145
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,700
This is a light perfumed wine.

1146
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,460
Travis just got the name of Gérard Depardieu's wine as well as the exact score.

1147
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,380
I don't know if we'll bring this back.

1148
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,380
What's Bas Skagg's fucking wine called?

1149
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,100
I need to know.

1150
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,340
No, I need to know the band Trane's wine.

1151
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,180
Bas Skagg's...

1152
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,460
Skagg's Vineyard.

1153
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,380
It sounds like a fucking, like...

1154
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,500
Like a zone in a post-apocalyptic game.

1155
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,180
2008 Montage GSM, so it's a blend.

1156
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,100
Uh, I bet that means...

1157
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,900
I don't actually know.

1158
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,620
Bas Skagg's Leftovers.

1159
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,180
I didn't finish these bottles, so I put them all in one.

1160
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,180
You see a bottle on the shelf.

1161
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,780
It says Skagg's Vineyard.

1162
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,820
You open it up.

1163
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,540
And it's 2008.

1164
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,340
You open it up.

1165
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,340
You taste it.

1166
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,100
What kind of score are you going to give it?

1167
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,020
I know it's not on the scale, but 74.

1168
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,580
Travis?

1169
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,460
93.

1170
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,540
Well, boys, it is a 95.

1171
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,260
The highest rated wine we have.

1172
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,380
The greatest celebrity wine is from Bas Skagg's.

1173
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,860
It's a rave for wine enthusiasts.

1174
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,500
That's extraordinarily decadent.

1175
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,580
Monteverde, Ganache, and Syrah blend.

1176
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,300
So it is a blend.

1177
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,180
Good for me.

1178
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:44,860
Currently among the best in California from Bas Skagg's.

1179
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,180
Wow.

1180
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,860
The best at wine, the best at playing Lido shuffle.

1181
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,900
Bas Skagg's.

1182
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,400
Wow.

1183
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,500
Okay, give me the band Trane's wine, Justin.

1184
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,820
I would, Travis.

1185
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,900
But I care about you too much to give you the band Trane's wine.

1186
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,980
Because it is, let's see.

1187
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,860
Can I guess?

1188
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,420
Can I guess?

1189
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,860
It's going to be so much better.

1190
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,380
Is it drops of juniper?

1191
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:15,820
No, it's Save Me San Francisco is the wine from the band Trane.

1192
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,460
That, of course, is named after a song that they did.

1193
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,060
And it's actually an album.

1194
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,620
So they did the album and a song.

1195
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,860
And is it an 82, Justin?

1196
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,540
And I guess it's a wine as well.

1197
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,860
It's 86 points.

1198
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:38,060
The San Francisco-based Roots Rockers have a whole line of wines based on their songs.

1199
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,020
There's also a petite Syrah called drops of Jupiter.

1200
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,060
Okay, that's fine.

1201
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,900
The wine is dry with a hint of oaky vanilla and buttered toast.

1202
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,180
So that's the band Trane's wine.

1203
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:49,740
It's very good.

1204
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,940
I don't think I'd ever want to drink wine and be like, mm, toast.

1205
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,020
Yum, it's just like toast.

1206
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,500
Yeah, I don't want to drink wine that came out of the brain of Trane.

1207
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,780
The Trane brain.

1208
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,740
Can I read this Yahoo?

1209
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,220
I know it's time for a question, but the Yahoos are so good.

1210
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,420
Yeah, please.

1211
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,860
This one's sent in by Steven Titus.

1212
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,780
It's Yahoo Answers user, sorry, something's gone wrong.

1213
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,260
Call them.

1214
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:21,180
Hmm, Boz asks, how do you describe taking out five blades out of your chest in a book?

1215
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,980
Like one of my main characters in the book has got stabbed with five blades in his chest

1216
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,780
at the same time.

1217
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:32,140
How do I describe in detail of him taking out of the five blades and what he feels as

1218
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,020
he takes them out?

1219
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,900
Help, please.

1220
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,460
Update.

1221
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,540
BTW, he's not human.

1222
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,380
May I go?

1223
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,060
As if I'm reading, here's what I want to hear, Travis.

1224
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,060
I want to hear as if I'm reading the audio book.

1225
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,300
As if I'm listening to it on audible.com.

1226
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:44,800
Okay.

1227
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,540
Zebular turned to face his attackers.

1228
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,780
What, you think this can stop me?

1229
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,260
He said through his tentacled mouth.

1230
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,420
He began removing the blades.

1231
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,140
Schlorp came the first one.

1232
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,620
Schlorp came the second.

1233
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,180
Schlorp, that was the third one.

1234
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,020
Schlorp, that was the fourth.

1235
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,140
Schlorp, the fifth one came out.

1236
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,140
Clang, he threw them all on the ground.

1237
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,540
Clang, clang, clang.

1238
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,060
Clang went the second one.

1239
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,100
Clang went the third.

1240
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,180
Clang went the fourth.

1241
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,660
Schlorp went the fifth as he threw it into his attacker's chest, killing him instantly.

1242
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,700
Take that, attacker, said Zebular or whatever his name was.

1243
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,660
Zebular, that was very good, Travis.

1244
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,300
Let me try.

1245
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:30,800
Okay.

1246
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,140
Zebular reached up and grabbed the knife handle of one of the five knives that was in him.

1247
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,700
And he pulled it out a little bit.

1248
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,660
Ah, fuck.

1249
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,380
He pulled it out another half inch.

1250
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,060
Fuck me, seriously.

1251
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,540
He pulled it out another quarter inch.

1252
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,820
God damn it.

1253
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,460
Only three more inches to go, he thought to himself.

1254
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,700
And then he blacked out from pain.

1255
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,780
And then he woke back up.

1256
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,300
Okay, I've got to get back to work.

1257
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,140
Chapter two.

1258
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,980
Another quarter inch came out of the knife.

1259
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,620
And he's like, it's worse doing it slowly.

1260
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,340
God damn it.

1261
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,740
And so he pulled it out another inch and a half, he thought to himself.

1262
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,240
Fuck.

1263
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,660
Okay, well, only one more inch and a half to go.

1264
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,060
And then he puked.

1265
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,580
And he's like, okay, I've got to stop.

1266
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,020
I've got to stop kidding around.

1267
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,140
It's time to get serious.

1268
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,580
It's time to get real.

1269
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,780
And then he said this out loud.

1270
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,820
It's time to get real.

1271
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,860
It's time to get real.

1272
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,940
And then in an instant, he yanked it out and then he finished.

1273
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,540
And then he did that with the other ones at the end.

1274
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,860
Can I do it?

1275
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,360
Yeah.

1276
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:47,100
Hercules Jr stood up from the ground and stopped being dead and smirked.

1277
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,740
Looks like you brought five knives to a god fight.

1278
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,540
He took the first blade by a handle and the second blade.

1279
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,540
And it had two at the same time, as if to show off how mighty he is.

1280
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,700
And then the third one came out pretty quick.

1281
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,620
And the fourth one got a little rib.

1282
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,140
And so that one was tricky.

1283
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,460
And then he accidentally put the third one back in.

1284
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,460
I don't know.

1285
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,340
What a twist.

1286
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,460
Uh oh, he said, I'm just going to leave those there.

1287
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,340
It hurt a great deal, even for Hercules Jr, who can't be hurt.

1288
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,300
So it didn't hurt it.

1289
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:22,860
I'm sorry.

1290
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,620
My backspace key fell off.

1291
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,060
And so whatever I write, it's got to stay in her.

1292
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,860
I mean, here.

1293
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,780
I mean, here, I couldn't even fix that.

1294
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,260
Anyway, then he fell in love.

1295
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,100
Does the Yahoo community have any good ways of describing that?

1296
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,060
I mean, Javec says there's a very good chance he wouldn't be feeling anything anymore.

1297
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,260
Even if somehow someone survived five stab wounds to the chest,

1298
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,500
I don't think they're going to last long if they yank the blades out

1299
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,460
and let themselves bleed to death.

1300
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,380
They're not human.

1301
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,660
So he saw that and he was like, all right, I got to edit this question.

1302
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,780
No, it's an edit, Travis.

1303
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,500
He saw the first response like, ah, fuck, I should have clarified.

1304
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,620
Gretchen Wiener says, ouch.

1305
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,620
For normal people, they would have died.

1306
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,300
So the person writing this book is like, ah, fuck, maybe it shouldn't be five blades stabbed.

1307
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,340
Shoot.

1308
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,660
Four?

1309
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,420
Maybe four?

1310
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,100
I think I could do four.

1311
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,620
It depends on where.

1312
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,020
That's it.

1313
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,860
OK, listen, question writer, is this like four stab wounds to the chest

1314
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,020
or is like one of them stabbed my toe?

1315
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,860
Oh, here's what it is.

1316
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,820
Update, Gretchen Wiener says, OK, then I got a great idea.

1317
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,420
How about, no, you don't.

1318
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,260
What about a lot of blood pouring out, but the blood that poured out went back in

1319
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,620
and then his wound recovered?

1320
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,900
So here's what it would be.

1321
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,100
Hercules Jr. smirked and pulled all the five blades out with his five mighty arms

1322
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,500
and threw them down to the ground.

1323
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,340
But evil Hercules knew the job was done.

1324
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,180
Look at all your blood, he says.

1325
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,580
It's on the ground where the dirt lives.

1326
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,500
Hercules Jr. smiles.

1327
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,020
We'll see about that.

1328
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:04,140
All five of his wounds open back up real wide and start making a sucking noise

1329
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,540
and the blood slurp and the blood lifts up off the ground

1330
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,940
and the five mouths on his body drinks it up

1331
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,940
and all the blood goes back in him.

1332
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,460
Now I'm ready to fight again.

1333
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,100
I hate you, evil Hercules.

1334
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,380
Glad I got my blood back.

1335
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,220
Now I'm strong for fighting.

1336
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,900
Look at how high I can jump.

1337
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,860
The end.

1338
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,420
The end.

1339
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,420
The end.

1340
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,180
You gotta know when to end your book.

1341
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,300
Yep, end on a high note.

1342
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,020
That's what I always say.

1343
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,460
Thank you, yes.

1344
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,580
I say you gotta start in the middle of the action

1345
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,260
and you gotta end in the middle of the action.

1346
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,740
Evil Hercules sighed.

1347
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,940
Well, I'm out of knives.

1348
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,940
Those are all my knives.

1349
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,140
I thought I would only need one, but I brought five.

1350
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,140
That was the set I got at Ikea and it only came with the five knives.

1351
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,900
How about another question?

1352
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,940
Yeah, we've only done one.

1353
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,740
Hmm, yeah, that seems like not enough.

1354
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,260
We should probably do more of those.

1355
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,420
My wife and I recently moved into our first house.

1356
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,420
We keep to ourselves, but try to be friendly with the neighbors.

1357
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,820
Yesterday, one of our neighbor's kids came to our door

1358
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,140
and asked if he could vacuum our home.

1359
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,900
A bit confused, but trying to be a good neighbor,

1360
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,460
we said he could vacuum downstairs.

1361
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,500
Like a good neighbor vacuum my house.

1362
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,260
It took about 10 minutes and we gave him five dollars.

1363
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:17,580
What?

1364
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,620
As he left, he gave us a handmade business card that said,

1365
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,820
It said, I will vacuum your house for $20.

1366
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,180
Now we're living with the shame of underpaying a 12-year-old

1367
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,260
for a service we didn't want or ask for.

1368
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,660
Do we owe this kid $15?

1369
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,180
If so, how do we give him the money?

1370
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,900
Hell, spotless in Seattle.

1371
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,540
This kid.

1372
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,580
I will vacuum your house for $20.

1373
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:54,060
This kid had, let's just confront this,

1374
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,460
a pocket full of business cards that said,

1375
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,540
I will vacuum your house for $4

1376
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,740
and then $15 more for however much money you gave him.

1377
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,900
If you gave him $50, he would say,

1378
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,860
for $65, I will vacuum your whole house.

1379
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,900
And it's a good racket.

1380
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,500
It's a good racket to get into.

1381
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,620
Good scam.

1382
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,500
Because that's the thing.

1383
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,300
It has to be like an Artful Dodger,

1384
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,900
like kind of, you know, the young gang of vacuuming scam artists.

1385
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,540
Because what kid just like rolls,

1386
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,380
it's one thing for like, I'll mow your lawn or whatever,

1387
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,380
but like, I'll vacuum your house?

1388
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,820
That kid probably also stole some of your jewelry.

1389
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,820
Put the vacuum into the jewelry box,

1390
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,020
sucked all the treasures up.

1391
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,260
I've never thought about this before,

1392
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,540
but if you let a kid mow your lawn and vacuum your house,

1393
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,180
when does this start to like broach

1394
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,100
into like child labor issues?

1395
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,660
Immediately, instantly.

1396
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,220
Already.

1397
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,220
The moment you pay them a service for hard work.

1398
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,060
So you think this is a sting?

1399
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,140
Like this kid, if you have him back,

1400
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,580
he's definitely wearing a wire.

1401
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:06,460
So I appreciate the entrepreneurial ship of this child, right?

1402
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:11,500
Because I used to mow Tommy Redd's dad's lawn

1403
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,820
for money that I could spend on Hero Clicks,

1404
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,020
but I used a manual push mower that didn't accomplish anything.

1405
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,300
It just kind of, just kind of-

1406
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,100
Mushed, just mushed the grass down.

1407
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,780
It mushed the grass down.

1408
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,740
And so one time I went to do it and he said,

1409
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,180
last time, did you actually do it?

1410
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,580
And I said, yeah, I just use a push mower

1411
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,260
and so it didn't work very well.

1412
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,820
And he said, I'm not going to employ you anymore.

1413
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,580
And I said, totally got it.

1414
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,620
$20, please.

1415
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,060
I'll vacuum your house for $20.

1416
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,100
I will vacuum your house for $20.

1417
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,220
With this push mower.

1418
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,660
I would sell, I will vacuum your house for $20 t-shirt

1419
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,020
at our merch store.

1420
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,860
I'm fairly sure you could not walk half a block wearing that shirt.

1421
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,860
You would just instantly like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1422
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,380
Yeah, yeah, come on in.

1423
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,100
Come on in, please.

1424
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,780
Please, this isn't your house

1425
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,900
and we're not anywhere near your house.

1426
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,260
I know, but I really need this service.

1427
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,700
This is a great service.

1428
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,980
I think you might be in the clear

1429
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,780
because the terms were not agreed upon before, right?

1430
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,380
This is not how business cards work.

1431
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,260
It's not, it's a business card, not an invoice.

1432
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,500
You need to be ready for the fact that this kid

1433
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,700
is going to come back

1434
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,500
and he's going to offer you the service again

1435
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,140
and you are going to need to think of a reason

1436
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,900
why you said yes the first time

1437
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,380
but now it's a no from now on.

1438
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,660
It's much cleaner than I used to be.

1439
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,060
We found another child who does it for $15.

1440
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,660
So sorry, Jeremy.

1441
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,780
You got undercut, Jeremy.

1442
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,580
Hit the bricks.

1443
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,620
This is business.

1444
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,140
Mark Cuban came by with his $15 house vacuuming service.

1445
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,740
It's a robot, you see.

1446
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,820
So I'm sorry to say that automation

1447
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,580
is taking your job, Jeremy.

1448
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,460
I love $20.

1449
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,220
Don't get me wrong.

1450
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:52,940
It's a good number.

1451
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,540
It's a good number and if you're a kid,

1452
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,580
it's basically $100.

1453
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,260
That is the thing.

1454
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,780
A $20 bill when you're a kid

1455
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,260
is like blank check.

1456
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,220
$20?

1457
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:02,940
Oh my gosh.

1458
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,740
Well, with inflation,

1459
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,940
they'd still be jazzed about $20.

1460
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,620
They'd still be psyched out of their fucking minds.

1461
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,100
Probably not a good vacuuming job, huh?

1462
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,420
Why didn't you ask how much it costs?

1463
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,140
Why did you let this kid in your house

1464
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,820
with no terms discussed?

1465
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,060
If you don't ask the kid how much it costs upfront,

1466
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,220
you are opening yourself up to a reality

1467
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,820
in which you're like, well, what do I owe you?

1468
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,860
And the kid's like,

1469
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,500
oh, nothing.

1470
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,020
I just wanted to look at all your things

1471
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:29,740
and touch them.

1472
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,140
Yeah.

1473
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,980
Because I'm dirty and I'm nasty.

1474
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,580
Or you're like, what do I owe you?

1475
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,100
And the kid's like $150.

1476
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,500
Yeah, that's all bad.

1477
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,260
There's no good outcome here.

1478
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,780
Or the kid comes in to vacuum your house

1479
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,380
and he's still vacuuming your house

1480
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,980
three hours later.

1481
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,980
And you're like, okay, go.

1482
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,860
That's a 10 minutes.

1483
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,180
I'm not sure he was doing a very good job.

1484
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,940
That's, I think we can all agree on that.

1485
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,100
It's not a good vacuum job this child did.

1486
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,260
So it may have been a $5 vacuum job.

1487
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,340
If you want your house vacuumed, call me.

1488
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,540
I'll do it for $19.

1489
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,060
$25, but it'll be cleaned by a man.

1490
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,380
And I will show you how a man cleans a house.

1491
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,140
A child's not gonna do it.

1492
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,580
I'll show you how a man does it.

1493
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,900
Oh, Justin, that vacuum cleaner's pretty big.

1494
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,020
Are you sure you can?

1495
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:15,340
Whoa.

1496
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,460
Yeah, it's no problem.

1497
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,860
I'll throw it on my back like a Ghostbuster.

1498
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,180
And you can get, like, business card says like,

1499
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,260
I'll suck this shit out of your house carpet.

1500
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:31,020
Our mom used to put, do other people do this?

1501
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,660
Our mom used to put this weird, smelly dust.

1502
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,620
Carpet Fresh?

1503
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,060
Carpet Fresh.

1504
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,580
Do people still do Carpet Fresh?

1505
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,300
Cause I feel like I've never seen anybody else do it.

1506
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,380
I know it used to be a thing where it's like,

1507
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,740
I'm about to vacuum anyway.

1508
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,660
Let me throw a bunch of dust on the ground.

1509
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,740
I guarantee Carpet Fresh is now like asbestos and lead paint.

1510
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,860
For sure.

1511
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,300
Like nobody uses it.

1512
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,260
Are you kidding me?

1513
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,540
You're gonna use Carpet Fresh?

1514
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,260
Oh, your feet are gonna melt off by the time you're 40.

1515
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,580
That is gonna do it for us for this week, folks.

1516
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:03,820
Thank you so much for, I was gonna say enjoying,

1517
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,460
but that seems-

1518
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,100
Indulging?

1519
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,580
Indulging yourself in this pot.

1520
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,380
Indulging us.

1521
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,900
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.

1522
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,820
Thank you for indulging us for this hour.

1523
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,060
We hope you have enjoyed yourself.

1524
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,060
We are, okay, so we have a few things to talk about.

1525
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,380
We're gonna try to blow through them as quick as possible.

1526
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,660
St. Louis and Detroit.

1527
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,700
Columbus, we're also coming to you in May,

1528
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,460
but you have come out in a big way

1529
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,100
and you bought up all the ding-dang tickets.

1530
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,780
If you're in St. Louis or Detroit though,

1531
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,540
and you have some free time on Thursday, May 3rd,

1532
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,300
or Friday, May 4th,

1533
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,660
we're gonna be at the Peabody Opera House in St. Louis

1534
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,220
and the Masonic Temple Theater in Detroit

1535
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,420
doing our podcast, My Brother, My Brother, Me,

1536
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,860
live on stage.

1537
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,740
And it's going to be very fun,

1538
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,460
and we would love it if you would come out and see us.

1539
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,380
Those shows are very close,

1540
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,340
and there's lots of good seats available,

1541
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,060
so please come buy them.

1542
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,140
There's not, like, infinity tickets.

1543
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,620
There's, like, a fixed amount in the world.

1544
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,940
It might sell out before the time we do the show,

1545
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,620
so hop on it right now.

1546
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,420
Don't wait.

1547
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,020
Go get great tickets, because you deserve it.

1548
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,260
And if you go to mcroyshows.com slash tours,

1549
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,140

1550

So please come see us again, May 3rd, May 4th,

01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,980
St. Louis, Detroit.

1552
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,620
Let's do it.

1553
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,900
And send in your questions,

1554
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,660
and make sure to put in the subject line,

1555
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,900
like, Detroit Show or Columbus Show

1556
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,180
or St. Louis Show or whatever.

1557
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,660
Also, I want to say, just announced,

1558
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,900
we are going to be on this year's JoCo Cruise,

1559
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,340
JoCo Cruise 2019.

1560
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,820
We are super excited about it,

1561
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,740
and we hope you are super excited about it too.

1562
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,860
Well, speak for yourself.

1563
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,860
I can't stop thinking about the Kraken.

1564
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,260
You're worried about the Kraken?

1565
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,940
The Kraken, Leviathan, Poseidon.

1566
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,020
Yeah, I understand.

1567
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,980
Well, don't worry.

1568
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,260
We start every-

1569
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,700
They start every JoCo Cruise

1570
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,380
with a sacrifice to the sea.

1571
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,700
Okay.

1572
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,140
So that we don't have to worry about it.

1573
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,420
Listen, there's not many cabins available,

1574
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,300
but we're going to be on there

1575
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,900
with They Might Be Giants and our whole family.

1576
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,580
So like, come on this fucking cruise already.

1577
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,300
What are you talking about?

1578
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,060
JoCoCruise.com.

1579
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,500
It's one of the most fun things

1580
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,020
I've ever done in my life going on last year,

1581
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,540
so I'm super looking forward to this one.

1582
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,220
JoCoCruise.com.

1583
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,340
Also want to say,

1584
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,580
I started a secret society here in Cincinnati

1585
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,660
called the Cincinnati Underground Society,

1586
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,580
and we are doing a monthly show

1587
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,500
called the Cincinnati Underground Society Show,

1588
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,420
or CUS, and-

1589
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:19,740
Nice.

1590
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,260
Tickets for our April show are on sale now.

1591
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,700
They are very close to selling out.

1592
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,100
We're at about 75% sold at this point.

1593
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,460
The show comes up Saturday, April 28th.

1594
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,900
I've got five out of town guests coming in

1595
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,380
and one local, and they're pretty great.

1596
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,980
It's going to be a really great show.

1597
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,740
We had a lot of fun doing the March show.

1598
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,180
I'm not going to tell you who the guests are,

1599
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:46,780
but trust me, it's a really good lineup.

1600
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,540
So if you want to come out to that,

1601
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:55,420

01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,620
Justin and Sydney are doing a book,

1605
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:03,740
and that's so exciting.

1606
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,380
They just announced it.

1607
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,660
They've been working really hard on it.

1608
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:06,720
Yep.

1609
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,340

01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,260
who's extremely talented, is doing illustrations,

1611
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,900
and it is a book based on our podcast, Sawbones.

1612
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:19,500
And you can get it at bit.ly forward slash Sawbones book.

1615

but please pre-order this book.

1616
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,500
I worked so hard on it.

1617
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,620
It's so hard to write a book.

1618
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,940
Bit.ly forward slash Sawbones book.

1619
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,060

1625
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:37,820
All right.

1626
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,900
That's actually only for April.

1627
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,460
So if you want a Munch Squad pin, go get it right now.

1628
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:43,660
