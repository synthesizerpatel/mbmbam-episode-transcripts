1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:52,320
Hello, hello everybody, and welcome to Don't Eat That Mary, a Great British Bake Off fancast.

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,840
And I'm Pimbles. And I'm Pimbles, the bread man.

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,200
This is our pet, Pimbles the bread man, a man made of bread.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,360
Boy, that's me. They left me in the proving oven too long, didn't they?

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,480
I sprouted legs and arms and I became a real man,

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,720
but only instead of where my skin would be, it's all crusty bread, isn't it?

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240
Don't be afraid of Pimbles, child. Don't be afraid of me, but also don't eat me.

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,360
Don't become too friendly, child, and try to put your mouth around Pimbles.

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,280
Don't get too comfy with Pimbles, eh?

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
He'll also steal your identity.

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
What do we do, little one? What do we do? We look. We don't touch, that's right.

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,160
Don't touch Pimbles.

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,480
Don't touch Pimbles. He's made of crusty bread.

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,680
And he's got leprosy.

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,600
Well, everything made of bread has leprosy, if you think about it.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,400
It's not leprosy, it's caraway seed, isn't it?

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,240
It just fall off when he walks around, don't it?

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,800
Oh, Lord, the bread comes off with the boot, doesn't it, Pimbles?

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,320
But don't be afraid, children.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Pimbles' pieces gonna fall off from time to time, but that's just life.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
You'll learn, you'll learn.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
Little bit of hummus.

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,400
Oh, don't eat that. Oh, Mary, don't eat that. Don't eat Pimbles, Mary.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,880
It's raw.

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,800
That's raw inside, isn't it? Pimbles didn't have a great cook job, did he?

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,080
It's not a good bake.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
Pimbles got a little too thick in the middle, didn't he?

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,800
He's got a soggy bottom.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,840
Overproven.

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
He's got a soggy bottom, doesn't he?

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Oh, Mary.

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,040
Mary.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
Mary, don't eat that.

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,440
Mary.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,000
Mary.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Bad Mary.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,840
No, Mary.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,480
Down, Mary.

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
Don't make me get the spray.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
I'll get the no-no can, Mary. You know I will.

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,840
I'll get the no-no can.

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,960
Mary.

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,000
Mary, don't eat it.

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,320
That's grass, Mary.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,920
Mary, put the grass.

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
Mary, that's a fork. Don't eat that.

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Mary, it's a pile of grass on a fork, Mary.

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,960
Don't eat Sue, Mary.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Mary.

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,440
You cannibal.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,280
Mary, you're gnawing on my elbow.

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,880
You're having a little gnaw, aren't you?

58
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,520
Mary, down.

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,400
I've been having a hard time thinking of what would be,

60
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,880
how we could improve The Great British Breaking Show,

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,120
because I think it's, like, pretty much perfect.

62
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,200
But I do like the idea of Pimbles the bread boy, the bread man.

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
Like, it needs a mascot. It needs attitude.

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
They need more merch possibilities.

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,160
Right, you need a, like, an unleavened mascot in there.

66
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,200
Like a bready, a starchy gex, if you will.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
Oh, that's great, because you could have, like,

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
you know, your Pimbles figure,

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
and then you could also have, like, battle damage Pimbles,

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
and, like, you know, your, like, in armor Pimbles.

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
I mean, the whole thing is merch for adults,

72
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,840
because it's like, oh, I gotta get that rolling pin.

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,240
I gotta get Mary's special proving gloves,

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,120
which are, of course, the fighting gloves she uses

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
in The Great British Proving Ground,

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
which is where they make you fight.

77
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,440
It's a different show.

78
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
The Great British Proving Draw BBO after hours.

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,880
Right, but the kids watch the show,

80
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,320
and they don't get a whole lot out of it.

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,360
Let's get Pimbles in the mix.

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Oi, Casey's made Pimbles, isn't it?

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
And it can be, like, elf on the shelf,

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,360
except it's, like, bread in the box.

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,920
He knows if you don't let the bread rise long enough.

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,440
And also, if you touch him, he dies.

87
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,000
Mm-hmm, because he's so flaky.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,240
Mm-hmm, because he's so flaky.

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,160
I'm bite of crusty bread, ain't I?

90
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,960
Bread and crackers.

91
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,920
I like The Great British Bake Off,

92
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,000
but there's been, I do have,

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,840
I think British people are too nice

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,520
to have their own cooking show.

95
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
Like, they don't give anybody actual criticism.

96
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,720
If somebody burns their shit, they're like,

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
well, I think you let this bake go on just a bit too long.

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
Like, they burnt their shit, Mary.

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
It's on fire, it's still on fire.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
They don't even eliminate people.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,800
When they get rid of them,

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
you can still see them in the corners.

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
They're just standing back there watching other people.

104
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,000
They're letting them bake still.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
They just politely asked them not to come back next week,

106
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,240
but it's really up to them.

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Oh, love, I'm sorry, but this flamencoosh had a gun in it.

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,440
I took a big bite of your flamencoosh

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
and I bit into a gun.

110
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
Oh, your Queen of Mall is full of pebbles.

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm so sorry, but you can't service

112
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
all of your muffins in a garbage can.

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,200
We expected them in a muffin tin, didn't we?

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Pimples show at the door.

115
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
This way!

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,040
But I like the plate.

117
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,360
It was a very playful presentation, the garbage can.

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,880
The garbage can has a great bake.

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
It's a great bake on the can.

120
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,760
Great, great proving on the tin, I'd say.

121
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,600
Also, hey, British people,

122
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
you guys are putting some things in bread, huh?

123
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,200
Yeah.

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,600
You all are putting some things in there.

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
You know what we put in bread?

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,720
Bread, for the most part.

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
Sometimes soup is predictable.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
Sometimes?

129
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,640
If we get real crazy, we'll put like a soup.

130
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,880
Sometimes?

131
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,760
I guess every time I watch Great British Bake Off,

132
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,040
I want just one time 11 of the contestants

133
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,960
to get like, you know, all their ingredients out.

134
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm like one guy just to pull out like a box of like,

135
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
you know, the ready-made like Pillsbury, you know, cake mix.

136
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,480
And he's just like looking around as he dumps it into a bowl

137
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,760
with some water and stirs it up.

138
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,160
And he's like, I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

139
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
I feel way off.

140
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,360
I wish you would let me finish my exploration of things

141
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
that British people are putting in bread these days.

142
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
What else do people put in bread, Justin?

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
It was olives and stuff.

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,080
Olives?

145
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,440
In bread?

146
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,560
Everything goes in their bread.

147
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,200
Yeah, that's true.

148
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,720
I saw somebody make a loaf of bread

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,640
and then stuff it inside another loaf of bread.

150
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,840
It's like, and then there was like, they put a G.I. Joe in there.

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
It's like, it's a tea loaf, isn't it?

152
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,120
Like, no, it's what?

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,640
You put a G.I. Joe in there.

154
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,600
If they cut open the bread

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,760
and they find memories from their childhood.

156
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,160
Yeah.

157
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,400
What?

158
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,920
How did you do this?

159
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,640
There's just baubles full of my dreams.

160
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,280
I'm pretty sure British G.I. Joes were called Union Jacks

161
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,960
back in the day.

162
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
I don't see what's so great about baking

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
that it deserves its own show

164
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
because that's all they do on that fucking television program.

165
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
If we can even call it that,

166
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,920
basically it's radio with pictures

167
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
is about how thrilling it is.

168
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
It's like a graphic novel.

169
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, basically, except the pictures move.

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,920
But what I want is other forms of cooking,

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
like the super cool British frying challenge.

172
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,760
And that show would basically just be called Chips.

173
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,520
Chips.

174
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,560
And this is Chippy.

175
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
He's a boy made of chips.

176
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,080
We done made chips again, didn't we love?

177
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,080
For this challenge,

178
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,760
Mary would like you to make some chips.

179
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,880
I just like chips.

180
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,360
Here's the worst part, right?

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,040
You would never guess this about me.

182
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,560
I don't know how to make them.

183
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,680
My name is Barry Barry.

184
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,600
I have no idea how to make chips.

185
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
I just know that at one point they're potatoes

186
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
and another point, they're chips.

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,600
What the fuck, right?

188
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,400
I tried to bake.

189
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm fucking losing my shit.

190
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,920
I put potatoes in the oven.

191
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,400
I cut them real thin, didn't I?

192
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
I left them in the oven.

193
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,240
I waited, nothing, no chips.

194
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
There's no point, they were chips.

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
I'll be down for you and turning the bread in there.

196
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
It's like, I can't not cook bread.

197
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,560
I think I've done accents from every part

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,400
of those beautiful aisles at this point.

199
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
I think I've done a bit of Welsh.

200
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,360
I think I've done a little bit of dirty Welsh.

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,040
Dirty Welsh.

202
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,920
Let's do some advice, what do you say boys?

203
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,440
Here's our first question.

204
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
If you have one, you can send it to mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

205
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
Here we go.

206
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
It's so weird that you just gave out the email

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,800
because I don't think we've done that in like 100 episodes.

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
It's really weird, right?

209
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
People keep finding it though.

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,680
I mean, shit.

211
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,480
I don't work on Fridays.

212
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Okay, so occasionally, I will go see a movie on my day off

213
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,600
in order to beat the crowds

214
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,680
who would normally come on a Friday evening.

215
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,200
This past time, I was sitting in a relatively empty theater

216
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,040
when a man who smelled horribly plopped down next to me.

217
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,520
Since the odor would be a distraction during the film,

218
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,880
I knew I had to switch seats, but I wanted to do it in a way

219
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
the man didn't think it was because of him.

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,400
I ended up getting up,

221
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,640
taking off all of my stuff, walking out of the theater,

222
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
counting to 10, re-entering the theater,

223
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
and sitting on the same row as the guy,

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
hoping he just thought that I was unaware

225
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,640
of my original seat was actually closer to him.

226
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,960
Did I make the right move?

227
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,480
Could I have done it better?

228
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,840
That's from Movie Seat Mover in Macon.

229
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
Why did you sit in the same row?

230
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

231
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,280
Why did you sit in the same row? Yeah, that's a great question.

232
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
Did I do the right thing?

233
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,800
And like the least stealth approach to this thing?

234
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
No, he's gonna notice that you're two seats away from him

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
and not one seat away from him.

236
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
What he wouldn't notice is that if you came in

237
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
and sat three rows behind him,

238
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,000
he would think you are a different person

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,280
because while we do develop like better object permanence

240
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,960
as we go, it's not that good.

241
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,200
They're paying attention to like the fucking locale

242
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,360
of every single human being around us.

243
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,240
But this is one of those things that's so indicative

244
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
of like people being afraid

245
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
that everyone's also thinking about them

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
as much as you're thinking about them.

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
They're not, absolutely.

248
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
You just get up and move.

249
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
That dude isn't gonna think twice about it.

250
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
Can you imagine a reality

251
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
at which you sit through his back

252
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,560
and that dude's like, up, up, up, up, up.

253
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,040
Excuse me, I don't think so.

254
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
I believe you were next to me.

255
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,520
We were going to be movie buddies.

256
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,680
Even if this fool like did notice,

257
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,280
A, did notice,

258
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,640
B, definitely, definitely took offense,

259
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,360
C, definitely fully knew it was because he did not smell good.

260
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Even if all those things were true,

261
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
he is never going to like say to you,

262
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
like, excuse me, can we confront this together?

263
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,080
Can we like, please?

264
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,920
Let's just lay all the cards on the table here, man.

265
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
Yeah, can we hit this head on, please?

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
We've been dancing around this all movie.

267
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
Me and my boys, Johnny and Justin,

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,600
we went and saw The Hateful Eight earlier this week.

269
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,520
And we saw it at the draft house,

270
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,040
which has a signed seating,

271
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,840
which is amazing for like any number of reasons.

272
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,960
But these dudes were sitting in our seats.

273
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,400
And it's like, that's the least perfect crime.

274
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,160
It's the worst imaginable crime.

275
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Cause I have a little piece of paper here

276
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,200
with numbers on it that says you're in my seats.

277
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,440
And they were like, no, we're pretty sure this is right.

278
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
I said, my boy Justin Tattle, didn't he?

279
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,800
He went down the airship and was like,

280
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
you need to get these guys out of here.

281
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,760
Cause those are our seats.

282
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,840
They're trying to make us sit in the back corner.

283
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,000
And like, I'm a, listen, I'm an excitable P-boy.

284
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
And I was seeing a Tarantino flake.

285
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
So you know my bladder is gonna be a trembling

286
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
the whole time out of just the pure tension of the work.

287
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,240
And then they moved.

288
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
And I think they said something gruff about it.

289
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,560
But you know what?

290
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,840
But they were wrong.

291
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,480
They were wrong.

292
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
Yeah, I'm not gonna feel bad.

293
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
Mad props to my boy Justin for tattling.

294
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm too afraid to tattle most of the time.

295
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,520
That's upsetting because I love tattling.

296
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,680
It's so rare you get to as an adult.

297
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,400
But isn't it like, okay, the unspoken rule is this.

298
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,920
Just in case anyone was wondering.

299
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,360
If you get, like, I've done this.

300
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
I've sat in a movie theater where it was assigned seats.

301
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
And it was like, ooh, I like that seat better.

302
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,400
But, but, but, but, but the unspoken rule is this, Griffin.

303
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,480
As soon as someone walks up and goes,

304
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
I think you're in my seat, you go, oh, sorry.

305
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
I read the ticket wrong.

306
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,440
Oh man, sorry.

307
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,080
I guess I confused a two with a 14.

308
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,000
Like, really, you confused a two with a 14?

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
But everyone accepts what's going on.

310
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,160
Like, they know that you tried to sit in their seat

311
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,520
because you like that seat better.

312
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,560
But like, you have to move as soon as you're confronted about it.

313
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,560
They're already embarrassed, but they thought,

314
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,400
maybe, maybe I am right.

315
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,480
Maybe deep down, I'm right all along.

316
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,480
Don't do that.

317
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,000
Don't do that.

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
This is not germane to the conversation.

319
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
This is a different kettle of fish.

320
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,520
This idea of moving in a non-assigned seat

321
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,440
because somebody sat right next to you

322
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,080
because they really, really, really wanted somebody

323
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
to catch them jerking off.

324
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,280
There's no reason why you need to be that person

325
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,920
for this person.

326
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,800
It's important to note here, Question Asker,

327
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
that if this theater was, let's say,

328
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
maybe there are 10 people in the whole theater, right?

329
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,040
Friday morning, like 10 a.m. showing.

330
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,520
And this guy comes and sits even like one seat over,

331
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,960
even with one seat gap.

332
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,240
Same row, he's a jerker.

333
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,280
Definitely, 100%.

334
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,000
He's a, yeah.

335
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,960
Something, something's going on.

336
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,460
Smell this.

337
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
I think that's why if you move rows,

338
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
that guy's gonna be like, I sat too close.

339
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
That's why I always wear a cop badge

340
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
just like hanging out of my front pants pocket.

341
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,000
And then like if somebody tries that stuff

342
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,640
and tries to get me to like eye their jerk style,

343
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,920
I keep an eye on their jerks.

344
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
Check out these sweet skills.

345
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
I point to the badge and I say,

346
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
are you sure you wanna do this?

347
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,640
I'll be your huckleberry,

348
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
but are you sure you wanna do this today?

349
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
Is today, is this how you wanted today to go?

350
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
And I'm pointing to my cop's badge

351
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
that says Detective Griffin McElroy, attorney at law.

352
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
Are you sure about this?

353
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,120
Sir Griffin McElroy.

354
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
Listen, I don't wanna tell you how to live your life,

355
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
but I'm pretty sure I could get a conviction off this one.

356
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,440
Detergent Griffin, detergent Griffin McElroy, kid cop.

357
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,160
Hi, I'm detergent Griffin McElroy.

358
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm here to wipe out the stain of crime.

359
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,760
That you left on the fucking seat with your jerk off.

360
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,160
You guys know who I am?

361
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,480
Maybe you act like you're doing him a solid.

362
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
So here's what I'm suggesting.

363
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,960
Like the trailer, your mid trailers,

364
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,920
you're seeing that new,

365
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,840
like they're still making Harry Potter movies

366
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,280
even without Harry Potter.

367
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,680
And you go, no, no, no, no, no.

368
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
And you run away from the person

369
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,880
and then you put your hand in your mouth

370
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,760
and kind of go, pretend like you were going to fart.

371
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,200
You didn't wanna expose him to it.

372
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,240
So you ran for it.

373
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,120
You made it a run for it.

374
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Like it was, and you just say to the guy like,

375
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,160
hey, listen, it's gonna be off and on, man.

376
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,200
It's gonna be one of those flicks.

377
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,160
I'll just stay over here.

378
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
And he'll be like, solid.

379
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,320
Thanks, fart buddy.

380
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,120
Thanks, fart dude.

381
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
Thanks, fart cop.

382
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,400
This Yahoo.

383
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,120
Thanks, detergent.

384
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,280
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Rosen.

385
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,800
Game recognized game.

386
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,360
Thank you, Rachel.

387
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,000
It's by Yahoo.

388
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,040
Answers user.

389
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
Ooh, they're anonymous.

390
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,000
Probably because they're asking

391
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
about a criminal crime thing.

392
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
And they know that detergent Griffin McElroy,

393
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,840
attorney at laws on the case, they ask.

394
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,880
Oh, I give them a name.

395
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,040
Pimbles asks, where to stash weed and pipes?

396
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
And then in parentheses, weed smokers only.

397
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,560
So my parents always find it.

398
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
In drawers, secret compartments in bed,

399
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,200
used to hide stuff in backpack till school found out.

400
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,880
Where are some good places to hide them?

401
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,640
Nothing dumb like in shoes or things like that.

402
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,520
I've tried everything.

403
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,000
I've seen in videos or tips, but they keep finding it.

404
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Fellow weed smokers, help me out.

405
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

406
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,040
Where are you gonna hide that kush and that kush piece?

407
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,400
How many times do your parents and school

408
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,600
have to find it before you just stop?

409
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,520
They're not gonna stop.

410
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,480
What are you talking about?

411
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,840
For some people, it just seems to me

412
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,240
like once you get busted once by school

413
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,120
and once by parents, like they're all so on point

414
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
looking for your shit.

415
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,600
You're gonna have to get like a safety deposit box downtown.

416
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,280
But the alternative is you no longer

417
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,160
have that good kush smoke hitting you right in the brain

418
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,920
and making you feel like so nice.

419
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,240
Is there a place, is there a smoke shop?

420
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,400
Much like I've been to beer houses

421
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,480
where like they take your Stein

422
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,640
and they lock it in like a little cabinet

423
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,120
and when you show up, you get your special Stein

424
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,680
to drink from and then they lock it back away.

425
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Maybe there's like a smoke shop where like

426
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,240
they keep your pipe and weed for you

427
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,600
and you come and you sit in a very comfortable chair

428
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,120
in like the back.

429
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
You smoke as much as you want

430
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,400
and then they lock your pipe back up

431
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
and you head on home.

432
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,520
No.

433
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,000
No, okay.

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,480
Not yet.

435
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,480
What if you're delinquent on your payments though

436
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,080
and then they come and they cut your little storage unit open

437
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,040
and then people bid on your gross ass pieces.

438
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,080
I'm looking in there and I see what looks like

439
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,000
a good old little greeny piece

440
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
and then behind that, I think I see what appears to be

441
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,520
the carb on a bong.

442
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,360
So I'm gonna assume a bong is in there.

443
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,800
So I think I'm gonna be able to get,

444
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
I'm a bit up to 30 on this one,

445
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,680
but we'll see how it goes.

446
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,360
Maybe Elvis's bong is in there.

447
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,840
I don't know.

448
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,440
I don't know.

449
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,920
Maybe a jet ski.

450
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,040
Old arcade games.

451
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,160
Maybe a jet ski's in there.

452
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,880
That would be crazy.

453
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,280
Cause it's a very, it's a small box.

454
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,200
It's like a shoe box, but we'll see.

455
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,760
Maybe.

456
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,560
You could bury it?

457
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,040
You could bury it.

458
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,240
Camouflage?

459
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,840
But then you're gonna need a treasure map.

460
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,040
And what if it grows?

461
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,440
Oof.

462
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,640
Didn't think about that.

463
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
Now you're really in the shit.

464
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,960
Yeah, that's federal.

465
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,840
That's a federal thing.

466
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
That's a federal offense.

467
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,320
I've got it.

468
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,560
They're gonna thank you for that one, federally speaking.

469
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,200
I've got it.

470
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,560
What?

471
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Okay.

472
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,320
So you've already been caught, right?

473
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,680
So your parents are looking for it.

474
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,200
They're on the lookout.

475
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,200
So you hide it where they would least suspect it.

476
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
You hide it in their drawers.

477
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,480
Oh my God.

478
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
Deborah, is there something you want to tell me?

479
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,240
Exactly.

480
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,720
Deborah.

481
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
Well, we found this, we found this awesome doge and it smells

482
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
like a quality strain.

483
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,320
What should we do with it?

484
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,200
Give it to our son?

485
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah, I agree.

486
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,160
Yeah.

487
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
We can't be trusted.

488
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Apparently we sleep, we sleep by weed.

489
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,120
There's only one person I know who I would trust to take care

490
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
of this kind strain of doja.

491
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
And that's my sweet boy, Derek.

492
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,640
Derek, get in here.

493
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,920
Derek, get in here.

494
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,680
How about this, can I- We can't be trusted, Derek.

495
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Can I take it one step further, Travis?

496
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,080
Uh-huh.

497
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,040
Can you tape it to the one place your parents will never see it,

498
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
which is your parents' backs?

499
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,280
Okay.

500
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
What if you tape it to each of their foreheads?

501
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
So that way they don't know about the one on their head,

502
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
but they're too embarrassed to say something about the other one's head.

503
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,480
That's very good.

504
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,120
Uh-huh.

505
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
They will never see that coming.

506
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
Oh, Derek, that was a great hug you just gave me.

507
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,120
Thank you for that great hug, Derek.

508
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,160
Then five minutes later, like,

509
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,400
there's just a weird smell coming from Derek's room.

510
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
No, I'm too busy thinking about that great hug you gave me.

511
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
So I'm probably not going to investigate.

512
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Maybe he's smoking weed,

513
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
but could somebody who hugs like that be still smoking?

514
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
Hugs not drugs.

515
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,520
Or in this case, hugs to drugs.

516
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
Hugs to drugs, my new program.

517
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,160
Um, yeah, I think that I have the helps.

518
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm happily and recently married to a wonderful man.

519
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
There is just one problem.

520
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,120
He recently learned how to smize.

521
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,240
At first, he thought it was cute,

522
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,840
but now he does it all the time and it's sort of terrifying.

523
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,400
How can I get my husband to stop smizing

524
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,120
and start smiling like a normal human being?

525
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,760
That's from scared of the smize in North Carolina.

526
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
It's my favorite question.

527
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
It's very good, but it's also bittersweet, isn't it?

528
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,640
I've only watched like three episodes ever

529
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
of America's Next Top Model.

530
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
Could you guys please explain to me in detail

531
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
what smizing exactly is?

532
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,680
It's like over here at me, Trav, look at me.

533
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,480
Uh-huh.

534
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,440
So this is a smile.

535
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,800
Okay.

536
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,080
Okay, now this is a smize.

537
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,840
All right, okay.

538
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,960
Do you see how it looks like the,

539
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
it looks like the top half of his face is twerking?

540
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,860
Uh-huh.

541
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,580
Uh-huh, smizing is, okay, smite, all right.

542
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,180
You know how you've been smiling this whole time, right?

543
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,740
Yes.

544
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,380
What is the key?

545
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
You, the listener, enjoying our podcast.

546
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,460
This is a great podcast you see yourself smiling

547
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,420
and enjoying yourself.

548
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,700
Here's what you do, smile like you're remembering

549
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,100
one of our classic, classic runs, runs of gas.

550
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,460
Okay, I'm doing it right now.

551
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,340
Imagine you're remembering one of Travis's great goofs,

552
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,420
Travis, have you got it, Travis?

553
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,100
Yes, I'm picturing my own hilarity.

554
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,500
What's happening with your mouth right now?

555
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,620
It's kind of formed into a smile shape.

556
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,140
Stop, that needs to be straight.

557
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,140
But the rest of your face still does the smiling business.

558
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,620
Oh, I see.

559
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,140
So you're smiling with your eyes or you're smizing.

560
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,580
I see, is it like rubbing your head

561
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,220
and like patting your stomach or whatever at the same time?

562
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,660
Because you can't make the smile with your face.

563
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,380
Well, with your lower half of face.

564
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,780
But you have to, I mean, that's why it's practice, right?

565
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,940
That's why modeling is not all runways and short skirts.

566
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,460
There's a lot of work to it.

567
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,540
You've got to work that hallway like a runway.

568
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,300
God, can we not?

569
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,100
Like it's really, it's too, it's a little bit too soon

570
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,820
because like they tried to placate me with those articles.

571
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,500
It's like, it's coming back for streaming.

572
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,780
It's not.

573
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,580
It's not, like it's probably, it's not.

574
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,140
And I've been trying to fill the gap with RuPaul's Drag Race,

575
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,420
which is like so terrific in so many like incredible ways

576
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,580
and a lot of ways is superior to ANTM

577
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,100
in like every conceivable way.

578
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
But you always remember your first, don't you?

579
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,940
The first cut is the deepest

580
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,780
and I'll be damned if Tyra didn't cut me

581
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
really, really deep to the bone.

582
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,860
Her husband is smizing.

583
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:50,740
Yes.

584
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,540
How do we feel about that broadly speaking?

585
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,660
Are we okay with that?

586
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,780
Like, do you really want a family like for your Christmas photo?

587
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,380
Like you're all just beaming

588
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,460
and Philip is in the background like,

589
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,900
this is a really hard conversation to make funny

590
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,660
because everything I'm doing with my face is like,

591
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,340
it's classic and lost.

592
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,980
Yeah, yeah.

593
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,980
Can you combat it every time he smizes?

594
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,700
Can you tooch?

595
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,980
Ooh.

596
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,180
Ooh.

597
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,700
Is that farting?

598
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,260
Tooching is like farting without the fart.

599
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,580
Okay.

600
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,700
Tooching is like when you-

601
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,900
Like you're gonna get a good one out.

602
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,580
Like Stanley Toochie.

603
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,740
Yeah, when you morph all of the muscles in your face

604
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,820
to appear like Stanley Toochie,

605
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,060
when you turn your own face into like a grim

606
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,980
Stanley Toochie mask of death.

607
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,580
My husband wants out Toochie-ing.

608
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,900
My husband is Stanley Toochie.

609
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:37,940
And at first-

610
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,900
And he wants out smizing.

611
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,940
At first I thought it was cute,

612
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,460
but now he's Stanley Toochie all the time

613
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,500
and it's sort of terrifying.

614
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,580
How can I get my husband to stop Stanley Toochie?

615
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,780
I have to stop Stanley Toochie.

616
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,980
I've come back from the future to stop Stanley Toochie

617
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,020
before he kills again.

618
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,420
Stanley Toochie is gonna make his own Hunger Games sequel

619
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,780
just starring Stanley Toochie

620
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,500
and the Stanley Toochie character.

621
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,540
Mr. President, get down!

622
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,340
It's Toochie!

623
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,540
It's called Back to the Tootcher.

624
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,660
I've got it bad.

625
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,540
Hot for Tootcher.

626
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,300
Hot for Tootcher is also good.

627
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,660
That'll be the spinoff.

628
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
If they can fucking make Harry Potter movies

629
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,540
without Harry Potter in them,

630
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,860
I don't think we can't make Back to the Future

631
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,340
without Marty and Doc and the crew.

632
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,980
Or any other character except Stanley Toochie.

633
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,100
Yeah, beloved Back to the Future character,

634
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,900
Stanley Toochie.

635
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:30,660
Can you imagine how livid it's Star Wars premiere night,

636
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,900
December 18th, I guess 17th,

637
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,260
over there in jolly old London

638
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,900
and poor the marquee dims,

639
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,660
the lights of the theater go down

640
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,060
and up starts the trailer for

641
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,940
magical creatures and where to find them

642
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,820
or magical beasts and where to find them or whatever.

643
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,660
And that music starts and the font and what all.

644
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,700
Can you imagine the pure shock and despair

645
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,540
that must have crossed the face

646
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,180
of a young Daniel Radcliffe in the audience that night?

647
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,860
How could they?

648
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,620
Wait, am I in this?

649
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,820
Am I in this?

650
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,420
How do I not remember whether or not I did this?

651
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,700
Is he Harry Potter?

652
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,460
This is so upsetting to me, Daniel Radcliffe.

653
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,020
Me, Daniel Radcliffe, beloved actor.

654
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,940
I, Daniel Radcliffe, am just now finding out about this.

655
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,980
Why didn't anyone tell me, Daniel Radcliffe, about this?

656
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,060
Is this punishment for the dick thing I did?

657
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,540
I said I was sorry.

658
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,500
I apologize for my penis thing in the play, okay?

659
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,060
I have to call Jon Hamm.

660
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,780
I called every child in America individually,

661
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,020
not in London because like we're fucking cool with it,

662
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
but I called every child in America individually

663
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,820
and I apologized for my penis thing in the play.

664
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,740
But it's not, I wasn't improvising.

665
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,700
It wasn't like I pulled my penis out every night of Equus.

666
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,780
Like, and they, I got notes.

667
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,340
Okay, Daniel, you did a great job up there,

668
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,660
but please, please, please, please, please,

669
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,700
stop taking your penis out.

670
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,660
It's not in the script and it's just for you.

671
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,020
Like it's just for you and you could,

672
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,380
I can tell it's just for you.

673
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,220
Let's say what we've all been thinking.

674
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,660
The great hog.

675
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,020
The little kid.

676
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,940
DR, DR.

677
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,060
Real magical boner.

678
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,740
The young man who played Harry Potter

679
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,900
got his dick out in a play about horses.

680
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,780
He did it for us.

681
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,900
He did it as a goof favor to us.

682
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,340
And now he's gonna be punished for it

683
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,020
by them making a Harry Potter movie

684
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,580
and just copying, pasting out Harry Potter.

685
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,940
Like fucking Eddie Redmayne,

686
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,940
like Eddie Redmayne hasn't gotten his dick out

687
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,220
in a play before.

688
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,380
I saw a production of fucking Bye Bye Birdie

689
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,820
where he whipped out his trouser snake, his dingus.

690
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,740
He played Birdie.

691
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,420
And we all forgot about that, huh?

692
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,380
He actually played Hugo.

693
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,700
So anyway, it's not right.

694
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,100
Both.

695
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,220
He actually played all the parts.

696
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:49,940
He played all the parts.

697
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,420
It was like his dick out the whole show.

698
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:52,740
Yeah.

699
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,860
It was conceptual.

700
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,420
I thought it was actually pretty fucking incredible.

701
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:56,900
Yeah.

702
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,860
Was it cutting edge?

703
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,900
Of course it was.

704
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,380
It was.

705
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,220
With a score by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

706
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,460
Right.

707
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Which I thought was maybe a weird pivot for him.

708
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,100
But yeah.

709
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,780
Aim high, I guess.

710
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:21,940
Can I tell you about a new advertiser, Justin?

711
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,340
Yeah.

712
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:28,660
Last night, my daughter, Charlie Gale, got a little choked up

713
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,740
because I was making her laugh at this great game

714
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,860
where I pretended to be a ghost.

715
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,660
Nice.

716
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,100
And she got choked up and then she puked all over my sheets.

717
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,420
Okay?

718
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,140
Nice.

719
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,100
Ruined them.

720
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,660
Ruined.

721
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,940
And then literally five minutes after that happened,

722
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,500
knock on the door, UPS man, what did I get but a delivery

723
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,180
from Bowl and Branch.

724
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,500
B-O-L-L and Branch.

725
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,140
Bowl and Branch brought sheets to me.

726
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:55,940
Yeah.

727
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,820
In the exact moment of my need.

728
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,060
That's funny that you say that because in a related story,

729
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,460
yesterday I shit my pants.

730
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,900
And then who's that knocking at the door?

731
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,540
It's me undies.

732
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,780
And they had me covered as well in the same way.

733
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,140
That's crazy.

734
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,500
We're not talking about them though this week.

735
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,860
We're talking about Bowl and Branch.

736
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,180
I just wanted to tell a fun story about when I shit my pants

737
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,300
and me undies was like,

738
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,780
they basically changed me like a mommy would.

739
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:20,740
Okay.

740
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,540
But the important thing is Bowl and Branch.

741
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,340
They and the sheets were some of the best I've ever slept on.

742
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,260
They were fantastic.

743
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,340
There's one important thing you do to make sure you have a good

744
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,180
day and let's get good sleep the night before.

745
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,500
You can go to Bowl and Branch.

746
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,300
They're gonna make that possible for you.

747
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,540
They've reinvented sheets and bedding with the sole purpose

748
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,700
of making your nights more comfortable than ever.

749
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,340
And here's the thing.

750
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,380
Maybe you're sitting there thinking,

751
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,940
oh, I've tried to buy sheets before I go to the,

752
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,620
you know, I go to the store and they're so expensive

753
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,780
and I don't know anything about thread count

754
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,740
and I'm a big sheets dummy and I'm stupid

755
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,060
and I don't know what's good, but stop it.

756
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,700
You're great.

757
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,220
One, two, the thing is at the stores,

758
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,580
you get so much overhead, right?

759
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,100
Because you're not just paying for the sheets.

760
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,060
You're paying for the building.

761
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,940
You're paying for the lights.

762
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,060
You're paying for all the employees.

763
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,620
You're paying for so much stuff that has nothing to do with the sheets.

764
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,020
You're paying for the special permit that buildings have to have

765
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,540
to have that many sheets inside of them.

766
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,180
Correct.

767
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,420
But Bowl and Branch, they keep the overhead low.

768
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,540
They don't sell in stores.

769
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,820
They just sell online.

770
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,100
They don't worry about thread count.

771
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,900
They just get good cotton.

772
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,100
That's what's important.

773
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,540
Thread count is a myth.

774
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,380
That's the thing that people tell you to make you buy overpriced sheets.

775
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,220
Bowl and Branch, they just focus on great sheets.

776
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,340
And so here's the thing.

777
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,260

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:35,380
And then it was up to you to solve the puzzle of how to make the meal out of those parts.

798
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,220
Ooh, what do you win if you solve it?

799
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,700
A meal.

800
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:38,740
Nice.

This week, just yesterday, I made udon chicken noodle soup, which turned out super good.

807
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,260
It was super tasty.

808
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,740
I'm not even like a chicken noodle soup guy, and it turned out great.

809
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,300
Little pro tip, a little food hack to put a little bit of sriracha in that, and it won't

810
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,580
lead you the wrong way.

811
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,540
Let me tell you about the ones for this week, right?

812
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,460
So the week of the 11th, when you're listening to this, here are some.

813
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,700
Buffalo chicken sandwiches with blue cheese salad.

814
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,200
Damn.

815
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,400
Seared salmon and salsa verde with orange spinach.

816
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,440
Ooh, I love the way you say verde.

817
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,640
Can you hit me with verde?

818
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,680
Oh, Jesus.

819
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,400
Oh, shit.

820
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,840
Chicken and drop biscuit casserole with, yeah, Cajun fried catfish and collard greens.

821
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,400
Lamb and beef gyros with roasted cauliflower.

822
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,960
That's fucking plenty.

823
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,520
Stop it.

824
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,040
Yeah, there's so many.

825
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,720
I think you mean collard verdes.

826
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,220
Verde.

827
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,600
Listen, last night.

828
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,800
And there's also, it's important to note, there's also vegetarian options.

829
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,160
Those are just all the meat options.

830
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,840
But listen, Travis, listen.

831
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:58,760
Last night, I ate rib-eye steak, perfectly prepared, thank you, Justin, with a hash made

832
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,400
of cremini mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, and roasted potatoes, thank you, Blue Apron.

833
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
Them shits was a slam dunk.

834
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Anyway.

835
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,280
Yeah, a slam dunk, right?

836
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,080
It's really amazing.

837
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,520
It's changed my life legit.

838
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:15,080
I've learned how to cook and made really amazing meals for myself and my wife with Blue Apron.

839
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,120
Huh?

840
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,320
And my wife.

841
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,440
I didn't say anything.

842
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,840
It's also important to note that if you're sitting here and going, yeah, but I don't

843
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,640
know how to cook.

844
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,000
Like, I buy all my meals frozen because I don't know what I'm doing.

845
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,280

It's from Sarah.

881

And it says, you know how we were going to donate some money to a good cause?

882
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Well, I decided to use it for this instead.

883
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,360
This is the best cause.

884
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,720
This is the best cause.

885
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,160
Happy 30th birthday.

886
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,880
Since you hate your birthday and everything surrounding it,

887
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,480
I thought we should celebrate it with NBNB AM's billions of listeners.

888
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,880
Here's to hundreds more awesome birthdays.

889
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,320
I love you, Robot David.

890
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,480
If only Robot David could feel love.

891
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,360
Well, that's the gift of the Magi twist right there, isn't it?

892
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,240
It's more of the term-

893
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,920
We needed this money to buy bolts.

894
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,880
It's the Terminator twist.

895
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,800
Because if Robot David understood what love is,

896
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,640
it would definitely, definitely be self-aware.

897
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,520
And that would be the ball game.

898
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,200
Happy birthday, Robot David.

899
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,960
That's what turned them into the Terminator?

900
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,480
Is they understood love and so he came back to kill John Connor?

901
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,760
Any complex human emotion.

902
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:23,880
Anything.

903
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,280
Okay.

904
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
So like anger and like-

905
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
That's not very complex, is it?

906
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,040
And hunger.

907
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,160
No, anger's pretty straightforward.

908
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,600
Desire for donuts.

909
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,000
Horny.

910
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,360
Horny.

911
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,560
Horny for donuts.

912
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,800
Are you troubled by a lack of astute yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

913
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,000
Do you experience feelings of laughter and enjoyment when you hear three friends go off on stupid tangents?

914
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,080
Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, ghost, or totally rad party dude house cat

915
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,560
who really only exists as a sound effect?

916
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,720
If the answer to any of these questions is yes,

917
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,040

I'm pretty sure we don't have the rights to this song.

925
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,760
Here's a yahoo.

926
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,800
Do you guys want a yahoo?

927
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,600
Yes.

928
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,320
Do you guys want to hear me do a yahoo and then we'll talk about it?

929
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Absolutely.

930
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,680
Yeah.

931
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,720
Um, got a couple here.

932
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,920
Hmm, got a couple here.

933
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,080
Do the best one.

934
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,240
Well, one of them is about Britishisms and I feel like we maybe already did that a bunch.

935
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,880
Oh yeah, that would not be great.

936
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,800
I think we, like, yeah, I think we got that.

937
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,280
Um, this, this one was sent in by level 9000 Yajiru Drew at Drew Davenport.

938
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,000
Thank you, Drew.

939
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's by Yajiru Answers user Cheetara who asks,

940
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,760
if you could live in someone's shoes for a day, who would it be?

941
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,260
Gross.

942
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,760
What?

943
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,000
If you could live in someone's shoes for a day, who would it be?

944
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,440
And then additional details.

945
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,680
Scott Bakula's wife.

946
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,940
Okay.

947
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,840
What?

948
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,280
Asked and answered.

949
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,920
Put it away.

950
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
File this one under read and completed.

951
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,320
So this is more of like a John Malkovich scenario,

952
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,760
like being John Malkovich and not like little old lady who lived in a shit.

953
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,840
I don't think he would be a, a silent passenger.

954
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,400
It's a silent passenger.

955
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,360
What if he was on business that one day?

956
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,360
One day.

957
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,400
Oh, what a twist.

958
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,120
Where are you?

959
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,480
I'm in New Orleans.

960
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm on set.

961
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,320
On a shoot.

962
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,800
I'm on set on the big easy.

963
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,720
Like you need to calm down right now.

964
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,080
You're not on camera, Scott.

965
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,200
We've talked about this.

966
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,760
For God's sake, Scott, dial it, rein it in.

967
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:02,520
I'm just trying to get, find me a poor boy down on the, down on the swamp lands.

968
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Scott, you're melting.

969
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,920
Boundaries, Scott.

970
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,560
Boundaries.

971
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,640
Can anybody find me one of them little crispy Louisiana donuts?

972
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,240
I done forgot what they called.

973
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,320
Hey Scott, it's me.

974
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,280
Dean Stockwell.

975
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,160
Your best friend.

976
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,040
Your wife called me.

977
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,640
She said she was really, really worried.

978
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,040
Oh, Dean, you gotta calm down.

979
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,720
I'll show you a good time.

980
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,960
Scott, first, first things first, Scott.

981
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,840
Listen, first things first, they're called beignets.

982
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,960
Second things first, rein it in.

983
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,840
Third things third, I've been controlled by somebody

984
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,000
who's left into my body for a day.

985
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,200
We're getting real close to gushy territory.

986
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,960
We do need to pedal away.

987
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,520
Pedal away.

988
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,160
We're away from gushy territory.

989
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,200
If you could live in someone's shoes for a day, who would it be?

990
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,600
Love, love Scott Bakula's wife.

991
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,320
Please, God, let me out of this.

992
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,880
You know who I'd like to be?

993
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,600
Who would you like to be?

994
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,680
I'd like to be that Benedict Cumberbatch.

995
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,320
Everyone seems to like him.

996
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,200
Yeah, he's very, he's very busy though.

997
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,640
I don't think that'd be great.

998
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,800
Cause you pop, you pop into his body and then like,

999
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,960
he's like on set in the new Star Trek or whatever.

1000
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,400
And then he, you fuck up his takes and then he never works again.

1001
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,760
Cause Travis, you're great at acting, but you wouldn't know how to control his body.

1002
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,240
You just wouldn't.

1003
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,720
That's true.

1004
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,080
It's a completely different mechanism.

1005
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,440
But I will say this, maybe it's a mutually beneficial thing.

1006
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,440
I jump in, I get to feel what it's like to be a Benedict Cumberbatch.

1007
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,600
But also Benedict Cumberbatch, I forced him to take the day off for once.

1008
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,360
Take a little Benedict time, right?

1009
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,720
And he's able to recover.

1010
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,840
Next day he wakes up and he's like,

1011
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,920
I feel like I've had a great day the day before.

1012
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,960
I don't remember any of it.

1013
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,320
Or is he in my body?

1014
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,360
Do we switch places?

1015
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,720
Is it a Freaky Friday thing?

1016
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,960
He's good for my career because he's in my body.

1017
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,840
I'm good for his mental health and wellbeing because I'm in his body.

1018
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,760
So we each learn a little bit about each other.

1019
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,320
He jumps into your body right when you're doing

1020
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,400
whatever it is Travis does at any given time.

1021
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
And I'm just saying, just looking at your schedule,

1022
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,640
I'm just going to say eating an entire ham.

1023
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,640
And he hops in, he's like,

1024
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,200
and chokes on the ham a little bit

1025
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,800
because he wasn't expecting to have ham in his mouth

1026
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,560
because he was just acting in the new Star Trek movie.

1027
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,120
And it was like wham, bam, thank you ham right there in his mouth.

1028
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,560
And he was like, what is this?

1029
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,400
What's this? What's all this said?

1030
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,480
Where's my cheekbones?

1031
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,880
Why do I have a beard?

1032
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,960
It's like Dr. Manhattan wearing a wig anymore.

1033
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,040
I look like just a regular person.

1034
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
This will be my greatest acting challenge ever.

1035
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,320
But then they would know that you weren't him, Travis,

1036
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,920
because the ultimate test for a fake Benedict Cumberbatch.

1037
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,520
If they made a recreation of The Thing,

1038
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,880
the horror movie The Thing,

1039
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,720
and they had to do the test to figure out who's alien

1040
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,680
and who is not alien.

1041
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,240
And in the fiction of this The Thing remake,

1042
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,520
first of all, it would be the second remake

1043
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,440
because they did remake it a few years ago.

1044
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,520
But everybody in it would be British actors

1045
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,960
and they would be playing themselves.

1046
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,760
And then you have the Benedict Cumberbatch there

1047
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,800
and it's like, Benedict Cumberbatch,

1048
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,000
we need to test if you're an alien or not.

1049
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,160
He's like, well, I won't say how that's gonna happen.

1050
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,800
And it's like, well, say your own name.

1051
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,440
And he's like, oh, it's easy.

1052
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,040
It's been, but it's Jumbadatch.

1053
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
It's Bimby Buck Blumberbatch.

1054
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,800
And it's like, kill him, fucking kill him.

1055
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,440
Get him, kill him, kill him, Hugh Laurie.

1056
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,480
And then I'm on the run.

1057
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,480
But luckily I've got those super long Cumberbatch legs.

1058
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,640
Yeah, you got those daddy long Cumberbatch legs.

1059
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,080
Just leaping over small children, hurdles.

1060
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
Much like Jack Skellington.

1061
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,600
Do you think when he heard they were making a movie

1062
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
called The Amazing Spider-Man,

1063
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,560
he was like, I'll audition for that.

1064
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,520
Cause I am one.

1065
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,160
Finally, I can unspool my other four legs

1066
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
that I keep tied to my body at all times.

1067
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,720
Benedict Cumberbatch is a living spider.

1068
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,440
True.

1069
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,480
Giant living spider.

1070
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:41,960
Right.

1071
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,560
I should have said giant spider.

1072
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,640
A living spider is not that impressive.

1073
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,160
Most are, I think.

1074
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,600
I share an apartment with another graduate student at home.

1075
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,000
We split rent, chores, kind of, and utilities.

1076
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,080
Our university gets an entire month off of school

1077
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,640
during winter.

1078
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,200
They've given specific dates here.

1079
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,320
That wasn't necessary.

1080
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,720
Thank you.

1081
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,240
And I went home.

1082
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,600
The dates are December 14th to January 19th.

1083
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,400
That's crazy.

1084
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,840
That's a long ass time.

1085
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,640
Chill break.

1086
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,560
Yeah, very chill.

1087
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,360
I went home.

1088
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,400
He remained at the apartment.

1089
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
The day I left, I paid my share of the utilities,

1090
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,480
which ended on like the 10th or the 11th.

1091
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,360
Now, since I paid that, I have not set foot in the apartment,

1092
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,640
meaning I haven't used an iota of utilities the whole month.

1093
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,320
The utilities will be due soon,

1094
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,760
and I don't know what to do.

1095
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,320
I just know he's gonna try to get me to pay half the utilities,

1096
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,520
even though I haven't used any.

1097
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,760
Am I responsible for half the utilities?

1098
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,840
My girlfriend thinks I should just pony up to keep the peace,

1099
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,400
but I don't know.

1100
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,360
What do you do, Sam?

1101
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,280
Okay, we've done this fucking question before.

1102
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,360
We did it from the other person's perspective.

1103
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,280
My deadbeat roommate won't pay for the utilities

1104
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,320
because he was gone for a month.

1105
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,680
Let's put this fucking thing to bed.

1106
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,360
Unless you're gonna start measuring out

1107
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,880
how much water everybody drinks

1108
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,920
and then come up with the ratio

1109
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
of how much of the water bill they're gonna start paying,

1110
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,320
you can't extrapolate that shit to this degree.

1111
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,440
You pay for your utilities.

1112
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,240
It's your house.

1113
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,320
You can't like, how many volts?

1114
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,600
How many volts, Brian?

1115
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,760
No, just pay your half the utilities.

1116
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,520
That's not how utilities works.

1117
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,720
When you enter into the lease,

1118
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,200
like you enter an agreement that we're splitting it.

1119
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,120
Not like while we're here.

1120
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,600
The only way out of this scenario

1121
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,480
is it's like you have to find someone to enter the cave

1122
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,760
so you can leave.

1123
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,240
Like you could like sublet your apartment

1124
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,440
for that month that you're gone,

1125
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,840
at which point, yeah, it's not your responsibility.

1126
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,120
It's that other person's.

1127
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,960
But right now there's a ghost of you

1128
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,440
still living in the apartment and it's all your stuff.

1129
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,040
And as long as all your stuff is there

1130
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,480
and your ghost is there,

1131
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,520
you have to pay half of that.

1132
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,440
Hold on, because I almost let you get away

1133
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
with what you said.

1134
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,200
There's a ghost of him there?

1135
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,640
Yeah, like his specter is still taking up the spot.

1136
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,400
I can't tell if you're speaking poetically

1137
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,160
or you're talking about like an actual phantasm

1138
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,280
that is like turning lights off.

1139
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,800
Well, I was speaking poetically,

1140
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,720
but now I'm thinking that maybe it would be better

1141
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,080
for the goof if I was speaking literally.

1142
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,520
And we're off to the races.

1143
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,800
Okay, but I mean, if you think about it,

1144
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,600
you're still there, like it's still your apartment.

1145
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,440
Like think about this,

1146
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,680
like you're the only one living in the apartment

1147
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,800
and you left for a month.

1148
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,960
You couldn't call your landlord and be like,

1149
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,880
I don't think I should have to pay rent.

1150
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,840
I wasn't there.

1151
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,440
Like that's not how it worked.

1152
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,400
You're in an agreement.

1153
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,120
Yeah, like you can't, it doesn't work this way.

1154
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,040
The agreement that you have made is that like,

1155
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm gonna take this space of earth

1156
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,120
and keep it from chaos.

1157
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,640
Like I will try to tame this piece of the wilderness

1158
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,680
and I will do my part.

1159
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,160
And part of that is like paying some money

1160
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,240
to keep it like warmed and watered and full.

1161
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,200
Now I will say this.

1162
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,600
Yeah, if you get back, right?

1163
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,680
And half the people have been living in the apartment

1164
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,520
for a month and your utilities are still the same amount.

1165
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,400
I think it does open up a conversation.

1166
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,200
You still have to pay.

1167
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,400
You still have to pay.

1168
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,000
But you can go to roommate and be like,

1169
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,640
hey, what were you doing while I was gone?

1170
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,600
Were you just like leaving water running for like days on it?

1171
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,120
How is it still the same?

1172
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,240
Half the people were here.

1173
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,160
You have to get more conservative

1174
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,760
about your utility use, Derek.

1175
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,880
You're using it all up.

1176
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,600
Have you seen a documentary?

1177
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,800
For your information,

1178
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,360
I had to put an inflatable cloud in the shower

1179
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,680
and turn it on while I played cool jerk

1180
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,840
to scare away some robbers.

1181
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,720
You monster.

1182
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,840
Thanks for asking how my break was.

1183
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,440
I had to put some weird hyper heater thing on a doorknob

1184
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,360
and I think you just choose through energy.

1185
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,320
And by the way, let's not talk about what that thing was

1186
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,480
because have they ever explained

1187
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,840
what the fuck that was that Kevin put up?

1188
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,760
I think it was a cattle brand.

1189
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,560
How the fuck do you have that McAllister's?

1190
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,040
It's from my weird sex dungeon.

1191
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,360
He has some access to things, huh?

1192
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
He got some access to some stuff, dude.

1193
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,040
He's Amazon Prime.

1194
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,160
What did he put on that doorknob?

1195
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,000
What did he put on that fucking doorknob that burned?

1196
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,600
How did it not burn the house down?

1197
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,640
How was it hot enough that it burned human flesh

1198
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,560
touching the other side of it?

1199
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,680
If the metal was red.

1200
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,920
That didn't like burn the house down.

1201
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,120
I can remember watching that as a kid

1202
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,440
and seeing that and thinking, I don't know what that is,

1203
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,720
but I bet when I'm an adult that I'll know what that is.

1204
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,840
They just don't let me know about it

1205
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,280
because I'm still a kid.

1206
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,840
Well, the bills come due, Chris Columbus.

1207
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,480
I'm an adult.

1208
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,320
I still don't know what the hell he's doing with that thing.

1209
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,800
That's some sci-fi bullshit.

1210
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,560
If it could make metal turn red,

1211
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,160
it would have set Joe Pesci's skeleton on fire

1212
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,080
inside of him.

1213
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,120
There's literally a point in the second one

1214
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,440
in which Daniel Stern is turned into an electrified skeleton

1215
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,160
and then he's fine.

1216
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,800
I almost always said Daniel Craig,

1217
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,080
but I knew that wasn't it.

1218
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,640
That would be a way better movie.

1219
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,880
We're Sticky Bandits, aren't we?

1220
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,280
How British is this episode?

1221
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,240
Daniel Craig versus Macaulay Culkin.

1222
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,280
Man, I would watch that movie.

1223
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,720
I'd watch the hell out that movie.

1224
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,520
So this is saying that, oh God,

1225
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,200
guess where I got this data?

1226
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,640
Uh, Yahoo Answers?

1227
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,920
Yeah, yeah.

1228
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,800
This says an iron is on top of the door

1229
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,040
and there's a bit of rope connected to the iron

1230
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,280
and wrapped around the door, which makes it hot.

1231
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,000
What?

1232
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,320
What?

1233
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,600
No, no.

1234
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,320
He hangs like what looks to be

1235
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,240
like just a portable heating element from an oven

1236
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,240
onto a doorknob.

1237
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,400
There is also an iron,

1238
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,480
but that's a completely separate shenanigan.

1239
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,320
I'm not saying to believe that Kevin McCallister

1240
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,400
is like a young Elon Musk

1241
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,920
and has invented like some sort of super heater rope.

1242
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,640
That movie would be sick too, wouldn't it be?

1243
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,840
Like the McCallister's parents would come home

1244
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,760
and there'd be all these like weird ornaments

1245
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,040
hanging on the trees and be like,

1246
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,640
what are these weird ornaments?

1247
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,560
And he'd be like, oh, well, I'm Elon Musk.

1248
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,680
So I just divided Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern

1249
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,880
down to their like chemical elemental components.

1250
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,320
Like that right there, that little element,

1251
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,560
that ornament there, that's Joe Pesci's carbon.

1252
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,440
Isn't that crazy?

1253
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,240
I'm Elon Musk.

1254
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,160
I'm a murderer.

1255
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,120
I have an answer.

1256
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,680
It is an electric charcoal lighter.

1257
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,200
Is what?

1258
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,560
Is what he has there.

1259
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:05,560
That's nothing.

1260
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,320
It's an electric charcoal lighter.

1261
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,200
That's not a thing.

1262
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,960
Do Google image search and you'll be like,

1263
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,920
ah, dunk.

1264
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,960
I guess that's what it was.

1265
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,520
Hold on.

1266
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,960
You still won't know what it is though.

1267
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,960
What does one do with that?

1268
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,560
It wouldn't, I think you like charcoal electronically speaking.

1269
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,760
I, thank you.

1270
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,320
But like.

1271
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,760
But you wouldn't set, you wouldn't turn metal red enough

1272
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,240
to set Joe Pesci's skeleton on fire inside of him.

1273
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,520
Wouldn't happen.

1274
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,920
And you also probably shouldn't leave this

1275
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,200
where kids can get to it.

1276
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,600
Well, that's true of like everything in the McAllister household.

1277
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:37,960
Yeah.

1278
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,080
Like what is everyone in that house doing the rest of the year

1279
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,720
that justifies all of this crazy shit?

1280
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:45,960
Yeah.

1281
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,240
Killing burglars.

1282
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,040
It's got to be, they have to be like a freelance burglar killing.

1283
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,560
It's like Dexter, but like way not as justified

1284
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,680
for the stuff that they're doing.

1285
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,720
You know what I mean?

1286
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,400
Like Dexter kills serial killers.

1287
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,800
They just go to like, if they find out that a shitty burglar

1288
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,440
is planning a heist anywhere in one of their neighbors houses.

1289
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,440
And I'm sure their neighbors like look the other way, right?

1290
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,880
Cause they don't want to get burgled.

1291
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,960
Well, it's a, it's a family full of vigilantes.

1292
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,160
And like when you're a vigilante, everyone's like, I don't,

1293
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,120
I wouldn't do it.

1294
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,440
I don't condone it, but I understand the need of it.

1295
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,040
It's not the family we want.

1296
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,480
It's the family we deserve, right?

1297
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,120
Is that it?

1298
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,240
If, but let me hit you with this.

1299
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,040
If the wet bandits have killed, then Home Alone

1300
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,200
is a lengthy prequel to Dexter.

1301
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,720
Like it could be envisioned that way that like,

1302
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,320
this is how he gets his start.

1303
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,320
He wants to let, make it take its time.

1304
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,920
They have also killed.

1305
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,880
They do that off screen the moment before the shot

1306
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,200
like opens up before the film begins.

1307
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,440
That's a weird tone to set, don't you think?

1308
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,120
It's that's why it's not in the film, right?

1309
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,800
It's in my fan fiction that I've written.

1310
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,560
Hold on.

1311
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,240
I have a flyer here somewhere.

1312
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,880
Crumple, crumple, crumple to my backpack.

1313
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,680
Hold on.

1314
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,080
Justin.

1315
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,800
I am not coming to the dramatic reading of your fan fiction.

1316
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,360
Hold on.

1317
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,080
It's in here somewhere.

1318
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,960
Home Alone, Home Alone Zero, Blood in the Snow.

1319
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,280
Wow.

1320
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,560
That's a big fucking backpack.

1321
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,440
Yeah.

1322
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,120
There's a lot of documents.

1323
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,440
A lot of prequels to a lot of things.

1324
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,320
What else you got in there?

1325
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,520
What other pre-pre's?

1326
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,800
What other pre-pre's you got?

1327
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,560
I got a prequel to Uncle Buck.

1328
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,840
It's called My Brother Buck.

1329
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:25,720
Kids.

1330
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,840
We got one.

1331
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,040
It looks like we got Cool Runnings.

1332
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,080
This one's just called Runnings because they were doing that before.

1333
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,960
It's just regular.

1334
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,720
They just do it regular.

1335
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,840
There's a prequel to the fly called The Guy.

1336
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,480
I have that.

1337
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,080
It's in here.

1338
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,960
I can't find it.

1339
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,000
I'll have to get it later.

1340
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,720
You should publish these.

1341
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,400
I've been telling you that for years.

1342
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,360
You're right.

1343
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,240
You're right.

1344
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,120
What are you afraid of?

1345
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,440
Just failure.

1346
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,960
Just being ostracized.

1347
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,600
I have a Forrest Gump prequel called Dumb Baby.

1348
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,240
Well, that one's mean.

1349
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,520
What?

1350
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,400
That one's mean.

1351
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,520
Why?

1352
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,680
It's not his fault.

1353
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,360
He's canonically dumb.

1354
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:10,760
Okay.

1355
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,880
But that's a dumb like you can't-

1356
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,240
That's not a good like you can't be like,

1357
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,440
here's a prequel to Borat.

1358
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,640
It's called Young Borat.

1359
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,920
No, but like if you said,

1360
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,040
here's a prequel to Borat.

1361
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,640
It's called Hairy Baby.

1362
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,440
That would be a different thing.

1363
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,240
Foreign Baby.

1364
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,280
Okay.

1365
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,240
But then so then to extrapolate that like anything,

1366
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,000
anything like Sling Blade-

1367
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,800
Oh, you're saying it's not special because it's like a baby.

1368
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,120
Yeah.

1369
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,320
This is Billy Bob Baby.

1370
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,040
What?

1371
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,200
Sorry.

1372
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,160
The prequel to Sling Blade.

1373
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,280
Baby Bob.

1374
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,160
Baby Bob.

1375
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,200
Baby Bob Thornton.

1376
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,440
Baby Bob.

1377
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,200
This is called Adventures in Baby.

1378
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,360
It's about when the babysitter was a baby.

1379
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:48,600
Right.

1380
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,280
Adventures in Our Parents Are Home.

1381
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,760
It's the sequel.

1382
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,640
Please tell mom the babysitter's fine.

1383
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,080
Check in with mom.

1384
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,360
The babysitter just got here.

1385
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,560
Dustin serves orbits for the right place to check into

1386
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,240
because later he'll be checking in.

1387
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,520
Dustin confirms his reservation.

1388
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,800
Dustin has to wait till 4 p.m.

1389
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,480
because the room's not quite ready yet.

1390
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,400
This is my new movie, The Hendersons.

1391
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,000
Do you guys want to go out to the woods this weekend?

1392
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,480
Yeah.

1393
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,280
Sure.

1394
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:26,920
Sounds fun.

1395
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,400
Have you seen the new historical musical 1775?

1396
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,520
Everything's pretty chill.

1397
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,040
It's pretty chill actually.

1398
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,480
So is that it?

1399
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,360
Yeah.

1400
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,560
Yep, that's gonna do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1401
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,840
We hope you've had some fun.

1402
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,320
We also hope you've learned something.

1403
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,760
Hope you've grown, right?

1404
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,240
Learned something and grown.

1405
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,880
Want to say a big thank you to John Roderick and Long Winter

1406
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,920
who used their theme song It's a Departure off the album

1407
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,880
Putting the Days to Bed.

1408
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,360
You can go get that and just enjoy it.

1409
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,880
Just drink it in.

1410
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,800
We also want to say thanks again to Blue Apron who makes cooking at home easy.

1411
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,400
Even if you have no idea what you're doing,

1412
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,800
you can get your first two meals free by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

1413
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,040
We are all three users, all three fans.

1414
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,040
Blueapron.com slash my brother.

1415
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,280
Can we talk about new projects?

1416
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,480
Yeah.

1417
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,040
Is your new project gonna be live by the time this goes up, you think?

1418
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,240
Hard to say.

1419
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,520
Probably not, but I can say that I'll give a little bit more details.

1420
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,000
Teresa and I are working on a new podcast

1421
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,800
that we're hoping to have live and ready to go.

1422
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,760
We're traveling this weekend, so that kind of slowed us down a little bit.

1423
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,800
But hopefully, at least by the end of the month, if not sooner.

1424
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,880
So keep an eye out for that.

1425
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,480
My wife Rachel and I made a podcast.

1426
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,000
It'll be out.

1427
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,360
I think I'll get it up today, actually.

1428
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,360
Although it's not gonna be on iTunes.

1429
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,320
Just look at my Twitter.

1430
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,840
I'll tweet about it, where to find it.

1431
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,320
Still tentatively titled.

1432
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,840
I think we're gonna go with Rose Buddies,

1433
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,520
and it's our podcast where we talk about The Bachelor,

1434
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,600
The Bachelor in Paradise family products.

1435
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,920
Very enthusiastic about this project.

1436
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,640
Please listen and let me know what you think.

1437
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,560
If we should do a full podcast out of it.

1438
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:16,200
Also, I've started a new video series on Polygon called Griffin's Amiibo Corner.

1439
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,480
We're reviewing Amiibo toys.

1440
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Griffin and I make a lot of video game videos.

1441
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,960
A lot of people still are just now getting into it.

1442
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,080
Search YouTube for a series called Monster Factory

1443
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,000
that Griffin and I make.

1444
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,600
A lot of people will like that.

1445
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,760
We need to get back on that fucking bus.

1446
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,560
It's about us trying to break video games and succeeding,

1447
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,920
but also breaking ourselves.

1448
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,560
We also do a lot of other podcasts.

1449
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,640
You can check out Sawbones, The Adventure Zone, Bunker Buddies,

1450
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,200
Trends Like These, Can I Pet Your Dog?

1451
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,440
Also, Till Death Do Us Blart.

1452
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,720
We haven't mentioned it in a while.

1453
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,960
It's our annual podcast with us and the guys from The Worst Idea of All Time,

1454
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,440
where every American Thanksgiving we watch and review Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

1455
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,880
for the rest of time when one of us dies, we will be replaced

1456
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,320
and the show will continue.

1457
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,080
You can find it on iTunes.

1458
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,680
Till Death Do Us Blart.

1459
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,840
Is that going to do it?

1460
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,400
We have other shows.

1461
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,640
There's other shows on the Maximum Fun Network you should also listen to.

1462
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,040
Oh, sure.

1463
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:17,400
Jordan Jesse Go, Can I Pet Your Dog, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Throwing Shade.

1464
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,120
There's a new show called Getting Curious that's very funny.

1465
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,040
There's a ton, a ton, a ton, a ton of stuff,

1466
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,920
and it's all free and it's all good to listen to with your ears.

1467
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,000
It's all at Maximumfun.org, just waiting for you to experience it.

1468
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,040
And we haven't mentioned it in a while,

1469
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,080
but if you want to hear us talk about either something business-wise

1470
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,560
or something personal on the Money Zone,

1471
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,840
just go to Maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

1472
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,720
Be aware that we're, you know, pretty solidly booked.

1473
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,840
So if you want something in the future, go buy it now.

1474
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,300
Okay.

1475
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,760
Oh, and there's a lot of merch, www.MaxFunStore.com.

1476
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,000
Yes.

1477
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,880
We've probably talked enough.

1478
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,400
We also have the Maximum Fun Facebook group,

1479
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,600
which is quickly turning into, like,

1480
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,840
Lin-Manuel Miranda's just, like, private, just dumping grounds on me.

1481
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,000
Well, that's the My Brother, My Brother and Me group.

1482
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,360
We also have the Maximum Fun group.

1483
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:04,840
Oh, yeah.

1484
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,720
Join both of them.

1485
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,400
All right, let's wrap this shit up.

1486
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,360
That's gonna do it for us.

1487
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,880
Griffith, you have a final Yahoo.

1488
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,800
Yeah, this one was sent in by Liz Bush.

1489
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,680
Thank you, Liz.

1490
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Black, who asks,

1491
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,720
Did anybody have sex in the 1990s?

1492
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,560
Did it feel different from now?

1493
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,000
My name's Justin McElroy.

1494
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,840
I'm Travis McElroy.

1495
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,040
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1496
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,760
Kiss your dad.

1497
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,080
On the lips.

1498
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:52,120
Maximum Fun.org.

1499
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,160

Every Tuesday, we bring you Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine, a show about all

1506
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,720
the dumb, weird, terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

1507
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,880
You know, some light summer listening.

1508
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,520
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

1509
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,040
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

1510
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:28,200
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday right here on the Maximum Fun network

1511
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:35,880
with Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine.
