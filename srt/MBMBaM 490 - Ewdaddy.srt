1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother. I've just been handed this,

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:06,720
He's Griffin, I'm Justin, and this is How We Do It. This is a holiday special in the sense that

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,920
it is mid-December. Fair, and the holidays are here again, and we wanted to share with you some

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,440
of our holiday recommendations, ways that you can make it really special, specific to different

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:29,200
holidays. I want to talk about my favorite holiday movies, Justin.

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
Okay, what are they, Travis?

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
I like the one-

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
I want to talk about my favorite Christmas cookies.

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,520
This is a sub-bracket. This is a sub-bracket within the kind of a carrot.

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,400
Okay, Griffin, you go, and then we'll slingshot back up.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,880
You've heard of Elf on a Shelf. Well, what about Dilf on a Shilf?

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
How is that a cookie?

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Oh, no, I changed it again.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,760
Damn it.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,880
The subject. We can't get through a complete holiday thought this episode, Travis. You know the rules.

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
I want to talk about my favorite holiday sweaters.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, Travis, what's your favorite holiday sweater?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,160
I like the fuzzy ones.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, listener, now, if you looked at your touch-tone phone, you can press 1 if you want

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
to hear a bit about movies, press 2 if you want to hear the sweater thing,

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,960
and press 3 if you want to talk about cookies.

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,160
Oh, they've chosen movies. Okay, my favorite movies is the one where the birch log is crackling,

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,000
and you can see a couple of the stockings hanging, and it goes for about an hour.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,560
I love that. Chevy Chase is so funny. I like the one where it's a fireplace,

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:48,960
but it has not been enkindled, and there's an okay dad, and he's in the fireplace trying to fix it,

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,880
and it's an hour of him just sort of clanging around, and there's long stretches where you just

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,640
kind of see his jeans, and it looks like he's laying perfectly still in there for 15 minutes,

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,320
just because he's too ashamed to come out and get on Google, and maybe actually he

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,160
likes it in there. It's quiet. In the fireplace? He likes it in the fireplace? It's quiet.

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,720
He's standing up in the chimney. It's a big chimney at this point. He's up in it.

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,520
I like the one where it's the people renting an Airbnb, and they light a fire in the fireplace

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,240
because it's the holidays, but they don't realize that the flu was closed years and years ago,

39
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,040
and so the house fills with smoke, and they end up having to call the fire department.

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,360
The fire department comes and puts it out, and then they have to pay for smoke damages to the

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,480
house. And then Kirk Cameron shows up and saves everyone with his face. Yeah, and he just keeps

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,960
yelling, fireproof! Yeah, it's pretty good. I like the one where it's a family watching a video

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,160
of the Christmas log, but the family looks nicer than your family. I mean, this is a hot family.

44
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,480
Yeah, they've got it going on. Is that the one where it looks like you're looking through the

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,120
window at them? Yeah, that's a good one. I like the one where it's a family, but they're not

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,240
watching the fireplace. It's just lit behind them. They have turned to face you, and they stare right

47
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,160
at you for one hour in complete silence. I like the one that's exactly like that,

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,800
but they're talking to each other instead of looking at the fireplace, and I'm just screaming

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,280
at the screen. Come on! Look at that beautiful fireplace, y'all. You're missing the best show

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,720
on Earth. I like the one where it's kind of like that, and I'm looking into their window,

51
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,280
watching them watch a fire and talk to each other, and then I show up in it, but it's like a slightly

52
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,920
better looking me who looks happy and more successful than I am, and then I slowly fade

53
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,760
away in real life. Oh, fascinating. Yeah, I like that one a lot. I like the one where a family of

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:14,240
fires watches a box of human flesh. Just sort of jibbling and gurgling around. I like Evil Dead 2.

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:26,480
Oh, okay. And another thing. I don't want to get off on a tangent, but I couldn't get through the

56
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,560
series. I don't know. It wasn't the same. So this is our advice show. No, it's a holiday special.

57
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,880
Our next episode is explicitly going to be our holiday special, so I don't know what this is.

58
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,480
This one's special because of how non-holiday themed it's going to seem.

59
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,760
The episode you heard last Monday was recorded that Monday. This episode is recorded the Wednesday

60
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,720
after that. So right now, I don't think my brothers are very funny, but no, it's not you.

61
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:06,240
I also don't think I'm funny. It's just like I should be doing yard work. That's what my human

62
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:15,040
body right now is built for, is yard work. You know, just like a grownup sort of yard business.

63
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, we got all the wiggles out.

64
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Yeah, I can't. Travis is right. I can't be silly right now.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,520
And you all want me to be silly right now? I've got hedges to trim.

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,920
Yeah, our parents took us to the kids' museum.

67
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah, Justin, fucking grip it and rip it, baby. Slop that down, dude. Shit,

68
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,320
yeah, dude. Crack one for the big boy. Fuck, yeah, dude.

69
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
Yeah, let the big dog hunt.

70
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,920
Let the big dog out, dude, and cram it, dude. Shit, yeah.

71
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,320
Come on. Growl, big dog.

72
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,040
Justin, if you would just open those before we started recording,

73
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,680
this wouldn't have to be an ongoing segment.

74
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Okay, here's a real thing.

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,320
I don't want to talk about it. I just fainted.

76
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,240
Wait.

77
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
I just fainted for a second.

78
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,360
From that. While I was laughing, I fainted. What do you guys think about that?

79
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,640
Well, we talked about this two episodes ago, and now it's come to pass.

80
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,400
Fucking, I know, dude, goosebumps.

81
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
That is my favorite episode of Goosebumps.

82
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,760
It becomes real in real life. Goosebumps.

83
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,960
Yeah.

84
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,640
We did a podcast about it, and then it became real in real life Goosebumps.

85
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
That's actually what RL stands for, is real life Stein.

86
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,600
Not a lot of people know that.

87
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
Juice, it's probably not great.

88
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,240
You should-

89
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
It's fine, but it's fun though. I'm having fun with my brothers,

90
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,320
and I'm sitting in a comfortable chair. It's fine.

91
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,840
Yeah, it's fine and fun.

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
And listen, if this causes Justin to die,

93
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,200
he'll die doing what he loves, thinking I'm really funny.

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,400
Great jokes, yeah.

95
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,920
Having great jokes. It wasn't even a joke. It was just you observing the fact that I

96
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,280
cracked open a refreshing Pepsi Zero Sugar.

97
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah, dog.

98
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
I go to an art university, and we usually have critiques where we talk about our works at the

99
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,880
end of the semester. One of my professors, who is really nice, usually brings in some

100
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,920
cookies he made for the critiques. However, the cookies have a large nut in them and love them,

101
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,040
and I do not like eating them, but I do enjoy the cookie parts.

102
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,200
I tried to pick out the nut, but the cookies made in such a way that it basically exploded

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
into powder in my hands if I do so. What do I do, brothers? Do I eat around the nut

104
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,840
and throw it away when no one's looking? Do I decline the cookie even though I like eating

105
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,760
them? I don't want to be rude and decline the cookies that he has made. That's from Cookie

106
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,400
Conundrum.

107
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,960
That's art, isn't it?

108
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,460
What?

109
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,160
This is art. This could be art.

110
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,280
This could be an art piece.

111
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,040
This is an art piece, and it's talking about how we all have...

112
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:55,520
We all sort of put out a good energy, a positive energy, but inside, we're all a little nuts,

113
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,480
aren't we?

114
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,980
Oh!

115
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,800
That could be sort of what it's saying. Regardless, it is a food crime, what they've done. Nobody

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,280
wants to be eating something and then change what they're eating to include one big nut.

117
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,080
Correct.

118
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,040
Do you know what I'm...

119
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,440
Yes.

120
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,920
Right.

121
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,720
No matter how much you love nuts, and please don't tweet at me about how much you love nuts,

122
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm saying that you hit the middle and there's a little jelly in there, amazing. You hit

123
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,280
the middle, there's a little chocolate kiss, amazing. You hit the middle and there's a

124
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,680
nut?

125
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,240
There's one big nut, and you chop the nut up and mix it in. Okay, now I'm eating a

126
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,880
nut cookie. I'm not eating a nut at the same time as the cookie. Do you know what I mean?

127
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,320
Nobody wants this.

128
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,720
A nut?

129
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,000
A whole nut?

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,800
A nut? Now, here's what you could do. You could take a little bit after one of the greatest

131
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,240
artists of all time, Bob Ross, and adopt yourself a pet squirrel. Bring that pet squirrel with

132
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,800
you. You eat the cookie. You hand that squirrel the nut. That's a treat for both of you.

133
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
That's good.

134
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
And a fun affectation.

135
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
That's why Bob had it.

136
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
Yep. Bob hated nuts.

137
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,960
This professor's bringing in cookies for critique. Maybe they should get in on the fun. In the

138
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,360
spirit of critique, I'd like to give you some mild feedback on your cookies.

139
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,600
Yeah?

140
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,000
The cookie parts we're all wild about, but I talked to our entire class, had a meeting.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,480
Oh, oh, oh, okay. Go to them and say our entire class had a discussion. You must do this in

142
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,840
private. Our entire class had a discussion and I've been nominated to be the spokesperson.

143
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,760
We don't like your whack cookies, except all of it. We do like, but the nut part, got to

144
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,720
go, Kiyosabe. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

145
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,920
Where did you even find a nut that huge?

146
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
Because no one wants it.

147
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,320
But the problem with that, Justin, is if you're critiquing the cookie with the nut the same

148
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,280
way one might critique a painting, it's basically what you're saying is, I really love the frame

149
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,520
around it, but right there in the center where you put paint, I hate that part. I like the

150
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,360
cookie that frames the nut, you see.

151
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,720
You're being so obtuse, Travis. That's absolutely not the same thing.

152
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,240
Is the nut not the paint in this nut where he's taken cookie and he's put his spin on

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,760
it with nut?

154
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,320
It really is kind of like an inversion of what you just said, Travis, because the art

155
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,640
is the cookie and then the frame is in the middle. That is as wild, like if a painting

156
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
did that, that is what this teacher has done.

157
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,920
Y'all, that would be good art right there.

158
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,480
It's just some thin paint around a big thing of wood and you'd be like, I flipped them.

159
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,400
What do you think about this?

160
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,360
Does this mean something?

161
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,560
Is this art for you?

162
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm the first one to have flipped them.

163
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm the first one to do that, so that's for sure art.

164
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
Nobody else has flipped them before.

165
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,760
I have a yahoo.

166
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
Did you guys hear about the banana art?

167
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,660
Yeah.

168
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,720
It's crazy, right?

169
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,200
What?

170
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,760
Thanks, Travis.

171
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Yeah. Hey, I thought I was one-twoing your joke, big dog.

172
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,320
Banana art.

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah, I heard about this.

174
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
Let's see what Justin goes through.

175
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,400
Everybody buckle up.

176
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,720
Justin's about to make an observation.

177
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,400
When someone asks a question about have you heard of something, saying yes kills the-

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm saying it's the end of it.

179
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,400
Yes, I've heard of it and I can't wait to hear your humorous observation about the banana,

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,040
Justin.

181
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,680
The implication is yes, I've heard of it and there's no reason for you to recap it.

182
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,160
So we can't actually summon-

183
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
Griffin hasn't heard about it.

184
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
I got your back.

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,720
Hey, Griffin, you gotta hear what Justin's about to say.

186
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
It's so funny and-

187
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,280
Oh, about the banana art?

188
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm already aware.

189
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,640
Please go on because the third party in this group doesn't know about the banana art.

190
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,880
Artist in Miami got a banana.

191
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,480
He taped it to a wall and he priced it at $120,000.

192
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,720
This is excellent.

193
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,760
We're all agreed.

194
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,040
That is good.

195
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
It's art, right?

196
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,760
Yeah, that's art.

197
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,880
Then another cat came in and he ate the extremely expensive art banana off the wall.

198
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
And his quote when he said it is,

199
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Maurizio, it's a good banana-

200
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
That's the artist's name.

201
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,880
Maurizio, it's a good banana, I have to say.

202
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,160
I don't know if that was part-

203
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,640
Okay, so here's a wild thing.

204
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,880
The second guy who ate the banana is a performance artist and he ate the original art.

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,880
Can you do that?

206
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,280
Yeah.

207
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,200
Because I don't think you're allowed to just make your art around a different art.

208
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,040
Like, can you eat something else art to say that's art now?

209
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
I just farted on Starry Night.

210
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,200
So now who's the artist?

211
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,240
Not you?

212
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
I just did a big punch through water lilies, so-

213
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,480
That's something.

214
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
That's something.

215
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,400
That's art.

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,120
That's art.

217
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,280
I have a Yahoo that was sent in by like 50 different people.

218
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,920
Thanks, everyone.

219
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
It's Yahoo Answers user Jah who asks,

220
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,520
is dirt a spice?

221
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,760
Huh?

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,240
Is dirt, comma, a spice?

223
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,040
You know how all spices come from the ground?

224
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,920
Well, so does dirt.

225
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,400
I don't see why we're not using it to season our food.

226
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,080
I mean, I guess in a very broad sense, all spice comes from the ground

227
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,560
because, like, it grows on plants, a lot of it, which comes out of the ground, I suppose.

228
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, dirt's just a, you know, bed for a plant.

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,160
But a strong case could be made that salt is dirt.

230
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,880
Salt is rock, right?

231
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,960
Yeah, it's like a little rock.

232
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,040
I mean, dirt is just small rock, right?

233
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,440
You lost me there, Trav.

234
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,560
There you didn't get me.

235
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
Dirt is just ground up rock.

236
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,560
I think it's different stuff.

237
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,760
I think dirt is just really ground up rock.

238
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,320
Are you sure?

239
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
Hey, I'm not sure, Griffin, but I don't see why it wouldn't be.

240
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,920
Well, shit, hold up.

241
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,960
What else would it be?

242
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,080
Ground up tree?

243
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,680
It's probably ground up tree and plant.

244
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,760
I mean, it's probably a combination of a lot of things.

245
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm just saying that there's probably some ground up rock in there.

246
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,320
I'm just saying there was somebody who got this crunchy white stuff

247
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,400
and put it on some chips in caveman days and ate it and was like,

248
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,720
that one is a spice.

249
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
Yeah, keep going with that.

250
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,760
Grand announcement.

251
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
This one is a spice, but then they got-

252
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,400
The white hard dirt, that's spice.

253
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,200
That's spice.

254
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,960
That one's spice.

255
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,240
Let me try this red flower.

256
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,960
Grind that up.

257
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,400
Ooh, it hurt my mouth.

258
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,800
That one's spice too, I decided.

259
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,080
That's what I'm calling it, spice too.

260
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
It's the second spice.

261
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
Now let me get some of this brown stuff on my chips.

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
Mmm, not a spice.

263
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,160
Unfortunately, not a spice.

264
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
Okay, but let me, I'm going to complicate this.

265
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
If you have a big pile of dirt, right?

266
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,480
And then you dump a jar of cinnamon into it and then you stir it all up.

267
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,520
You don't say that you have dirt and cinnamon.

268
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,120
You have dirt, right?

269
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
Like you just have more different spicy dirt.

270
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,440
That is true.

271
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
Like it just has to become dirt.

272
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,560
When reintegrated into dirt, it's dirt.

273
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,840
Well, how much dirt would I have to put in the cinnamon jar

274
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,720
before it stops being cinnamon juice?

275
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
I was about to say one to one, but that's not true, right?

276
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,760
Like there, I think that there would be, what is the-

277
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,400
I could put a little bit of dirt and some cinnamon

278
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,840
and I think I would still eat the cinnamon if pressed.

279
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,080
Right.

280
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,320
Right?

281
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,960
Like, but what is the amount?

282
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Oh, this is a fun game.

283
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,920
Is how dirty just would it have to be for you to not want it anymore?

284
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,960
It helps because the visual of cinnamon blends in.

285
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,840
Whereas if this was like very fine, yes.

286
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,160
If this was fine salt and you threw some like really dark dirt in there,

287
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm like, oh, I can see it.

288
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,840
That's gross.

289
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,160
Umami is all the rage.

290
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,120
Thanks.

291
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,280
It's all the rage right now.

292
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,480
It's just dirt.

293
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,920
People don't like sour.

294
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,360
People don't like sweet.

295
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,280
Spicy hurts our tongue now and everybody wants to talk about umami.

296
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,800
And so they're doing, they're trying the fish and squishing mushrooms.

297
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,360
They're making the hamburgers.

298
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,800
They're making the hamburgers.

299
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,360
They spin of the pizza and they're making it so umami.

300
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,160
It's really a matter of time, right?

301
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:36,080
Before we just scoop up scoop fulls of this brown ground up tree stuff.

302
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,440
That's my new flavor.

303
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,320
Ew, daddy.

304
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,720
And it's just gross.

305
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
And it's a gross flavor.

306
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
You have sour, you got sweet.

307
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
You got, I don't know, the other ones.

308
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
And then you have savory and the umami.

309
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
I mean, you have gross and you call it ew, daddy.

310
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,560
That's a good point, Travis.

311
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,360
You don't say, like, if I eat something really raunchy,

312
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,120
I don't say it's like sour or sweet.

313
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,000
I just say, like, ugh, it sucks.

314
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
Yeah, this is a really gross flavor.

315
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,760
Ew, daddy.

316
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,880
Why can't gross be a flavor, right?

317
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,400
Right, yeah.

318
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
Nobody's like, oh, I accidentally ate goat barf.

319
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
It could have used more sugar.

320
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,920
It's like, that is irredeemable.

321
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,360
It has a new term, which is ew, daddy.

322
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
Okay, all right, it begs the question.

323
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,040
If you have, let's say, goat barf, right?

324
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,760
And you have goat barf and it's fucking repellent.

325
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,560
The fact that you don't assign a flavor,

326
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,720
if you assign any flavor to it,

327
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
the implication is that with an addition

328
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,200
of enough other flavors, it could be good.

329
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,840
It's like, it's, oh, it's bitter.

330
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,720
Well, if you add some sugar and salt and sour,

331
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,920
maybe it'd be good then.

332
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,480
No, it's not, because it's not any of the flavors.

333
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,360
It's ew, daddy.

334
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,400
It's ew, daddy.

335
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,800
No.

336
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,680
Ew, daddy.

337
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,400
You serve up goat barf on Top Chef,

338
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Tom Colicchio would be like,

339
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
did you taste this before you sent it out?

340
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,320
And you'd have to be like, no, Tom, you fucking pervert.

341
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
It's fucking foul.

342
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
Hey, Justin, did you taste the back of this

343
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
Nintendo Switch cartridge before you brought it out?

344
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,520
Because it's ew, daddy.

345
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
Thank you, that's what I was going for.

346
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
That would be good, because then when someone's like,

347
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,200
this food is gross, you'd be like, yes, got them.

348
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,080
Got them, did it.

349
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
How do I-

350
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,800
Welcome to my themed garbage pail kids restaurant.

351
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,160
How do I get people to notice that I'm great at Sudoku?

352
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,520
It's like they don't even care.

353
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,040
That's from Dean from Ohio.

354
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
I care, Dean.

355
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,560
We all care, Dean.

356
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,840
Here's the thing, right?

357
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,960
There are many skills.

358
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,640
The world is unfair, because, oh, somebody runs so fast?

359
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,520
Super cool.

360
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,640
Everybody loves that.

361
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,440
Oh, they're so, I do a Sudoku real fast?

362
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,640
Nothing.

363
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,000
No one's taking my picture to put on a magazine or whatever.

364
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,960
I've been struggling with this lately,

365
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,800
because I'm getting good at Rubik's Cubes,

366
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,160
and I have them littered all around my home.

367
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
I have noticed that.

368
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,000
And the problem is, it's very hard.

369
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
So here's the way you could tell.

370
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,880
There's limited ways you can communicate

371
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
that you're getting pretty good at the Rubik's Cube.

372
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,080
Here's a list of them, because I researched this thoroughly.

373
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,360
At this point, one, say it on a podcast.

374
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,080
No one cares.

375
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,960
Two, leave unsolved Rubik's Cubes around your home,

376
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,200
and then when someone is nearby,

377
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
you begin solving it and just hope to fucking God

378
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,520
that they somehow can maintain attention

379
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
on you solving the Rubik's Cube

380
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,920
for long enough for you to get to the solution.

381
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,960
Because if they look over and you just have

382
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,840
a solved Rubik's Cube in your hand, who gives a shit?

383
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,760
Maybe it was solved before.

384
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
They have to be there for the process,

385
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,360
and no one wants to watch it.

386
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,760
But at least then, Justin, you have the benefit

387
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,040
of easy color.

388
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,600
You can look at a Rubik's Cube

389
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,920
and see if it's correctly solved or not.

390
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Whereas if you slam a Sudoku in 45 seconds,

391
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,680
you can hold it up and say, I did it.

392
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,360
And unless that person wants to check your math

393
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,040
and make sure that all the numbers are in the correct spot,

394
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
they don't give two shits.

395
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,840
It doesn't matter, even if you did it in one second.

396
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,000
If I was sitting next to you on the plane

397
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,160
and you popped out your number two pencil

398
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,080
and got out the hard Sudoku from the Washington Post

399
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,200
and you cleared your throat super loud

400
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
so that I had to look over at you,

401
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,880
and I watched you solve the Sudoku

402
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,000
in one and a half seconds, and you hold it up

403
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,280
and be like, holy shit, did you see that?

404
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,040
I would be like, yeah, it's a child's number game.

405
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,320
I guess you solved the child's number game.

406
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,680
I have so much of my own shit going on

407
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,280
in my own head right now

408
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
that it's hard for me to get excited, Justin,

409
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
about your child's color shape

410
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
that you like to twist and spin

411
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,600
because I have sort of other more engaging,

412
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,720
important stuff going on.

413
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,760
And by me, I mean us, all of us, the rest of us.

414
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,120
But people like to celebrate when people are good

415
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
at the child's ball throwing game

416
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
or the child's ball kicking game.

417
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Why can't we be good at child's paper games?

418
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Because those are badass and cool to see.

419
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,760
What if I did a Sudoku in a really cool way?

420
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,960
Not fucking possible.

421
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
I'm doing it on my bicycle, no hands on the handlebar

422
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,320
because they're busy with the number two pencil.

423
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,120
It's reckless.

424
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,840
It's reckless.

425
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
That's just reckless.

426
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,400
Yeah, now I'm the bad boy Sudoku.

427
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,560
Travis, it is such an honor to have you

428
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,160
on the show, the bad boy Sudoku, the Sudoku world.

429
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,960
Fuck you.

430
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
He, of course, remember Travis as the one who,

431
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,040
when an opponent wasn't looking,

432
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,160
reached in and wrote blue in one of the squares

433
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,760
and they fucking brought the entire convention to its knees.

434
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,960
It was a scandal writ large.

435
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Yep.

436
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,880
And I remember that one time you leaned over

437
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,440
to Kenny Numberman and bit his nose,

438
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,760
cleaned the hell off his face.

439
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,920
I do regret that because it turned out

440
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,320
we weren't even competing at that point.

441
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
No, you were on a ski lift.

442
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
You guys were going on a ski trip together.

443
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,760
And I bit his nose off.

444
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
I thought there was a bug on it.

445
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
That was pretty cool, man.

446
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,320
Thank you.

447
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,760
I remember when you brought a six pack of Coors

448
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,440
to my grandpapa's funeral.

449
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,640
I also regret that.

450
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,560
I did appreciate how you put two Sudoku puzzles,

451
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,400
one on each of his eyes while you sent him on his way

452
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,760
across the River Styx.

453
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,080
Well, the family paid me for that.

454
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
You never think about that.

455
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,080
The ferryman every once in a while is like,

456
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
I got so many fucking coins, y'all.

457
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm good.

458
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
Please send a Sudoku puzzle.

459
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,800
Please send a Sudoku puzzle.

460
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,320
It's so boring here.

461
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,480
I just go back and forth on the river.

462
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,520
Send a Sudoku.

463
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,280
It's not a good puzzle.

464
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
Well, you don't think the Sudoku is a good puzzle?

465
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,140
No.

466
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
It's quite a brain teaser.

467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,520
Would you rather do riddles, Griffin?

468
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
Because we could do riddles.

469
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,560
Don't you fuck with me.

470
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,040
You know how they made a movie out of escape room,

471
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,600
a horror movie where the teens got trapped in escape room

472
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
and then they thought they were in the lobby,

473
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
but it turns out this is the escape room

474
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
and it is full of deadly traps.

475
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,160
And it was based on escape rooms.

476
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,800
Do you think they'll ever do that for Sudoku?

477
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,480
Yeah, I've actually been working on a script for Sudoku

478
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,040
and it's a university that teaches Sudoku

479
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,960
and things get pretty ribald.

480
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
That's funny.

481
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,320
Yeah, the six and the nine are always next to each other,

482
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
if you know what I mean.

483
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,800
Hell yeah, dude.

484
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,840
This is 69.

485
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,960
What's that?

486
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,160
It's a sex number.

487
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,680
Why is that?

488
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,360
It's because when you put them together,

489
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
it looks like the six and the nine

490
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,280
are orally pleasuring one another.

491
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,000
Do you see it now?

492
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,560
Look at it and squint like a magic eye.

493
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
You know how we're all just genitals

494
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,560
attached to one big mouth?

495
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,000
You get it.

496
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,600
Hey guys, 69 is nothing.

497
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,800
That doesn't look like that.

498
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
One person went, oh, a six and a nine together.

499
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,840
That looks like two people orally pleasuring each other

500
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
while curled up like a Sonic the Hedgehog.

501
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,720
And another person was like, yeah, it does.

502
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
Hey, guess what, gang?

503
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,960
It doesn't.

504
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,000
It wicked doesn't.

505
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
If you had a seven and an L maybe.

506
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,280
Maybe.

507
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,080
The other thing is you can't even do that.

508
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,260
Wait.

509
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,440
You can't even do it now.

510
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
It doesn't work.

511
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,840
Justin's right.

512
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
Where do the legs even go?

513
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,800
What do you do with your pants?

514
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,480
If I was to train 69 in the way that the numbers prescribed,

515
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,480
I would have to put like my wife's entire lower body

516
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,280
in my mouth.

517
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,760
What?

518
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,400
That's not-

519
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,120
Wait, is that-

520
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Wait, is that not-

521
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,080
Oh shit, Trav.

522
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
We should go to the money zone.

523
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:25,200
Hey, I want to tell you about me undies.

524
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
Undies.

525
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,960
We always talk about getting me undies for yourself,

526
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,160
but you know what?

527
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
It's the time for others.

528
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,440
You need to think about putting clothes on other people's bodies.

529
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,640
Me undies makes a great gift for someone you care about

530
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,840
this holiday season.

531
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,280
And it's not just underwear.

532
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,360
They have all kinds of things.

533
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,320
You got comfy pants, t-shirts, robes, slippers,

534
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,480
all kinds of stuff, including a baby body suit.

535
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
Adorable.

536
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,640
And of course, all of their clothes are cozy.

537
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,800
And they have sizes XS through 4XL.

538
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,240
And it's three times softer than cotton.

539
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
You know it is.

540
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,640
So you're going to want to check it out.

541
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400

543
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,960
slash my brother, that's meundies.com slash my brother.

544
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,280
Going to the post office is hell.

545
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,600
Okay.

546
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,200
Especially this time of year.

547
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
It can be really, the holidays are tough on everybody

548
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
and mostly because of how much you have to go to the post office.

549
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,600
Which is to be fair, that's also true of going outside

550
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
anywhere at all ever.

551
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,960
That's fair, Travis.

552
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Stamps.com is going to save you from having to go to post office

553
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,480
and save you the money that you would have spent on things

554
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,560
at post office because they've got discounts,

555
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,320
the Stamps.com people do.

556
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,720
You use your computer, you'll print official US postage 24-7.

557
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,280
That's right.

558
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,280
Once you start, you will be printing postage

559
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,720
every waking moment of your life for any letter, any package,

560
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,240
any class of mail, anywhere you want to send things.

561
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,440
But it's worth it.

562
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,400
It's worth it.

563
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,920
It's a new lifestyle.

564
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,560
This is a lifestyle brand, Stamps.com.

565
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,040
Once your mail is ready, you just hand it to your mail carrier

566
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,400
or you drop it in a mailbox.

567
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,600
It's no wonder over 700,000 small businesses

568
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,880
already use Stamps.com and folks, that's basically a million.

569
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Don't spend a minute of your holiday season

570
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,560

Never go to the post office again.

586
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,000
Have you ever watched a movie so bad

587
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,160
you just needed to talk to somebody about it?

588
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,720
Well, here at the Flophouse, we watch a bad movie

589
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,840
and then talk about it.

590
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,280
Yeah, you don't have to do anything.

591
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,040
We'll watch it and we'll talk it.

592
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,080
We do the hard work.

593
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,520
Featuring the beautiful vocal talents of Dan McCoy.

594
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,200
Stuart Wellington.

595
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,680
And me, America's Rascal, Elliot Kalin.

596
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,560
New episodes every other Saturday at MaximumFun.org

597
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,880
or wherever you get your podcasts, dude.

598
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,160
Bye-bye.

599
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,660
Bye-bye.

600
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:44,560
I want to munch.

601
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,060
Squad.

602
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,560
I want to munch.

603
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,520
Squad.

604
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,480
Squad.

605
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,520
Hello, welcome to Munch Squad.

606
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,120
It's podcast after podcast about the latest

607
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,200
and greatest in brand eating.

608
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,040
I have, if it so please the court, I just have a couple.

609
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,080
Two to three that I'd love to get through.

610
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,480
Because I don't want a new year to begin

611
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,320
and still have stuff on my desk that I have to clear off.

612
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,600
Is that OK with everybody?

613
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,200
Edible.

614
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,000
This is our sub-segment of Munch Squad.

615
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,240
It's our CBD update, which I've decided

616
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,000
to start calling CBD's nuts.

617
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,680
Oh, I get it.

618
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,960
Welcome to the party Edible Arrangements.

619
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,360
The world's largest franchiser of fresh fruit arrangements

620
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,560
has officially debuted a new Incredible Edibles hemp

621
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,480
derived CBD product line, including smoothies

622
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,800
and chocolate dipped fruit.

623
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,080
It's from Incredible Edibles, a company which

624
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,240
focuses on supplying CBD with traceability and authenticity

625
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,280
from the hemp farm to the finished product.

626
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,120
That's right, folks.

627
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,840
Farm to smoothie CBD.

628
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,480
We've finally fucking done it.

629
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,600
Quote from Tariq Freed, the founder and CEO

630
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,000
of Edible Arrangements.

631
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,680
Consumers are showing an increasing demand

632
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,440
for CBD products.

633
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,020
And now is the perfect time for us

634
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,960
to make our mark on this flourishing industry.

635
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,240
We've always prided ourselves on our knack.

636
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,800
I just want to say, hey, good euphemism for cash in.

637
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,640
Yeah, we have always prided ourselves

638
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,260
on our knack for innovation.

639
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,500
And we continue to do so with the introduction

640
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,300
of new menu innovations for fresh and healthy alternatives.

641
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,560
In the case of Incredible Edible CBD products,

642
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,240
the alternative we now offer is high quality traceable CBD

643
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,080
with a focus on health, not high.

644
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,600
I'd like to go back to where it's

645
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,000
talking about increasing demand.

646
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Am I to believe, Tariq, that at least one time

647
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,720
in human existence, someone blew into the doors

648
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
of an Edible Arrangements and just shouted,

649
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,880
like, I need this fruit to have CBD in it?

650
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,800
Hey, you said edible, right?

651
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,500
You want our chocolate dipped strawberries

652
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,680
to get you fucked up?

653
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
No, it's for health.

654
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,840
Not high.

655
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,600
OK.

656
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,880
Red Lobster has made a Cheddar Bay Biscuit sweater.

657
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
It's for the holidays.

658
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,280
And it's got little lobsters on it

659
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,400
and Cheddar Bay Biscuits on it.

660
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,160
And it's got a special insulated pocket

661
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,520
to help keep your Cheddar Bay Biscuits warm.

662
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,680
To help steal your Cheddar Bay Biscuits, we should be clear.

663
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
Yes.

664
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,440
How big?

665
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,360
Hey, Juice, how big a pocket we talking?

666
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,120
It says, they're kept warm to perfect.

667
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,960
I'm looking at a picture of a woman

668
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,880
with four biscuits in her sweater pocket.

669
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,360
Fuck yeah.

670
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,000
That's good.

671
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,500
That's good.

672
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,600
I was worried it would just be a single serve.

673
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,600
For those looking to turn heads at their office party,

674
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,080
I think that you would turn heads in this sweater,

675
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,880
but you'd turn them back and forth in kind of a sad way.

676
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,320
You know?

677
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
You would oscillate heads.

678
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,000
Right.

679
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,520
Those looking to oscillate heads in a slow fashion

680
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,840
or give an unforgettable gift to a seafood-loving one.

681
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,920
It says, a seafood-loving loved one.

682
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,040
Just do it with the first draft on this one, huh?

683
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Red Lobster, OK.

684
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,360
Our Cheddar Bay Biscuits, a good holiday sweater.

685
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,600
Originally, the copy said, a seafood-loved one.

686
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,800
And they're like, that doesn't seem right.

687
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,960
It's guaranteed to help holiday enthusiasts

688
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,400
slay S-L-E-I-G-H all season long.

689
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,720
I'm trying not to fill up before I get to my shrimp scampi

690
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,520
sweater that I also ordered.

691
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,160
So I'm going to pass on these.

692
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,920
That's fair enough.

693
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,760
It's $40.

694
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,680
You can buy it if you don't value your life.

695
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,560
Last one real quick.

696
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,240
And I want to say thank you to Robin for this one.

697
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,480
The Michael Jordan Steakhouse is offering a limited time Space

698
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,080
Jam menu.

699
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,760
Boy, if you're a die-hard Space Jam fan like many of us

700
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,680
in Chicago, you will be thrilled to hear

701
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,320
that Michael Jordan Steakhouse is offering limited time

702
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,680
Space Jam-inspired menu.

703
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,800
From now until April 13, 2020, you

704
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,040
can try a Space Jam-inspired meal during every Chicago Bulls

705
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,680
home game.

706
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,040
For anyone who's ever wanted to be like Mike,

707
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,360
this meal will take you back to the Michael Jordan days

708
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,640
and give anyone who tries it a feeling of nostalgia

709
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,480
and a chance to eat like Mike.

710
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,200
That would be a fucking wild, wild reaction to this meal.

711
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,560
The new item, titled Mike's Secret Stuff, is no joke.

712
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,360
It includes a Space Jam burger.

713
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,520
It consists of a 10-ounce beef patty that's

714
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,600
stacked with BBQ braised pork belly, dill

715
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,400
pickled, stout mustard, pickled onions,

716
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,280
and aged cheddar cheese.

717
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,160
What does that have to do with Space Jam?

718
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,600
Well, you eat it off of Wayne Knight's nude body.

719
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,440
If that's not enough for you, the menu,

720
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,800
how could it not be enough?

721
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,000
And the menu item also comes as a combo with hand-cut fries

722
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,520
and a Mike's Secret Stuff salted caramel milkshake.

723
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,240
Hey, Mike, what's your secret stuff?

724
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
Well, friend, it turns out it's fucking

725
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,480
salted caramel milkshakes.

726
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,400
Help me deliver on the b-ball court.

727
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,200
The FDA must have a law preventing anyone

728
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,600
from advertising, quote, secret stuff on their food menus.

729
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,800
Yes, because it can cover any number of sins.

730
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,080
What makes me mad is that they called the menu item, which

731
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,960
is a burger, Mike's Secret Stuff,

732
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,720
and then they called the milkshake Mike's Secret

733
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,480
Stuff.

734
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,520
Like, you were so close.

735
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,920
If you had just waited, you could have gotten it

736
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,400
into a drink form.

737
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
But no, you had to call the burger.

738
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,760
You can't just call them both Mike's Secret Stuff.

739
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,240
Michael Jordan was not beginning games

740
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,960
by eating a fucking cheeseburger.

741
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,920
Mike has a lot of secrets, Justin.

742
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,640
And then a milkshake to wash it down.

743
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,800
That's not how Mike began his games.

744
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,920
I just, I'm bothered by something

745
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,040
that seems so thematic that then once you peel one layer back,

746
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,400
has zero theme at all.

747
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,360
Like, you could put some fig jam on there.

748
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,280
And I would have been like, OK, done.

749
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,360
Now you're fucking talking.

750
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,920
But there's nothing.

751
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,600
I would sooner believe that Mike's Secret Stuff is fig jam.

752
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,140
If I just went back in the locker room

753
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,040
and saw Michael Jordan eating piles of fig jam

754
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,080
from a jar with a spoon, that would be more plausible to me.

755
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,200
Producing eggs from some sort of sack.

756
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,080
The executive chef of Michael Jordan's steakhouse,

757
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,680
Craig Cooper, is thrilled to be offering

758
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,720
Bulls and Michael Jordan fans alike this opportunity.

759
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
A burger!

760
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,040
A burger and milkshake with fries!

761
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
Quote, we're doing it with really great ingredients

762
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,640
and going over the top.

763
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,520
Yeah, I mean, it would be better than if you went with,

764
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,000
we're doing it with bad food that we can't sell otherwise.

765
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,480
If they wanted to be really thematic,

766
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,920
the drink should just be like a glass of water.

767
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,240
But then you drink it and you beat the monsters.

768
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,880
Michael's Secret Stuff is hydration and plenty of sleep.

769
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,600
We were, this is continuing the quote,

770
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,400
we were inspired by Space Jam.

771
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,960
And who knows?

772
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,500
Maybe the Mike's Secret Stuff shake

773
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,040
will be enough to bring the Bulls back

774
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,800
to their Michael Jordan era prime.

775
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,080
So Craig, just so I can be fucking clear,

776
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,760
you are saying that maybe if the entire Bulls franchise

777
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,720
drank a salted caramel milkshake before the game began,

778
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,200
they might launch back to prominence.

779
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,520
Is that where we're going with this?

780
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,280
Perhaps even stranger, Justin.

781
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,560
What he is suggesting is,

782
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,580
if some people in a restaurant drink the shake,

783
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,640
the enjoyment of said shake might be enough

784
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,640
to power a basketball team to victory, perhaps miles away.

785
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,320
The thing, the fictional setting that Craig has created,

786
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,360
yes, thank you, Travis, is not that the team,

787
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,960
it's that a city would love a salted caramel milkshake

788
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,360
so much that their favorite team

789
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,940
would be good at basketball again.

790
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,720
That is what Craig is, that's a good milkshake, Craig.

791
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,560
Are you sure?

792
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,960
Does it just have the regular things

793
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,820
like salt and caramel and ice cream?

794
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,800
Imagine if in Angels of the Outfield,

795
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,660
the actual scenario had been that there were angels

796
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,720
somewhere else in the city,

797
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,400
and everyone was so excited about those angels

798
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,280
that the baseball team won.

799
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,760
And that's what's going on here.

800
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,000
Angels a few blocks over.

801
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,620
Yes, Angels at the Walmart,

802
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,640
and the angels are just shopping, but everyone loves them.

803
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,000
I would pay 200 American dollars

804
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,440
for a Space Jam hamburger if-

805
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,760
A Space Jam burger?

806
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,680
A Space Jam burger.

807
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,680
If Michael Jordan himself ran towards my table with it

808
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,400
in his hand, no plate, and jumped way up in the air

809
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,480
and dunked it right into my head,

810
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,160
but then he picked me up off the ground

811
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,680
where he flattened me, and he stands me up

812
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,360
and dusts me off and says, do you want to come

813
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,080
in the back with me and help me hurt the Monstars?

814
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,080
And then me and him got to go back in the kitchen

815
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,640
where he's got the Monstars captured,

816
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,360
and then he and I hurt them because of how bad they were

817
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,420
to the Looney Tunes.

818
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,480
So in Space Jam 2, we can only assume that LeBron

819
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,120
will drink LeBron's secret stuff.

820
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,960
Now, as we all know, Michael Jordan's secret stuff

821
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,440
was water, and LeBron's secret stuff,

822
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,240
I'm assuming, will also be water.

823
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,600
Maybe Sprite- At some point,

824
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,800
the Looney Tunes must become suspicious

825
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,920
of pro basketball players trying

826
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,400
to sell them high-priced water.

827
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,920
I mean, the other side of that, Justin, is that,

828
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,480
and I'm not saying this about LeBron James, mind you,

829
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,560
but that at some point, an NBA star gives them, say,

830
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,320
anabolic steroids to make them successful at basketball,

831
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,880
and they're like, finally, something that works.

832
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,760
I do look forward to the inevitable Wayne Knight cameo

833
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,920
and hearing a room full of seven-year-olds scream,

834
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,840
who the fuck is that?

835
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,360
Or just hearing them yell, Newman!

836
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,260
Because that is a show that stretches beyond age.

837
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,560
What will be more depressing,

838
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,280
that the room full of seven-year-olds don't know

839
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
who Wayne Knight is, or that they don't know

840
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,080
who Michael Jordan is?

841
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,200
Oh.

842
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,560
Depends on if you're Michael Jordan or not.

843
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,120
I could show it up in his kenga,

844
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,120
ready to enjoy that great movie with his family,

845
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,960
and he strides out of the screen

846
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,520
with a bottle of his secret stuff,

847
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,560
and is met with fucking silence

848
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,840
by a room full of seven-year-olds.

849
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,560
Is that a Fortnite guy?

850
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,720
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

851
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,560
Thank you.

852
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,880
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Nurbel, who asks,

853
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,000
what would a witch even do with a cauldron?

854
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,520
Good question.

855
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,080
Why did witches have cauldrons?

856
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,860
A cauldron holds a massive quantity of soup or stew,

857
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,160
but they are a witch.

858
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,740
How many people are they serving?

859
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,080
It's not like they know a lot of people

860
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,240
because they're witches and probably keep to themselves,

861
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,800
and they didn't have refrigerators back then

862
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,920
to save some for later.

863
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,120
Seems like they would have wasted a lot of food.

864
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,480
Okay, first, my dude, Covens.

865
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,400
What do you mean witches don't know people?

866
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,120
Inherently, witches are part of a big group.

867
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,840
That's the thing, Covens.

868
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,120
Come on, my dude.

869
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,720
Someone's gonna draw it, your coven comes over,

870
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
you've got a cauldron for one.

871
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,040
Embarrassing, no thank you.

872
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,800
A big cauldron, you can make one portion.

873
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,520
A small cauldron, you can't make more than one portion.

874
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,460
Options, buddy.

875
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,600
Read a book.

876
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,800
Whenever you do see

877
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,800
a depiction of a witch with a cauldron

878
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,760
who is stirring something up,

879
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,360
my mind has never leapt to chili

880
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,280
or beef stew or potatoes soup.

881
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,000
It's always some sort of potion.

882
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,520
Yes, am I alone in this?

883
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,160
Well, chili can be a potion, Griffin.

884
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,160
It's a kind of bean fart potion, sure.

885
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,240
But then that brings up the question

886
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,200
of how much potion do you need?

887
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,280
Do potions go back?

888
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,920
If a potion has an eye of newt in it,

889
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,680
that I imagine would go bad after a bit.

890
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,800
It has a perishable sort of object in it.

891
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,640
That is, here's the thing though, Griffin.

892
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,560
If you watch any movie with a witch building a potion,

893
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,920
they have some kind of base potion in there, right?

894
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,280
Because the cauldron's almost always full.

895
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,560
And then when the person says,

896
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,120
I need a powerful love spell or whatever,

897
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,560
that's when they start throwing in

898
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,400
the individual ingredients.

899
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
It's a sourdough starter, essentially,

900
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
is what you're suggesting.

901
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,320
Okay.

902
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,040
That there's some kind of base potion,

903
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,340
a universal potion base,

904
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,560
that then they can add specific ingredients to

905
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,800
as soon as someone gets there.

906
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,640
Because that's the thing.

907
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,800
If a villager rolled up and said,

908
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,880
I need a potion to punish my enemies,

909
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,760
you wouldn't be like, okay, sit down.

910
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,820
This thing holds 60 gallons.

911
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,160
It's gonna take a while to heat up.

912
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,120
You're gonna be here.

913
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,800
That's like, you know, it's like a drug dealer

914
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,080
hanging out with you while you make the deal,

915
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,920
I assume, because I've watched TV and movies.

916
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,720
They gotta have smaller cauldrons, right?

917
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,360
Like, they're batch making all these.

918
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,160
Well, you think they're just made of cauldrons, Justin?

919
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,360
Well, they at least have another one for chili, right?

920
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,680
We can agree that it's not the same cauldron, right,

921
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,320
for chili and love spell potions.

922
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,920
Oh no, that could go so bad.

923
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,920
They very temporarily put in the stopper,

924
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,460
dump the love spell potion into the bathtub,

925
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,480
make the chili in the cauldron,

926
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,600
edit up, share it with the friends,

927
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,080
scoop the love spell potion back into the cauldron.

928
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,120
After it's been cleaned, oops, it wasn't cleaned.

929
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,040
I got ding-danged beans and onions

930
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,680
in my love potion again.

931
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,080
And it works even better.

932
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,140
It works really good.

933
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
Do you think witches ever get mad

934
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,040
when somebody's like, I need a potion?

935
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,000
Do you think the first thought the witch's head is always,

936
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
oh man, I gotta build a fire in the middle of my house?

937
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,480
I really, this is where I sleep and live,

938
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,520
and I don't wanna build a fire in the middle of my house,

939
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
but I have to make the potion.

940
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,480
Can I do it outside?

941
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,060
No, it'll be contaminated.

942
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,400
But the potions, and people don't like to hear this,

943
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,560
they smell super bad.

944
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,760
There's a lot of stinky, stinky stuff in there.

945
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,600
Can I just make you some chili?

946
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,420
You want me to make ones with mushrooms

947
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,040
and animal eyes in it?

948
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
That one's gonna stink, my man.

949
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,780
That must be the worst, is when a client shows up and says,

950
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,440
I need a love potion and some chili.

951
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,600
And you're like, oh no.

952
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,200
I don't have the pots for that.

953
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,320
I don't have the bandwidth.

954
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,280
Oh boy.

955
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,100
Can you come back tomorrow?

956
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,280
I can't, I wanna love chili right now.

957
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,120
Oh no.

958
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,120
I don't like chili, I don't wanna learn.

959
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,200
I'm usually in charge of going to the supermarket,

960
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,020
but I was sick this week,

961
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,200
and my wife did the shopping instead.

962
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,840
First, it seemed like she just got the usual things

963
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,660
that we always eat,

964
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,920
but when I opened the freezer this morning,

965
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,880
I saw three gigantic tubs of Cool Whip

966
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,920
staring back at me.

967
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,440
My wife has never mentioned her interest in Cool Whip,

968
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,380
and I haven't had this stuff since I was a kid.

969
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,020
What does this mean for my marriage,

970
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,000
and am I cool to dig in while she's at work?

971
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,680
And that's from Cool Whip Cassie.

972
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,960
No, don't just eat Cool Whip.

973
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,920
Oh, what if you need it for something?

974
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,240
Yeah, what if you need Cool Whip?

975
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,340
Come on Griffin, use your head.

976
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,680
You've had that pumpkin pie sitting around for a while,

977
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,480
you've been waiting for an excuse.

978
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,440
Cool Whip can be a fun addition to lots of things.

979
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,680
Strawberry shortcake, maybe a fun peanut butter sandwich.

980
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,040
Add a little Cool Whip on there.

981
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,520
Ooh, interesting.

982
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,240
That's new, add just a little ice cream.

983
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,720
Why are we talking about Cool Whip?

984
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,480
Nobody wants to talk about Cool Whip.

985
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,120
Sorry Cass, hey Cassie, sorry,

986
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,520
but nobody wants to talk about Cool Whip.

987
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,560
Well, it's kind of the question,

988
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,520
so we kind of have to do whatever the question says.

989
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,160
Yeah, but I don't really want to talk about Cool Whip.

990
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,840
Okay, here's the thing to me

991
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,880
that makes this whole situation a little weird,

992
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,440
that it's in the freezer.

993
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,680
Because if you're planning on enjoying the Cool Whip,

994
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,280
it must be defrosted.

995
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,480
No one says, like, what you said just now before

996
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,200
is a situation where you start thinking,

997
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,560
man, I'd love to eat some Cool Whip in four hours.

998
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,080
Oh, I've solved it.

999
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,160
I've cracked this whole thing wide open.

1000
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,040
So Cassie's wife doesn't normally do the shopping, right?

1001
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,880
Right.

1002
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,200
Cassie normally does the shopping.

1003
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,600
So wife went, maybe got a little flustered.

1004
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,640
There's a great deal on Cool Whip.

1005
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,640
They thought maybe Cassie never buys Cool Whip

1006
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,400
because it's always expensive, but this is a good deal.

1007
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't even know if we need Cool Whip,

1008
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,840
but we've never had it before.

1009
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,600
It's such a good deal, I'm buying three of them.

1010
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,360
Cassie hasn't ever mentioned Cool Whip before,

1011
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,440
but that could be because of the prohibitive price.

1012
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,240
Cassie's worried about getting me excited about Cool Whip

1013
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,320
and then not being able to afford it and letting me down.

1014
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,680
Well, I'm gonna surprise Cassie with three,

1015
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,120
yes, three tubs of Cool Whip.

1016
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,920
Well, Cassie, be pleased.

1017
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,680
To pitch a different scenario,

1018
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,240
you're walking through the grocery store

1019
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,840
you've never grocery shopped in your life.

1020
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,480
It's a strange labyrinth of products and produce.

1021
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,360
Some of this stuff you've never even seen before.

1022
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,040
You're lost, you're unmoored.

1023
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,640
You're sure you're gonna do a terrible job.

1024
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,560
And then you look in a refrigerated section

1025
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,040
and you see a product and this product is cool.

1026
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,920
Yeah.

1027
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,760
You think that's a good place to start.

1028
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,800
That's cool.

1029
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,000
These are cool, so I'll get these.

1030
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,320
If there's something called, if there was great bread,

1031
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,760
that's my next destination.

1032
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,760
And maybe this is the reward that I do this sometimes.

1033
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,400
So I'm like, I'm shopping so good.

1034
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,240
I'm buying the healthy items.

1035
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,800
I'm gonna buy myself some Sunday cones or whatever.

1036
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Something, just a treat for me.

1037
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,560
And now three seems excessive, three tubs,

1038
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,400
but Cool Whip is a luxury item.

1039
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,840
It is rarely necessary.

1040
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,160
So maybe Cassidy's wife just thought they were doing

1041
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,400
a really great job.

1042
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,880
Maybe Cassidy's wife knew that my daughter was coming over

1043
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,200
because on Thanksgiving, I had a tub of Cool Whip out

1044
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,800
to put on my Ritz tort.

1045
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,800
And I had the tray out and I opened the Cool Whip tub

1046
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,200
and I looked away to grab a spoon.

1047
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,680
And when I looked back, my daughter had shoved

1048
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,240
her entire fucking face into it.

1049
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,240
Just shoved her face right into the Cool Whip.

1050
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,440
I had another tub because I've been down this road before.

1051
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,280
I've been down this particular road to perdition.

1052
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,080
She thought she had one on me.

1053
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,960
And the next time I went to the store, I said,

1054
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,800
well, I'm gonna buy two tubs of Cool Whip

1055
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,160
because somebody might shove their face into one.

1056
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,800
And then she looks at me dead in the eyes and say,

1057
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,680
well, somebody shoved their face into two.

1058
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,440
Fuck, she got me.

1059
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Damn, cold blooded.

1060
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,440
So you're suggesting that they bought three suspect ink

1061
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,280
that your daughter is going to come to their house.

1062
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,440
My daughter is invited to their holiday gatherings.

1063
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,280
You can't have enough tubs of Cool Whip

1064
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,080
around the house around the holidays, folks.

1065
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,920
That's a dessert.

1066
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,880
Hey, listen, if a bunch of guests show up,

1067
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,960
you don't have a dessert, cut up some fresh fruit,

1068
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,520
throw in some Cool Whip, you got a dessert going right there.

1069
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,000
Your dessert's done.

1070
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,480
You could also just open the tub

1071
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,040
and throw some spoons in it.

1072
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,840
Now you got a dessert going.

1073
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,400
Just have them eat the Cool Whip.

1074
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Yeah, man.

1075
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,840
Just get out a big thing of cracked pepper

1076
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,800
and say, here's a spicy dessert for everyone.

1077
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,040
This is fun.

1078
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,840
We can all eat things that aren't supposed to be food.

1079
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,320
I'm not saying you eat the spoons, Griffin.

1080
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah, you just crack open a bunch of Diet Cokes

1081
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,360
and pour them in a big bowl.

1082
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,160
Hey, everyone, soup's on.

1083
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,160
That's actually a good start for a soup.

1084
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,280
This has been our podcast, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1085
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,920
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1086
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,440
We got a couple of things.

1087
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,240
The first one I'd like to mention,

1088
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,120
this time of year, our incredible listeners

1089
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,000
all get together to help fill some empty stockings

1090
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,160
here in the Huntington, West Virginia area.

1091
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,480
There's a whole list of needs, people that,

1092
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,000
not even gifts, there are some for kids on there,

1093
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,080
but a lot are just people trying to get clothes

1094
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,440
for the cold weather.

1095
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,880
Our listeners are always really good about helping,

1096
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,080
I mean, literally everybody.

1097
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,480
It's amazing every time of year.

1098
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,640
It's called MBMBAM Angels.

1099
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,440
It's been going on for years now,

1100
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,240
and the 2019 drive is in full swing.

1101
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,240
If you get a few moments and you have a few bucks to spare,

1102
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,400
please head on over to MBMBAMangels.com.

1103
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,400
You can claim a family or just send money

1104
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,040
to help with the effort.

1105
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,800
Huge thanks to all the organizers of that,

1106
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,920
and you are the best, and we love you,

1107
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,760
and thank you if you can donate.

1108
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,160
It would really mean a lot, MBMBAMangels.com.

1109
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,960
It looks like they are about halfway there

1110
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,800
as I'm reading this.

1111
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,440
So if you could pitch in, it would really mean a lot.

1112
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,880
Also, big announcement, here in February,

1113
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,720
we're gonna be doing a couple of live shows

1114
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,240
here in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, the queen city.

1115
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,560
Why Cincinnati, you ask?

1116
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,200
Well, it's where I live, and I'll just have had a baby,

1117
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,720
and I don't want to go anywhere,

1118
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,920
but we're doing some live shows here,

1119
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,240
and those tickets are going on sale this Friday.

1120
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,440
So be ready for that.

1121
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,480
We'll tweet all the links and details and everything.

1122
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,280
Also, the Adventure Zone Bureau of Balance game,

1123
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,200
the cooperative card storytelling game

1124
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,840
that we made with Together Studios,

1125
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,360
the presales are open now.

1126
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,720

1127
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,160
and pre-order it now.

1128
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,640
Let's see what, oh, and as long as you're pre-ordering,

1129
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,200
go to TheAdventureZoneComic.com

1130
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,000
and pre-order the next graphic novel, too.

1131
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,120
Why not just do both?

1132
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,080
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1133
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,000
for the use of our theme song,

1134
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,040
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1135
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,360
Find, just go there, go to wherever you get music,

1136
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,560
the music store or the online music store,

1137
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,400
and get this music, folks.

1138
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,880
And hey, thanks to Maximum Fun

1139
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,040

1145
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,200
And it's gonna be island-themed, by the way,

1146
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,160
so if you wanna dress cordially, feel free.

1147
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,640
Wait, really?

1148
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,480
Yeah, baby.

1149
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,640
Better order a shirt.

1150
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,120
I have a box with over 200 beach balls in it

1151
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,560
in my home as we speak.

1152
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,880
Did we talk about this?

1153
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,680
Well, no, I just put my mother-in-law in charge of it,

1154
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,800
so it's gonna be buck wild.

1155
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,120
This is a woman that once made 30 children into trees

1156
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,600
for a Wizard of Oz production.

1157
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,960
It's gonna be buck wild, okay?

1158
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,800
Can't wait.

1159
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,620
Here's the final Yahoo!

1160
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,560
It was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

1161
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,400
Thanks, Graham.

1162
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,200
It's Yahoo! Answers user, Steven, who asks,

1163
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,160
does the Cats movie trailer make anyone horny?

1164
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:59,000
Horny. My name's Justin McElroy.

1165
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,320
I'm Travis McElroy.

1166
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1167
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,520
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1168
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,680
May you kiss your dad, square out the lips.
