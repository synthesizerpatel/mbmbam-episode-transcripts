1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Hi folks, I'm your middle-est brother Travis McRoy.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McRoy.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,440
This is weird and I don't like this.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,560
It's weird, right?

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,400
Yeah.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,420
It's like when you, it's like a flat tire.

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,560
You can feel that something's just off

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,000
and it's that Justin's not here.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,480
He's on a boat, he's on a cruise.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,160
He said we weren't allowed to go.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Yeah, that was weird.

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,000
It was weird.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,240
He said that only one of us could be at the ocean.

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,040
He said it was something about maritime law.

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,160
Yeah, well it's kind of like that

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Kiefer Sutherland show Designated Survivor

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,760
and that if there is, God forbid,

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,800
but if there is a, you know,

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,440
that movie with the Poseidon adventure sort of situation,

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
well you and I can carry the torch

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,480
if there is a Poseidon adventure situation.

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,720
Just quick sidetrack.

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,360
I think it would be great if on Designated Survivor

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,360
every like season ender and then season starter

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,120
was like at the end of the season,

26
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,520
it was like good news Kiefer,

27
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,920
we found a new president.

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,560
You don't have to be president anymore.

29
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,400
And then something happens

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,760
that he has to be president again every year.

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,600
Okay.

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,400
And hopefully it goes like 12 seasons.

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,640
Yeah, so like the Secretary of Agriculture

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,120
like flies back from an extended trip in Dubai

35
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,520
and is like, what's up motherfucker?

36
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,360
I'm back.

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
Bet you thought I was in the room

38
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,480
when the big boom happened, but no, no, no.

39
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,720
Anyway, give me that president badge.

40
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,160
And he's like, oh, thank goodness.

41
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,040
I didn't want to be president.

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,880
But then he falls in a toilet and dies.

43
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
Anyways, so.

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
Anyway, so that's Travis and my spec script

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
for Designated Survivor season two premiere.

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,520
Very excited about it.

47
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,800
So Justin's not here.

48
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,960
So in lieu of his being,

49
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,920
we are putting up the Candle Nights episode

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
from last year, which we recorded as part of the TV show.

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,640
If you have watched our TV show, which you should,

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,680
I think it's pretty fun.

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,560
You'll recognize some of the stuff

54
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,120
because it is what we filmed.

55
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,240
It was our last day of filming.

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,160
We're all extremely tired.

57
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,640
I think it's fair to say, very emotional.

58
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,200
And so yeah.

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Something to keep in mind.

60
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,280
One, it's a live show.

61
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,960
Two, we're recording it in the auditorium at City Hall.

62
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
So it's not like we were, you know,

63
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,600
it's not a state of the art recording.

64
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,440
The audio's not good.

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

66
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
The audio, it's listenable

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,040
and you can hear what we're saying,

68
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,200
but that auditorium was invented,

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,640
it was built before amplified sound was invented.

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,000
And so there's a bit of a trade-off

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
and I apologize for that,

72
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,520
but I think it's a really fun episode

73
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,000
and I think you'll like it regardless.

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,720
Some other thing, I just edited the episode

75
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,040
and Travis, unfortunately,

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,400
I did cut the celebrity miracle bit

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
because that part was un-listenable

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
because you couldn't hear it at all,

79
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,480
which is a bummer.

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,160
And that's also, that's for the TV show.

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,560
That's fine, I understand.

82
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Travis got a surprise celebrity guest

83
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,240
and it's on a TV show,

84
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,000
but unfortunately just like it's not listenable at all.

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,960
And what else?

86
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,160
I think that's all the sort of caveats.

87
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,920
We're gonna start out with our dad just hamming it up.

88
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,820
What else is new?

89
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,480
But yeah, we realized this is weird

90
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,560
that we are publishing one of our holiday specials

91
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,520
that we recorded in a non-holiday September

92
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,200
and publishing in a definitely non-holiday March,

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,680
but that's just how we do things.

94
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,600
I mean, it's the traditional candle lights in March.

95
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,440
You know what I mean?

96
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,480
Yeah.

97
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,600
So yeah, thanks for listening.

98
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
Enjoy the episode.

99
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,200
We'll be back in a bit for the Midi-Zone, so see you soon.

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
Christmas.

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,920
Yeah, it's bad enough.

102
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,000
They got the Sheets thing, they got the Schmanners thing,

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
they got the Sawbones thing, they got the Buffering thing.

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,240
Apparently no room for the Adventure Zone,

105
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,780
but that's okay.

106
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,940
No, no, no.

107
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,280
Thank you for acting like you know what that is.

108
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Hi, I'm Clint McElroy.

109
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,240
I am, some of the people up here

110
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,400
that you have seen on this stage this evening

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
are my fault so far, so I take full credit there.

112
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,900
But I serve a very important duty tonight.

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
For what?

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,160
Are you laughing because I said duty?

115
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah.

116
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,960
This is a prime bim-bam crowd.

117
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,800
No, seriously though, I'm here for a very important purpose.

118
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,740
The producers and the director and the crew told me

119
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,540
that if I shoehorned myself into this TV show one more time,

120
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,860
I'd qualify for an Emmy, so here I am.

121
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,220
No, but seriously, on a serious note,

122
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,440
Candle Nights is important to all of us,

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
and I think you'd probably agree with me

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,480
if you weren't all hammered.

125
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,840
But a very important component

126
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,620
of every Candle Nights observation

127
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,280
is our Candle Nights carolers.

128
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,800
Here's the problem.

129
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,160
We've run a little over,

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,040
and they have to do a tree lighting in Guyandot

131
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,880
in just a few minutes.

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,900
So, and those three people came from Australia.

133
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,520
I'll tell you the Guyandot joke later.

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
That's why nobody laughed at it.

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
But they prepared all these songs,

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,920
there's just not enough time.

137
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,640
So, they're going to do a very unique rendition

138
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,240
of four different Christmas songs.

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,500
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy tonight

140
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,480
and welcome our Candle Light, Candle Night,

141
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,200
knew I was gonna do that, carolers!
