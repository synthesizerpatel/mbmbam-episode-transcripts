1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:45,360
Do you need a pitch?

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:56,480
Here's where I'll start. Too high. Let me know. Too low. No, no, that's right. Do you want to

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,760
just let me know when you're recording? Yeah, I'm recording now. Yeah, it's hot. Isn't it rich? Oh,

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,720
sorry. Now I'm recording. Isn't it? Oh, sorry. No, it was recording before. It was recording before.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,840
He got a virus pop-up. Yeah, it's recording now. It's recording now. And Juice McAfee's got this

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,120
one, so don't worry about it. People love this, and you're really ruining it for me. No, we got

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,160
it. Well, we'll edit all of this out. The virus hackers are the ones who are ruining it, and it's

12
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,920
Norton Antivirus who sponsored this 500th episode of the show. They are a brick wall. Go ahead and

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:38,240
sing for me now. Isn't it rich? Uh-huh. Are we a pair? Are we? Me here at last on the ground and you

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:53,680
in midair. Where are the clowns? Where are they? Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve? One who keeps

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:04,240
tearing around and one who can move. I can just tell those levels aren't good. Where are the clowns?

16
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,200
He's just fluctuating. He's all over the fucking place I know. There ought to be clowns. Just when

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,920
I stopped. Oh, God. I thought that was it. Yeah, I didn't know there was a bridge. Opening doors.

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:24,720
It's 500. All right. Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours. Making my entrance again with

19
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:37,920
my usual flair. Sure of my lines, but no one was there. That's gotta be the end. Don't you love a

20
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,200
farce? Hold on. Actually, I just come around on it. It's my fault I fear. It's your curry sauce that

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,160
you're rubbing on. I thought that you'd want what I'd want. I'm sorry, my dear. Uh-huh. Bring them

22
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:06,160
home. Goose those levels. Send in the clowns. But where are the clowns? Take me home, Justin.

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:27,440
Don't bother. They are here. They are here. Maybe next year. Hello and welcome. Are you gonna sit

24
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
back down now? I gotta sit back down, yeah. We could all do standing if you guys wanted to. No,

25
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,640
this is my home, my very comfortable. The conceit of the episode is we have just filled our rigid

26
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,480
frames with hot pasta. The last thing I need to be doing is elevating my- Can I introduce- Oh,

27
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,960
I've introduced- Introduce it. 499 of them. Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me,

28
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,560
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

29
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm still, even after all these years,

30
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,560
your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. So welcome to the 500th episode of My Brother,

31
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:15,520
My Brother and Me, Spaghetageddon 2. Too saucy. Too carbious. Now, a lot of people pointed out

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,800
that apparently in episode 251, we said that episode 500 was going to mark the beginning of

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,000
period 3.0 of My Brother, My Brother and Me. Oh, interesting. And now I would like to suggest

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,200
a change. Okay. Right off here, right off the bat. Maybe from now on, we're an advice show for a

35
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,560
bygone era. Okay. Old timey, like how do you do good at the hoop and stick thing? Yeah, yeah.

36
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,960
Hey, so how do your bodies feel presently? I'll tell you, Griffin. Yeah. Feel great. Okay. I ate

37
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,560
two bowls of that saucy stuff. Munched it all up. Special thanks to our stepmom, Carol,

38
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,280
for that saucy stuff. Carol gave us the chunky stuff. The saucy stuff we crave. Yeah, it's the

39
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,600
saucy stuff we crave. And I threw that right down my hole. And it's weird because I remember

40
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,960
Spaghetageddon 1 feeling like energy had been put in me by the pasta. But weirdly,

41
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,360
this go round, it feels like it went the other way. And I was somehow, it was taking something

42
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,760
out of me because I feel like I need to go to sleep. You feel heavy. I feel a heft. Well,

43
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,120
we did also listen to smooth jazz while we ate spaghetti. Yeah, that helped push me further down

44
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,680
the hole. And so maybe that's a reflection of 10 years just sort of where my body is. Yeah. Now,

45
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,640
I had my pasta because it is of that, of that bean life. I had mine on Shirataki noodles,

46
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,640
which are made of seaweed and they are indistinguishable. No, I'm kidding. They're bad.

47
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,840
And saying that I ate- They weren't bad. They weren't bad. That was a passable pasta experience.

48
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,400
Yeah, but saying I ate spaghetti for lunch would be like saying I read the VHS amore on the back

49
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,080
of old school and I had seen the movie old school. There's really not a connection between the two.

50
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,480
It's a ghost of the experience. This is our 500th special episode. I hate recording in the same room.

51
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,640
I fucking despise it. I'm looking at your faces. We're in Travis's office. I have also positioned

52
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Justin directly across from you. How do you work like this, Travis? What do you mean?

53
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:42,320
It's, I need sparse, Spartan. It is, there's chaos. This is representative of my brain. A lot of half

54
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,440
formed but fully charged ahead ideas. Yeah. This is what I've done here. You just kind of got an

55
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,760
Ewok village play set up there next to some sort of Cinco de Mayo skeleton man. Yeah. So it's just

56
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:00,880
like, what's the theme, bud? Well, that shelf is all comic books. We got superheroes on that big shelf.

57
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,480
This shelf is all about me. I'm mostly focused on the Ewok play set Cinco de Mayo shelf. Well,

58
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,640
Ewoks like to party. Nub nub. This is our 500th episode. Oh boy, it feels like 486 though,

59
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,080
doesn't it? Yeah. The time just fucking goes the normal speed. So was the special element we added

60
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,280
here us just being really sad and tired and talking about my room? No, we're not going to

61
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,320
talk about your room. We're going to have special guests. We've got, I'm assuming you

62
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,400
guys have prepared some other stuff. Yeah. And it's going to be a fun episode. I got updates

63
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,360
from a lot of people. Oh, that'd be fun. I've got some yahoos and, but they're special yahoos

64
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,000
cause I'll read them funny or something. Oh, nice. Nice, nice, nice. Hey, do you guys want to start

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,680
with an update? Yes. Okay. Um, so this update. Is that your refrigerator? I mean, are you asking

66
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,040
if that is a physical refrigerator on the sound? It's a little bit of a buzz. Yeah. And you let

67
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,200
that happen? I edit it out. You edit the refrigerator buzz out? Yeah. Why don't you edit

68
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,680
the refrigerator out of the office? Uh, so this is from I'm quote new to not aversary end quote.

69
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,040
And you answered my question on episode 91 feeding frenzy. I was the question that inspired the title.

70
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,360
You told me the best way to heal my newly single heart was to get my girl shark pack together,

71
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,440
break some hearts and eat some seals. I'm pleased to say I followed your advice and 2012 became a

72
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,840
year where I took chances, met new people and followed and moved to a new city where I met the

73
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,640
man of my dreams. Eight years later, I'm happily married with a beautiful puppy and I listened to

74
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,720
feeding frenzy anytime I need to pick me up. All the best, Jenny. I'm assuming you named either

75
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,600
the puppy or your husband after us. Yeah. Or both. And I'm also assuming that the husband is a very

76
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,720
handsome, very eloquent Mako shark who has gotten the power to speak like through magic, like in the

77
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,480
movie that won the Oscar. I can't remember Free Willy Big Man in the Water. Yeah, I think that

78
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,560
my bet and Jenny did not describe the husband. But here's what I like to fix there. Yeah,

79
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,360
a very resilient, maybe a little scarred seal. Oh, I see. And Jenny attempted to eat the seal,

80
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,400
but then they fell in love and now married and they have a seal pup. And that's what she means

81
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,480
by puppy. It's a seal baby. A human seal hybrid. All right. Well, that sounds like a listener of

82
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,400
our show. Right, guys? Hey, what if on 500 we just fucking rip them up? We didn't really talk about

83
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,400
this beforehand, but what about on 500? Okay, let's do this. Ready? Hey, everybody, thank you.

84
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,440
There is no way for us to say thanks enough to make up for how much you have done for us in our

85
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,720
lives and created a bounty and a blessing that we, or any human being who has ever lived,

86
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,480
does not deserve. Thank you. But we can't just do that the whole time. No. So what if we just rip

87
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,880
them the fuck up? And maybe that'll be a start of a new era, you know? The start of the new area

88
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,560
is the new areola. Oh, we're shock jocks. We insult people, we talk about nasty body parts.

89
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,520
The new energy. Let's talk about the nastiest body part. The areola. That's fucking good.

90
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:26,640
Areola 51. Am I right, boys? Alien-ness. Areola 51 is something that we need to nurture like a

91
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,840
small flame that hold that idea of areola 51. I want to like make sure that we do have enough

92
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,920
kindling to put on it and blow on it. Because what's the follow up? You know what I mean?

93
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Yeah. I mean, that's, that's, I want to, I want to nurture it until it's a spark right now. Skin

94
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,000
dependence day. Skin dependence day. Areola 51. It's really good. I'm getting close. You know

95
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,520
what I mean? I'm in the areola because it's like area. You can't actually do the same. Oh,

96
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,280
there it goes. Oh no, I killed the flame. Not enough kindling. Oh, damn it. Should we,

97
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,920
do you guys want to do a yahoo? This is going to be pretty fucking loosey goosey. Let's bring

98
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,920
somebody in. Let's bring in a special guest. Okay. Okay. Let's, but it's not, if we,

99
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,000
if we have a lot of them, it's not going to be very special, is it? So let's decide on three

100
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,040
right now. No, not three. Let's get them all in the room and we'll make them fight it out.

101
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,720
Let's bring our daddy in. Let's get dad in here because he does have diarrhea and I would like to.

102
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,240
He needs to go. He aided this beginning. He is bad off, boy.

103
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,800
Okay. Uh, hi dad. Hi. Do you remember how to do, by the way, this energy has been,

104
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,640
this episode has been so fucking low energy, dad. So if you could bring some spice and really get

105
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,040
us going, that'd be huge. Please display good microphone technique. Are we blaming that on

106
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,120
the pasta? I'm blaming it on the pasta and the fact that I broke my fucking spine last night

107
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,960
at our show where I did a full blown death drop. Hey dad, I wanted to, this is Clint McElroy. He's

108
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,840
Hey everybody. It's me, Clint McElroy bringing the energy. So yeah, give us that juice dad,

109
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:04,800
that stinky stuff, the shit we crave. About what? About funny stuff. Let me start by this. Okay.

110
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,240
What's your favorite moment from My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the podcast?

111
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,480
Uh, the first time I was on. Okay. When was that? Yeah. When was that? Um, it was a long time ago

112
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,520
because I was, we were still up on the hill in the old studios at the radio station. Yeah. And I had

113
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,640
to step outside because I was laughing too loud and it was bothering my recording compatriots.

114
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,720
I see. So I stepped outside. So wait, we just called you on the phone? Yeah. Yeah. We called

115
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,440
them on the phone. Was it for a bonus episode? Yeah. That was a full episode. We were on the

116
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,200
phone. This was back when we recorded the show on a fucking yak back on a broken talk boy. Uh,

117
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,120
yeah. We would hold it up to a landline. Dad, how would you say that, um, what's the biggest impact

118
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,800
on your life? Like how have we changed it? How have we fixed it? How we fixed it. It had, you have

119
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,960
fixed my life by enabling me to build my own career. Finally, you know, uh, to make something

120
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,840
of myself. Yeah. You know, um, and, and I've gotten, the big thing is I've gotten a chance to

121
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,240
like meet Joel from mystery science theater 3000. That was, that was a big life. Who's the best

122
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,480
famous person you've gotten to meet by riding our coattails? That's a good one. Uh, well,

123
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,520
now wait a minute. I think Joel, maybe Joel was Joel from mystery science theater. 3000 Joel from

124
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:41,520
it. Joel. Yeah. Um, Brandon Ralph was a nice get. Nice dude. Fucking jacked tall. What did you think

125
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:48,880
of Brandon, Brandon, Ralph's huge muscles? His frame. Um, his pecs were good, but when he

126
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,280
pulled up his shirt and showed us his six pack, I thought that was a little, it's weird that he has

127
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,360
to do it every 15 minutes. He has a timer on his watch. Excuse me. Yeah. And he actually, it was,

128
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,520
he said Superman, make a whoopee and he pulls up his shirt and he's got a six pack of Michelob

129
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,840
ultra under there every time. Uh, that was, that was good. Um, what's your favorite city we visited

130
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,400
for live shows? And what's the worst city? Yeah. Listen for me going, I will go back to the Wilbur

131
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,440
in Boston. Well, you say that we are specifically not going back to the Wilbur this year.

132
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,720
Well, I still, that, that first time we did a live Taz and we stepped out on the stage

133
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,280
and I've never experienced anything like that. And I've done boys. I've been,

134
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,880
walked a lot of stages. I've trod a lot of boards, but that was an extremely cool moment.

135
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,480
I felt like that was, that was awesome. Um, but it's not the 500th episode of the adventure zone.

136
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Correct? No. Oh, it's not. No. What is this for? Uh, okay. Uh, and what was that least favorite

137
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,480
city? Which one did you really hate? It was a real stinker and be honest, be honest about it.

138
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
Yeah. We'll bleep it out. We'll bleep it out. We'll bleep it out because Hey dad,

139
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,760
after 500 we're fucking ripping them, dude. Yeah, dude. I would have to say the time we spent in

140
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:20,960
San Francisco was, I can't believe you actually answered it. One of the best times. Hey folks,

141
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Clint McElroy. Thank you so much. Am I done? You're actually done. Yeah. You're done. Do you

142
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,600
want to say anything earnest? Oh, honest, earnest. Yeah. You mean like going on about how damn proud

143
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,600
I am of you guys? Get out, get out. No, I love that stuff. I just, I'm very proud of you guys.

144
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:45,200
I really, and the, just, just to be able to look on my oldest son's face and see how happy he is

145
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:54,320
that I am proud of. Oh God. And, and look, I, um, I don't want to really. Hey dad, on your way out,

146
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,240
will you send in the clowns? Just tell them they're up. Do we want to send another get,

147
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,920
am I done? If Henry's not up, can you send, can you ask Rachel to come in? Uh, okay. So let's

148
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,240
talk about how the show, do you all think it has changed since we became parents? I think it's,

149
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,400
all our jokes are still totally relatable. I think everything hasn't changed. I think that

150
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,720
we didn't miss a fucking step, did we? I don't think we missed a step, did we? Have you guys

151
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,680
started encountering the idea of like, now our kids will soon listen to like shit we said,

152
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,680
um, like five, six, seven, eight, 10 years ago. Are you reaching that part with, are you reaching

153
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,760
that with Charlie where Charlie's like talking to you about, hey, come on in, come on in. Join us.

154
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,480
Is Henry asleep? No. That really traps my ass. If I'm being honest. Anyways, here's Rachel. Hi hun.

155
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,880
Hi. Um, how are you doing? Are you frustrated because our son didn't take a nap? This is an

156
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,280
honest place. I'm, I'm kind of frustrated. I did some work in there, told him a story about

157
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,080
Superman. I thought he liked it. Wait, was it off the dome? It was right. I flipped it right off

158
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,320
the dome. What did he do? He wanted to be slow in his story and beat the Joker. So anyway,

159
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,200
and that didn't work. He's not asleep. No, he's not asleep. All right. Well, I'm not worried

160
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,360
about it. What, um, what am I, am I supposed to? Well, this is kind of a retrospective, 500,

161
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,560
looking back. Your first, your face, if you could rank, this is gonna be really tough. If you could

162
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:35,760
rank your top 10 My Brother, My Brother B episodes. Uh, 17. Oh nice. Oh yeah. Hey, that's a safe bet.

163
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,680
Shooting before the first like 50 is a safe bet. 17 is gonna be like our, like we said some wild

164
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,840
shit and why did she pick 17? Which leads me to 43. Oh, that's a dog whistle right there. And

165
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,400
those two, if you think about it, canonically are pretty linked actually. Yikes. I mean, I could

166
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,360
continue to just name numbers. How about I say my least favorite ones? Okay. Yeah. So number one.

167
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,160
Yeah. That's an easy, easy call. I bet everyone at home is going.

168
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:19,200
Yeah. You, you came on the team later. You were recruited by Tom Cruise's guys,

169
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,000
the ones he uses to find brides. Yeah. We needed to get Griffin married to be a little bit more

170
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,800
relatable. The admins whittled down the list and you were brought on the team a little bit later

171
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,440
after the product had already been in production for a few years. Now is the product you

172
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,680
in this scenario of the podcast? Um, it's, we're, it's symbiotic. Or is it your seed?

173
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Oh yeah. My seed? Well, let's talk about my seed. Okay. Pretty cool.

174
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,800
Made a little guy with it. You did. I didn't. Hey, we did it. Thank you. You took my seed.

175
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,040
And you ran with it. I really, I've seen the before and after and you did a great job.

176
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,320
You made it your own dude. Don't say that that's weird slime is I, I had anything to do with it

177
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,440
afterwards. Rachel, you've listed the first episode of this podcast. Yeah. If you imagine being 10

178
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:25,440
years ago and being someone who listed that, can you, is there even a glimmer in your mind,

179
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,640
even a spark where you think, bet these guys are going to make $500. This is the sort of thing

180
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,960
that 500 of them will be. I mean, I didn't even think you guys would still be brothers by now.

181
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,800
I just assumed that like people who listened to that first episode is like, if you find an injured

182
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,160
baby bird and you're like, I'm going to nurse it back to health. But then you found out you had

183
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,120
to nurse that bird for like 500 days. And you're like, Oh, I really thought he'd be flying by now.

184
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,200
You only have to nurse the bird for the first like 100 days. And then you're just waiting for

185
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,520
him to fly because today, the day you fly with more gems about horses. Yeah. We met about a year

186
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:12,240
after the show had started. You and Rachel, not us. No, me and Rachel, uh, our guest. And I met

187
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,520
you right after you did your second city show or right before somewhere around there. It was right

188
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,440
before. Yeah. Yeah. This would have been, uh, and did you go back? We kind of had a little flirt

189
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,840
going on, a little correspondence going on for a while after. This is great with Justin sitting

190
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,880
in between us. And did you go back and listen to the old episodes where I would talk pretty much

191
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,880
about like, you know, how I didn't wash my Bush or some shit like that and be like, I can't not

192
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,040
get with him. I was actually always surprised at how comfortable you were talking about how

193
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,520
terrible your digestive system was. I was like, this man is really comfortable talking about his

194
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,320
diarrhea on a podcast and this, and he's trying to be my boyfriend. But when we met, I did have

195
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,200
bad diarrhea. I got on the airplane and told you about that. But Rachel, you now have the insight

196
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,800
that you can share with our listeners at home. Is that just a funny persona? I mean, he plays it up

197
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,600
for sure. Mr. Bad guy. That's a good character. The grooving place at home. Rock solid digestion.

198
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,840
This guy, he poops once a day, every day. Same time. Same time. Say you're watching by it. It

199
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,560
lasts an hour and a half. I love you a lot. I love you too. And I'm glad I met you because I feel

200
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,200
like I can't go back and listen to episodes one through 50. You were a lot sadder. I was much

201
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,160
sadder. That seemed to be a thing. I remember early after we started dating, getting tweets

202
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,520
from people like, I miss sad. He was funnier when he was sad. He wasn't. Wicked was not.

203
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,440
Well, Rachel, thank you so much for your contributions to our family. Thanks for having

204
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,040
me. Yeah. And the love and laughter that you provide me every day with your smile, your grace.

205
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:07,520
Okay. Justin's clocking out. Okay. Who'd you get? Your wife. I got a big get for a real special,

206
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,680
special guest. Okay. This co-host of saw bones, a mayoral tour of misguided medicine. My wife,

207
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,760
my best friend, don't plug your own show. Smurl McElroy. Welcome Dr. McElroy. Thank you. I like

208
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,360
the purple mic. Yeah, that's very nice. You've been with her since the beginning, since before

209
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,640
the beginning, you were already shaping Justin into the performer and co-host that he is today.

210
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:39,120
Mm-hmm. What's it like to finally see all your hard work pay off and to have a partner who

211
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,720
finally is bringing something to the table? Because you were a doctor for a while. Well,

212
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,840
Justin was just like kind of a lay about video game journalist. And now he's able to provide

213
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,640
for you and give something to society. So you don't have to do all the work. Is it nice?

214
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,320
Yeah. I think it's a huge relief, really. I mean, you bet on somebody, you take that gamble,

215
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,600
you put all that work in and you just really hope at some point it pays off.

216
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,000
Sid, you've known us for a while. Can you remember the exact moment where success ruined us?

217
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,200
Or if you prefer me specifically, because I've always been ruined.

218
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,480
Yeah, Travis was ruined. Travis came pre-ruined from the factory.

219
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,880
We got our first iTunes review where somebody was like,

220
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
yeah, pretty good. And Travis was like, that's what did Travis.

221
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
I got second place in a lip sync battle in elementary school and ever since then.

222
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,560
He's just been spoiled milk.

223
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,600
I think the bidet has been a real turning point for you.

224
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,720
Was that not a present from you to him?

225
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,320
Well, I guess I take the blame for it.

226
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,600
But I became the sort of person that would appreciate the gift. I mean, in your defense.

227
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,080
You did want a bidet before I got you the bidet.

228
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,480
Now that he's got a pretty like constantly clean hole, like how has he been since that?

229
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:54,800
Yeah.

230
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,040
Have you noticed a sort of difference?

231
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,960
Do you mean as a lover?

232
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,040
No, I don't want to talk about that.

233
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,240
I don't either.

234
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,480
Hey, Sid, what's your favorite episode of the podcast of My Brother, My Brother and Me?

235
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
It's so hard to choose.

236
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,240
I bet it is, Sidney.

237
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,120
There's quite a few.

238
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
I bet it is hard. That's not why.

239
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,560
Sidney, what's your favorite bit from My Brother, My Brother and Me?

240
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,600
Don't do this.

241
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,080
You can't pick one favorite bit.

242
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,560
This isn't fair.

243
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,160
Nobody's taken Shrimp Heaven now yet.

244
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,400
Just pick one favorite bit.

245
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
Nobody's taken Donkey.

246
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,720
Donkey's huge right now.

247
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,920
Donkey's a pretty big one.

248
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,200
It's really sad that when I try to think of my favorite bits,

249
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,640
they're all from like over 300 episodes ago.

250
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
When I asked Sidney to come in here, Rachel said,

251
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
it's fine. I just did it. It took five minutes.

252
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
You have to stroke three of those a little bit.

253
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
But that quote is to be expected.

254
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,440
Oh, boy.

255
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,280
Sidney's refusing to do that though.

256
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,840
Maybe like,

257
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm very, I love them all.

258
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,280
It's just, you guys are so great.

259
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,400
More of a Taz fan.

260
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,480
You have listened to My Brother, My Brother and Me.

261
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
That's what hurts.

262
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,280
It's just one thing.

263
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,160
I've showed you videos of like, look at the funny thing I did.

264
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,560
I haven't listened since we had kids.

265
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,200
Okay.

266
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,920
Well, yeah, so you haven't heard all the shit

267
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
he's been talking about these two.

268
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,680
Everyone can agree all our best episodes were before that anyway,

269
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,400
to be fair.

270
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
That's where we were just really grinding.

271
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
We were just like, hey, we just got to record.

272
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,440
We just got to get an hour out there.

273
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,800
The show was our kid, wasn't it?

274
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,120
Yeah.

275
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
The three of us got together and made a baby

276
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,320
and the baby was our show.

277
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,800
There was a lot of horse stuff back then.

278
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,920
And that's fucking funny.

279
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,400
Why do you think that that's so funny, Sidney?

280
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,160
Sidney, why are horses so funny?

281
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
I mean, they're big.

282
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,160
They are, yeah.

283
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
We never talk about that, I think.

284
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,080
They got funny names.

285
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,480
They kind of look like they're going to talk, right?

286
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,800
They look like at any moment they're going to,

287
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,640
and it's weird then that you like ride them.

288
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,920
Have you guys seen Bojack Horseman?

289
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,320
He talks.

290
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,040
He talks, yeah.

291
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
I'm glad to finally get like a doctor's opinion on the fact

292
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
that horses' mouths look like they should be talking.

293
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,440
I feel that so to my core.

294
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,040
Sid, was there a moment in our meteoric rise to podcast stardom

295
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,360
where you thought, I got to start treating him better.

296
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,160
I'm going to lose him.

297
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,920
Um, yes.

298
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,280
When was that?

299
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,120
No?

300
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,080
Okay, that's fine.

301
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
You treat me very well.

302
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,880
No, no.

303
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,120
I mean, you know.

304
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah, I guess.

305
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,120
I guess at some point with like, you know, the live shows and everything

306
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,640
and everybody cheering for you all.

307
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:28,960
Yeah.

308
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,000
Cheering like, I want to fuck your brains out, Justin.

309
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,480
Stuff like that.

310
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,920
Look at that sexy guy.

311
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,320
Yeah.

312
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm going to feel him.

313
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
I love the one who only wears Disney shirts.

314
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm going to steal that wiener.

315
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,560
Sydney, what do you feel like you as a podcaster have learned from us

316
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,400
in your own podcasting careers?

317
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,560
Well, I mean, this sounds like I'm stroking your egos,

318
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,880
but everything, I would never have done a podcast otherwise.

319
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,000
This is that good shit.

320
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,960
Keep it coming.

321
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,320
No, but I mean, it's true.

322
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,560
I would never have thought to do it.

323
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,080
I mean, in the doctor world, a lot of us don't know what podcasts are

324
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
or how to find them or get them or how you go about it.

325
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,680
You've been telling them about it though, right?

326
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:13,920
Yes.

327
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
She burns them cassette tapes.

328
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,320
I mean, it's growing, but doctors are never on like the cutting edge

329
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
of like cool new media or anything cool and new.

330
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Sounds like those doctors have borders and they're not without them.

331
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,240
They have some borders around what they'll listen to.

332
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,160
And they only shop at borders.

333
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,880
They only shop at borders, which is closed so they can't buy podcasts.

334
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,520
You know, just side note, because you just made me remember this

335
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,680
for like the first 50 episodes to get my friends to listen to it.

336
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,040
I did burn it on the CD.

337
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,920
Oh, yeah, for sure.

338
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
Yeah, I used to because I worked at the Shakespeare Company

339
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,720
and then like a company van and I would use it to drive like materials

340
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,640
and then the touring company would use.

341
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,920
I would like leave the CD in the like in the player

342
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,080
so that when they started the car, it would just be on.

343
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,120
That sucks, bud.

344
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,080
That's rough.

345
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,360
But look at me now.

346
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,160
That's rough.

347
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,400
Even now at work, sometimes people will be like, how's your blog?

348
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,200
Oh, cool.

349
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,840
It's pretty good.

350
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,320
I mean, this is a confessional sort of medium, right?

351
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
Now, is there a possibility the doctors are doing that because they're jealous?

352
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,200
I don't think so.

353
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't think they know what I'm doing.

354
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,800
Would you say how many who's who would you say Sidney has saved more lives?

355
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,360
OK, this is interesting because we get emails from people.

356
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
They're like, you saved my life.

357
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,640
Yeah, you really made me laugh.

358
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
Us or a doctor.

359
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,340
You.

360
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,240
A doctor, me.

361
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,960
OK, yeah.

362
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,880
OK, but let's change the parameters.

363
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,920
OK, OK, think about it this way, right?

364
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,800
You're strong, right?

365
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,280
You could pick up 50 pound weight and very tiny picks up a big crumb.

366
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,800
I think that's more impressive.

367
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,040
Right.

368
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,600
So you may have saved more lives, but the amount we've saved comparatively.

369
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,120
We are a pizza rat.

370
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,320
Yeah, you see us saving our life and you're like,

371
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,560
that shouldn't be them doing that, but we're going to do it anyway.

372
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,480
I guess what I'm saying is, are you proud of us?

373
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,240
Of course I'm proud.

374
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,640
You all have definitely your skill set has brought a lot more joy to people

375
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,800
than I think my skill set does.

376
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,240
But the problem is you also do podcasts and I do not doctor.

377
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,560
So you still handily whip my ass.

378
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,720
Yeah, Sidney, thank you so much for joining us.

379
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,600
Will you at some point, will you see if Charlie wants to come in?

380
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,760
We'll get a real Bim Bam fan on here.

381
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,480
She will.

382
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,720
Yeah.

383
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,920
Are you sure you're ready for that?

384
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,320
Could I get my wife in to talk about how great I am?

385
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,200
Sure, yes, I guess.

386
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,440
Okay.

387
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,120
But we got to hurt, we're running out of time.

388
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,920
It's just that you guys, you got to talk to your wives

389
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,440
and I just miss Teresa a lot.

390
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Yeah, I know, but look at the time.

391
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,760
Yeah, I know.

392
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
Where does it go?

393
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,200
I mean, we're only a half an hour into our hour long show.

394
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
Wow, okay, we have time for lots of special guests.

395
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,600
Yeah.

396
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,960
Thank you, Sidney.

397
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,520
Thank you all.

398
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,640
I'm going to go blast off in the bathroom while we wait for our next guest.

399
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,200
All right, this is a segment where Travis and I talk about Griffin who has left the room.

400
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Do you want me to get pissy, sir?

401
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,760
Yes, please.

402
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,280
I just think I might not edit this one.

403
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,760
Oh?

404
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,680
Yeah, I think I might just leave all this.

405
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,560
Wouldn't that be fun?

406
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,480
I mean, Justin and I were really quiet while you peed so we could hear it through the microphone.

407
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,280
Oh, cool.

408
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,680
Yeah.

409
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,720
That's authentic.

410
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
That is, that's that rough and raw stuff, you know?

411
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,920
Let's listen to how Justin would do it.

412
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,400
Uh-oh.

413
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,280
It's really quiet.

414
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,000
Maybe he's nervous.

415
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,680
I hear it a little bit.

416
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,280
Maybe we should open the door.

417
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,480
Just open the door.

418
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
The acoustics are bad.

419
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,160
We need to get room tone on your pissies.

420
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,040
We're going to have you finish this bottle of water and do a take two.

421
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Real quick before he gets back, Travis, you're my favorite.

422
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,920
Okay, thanks.

423
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,400
All right, just count us back in.

424
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,120
Okay, it was just your pissy was real quiet.

425
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,320
And a three and a four.

426
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,160
You know what to do.

427
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,240
Uh, do you want to do another catch up?

428
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,400
Yeah.

429
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,960
Want to check in?

430
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,680
My wife?

431
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah.

432
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,880
My wife.

433
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,760
My wife.

434
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,120
I legitimately thought I had a problem with the weird excess chocolate in my office,

435
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,880
but Justin being like, just throw it away, made me feel much better.

436
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,120
I have not thrown away the old chocolate, but it comforts me to know that the chocolate police

437
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,800
will not come for me if I do.

438
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,480
I would now appreciate your advice on whether I should make a sign for my office with the

439
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,560
nickname you gave me, Dr. Prematorium's Fudge-a-matorium.

440
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,440
That's good shit.

441
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:19,920
Yeah.

442
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,880
Hi, honey.

443
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,440
Hello.

444
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
Yes, make that sign.

445
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,920
Hello, welcome.

446
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,040
That was a pretty low stakes sort of problem that we saw too, huh?

447
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,640
Yeah, we did start doing a lot more slow pitches in our later years.

448
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,720
Well, you can only do so much roommate shit.

449
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Now, uh, joining us in the studio is the co-host of, uh, Shmanners, a wildly popular

450
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
advice cast, uh, that I also happen to be on.

451
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,560
And, uh, it's Teresa McElroy, and she also, she and I started dating two months before

452
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,240
we started recording My Brother, My Brother, Me.

453
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,160
So she has been there from the beginning, and you've really seen me become unbearable.

454
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,640
Is that true?

455
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,120
It's true.

456
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,600
Yeah.

457
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,760
I think that the, that the real catalyst for, um, Travis's head not fitting through the

458
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,880
door anymore is the thank Travis for Travis.

459
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,680
Yeah, that did happen.

460
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,200
I think I started myself.

461
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,920
I think you did.

462
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,840
Which is, yeah, very appropriate.

463
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,480
Yeah, that's the thing.

464
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
It's like, oh, who said that first?

465
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,800
I did.

466
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,640
I love, I love, um, that Teresa needed basically no prompting to get into that.

467
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,240
Someone said, hey, isn't Travis kind of, and she just ripped the sleeves off her shirt.

468
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,160
It's like, let's fucking go.

469
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,320
Well, here's the thing, here's what people don't see, the listeners at home, is that

470
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
my wife does not think I'm funny.

471
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
And so the balance there is like-

472
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,880
I like to make him work pretty hard for it.

473
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,200
I'll come out and be like, hey, listen to this funny thing I did.

474
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
And she'll just look at me like, that's dumb.

475
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,040
And I'm like, oh no, people laughed at it on Twitter.

476
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,400
Have you heard about play along at home?

477
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,200
Um, I have.

478
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,760
What do you think?

479
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,320
Let's get your thoughts on-

480
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,440
In the dark moments.

481
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,240
In the dark times with Travis staring into a mirror lit only by candles and his own sadness.

482
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,280
And he says, maybe I should stop doing play along at home.

483
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,680
That is the opposite of what happens, good sir.

484
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,760
I come busting into whatever room she's in like, listen to these questions I wrote.

485
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
You'll never believe what I found out about squirrels.

486
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,960
What's your feelings on play along at home?

487
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,560
Well, the first time that he came to me with this quiz, I said,

488
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,200
so is this quiz for your brothers or for the listeners?

489
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,880
And he said-

490
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,000
A good important question.

491
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,360
He said, yes, it's for everyone.

492
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,120
It's for everyone, so play along at home.

493
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,760
Okay.

494
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:33,040
And I thought that these would be maybe like, like it would be some kind of like trivia game.

495
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,840
It is.

496
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,720
But it's not really.

497
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,520
Now, honey, would you say that maybe I happen to have a certain,

498
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,880
I don't know, dark desire to create things that only I find funny?

499
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,800
Oh, you mean like sad libs?

500
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,600
Like sad libs and play along at home and pretty much half the stuff I find-

501
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,120
All the jokes you've ever said.

502
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,640
Yeah, it says like, I find that you can't please-

503
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,240
Okay, I heard that, Justin.

504
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,400
Not all the jokes, you're right.

505
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,920
Honestly, you've honed me, I would say to a razor sharp edge.

506
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,160
Only of my best stuff makes it on air now.

507
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,960
Now tell me, is play along at home part of the razor?

508
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,440
Hey, you wouldn't believe the other shit I don't use.

509
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,720
Now, Charlize, what is your favorite episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me?

510
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,480
Well, I would be remiss if I didn't say Spaghetti Gettin' One.

511
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,680
You are the first of the wives to actually name an episode, so thank you.

512
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,640
Thank you for that.

513
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,800
What's your favorite bit?

514
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,040
Does Fugue for Tin Brothers, does that count as a bit?

515
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,160
I think it does, yes.

516
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,560
I don't think so, we didn't really write that.

517
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:42,880
Right.

518
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,440
Technically, Lin stole the music for it, so-

519
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,160
And our jokes.

520
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,920
So he didn't really write it either.

521
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,480
So that's the real noodle scratcher.

522
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,800
It is.

523
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,720
Who wrote that?

524
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,840
This is like that time travel-

525
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,600
To whom does the bit belong?

526
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,360
Exactly, if I go back in time and I hand Shakespeare a copy of Hamlet,

527
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
and then he uses that to make Hamlet.

528
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
Who wrote Hamlet, right?

529
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Still Shakespeare, or I guess who-

530
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,680
No, because I'm creating a cyclical loop of where did I get it from?

531
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
Shakespeare.

532
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,520
Okay, but I'm taking it back to him and giving it to him,

533
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
and he's using that to make Hamlet.

534
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,800
Yeah, but you still gave it to him because you had it from Shakespeare.

535
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
Damn, Griffin, you solved it.

536
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,760
What he's not saying is then he disappears from the photograph, right?

537
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,200
Why is Shakespeare in the photograph?

538
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,720
Who took a photograph of Shakespeare?

539
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,200
And then you gotta get Shakespeare and Mrs. Shakespeare

540
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,360
to hook up in a car at their junior prom.

541
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
Gotta get Biff out of there.

542
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,680
What if he went back too far and you gave it to teenage Shakespeare

543
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,920
and he wrote it was like, pfft, this sucks.

544
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,240
Bring me to play with jugs.

545
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,960
And then he never wrote anything.

546
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,560
But then he wrote Romeo and Juliet.

547
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,840
Sure, right, okay, that's fair.

548
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,040
Teresa Marie, thank you so much for joining us.

549
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,960
And for making our brother a better person.

550
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,240
A thankless job that made Justin a better person.

551
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,680
You've got so many more miles to go, Teresa.

552
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,600
I am a bearable person now.

553
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,160
You're my favorite person, Travis.

554
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,040
Thank you, you're my favorite too.

555
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,600
I love you.

556
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,160
I love you too.

557
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh no, they're kissing, they're friction right on the table.

558
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,320
That's how we do it.

559
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
And I hope that your listeners know that it's all in good fun.

560
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,240
We rib each other.

561
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,520
Apparently not my jokes.

562
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,680
No, your jokes are terrible.

563
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,680
She got the memo, man.

564
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,720
Post 500, ripping that butt.

565
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,920
Thank you, Teresa.

566
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,720
You're welcome.

567
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,600
She's ripping that butt.

568
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,280
She's ripping your butt, dude.

569
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,640
Okay, so we have in the room now.

570
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,760
Griffin went to go get Henry.

571
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,360
I don't know how long we're gonna have him.

572
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,240
Bebe, hello.

573
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
Hello.

574
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,960
Well, that's Charlie.

575
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,040
That was a no from Henry.

576
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
That's a big no from Henry.

577
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,300
Okay.

578
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,760
Griffin, you share a microphone with me.

579
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,560
Okay.

580
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,600
That's a rubber glove.

581
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,360
That's a rubber glove, Charlie.

582
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,800
Why does Travis have that in his office?

583
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
That's a great question.

584
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
Is it for weird bad stuff?

585
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,120
No, it's for my hair.

586
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,840
Hi, Bebe.

587
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,200
Please don't call me Travis, Bebe.

588
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,960
You know I don't like that.

589
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,640
Stop touching the microphone, Charlie.

590
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,920
Wait, good mic technique.

591
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,400
Come on, baby.

592
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,200
Good mic technique.

593
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,240
We've done our drills at home.

594
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,040
Hi.

595
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,840
Hi, Charlie.

596
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,640
What's your favorite bit?

597
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,560
Like you watch, you know how sometimes you and I,

598
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,280
before you go to bed, watch at your asking for it,

599
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
watch some My Brother, My Brother, Me cartoons

600
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,120
that people make on YouTube?

601
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,320
You know how we watch this sometimes?

602
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,840
The one about ice cream

603
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,560
or the one where you make a new outfit for that?

604
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,680
Those are my two faves.

605
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,560
Oh, is the one about ice cream the one with the flavor brown?

606
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:32,960
Yeah.

607
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah, that was pretty good.

608
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
How's that song go?

609
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,880
Well, I forgot.

610
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,360
Do you want ice cream?

611
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,960
Oh, that dreamy, screaming cream

612
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,520
and the chocolate flavor of vanilla bean.

613
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,920
I want to switch.

614
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,680
Okay, do you want to come over and sit with me?

615
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,720
Hey, Bebe.

616
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,920
Why don't you, why don't you-

617
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,480
There you go.

618
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,680
Yeah, go sit over there, cousins.

619
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,600
Oh, that's great.

620
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,720
Charlie, if you did a podcast about anything,

621
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
what would you do a podcast about?

622
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,280
Candy.

623
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,440
Okay, what would you say about candy?

624
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,000
That I love candy

625
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,120
and we'll talk about all the different kinds of candy.

626
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,560
Yeah, Bebe, what's your favorite candy?

627
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,120
Like those weird little strawberry hard candies

628
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,000
with Gush in the middle?

629
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,400
You like the gummies too.

630
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,680
Do you like sour gummies?

631
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,120
I don't.

632
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,680
Well, I like sweet gummies.

633
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,080
Okay.

634
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,920
Okay, cousins, don't fight over the microphones, please.

635
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,840
Charlie, do you think Marin was overrated

636
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,680
just because he's been on the scene for so long?

637
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,180
Yeah.

638
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,680
Maybe.

639
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,080
Yeah, maybe.

640
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,440
Do you think when cereal came around

641
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
and sort of like opened up a lot of people to podcasting-

642
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,840
Bebe, don't play with the wind filter, please.

643
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,800
Leave the wind filter there.

644
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,120
Just leave them right there.

645
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,160
We don't need to touch it anymore.

646
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,200
Hey, Bebe, don't touch.

647
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,680
Don't touch.

648
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,840
So, Charlie, I was asking you about cereal season one.

649
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,560
It seemed to really cause a real zeitgeist.

650
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,200
Do you think that was for the positive or for the negative?

651
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,920
Do you think?

652
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,520
I'd like a critical analysis.

653
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,560
What do you think about cereal?

654
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,040
It's amazing.

655
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,200
Yeah.

656
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,440
What is your favorite thing about cereal?

657
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,080
That when some cereals get soggy, it gets really sweet.

658
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,800
Yeah.

659
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,480
Bebe, do you like cereal?

660
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,960
Yes.

661
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,000
What's your favorite cereal?

662
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,280
Strawberry.

663
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,160
You like strawberry.

664
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Okay, I'm picking up that I think-

665
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,760
Is your favorite food strawberries?

666
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,200
Yes.

667
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,640
Yeah, strawberries are pretty good.

668
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,560
What's your favorite My Brother, My Brother, and Me bit?

669
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,720
You silly, Daddy.

670
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,440
Okay.

671
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,320
I am pretty silly.

672
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,760
Do you think Daddy's funny?

673
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,480
Yes.

674
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,800
Yeah.

675
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,960
Hey, can I ask you a question, Bebe?

676
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,920
What?

677
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,600
How do you feel about play along at home?

678
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
Do you like it or is it really bad?

679
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,560
I like it.

680
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,800
Yeah, that's who I'm doing it for.

681
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,200
Okay.

682
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,760
My turn.

683
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
Okay, Charlie, what do you think about play along at home?

684
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,520
It's amazing.

685
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:43,840
Yeah.

686
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,480
Wow.

687
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Hey, I'm resonating with the younger generation.

688
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,080
I'm picking up that new demographic.

689
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,200
That's interesting.

690
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,720
Do you think that Uncle Travis and Uncle Griffin are too mean to Daddy

691
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,200
about opening his refreshing sodas in the middle of the show?

692
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,760
I knew it.

693
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,840
Maybe.

694
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,320
Maybe.

695
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,320
But he does kind of grip it and rip it, right?

696
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,840
He grips it and he rips it, right?

697
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,000
He really makes a meal of it.

698
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,520
No.

699
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,480
No.

700
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,200
Charlie, do you have any other favorite My Brother, My Brother, and Me bits

701
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,120
that you'd like to share with us?

702
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,360
No, those are the only two.

703
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,080
Only those two?

704
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,800
Silly Justin.

705
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
Bebe, we've been thinking about rebranding.

706
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,760
Can you think of another title?

707
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,360
Like what else the show could be called?

708
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,280
No, me.

709
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:34,880
Uncle Travis, what's your favorite, favorite of your podcast?

710
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,380
Me.

711
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,680
Oh, good question, Charlie.

712
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,320
My favorite bit is there is an episode where we talk about Tim Curry

713
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,480
driving an ice cream truck and he says,

714
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,120
I'm hanging out in here with Pikachu and Charmander.

715
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,240
I'm chilling in here with Pikachu and Charmander.

716
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,800
Charizard, pump the brakes.

717
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
Charizard is driving a pylon.

718
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,400
We're all eating push pops.

719
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,800
And the way that Griffin says it backs me up every time I think about it.

720
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,040
With Charmander.

721
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,320
Bebe, will you tell us a joke?

722
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:12,880
What?

723
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,400
Charlie, that's a pretty good joke.

724
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,360
Hey, Bebe, guess what?

725
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,440
Chicken butt.

726
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,360
That's actually way better than Travis's.

727
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,360
Hey, Charlie, can you tell it?

728
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,840
Can you tell us a joke?

729
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,560
Do you know a joke?

730
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,240
All right, now don't be silly.

731
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,840
Joke telling is deadly serious.

732
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,240
Yeah.

733
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,280
Guess who?

734
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,600
Who?

735
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,440
Chicken poo.

736
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,000
That's good.

737
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,400
That's good.

738
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,120
That kind of was the same formula.

739
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,360
Why?

740
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,640
Chicken pee.

741
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,280
Chicken pee?

742
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,640
It's pretty good.

743
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
This show used to be about something, wouldn't you say, Charlie?

744
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,400
Yeah.

745
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,160
Charlie, what do you think this show's about?

746
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,600
Yeah, what does My Brother, My Brother mean about?

747
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,280
If you had to tell a friend what our-

748
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,240
Chicken poop.

749
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
It's about chicken poop.

750
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,200
Chicken hand.

751
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,080
Chicken hand.

752
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,280
Yeah, it's another part of the chicken.

753
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,640
If you had to tell-

754
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,760
Chicken nose.

755
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,120
Hey, Charlie, would you say that Justin has changed since he had kids?

756
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,080
Chicken poop.

757
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,200
Do you think I'm different since I had kids?

758
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,640
Bebe, please stop talking about chicken poop.

759
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,000
I've never been a lot of chicken poop.

760
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,960
Yeah, that's wild, isn't it?

761
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,440
That's a good point.

762
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,960
All right, well-

763
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,760
All right, thanks, guys.

764
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,640
Thanks, cousins.

765
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,200
I love you.

766
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

767
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,160
Well, then you got to bring something.

768
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,880
Bebe, stop hanging off the microphone.

769
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,480
No, no, no.

770
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400
I mean like a bit or something.

771
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,520
Like a story or-

772
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,720
Bebe, would you guys sing a song?

773
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh, hey, she does celebrity impressions.

774
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,320
Oh.

775
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,280
Oh, tight.

776
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,240
Do Michael Keaton.

777
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,920
No, do a celebrity impression.

778
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,000
One of your best ones.

779
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,120
Is that Spongebob?

780
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,600
Yeah.

781
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,240
Very good.

782
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,640
Very good.

783
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,360
All right, thanks, Charlie.

784
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,080
One more.

785
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,120
Okay, she got one more.

786
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,320
Just a little bit more heat.

787
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,640
Uh-oh.

788
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,920
Bebe's going to walk the room and explore the space.

789
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,240
She has to move the microphone from the stand.

790
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,000
Charlie, do your impression.

791
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Kermit the Frog here.

792
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,200
That's good stuff.

793
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,920
That's very good.

794
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,640
I love it.

795
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,760
Bebe, do you want to sing a song?

796
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,640
Twinkle, twinkle in the stars.

797
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,360
How I wonder what you are.

798
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,720
Can I sing a song?

799
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,440
Sure, Charlie.

800
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,160
All the other girls here are stars.

801
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,240
Beyond the northern lights.

802
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,480
They try to shine into your current life.

803
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,560
Too close and too bright.

804
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,840
They try and they try.

805
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,320
But everything that they do is a ghost of a trace.

806
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,080
I'm a pale imitation of you.

807
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,880
I'll be the one to drive you back home, Kathleen.

808
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,400
Yay.

809
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,080
Wow, that's really good, Charlie.

810
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,360
Well done.

811
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,040
She wrote that last week, actually.

812
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,320
I told her it wasn't good enough.

813
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,800
I'm sorry.

814
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,240
We're going to keep retooling it.

815
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,800
Come on.

816
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,080
All right, you two kids out of here.

817
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,640
Bye, Charlie.

818
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,280
Bye, Bebe.

819
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,920
Bye, cousins.

820
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,760
Leave the microphone, Charlie.

821
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,640
Charlie, leave the microphone.

822
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,600
She's doing an Airhead-style protest where she won't leave the studio.

823
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,000
She's got a gun full of hot sauce.

824
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,640
Good job, guys.

825
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,920
Guys, I just figured out how we're going to amp this episode up.

826
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,560
We got a microphone.

827
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,440
We can take out the thing.

828
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,880
You got a pull-up bar.

829
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,600
I say...

830
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,760
Oh, we're all going to see how many pull-ups we can do?

831
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,840
I think this episode has got to have a pull-up contest.

832
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,400
Okay.

833
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,960
Yeah, all right.

834
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,840
Now, Griffin, we'll just take turns holding the microphone up to the person doing the pull-up.

835
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,640
Yeah, it's fucking tight.

836
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,360
This is good.

837
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,120
Travis, move your big basket of laundry that you have in your office for some reason out of the way.

838
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,320
That's where my closet is.

839
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,480
Yeah, again, in the office is a strange...

840
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:42,960
Okay, wow.

841
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,920
That's a big closet.

842
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,640
Yeah, sure.

843
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,480
Get a big bag of barbecue.

844
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,000
It's not a bag of barbecue.

845
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,520
Just the usual office shit.

846
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,000
I cleaned it up.

847
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,800
I cleaned it up so that you could be in here.

848
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,720
Okay, so who's going to go first?

849
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,440
How secure is this?

850
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,280
Because I already ate shit once.

851
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,840
It's secure.

852
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,880
Hang on all the time.

853
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,120
Okay, so do you use this?

854
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,080
Well, you can use hands like this or hands like this.

855
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,200
Can you do a pull-up?

856
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,520
Yeah.

857
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,720
I've never done one before.

858
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,360
You can do it.

859
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,160
In middle school, I tried to do one and the doctor, the gym doctor, told me to just stop.

860
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,960
If you want to do a pull-up...

861
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,160
Just go ahead now.

862
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,480
All right.

863
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,120
Okay, do it.

864
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,680
What are we counting as a pull-up?

865
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,480
If it goes...

866
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Get your chin up to your hand level.

867
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,480
One.

868
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Oh my God.

869
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,760
Two.

870
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,960
I can't do more than two.

871
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,920
All right, Justin, you're up.

872
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,400
Dude, that was...

873
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,040
Hey guys, that was my first pull-up ever in my life.

874
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,680
That was two.

875
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
Okay, that was two pull-ups.

876
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,720
Here we go.

877
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,040
This isn't fair.

878
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,120
I have more weight than Griffin does to pull up.

879
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,160
You got more power though.

880
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,600
Yeah, you have more torque.

881
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,680
You could really stomp my ass if you wanted to.

882
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,320
I won't be at that.

883
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,000
I didn't realize that I came up with the idea.

884
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,280
You are literally hoisting on your own batard.

885
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,840
One.

886
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,480
Baby.

887
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:56,800
One.

888
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,280
That's good.

889
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,080
That's one.

890
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,920
Oh, this is a bad idea.

891
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,400
All right.

892
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,320
Let's see how Dougie Big Arms does it.

893
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,440
Here we go, Dougie Big Arms.

894
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,320
That's one.

895
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,200
That's two.

896
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,120
His neck looks crazy and big.

897
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,600
That was three.

898
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,400
That's all you needed.

899
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,840
Yeah, all I needed to do was three to win and it's because I've been working out.

900
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,480
My guts hurt real bad.

901
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,840
Yeah, sure, babe.

902
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,640
Yeah, bud.

903
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,320
Hey, you got any more catch-ups, check-ins?

904
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,520
A check-in would be nice.

905
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,720
I would like to pause it if we can...

906
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,520
All right, let's pause it.

907
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,760
Let's get real for just a second.

908
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,920
We don't have to get saccharine, but I want to ask you guys your favorite sort of memory

909
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,040
associated with us doing this show.

910
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,680
Oh, cool.

911
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,560
Like for dad, like doing that first task at the Wilbur, that was huge.

912
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,200
That was a wild...

913
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,800
That was our first show that I remember thinking like, this is fucking wild.

914
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,840
This is getting out of hand.

915
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:54,800
I will never forget the first live show we ever did was opening for Jordan Jesse Go at

916
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,920
Second City in Chicago.

917
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:03,200
And we were very nervous to do it because we'd never done it live and we'd always relied

918
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,000
on it at that point.

919
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,120
I think we were literally at a year at that point, almost exactly.

920
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,520
Yeah, because it was on my birthday and we started on April 10th.

921
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,720
My birthday is April 17th.

922
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,600
And so we went out and I at that point called my girlfriend, Teresa, and I was like, I'm

923
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,160
so nervous.

924
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,320
She was like, just focus on making your brothers laugh.

925
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,200
Just don't worry about it.

926
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,320
I did a throw up backstage.

927
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,120
I did a literal mom skeddy right there.

928
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,920
That's not a joke.

929
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,880
I did that with my body.

930
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
And then the show went super great.

931
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,360
And it was the first time I had heard people laugh in the room at things we were saying

932
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:31,920
and enjoy it.

933
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,120
And that was very special.

934
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,880
I think, and it's why we haven't talked about Max Fun since we've been doing this wrap up

935
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,440
episode, but it's been mostly sort of bits and bytes and goofs and pranks and stuff.

936
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:53,200
But I remember waiting in line at Trader Joe's in Chicago with like two feet of snow on the

937
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,440
ground.

938
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,760
And I just walked and I was miserable and soggy.

939
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,440
And while I was checking out, I checked my email on my phone and there was one from Jesse

940
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,600
inviting us to be on the network.

941
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,120
And that was like, that's the most memorable moment.

942
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,800
That was a defining moment.

943
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,400
That's where it was like, hey, this is like, we're going to make money.

944
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,120
Dude, this is a job.

945
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,800
Yeah, this could be more than just a hobby.

946
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,480
And also we were all such big fans of his show and a bunch of Max Fun stuff.

947
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,160
And so the idea of, it was like meeting a celeb and you feel this weird like, oh, our

948
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,200
worlds are weirdly intersecting at this one moment.

949
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,720
Only it's not just the one moment.

950
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,880
It's like all the moments after.

951
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,680
That was so nice.

952
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:42,960
I think that was when we filmed the Candle Nights episode of the TV show and the having

953
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,320
the crowd of people there and like all our family being there and the filming and everything.

954
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,480
It really felt like, I don't know, it really felt like a thing.

955
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,920
Like we had like, it was one of the rare times where I've taken to say, you know, it's

956
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,840
hard when you make a podcast every week, there's another one to make.

957
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,760
So you very rarely like, that's part of the joke I think with us talking about like

958
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,600
favorite bits, favorite episodes or whatever.

959
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,920
Like, I don't know, we have to do another one next week.

960
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,600
You can't rest on your laurels too much.

961
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,040
It's just, you got to do another one.

962
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,360
So I think that was one of the few moments that actually took the time to realize how

963
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:21,200
far we'd come and how cool was what we get to do.

964
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,920
Yeah, you like, you know, getting pretty emotional during that shoot.

965
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:33,120
Like, I don't know that a lot of people realize like, that was our, and J.D. Amato taught

966
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:38,400
us this term as he taught us so many things because he single-handedly saved that show

967
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:45,440
and is a lifelong member of the of the fam, the martini shot, as he called it.

968
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,080
That was the last thing we filmed, like that scene about sitting there.

969
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,640
And it was a scary thing like us doing the TV show.

970
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,760
We had no idea what we're doing.

971
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,120
And this was like this weird, cathartic, we had just done the show.

972
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:01,280
I had just fucking smashed the mayor's car with the car, just fucking annihilated it

973
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,080
earlier in the day.

974
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,240
So I had a lot of emotions going on.

975
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,200
And to have that be the last thing we shot, that's standout.

976
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,320
That's been for me, like a recurring theme from the beginning, because the truth is,

977
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,560
the honest thing is going into it, Justin and Griffin were already doing the joystick

978
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:23,040
podcast and I wasn't doing anything that was like of any kind of public interest whatsoever.

979
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:28,640
Or and Justin, you know, whoever came up with the idea first, I think it was Justin.

980
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,560
But like, let's do a podcast.

981
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,520
And then it was Justin.

982
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:31,760
Yeah.

983
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,960
When we went into that first episode, Justin said, we're just going to do like a test

984
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,400
one to see how it goes.

985
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,240
And I was so nervous.

986
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,640
But him saying like, this is just like for practice.

987
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,680
And I was like, oh, OK.

988
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,800
So then I was able to do it.

989
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,040
Yeah.

990
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,080
And then we finished recording.

991
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,640
I still have to tell Travis that actually before every episode.

992
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,440
And then we finished recording.

993
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,360
Justin's like, OK, yeah, we'll just publish that.

994
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,920
And I was like, oh, thank God I didn't know we were publishing before.

995
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,200
It would have been so in my head.

996
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,600
And then people received it well and liked it.

997
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,200
And I'm like, it was nice.

998
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,280
So I guess, you know what?

999
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,320
Let's go ahead and call it there.

1000
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,880
This has been a wonderful time of reflection and growth.

1001
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
I want to say thank you to everyone who sent in updates.

1002
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,400
I'm sorry we only did two.

1003
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,840
Can you just rattle some off?

1004
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,440
I think that it would be-

1005
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,640
Back in October 2016, I wrote in saying that my wife and I bought a house and found 280

1006
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,640
rolls of toilet paper in unopened 40-roll boxes in the attic.

1007
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,160
There's 45 rolls left, and I just got the last box down for the attic.

1008
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,840
And I'm getting nervous because I can't go back to buying toilet paper after living like this.

1009
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,520
I can run the numbers and figure out how much shitting you're doing, my man.

1010
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,040
Let's see.

1011
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,760
You answer a question about my roommate about starting a bone collection on episode 476.

1012
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,040
I did follow your advice and just asked my roommates how to start a collection.

1013
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,520
But before they could help me, they turned out to be shitty people.

1014
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,320
So I'm moving out.

1015
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,720
Good news, I thought I-

1016
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,000
Good news, though.

1017
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,680
I asked my dad, who spends a lot of time in the woods, if he had any bones or advice

1018
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,720
how to get them, and now I have a pretty large collection.

1019
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,760
Thank you for your advice, even if my roommates turned out to be total jerks.

1020
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,520
Oh, this is a more recent one, but this one made me really happy.

1021
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,640
Hey, brothers.

1022
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,800
This is Calvin, the ravioli champion from the 2019 Candle Knights episode.

1023
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,640
I decided to take your advice and start training an heir to the ravioli throne.

1024
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,200
There's a young lady who also works at the camp who has been a competitor in the past,

1025
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,600
and she has the stomach of a true champion.

1026
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,400
We've talked and decided that I will tab out early this year,

1027
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,960
after a reasonable healthy ravioli, and in the same moment announce my successor

1028
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,440
and continue to coach her for the remainder of the meal.

1029
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,240
It will be a true move me moment, just like Rocky.

1030
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,520
Thank you for the advice on my positive situation and happy 500.

1031
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,920
A while back, I sent you a question about a fast food joint with an employee that wouldn't

1032
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,320
take my family's order until we solved his riddles.

1033
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,200
This led to you-

1034
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,320
This led you to the website riddles.com, which then grew into the segment riddle me piss.

1035
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,280
After listening to the episode, my family and I returned to the restaurant,

1036
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,000
only to find the burrito riddler wasn't working there anymore.

1037
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,880
In fact, we don't know where he went, or if he was real.

1038
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,240
And to this day, what should I do if I see him out in the world,

1039
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,160
continuing his chaotic work of refusing service to people until they solve his riddles?

1040
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,520
And should I be prepared with a riddle myself, should we ever cross paths again?

1041
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,160
It's the people who wrote in with the updates asking us for more advice.

1042
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,560
Yes.

1043
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,120
Like you, everybody only gets one.

1044
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:11,920
Everybody gets one.

1045
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,360
Oh, here's one.

1046
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,560
In episode 102, you answered my question about how to cope with my then-boyfriend

1047
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,520
going on a two-month trip to Scotland to do field work.

1048
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,600
Justin had just gotten through Sydney's time abroad in Africa, so your response was,

1049
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,160
as usual, a mix of heartfelt advice and hilarious goops.

1050
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,160
In addition to suggesting eternal sunshining myself, you recommended my boyfriend bring

1051
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,680
back three baubles from the trip, which then led to a bit that made your anti-juggler stance

1052
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,320
part of the NBNBM canon.

1053
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Damn, that was a big one then.

1054
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,480
Sorry, jugglers.

1055
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,080
Instead of pulling an eternal sunshine, we Skyped a lot and tried to stay busy.

1056
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,160
He did come back with three baubles from me.

1057
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,200
No juggling.

1058
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,960
And just a few months later, we got engaged.

1059
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,960
As of today, we've been married for almost seven years, and we are expecting our second

1060
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,760
child in April.

1061
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,000
Holy shit.

1062
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,680
Thank you for entertaining us through the years.

1063
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,280
We love you, Rachel and Joshua.

1064
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:01,840
That's big.

1065
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,520
That's another kind of unforgettable moment is that time we did the show in...

1066
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,240
That was Huntington.

1067
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:15,680
Okay, but I'm thinking about the show that we did in Wisconsin, where we had two and

1068
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,800
a half proposals.

1069
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,160
Yeah, right, right, right, yeah.

1070
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,360
Yeah, that was wild.

1071
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,440
I'd say maybe even the half proposal was probably the weirdest part.

1072
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,560
Yeah, that might be weird.

1073
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,280
Yeah, this has been a lot of fun, and it's been fun doing this.

1074
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,120
It's a shame we have to cancel the podcast.

1075
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,680
I wish we could keep doing it, but...

1076
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,440
I kept hoping that Jesse would call and say, I've changed my mind, but no, he's...

1077
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,800
Just to say he's proud of us, that also would be cool.

1078
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,920
Yeah, but our licenses run out.

1079
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,760
Our children are just screaming at us.

1080
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,920
They're just screaming and screaming.

1081
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,200
Thank you so much for listening.

1082
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,360
Thank you to you at home for everything you've done for us.

1083
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,160
We really can't thank you enough.

1084
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,720
The thing to me that I'm so thankful for you at home is everyone who has ever told

1085
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,600
someone else that they should check out the podcast, we owe you a debt of gratitude that

1086
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,640
can never be repaid.

1087
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,720
Yeah, it's the reason we're here.

1088
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,440
It's the reason we are here doing this still.

1089
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,520
I used to be able to say we've never paid for advertising, but one of you two dipshits

1090
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,080
did a Facebook campaign without talking to the other ones, and so now that's a lie.

1091
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,000
Now we've got Zuckerberg fucking beating down our necks, and we're part of the corporate

1092
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,320
machine.

1093
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,960
But before that, word of mouth was the only way that we got around.

1094
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,160
And it got around, we did.

1095
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,120
And that's all thanks to y'all.

1096
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:35,840
We're working on, it should be up soon in the merch store, a 500th episode challenge

1097
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,680
coin that's like, if you're part of that 500 club, you'll be able to show it with

1098
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,920
pride with the 500th coin.

1099
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,960
And as self-indulgent as this has been in, what, a month and a half, we're going to

1100
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,080
also be celebrating our 10-year anniversary, which is wild.

1101
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,600
And also I tried to run the numbers on how many episodes we've missed if we don't

1102
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,520
hit even 520.

1103
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,000
Not a lot.

1104
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,920
I guess not very many at all.

1105
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,600
Not enough, not enough.

1106
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,720
Yeah, we're going to take the next 30 episodes off.

1107
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,880
Do you have a final yahoo this time?

1108
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,840
Oh, I can pull one.

1109
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,280
Wow.

1110
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,040
Well, I just want to say, I also wanted to say thank you because it's weird.

1111
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,720
I feel like there's a gun to my head because there's children screaming like, be grateful

1112
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,280
faster.

1113
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,200
Well, let's do all the other stuff, right?

1114
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,840
Check out Maximumfun.org, our podcast home, John Roderick and the Longer Winters for

1115
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,000
the use of our theme song, Putting the Days of the-

1116
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,520
You never have to do this part, bud.

1117
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,400
It's a departure, is the name of the title of the track.

1118
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,480
Yeah, we're very grateful to be able to use that song.

1119
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,040
Also, just sort of final review.

1120
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,560
I never want to eat spaghetti before recording the podcast again.

1121
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,920
It did not make me funnier.

1122
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,000
It made my body sort of feel leaden and sagging.

1123
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,080
What you've learned is that the magic was in you all along.

1124
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,320
Yeah.

1125
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,880
You didn't need the magic spaghetti, or at least it was.

1126
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,840
I mean, was.

1127
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,040
He used up the magic.

1128
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,880
Or it's possible, yeah, 10 years ago, it's just my body wasn't just a big duffel bag

1129
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,920
full of socks like it is now.

1130
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,240
Also, a big thank you to all of our family, the ones who joined us on the episode today.

1131
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,920
Hello, I'm all of a family.

1132
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,520
I've been making this show happen for over 10 years.

1133
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,480
That's our producer.

1134
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,080
He's usually on my consider yourself my dad.

1135
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,560
You all have you all have changed our lives.

1136
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,760
This feels too like I don't know.

1137
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,880
It doesn't even cover it.

1138
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,160
Yeah, but it doesn't feel like it like created our the lives that we live now is because

1139
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,840
of the support you all have given us.

1140
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,280
And yeah, I don't know what my life would even look like without this show.

1141
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,120
And you boys, I love you both so much.

1142
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,320
I'm so glad I get to do this show with you guys every week.

1143
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,080
It is it is amazing.

1144
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,440
Now every week on this show, as you know, at this point, Griffin gives us a Yahoo!

1145
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,000
And we come back next week and talk about it.

1146
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,120
Talk about our thoughts.

1147
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,520
Yeah.

1148
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,800
Griffin, what do you got for us?

1149
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,320
Well, Chad sent this one and thanks, Chad.

1150
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:08,800
It's Yahoo!

1151
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,080

I think everybody who sends in Yahoo!'s.

1153
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,360
Yeah, everybody.

1154
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,520
It's a fucking minefield out there.

1155
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,240
It's a slog.

1156
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,960
Yeah, it's a psychic minefield and you all are.

1157
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,240
We have faced so many troubling concepts.

1158
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,200
Yeah, I can't imagine the other ones who didn't make it on the show.

1159
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,120
That's just the cream that rose to the top.

1160
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,520
But below that cream is a bunch of sewage.

1161
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,760
Anyway, just a lot of botulism.

1162
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,400
Right.

1163
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,760
OK, anyway, thank you, Chad.

1164
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,280
Tim asks.

1165
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,960
Is it bad to eat a burger for breakfast just once?

1166
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,520
My name is Justin Mackerel.

1167
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,480
I'm Travis McElroy.

1168
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1169
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,160
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1170
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,280
Kiss your dad.

1171
00:58:51,280 --> 00:59:18,560
Square on the lips.

1172
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:34,560
Bye.
