1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,400
I need help and I don't know where else to turn I've got a problem deep inside me and

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
I'm feeling quite concerned It's an issue and I feel I need some input

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,240
and insight Into if it's something serious or if I could

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,000
just might be overreacting Got the problem I'm having and it's really

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
no big deal and I should probably be laughing But I think I better talk to someone wiser

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,040
than I Get a second opinion just to be on the safe

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
side

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
You know what?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
An opinion's three and four Cause I know just who I need

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
I need the brothers McElroy Three sages from the past

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,560
Dispensing wisdom for the ages The greatest modern minds

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,240
Mending hearts like magic mages I could write pages

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,800
About all they've done to help me Like when I caught on fire

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,520
Or that time I lost my house keys I will never tire

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,440
Of the way this show delights me Advice for the modern era

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,920
It's my brother, my brother and me

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Just give me a big bottle of pee

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,920
The bed you supplied us with is quite loud And we're afraid that our noise-making will

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,920
be a ruckus So what bed might be quieter that you could

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
accommodate us with?

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,920
And also, where can I put my oversized duffel bag

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
With the words, you need your bags

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:24,920
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,920
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,920
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Then let the money run free Take a chance on me

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Finally, being the one to recognize that the true sound

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,920
Of my brother, my brother and me is rap

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,920
It's the sweet sound of the streets

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,920
We all agree that we are urban

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
We are nothing if not street

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Hip-hop

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
R&B

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Most of our episodes are about hip-hop and R&B

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,920
I draw most of the things we say from the recordings of Jay-Z and Missile War in Hell

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Is it sad that for the better part of my entire life

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
I thought R&B stood for Rap and Beats?

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
What?

40
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
When did you discover otherwise?

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
I thought it stood for Rap and Beats

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
This is My Brother, My Brother and Me

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,920
And it's an advice show for the modern era

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,920
We also will teach you that R&B does not stand for Rap and Beats

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
What does it stand for?

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,920
How well do you enjoy that Rap and Beats music?

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,920
She's the greatest Rap and Beat singer of all time

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Aaliyah is the new princess of hip-hop and Rap and Beats

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
God bless you

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Hello Brothers McElroy, this is Michael from California

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
And I am wondering, how do you learn better?

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
How do you learn to dress better?

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Sorry, got cut off a little bit

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
That's not your fault, Michael

55
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
I'm wondering, how do you learn to dress better?

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm tired of just wearing nerdy t-shirts all the time

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,920
And I have no idea how to start learning how to dress more mature

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Thank you

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Griffin's got a great answer, watch this

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
I do?

61
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Well, I was going to suggest that you need to watch a hit web series

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Oh, that's right

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
That's called Put This On, by close personal friend of the show

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Jesse Thorn and Adam Lissagore

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Well, they are sort of friends of the show

66
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,920
If you're here, thanks to our friends at Maximumfun.org

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
You have probably heard the name Jesse Thorn

68
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Put This On, there's not enough episodes for my taste

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
It's at PutThisOn.com

70
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,920
There's just two right now about jeans and shoes

71
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
That blog is chock full of tips

72
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
What do they say about jeans?

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,920
This is a discussion I've been having a lot lately

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Their conclusion is that jeans can qualify as fancy dress if worn properly

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,920
You should watch it, Travis, you'll get into it

76
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Because it's all about finding a good pair of jeans for you

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
And then how to maintain those jeans

78
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,920
I was talking to Teresa the other day

79
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,920
And I made her promise that when I reach the point

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,920
That I'm too old to wear jeans

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
That she is sworn to tell me

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
So she can just kill you

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Yeah, and then it's just sweet, sweet death

84
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's get back to Michael's question

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I think you need to expand beyond nerdy t-shirts

86
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Because those are inherently undressy

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Find yourself a nice polo shirt

88
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
A nice button up

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
It's not that hard to dress better

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Yeah, just start at the ground up

91
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I would also say that you should

92
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,920
That you could get a t-shirt that's not necessarily nerdy

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Maybe something more universal

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Something everyone can relate to

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Like, for instance, a My Brother, My Brother and Me t-shirt

96
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Available for one day only

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,920
This final day at MBMBAM.com

98
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
It may even be too late

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
It may be too late if you're listening to this on Tuesday

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
But still go look, we might work something out for you

101
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Or just plain t-shirts

102
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Plain t-shirts, that's a classy look

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Just a plain, tight fit

104
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
You know what I like? A nice corduroy jacket

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
You know what? A jacket is a good pro tip

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Because I could dress up anything

107
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,920
I wear a nice tan jacket at trade shows and things

108
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Because it classes up the look without having to buy a whole new wardrobe

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Corduroy is good too though

110
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Go to Target and look at their jackets

111
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,920
They have nice jackets for $20-$30

112
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,920
And you'll wear those things for months

113
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
100 years

114
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I finally found out, this is from Michael

115
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,920
I recently found out that my wife and I are expecting a baby

116
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Mazel tov

117
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Congrats

118
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
This will be our first

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
So we're a little nervous about what to expect

120
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Immediately things changed my mind about priorities

121
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm also a little listener to the Joystick Podcast

122
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
I love my gaming time

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,920
How can I balance my new child and keep the trophies rolling in?

124
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
First, that sounds dangerous

125
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,920
If you're trying to balance a baby

126
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,920
While at the same time trophies are rolling at you

127
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You may already be a bad parent

128
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Is the baby on your head?

129
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Is this where you're balancing him?

130
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Like a book?

131
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Like a hilarious silent film starring Buster Keaton

132
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
There's a baby balanced precariously on your head as trophies roll at you

133
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I think the most important thing about being a parent

134
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Is knowing where to turn for advice about parenting

135
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,920
It's definitely us

136
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
You've already cracked the case with the first biggest problem

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Which is where to turn for parenting advice

138
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I've seen 3 men and a baby

139
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I've seen 4 men and a baby

140
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,920
I've seen 2 and a half men

141
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,920
I've seen babies stay out

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I've seen...

143
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Dunstan checks in

144
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Dunstan checks in, which isn't exactly about parenting

145
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I've seen most viable primate

146
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
I've seen air bud

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,920
I've seen most vertical primate

148
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
We got off the subject right now

149
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I saw Milo and Otis

150
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Land Before Times Part 1, 2, 3, and 4

151
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Land of the Lost

152
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Listen

153
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Michael, the truth is

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
The truth is, I think

155
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Fire, rain

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
In order to be a good parent

157
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,920
You have to not do the things that you used to like doing

158
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I think that there's a

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
I think there's a ratio, an inverse

160
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Ratio between the sacrifices of your fun time

161
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,920
To the relative health of your child

162
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Let me give you a trophy

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
To reach for

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
An achievement to try to gain

165
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
And that is

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Didn't raise a serial killer

167
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,920
100 gamer score

168
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,920
100 gamer score for not raising someone who murders you in your sleep

169
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,920
The way it works is when you grow up

170
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
When you have a child

171
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
You've been doing cool shit your whole life

172
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Now it's your child's turn to do cool shit

173
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
And it's your time to do bummer shit

174
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
It's like the Highlander

175
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
There can be only one person who's

176
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Enjoying their life at one time

177
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
And guess what friend

178
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
It's not you anymore

179
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
I'm 30 years old

180
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
And have recently made a friend in World of Warcraft

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Who I've been playing with regularly

182
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Last week I found out he's a 15 year old boy

183
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
And when I told my girlfriend

184
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
She freaked out and said it was weird

185
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
And that I should stop playing with him

186
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
What do I do?

187
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
I can't tell you the number of times my wife has walked in on me

188
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
With a 15 year old boy

189
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
And she's like oh no I'll call the cops

190
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I'll leave you blah blah blah blah

191
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
It's like chill out lady

192
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
He's our neighbor

193
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
How am I gonna get better at recording pop music

194
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Well pop

195
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Pop influence by rapping beats

196
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Like Michael Jackson

197
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
If I can't play with 15 year old boys

198
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Someone's gotta teach this kid to shave

199
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
It's not gonna be his deadbeat dad

200
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
You gotta be in front of the mirror

201
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
With like whipped cream on his face and a spoon

202
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
It's easy it's just like this

203
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
It's real good slower

204
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Slower

205
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
So much slower

206
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Daniel

207
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
This is such a problem of the modern

208
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
The modern age

209
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Yeah it is

210
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
You know I imagine someone

211
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
20 years ago reading this question

212
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Would think it was written

213
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
In a different language

214
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
I think

215
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
When we talked about the question about

216
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Kissing your dad's square on the lips

217
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
If you don't think it's weird then it's not

218
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Weird

219
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
It is pretty fucking weird though

220
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
It's weird though

221
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I assume you guys are just like rating

222
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Whatever people do on that World of Warcraft

223
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Jam

224
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
There's nothing you can do

225
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
In World of Warcraft with a 15 year old boy that doesn't make you sound like

226
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
A gay pedophile

227
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
We were just rating

228
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
We were just pounding the dragon

229
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
On our sewing

230
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
We were just teaching him some leather work

231
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
We were grinding

232
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
We were just grinding

233
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
I was grinding with a 15 year old and my wife

234
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Flipped

235
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
This is

236
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
This is something where

237
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Just pretend you don't know it

238
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Are you sure it's not Chris Hanson on the other end

239
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Saying he's a 15 year old boy

240
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
That's the future of To Catch a Predator

241
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Why are you hanging with him?

242
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Maybe find someone your own age

243
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Also playing World of Warcraft

244
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Or switch to Second Life

245
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Because that place is just

246
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Just ripe for the harvest

247
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Of just sweet

248
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Sweet succulent teenage fruit

249
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Just hanging

250
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Hanging low on the tree

251
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
You know there's Marshall in Second Life now

252
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Yeah I saw that

253
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Marshall University, my alma mater

254
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
And Justin's alma mater

255
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Now has a virtual college

256
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
In Second Life

257
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Am I allowed to

258
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
I haven't discussed this with my wife

259
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Am I allowed to go to virtual Marshall

260
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
And do the things that I did at real Marshall

261
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Without fear of repercussions?

262
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Is that how that works?

263
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Well give me an example of some of these things

264
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Like

265
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
If I go to Second Life

266
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Can I set a

267
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Dumpster on fire and then blame it

268
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
On a pizza guy that walked by earlier

269
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Is that okay?

270
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
I mean it depends if the programmers

271
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Have enabled that

272
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Option for you to do in the game

273
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
How's your tech?

274
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
How is the tech on this if I can't burn

275
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
A dumpster?

276
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I don't know

277
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
I would love to see if I could get kicked out of

278
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Second Life Marshall though

279
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I would love to see what it takes to do

280
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
When you do you have to walk out screaming

281
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
That's it I'm starting Third Life

282
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
On one hand

283
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
You have it as a recruitment tool

284
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
That's what they built it for

285
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
So that they can take students on a virtual tour

286
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
So I'd love to show up as a prospective

287
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
You know student

288
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
And walk around that group

289
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
And cause all kinds of shenanigans

290
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I'd just like to sit on the quad

291
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
And play my guitar that's it

292
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Just don't bother me

293
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Just run into the middle of a group? You guys trying to sack?

294
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
You guys want to sack?

295
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
We're going to sack over at the student center in 15

296
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Meet by the John and my 15 year old friend

297
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
We're just sacking together

298
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
We're going to do some disc

299
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
You guys like Dave Matthews?

300
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
It's a crazy game of poker

301
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Today right?

302
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Allen writes from Gmail

303
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm starting my senior year of high school

304
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
And my parents are becoming increasingly pushy

305
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
About telling me I need to decide where I want to go

306
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
To college

307
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Have you considered Marshall?

308
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Have you considered virtual Marshall?

309
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Have you considered VMU?

310
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I'm at the top of my class and should have no problem

311
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Getting a scholarship the problem is

312
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
I have no idea what I want to do

313
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I'm equally good in all subjects at school

314
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
But I don't like any of them enough to devote

315
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
48 years of my life to studying them

316
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Furthermore I cannot think of any real job

317
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
I would enjoy

318
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
How can I find out what to do with my life?

319
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Oh Allen

320
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Allen Allen Allen

321
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
That's a great question

322
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
I mean you're asking

323
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Maybe the only person who

324
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Really can provide

325
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Well I guess Travis and Griffin are both better at this than I am

326
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,920
I went to school on an acting and directing degree

327
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
And I

328
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
And I

329
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Now I write about video games so

330
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
I don't know

331
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
I think I heard someone say that if

332
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
That if

333
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
College only teaches you

334
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
What you want to do with your life then it's

335
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
A good investment but I don't know

336
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
What do you guys think?

337
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
I think that there's two kinds of people

338
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
There are people that have known what they've wanted to do since they were 8 years old

339
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
There's people that are going to figure out

340
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
What they're going to do when they're 22 and like

341
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Are handed a diploma

342
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
And you know both of those people

343
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
End up knowing what they're going to do

344
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
And there are people like Allen

345
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Griffin

346
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
You were saying?

347
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
There are people like Allen who will never find out what they want to do

348
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
And will die purpose

349
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
You know I'm glad you were

350
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Trying to cut Travis off to tell

351
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Allen that he was going to die without

352
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Purpose

353
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Not completely without purpose

354
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
But a great use of the

355
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Without a fulfilling purpose

356
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Do you think he'll be on his deathbed and he'll look back and say

357
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
I wasted it

358
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
I wasted it all

359
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
You were right Griffin

360
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Excuse me Travis can I cut in on what you're saying

361
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
To remind one of our precious listeners

362
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
That his life is a shell

363
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Allen listen

364
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
I hate to add to your burden but this is

365
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
The most important decision you'll ever make

366
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
So you need to spend the last

367
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Few few months

368
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
You have left in high school

369
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Doing as much shit as you

370
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Possibly can

371
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Extracurriculars

372
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Join the

373
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Theater community

374
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
And choreograph their upcoming

375
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Production of Oklahoma

376
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Go join your

377
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
School newspaper

378
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Play some football do some sports

379
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Commentating

380
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Anything you can to try and find

381
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Your calling because it's out there

382
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
You just gotta stumble upon it

383
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
I would suggest Allen this is such a hard decision

384
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Because it's a weird system we have where we

385
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Ask people to choose what they

386
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Want to do with their lives before they have a chance

387
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
To actually do anything

388
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
If I might be so bold

389
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Why don't you try talking to some people

390
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Pick some careers you might be interested in

391
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
And talk to some people who are currently

392
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
In those careers and see how they

393
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Like it because that's a

394
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Pretty good barometer of whether or not

395
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
If it's making them happy then

396
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I actually made my decision to go into

397
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Journalism because I did

398
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
It a bit in high school and I enjoyed it but I was a

399
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Theater major in high school but I watched

400
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Justin in

401
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
College go from

402
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Having this theater degree that he didn't

403
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
You know want to use in his

404
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Professional life and making a

405
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Last minute change to journalism

406
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
And I was like man I don't want any of that

407
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I don't want to do that

408
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I don't want that life that's for certain

409
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Sir that is great I am so

410
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Glad that my life could serve as a negative

411
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Example for how not to live your life

412
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
No not a negative example

413
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
That trailblazing guidance for you you piece

414
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Of shit

415
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Forum spring asks is it considered

416
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Cheating if I make out with a gay man

417
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
Assuming that you're a

418
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Man okay wait there's so many people

419
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
You gotta give us enough

420
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Context to answer these questions

421
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Are you dating the gay man

422
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
No then it's not cheating

423
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Are you dating a girl

424
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
I think it is a she there a girl

425
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Who is dating a guy is it

426
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Cheating if she makes out with a

427
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Gay man god that's such an answer

428
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Is the answer is yes

429
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Of course of course it is

430
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
You know do you know how you know what's

431
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
A sin would you do it in front of jesus

432
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Not kind of masturbation which

433
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Is a problem because I would

434
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Totally do that from jesus

435
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
So if you're okay so if you're a girl

436
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
This is the whole thing this is how

437
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
You determine cheating right would you

438
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Do it in front of them if you

439
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Wouldn't do it in front of them then it's cheating

440
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
If you would do it in front of them

441
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Then they're cool with it and you're fine it's one of those

442
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
How would you feel like if you

443
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Have to ask then

444
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
It is yeah

445
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
How about it's not cheating if you make out with

446
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
That gay man if I go over here and make

447
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Out with this lesbian that cool yeah

448
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
We cool nice

449
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,920
This is a real healthy relationship we got going

450
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
On here with Portia de Rossi is

451
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Are you are you cool are you cool

452
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
For you because it's

453
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Fact it is stone cold

454
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Fact that every girl

455
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Freshman year of college is

456
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Going to make out with a gay man that's that's 100

457
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Percent I think it was actually part of

458
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
The marshall plan you couldn't graduate from

459
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
From three of the

460
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Twelve schools at marshall unless

461
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
You had made out with a gay man it was

462
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
A prerequisite and that same

463
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Gay man will flamboyantly

464
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Squeeze one or more of her breasts

465
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
If they honk it was

466
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Just one gay man

467
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
It was marshall's marshall's gay

468
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Man and everyone had to make out with him

469
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
In order to graduate college his name actually

470
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Funny enough marshall gayman

471
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Is it cheating is really easy

472
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
To answer because it's all about

473
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Your partner's perception if they think

474
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
It's cheating

475
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
It's cheating if you can't

476
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Ask them like is it cool that I made out

477
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
With a gay are you asking me if you should feel guilty

478
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I don't know guilt fades are

479
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
You going to do anything about you're not going to start a relationship

480
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
With this guy so

481
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I don't think you should tell the person

482
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Like especially if it's going to create

483
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Well let me I mean if you can let

484
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
It slide then don't

485
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Tell them because it's just going to hurt their feelings especially

486
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Because that's not

487
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
A sexual preference like girls who

488
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Are into gay dudes it's not like

489
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
It's not maybe it is I don't know

490
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Maybe it is well let me ask you this turn

491
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Around it's probably a katherine heigl movie about it

492
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Is a straight girl asking this question

493
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
If she makes out with another straight girl

494
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Is that cheating

495
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
There are so

496
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Many layers to that question no it's

497
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
It's irrelevant it has everything

498
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
To do it has nothing to do with what

499
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
The

500
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Planets leading advice podcast says

501
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
And more about

502
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
What it has everything

503
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
To do with what your dude thinks

504
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
So if he's cool

505
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
If he's like this doesn't bother me at all

506
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
It's not cheating if he's not

507
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Cool it's fully fully

508
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
And also be prepared for him to say he's

509
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Cool but he's probably not just don't do it

510
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
How about you just don't make out with gay dudes

511
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Anymore you already did it

512
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Didn't you but using that metric like

513
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Any any like

514
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Your boyfriend could think that splitting a pizza

515
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
With another dude is cheating like

516
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
There has to be

517
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
But if you

518
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Presumably if you're asking what is

519
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Cheating you're doing it because you're

520
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Worried that your partner will

521
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Dump you

522
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
If if they

523
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Think you've been cheating so

524
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
It has everything to do with what they

525
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Consider cheating and I mean

526
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Like if they're the sort of person if

527
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
They do consider splitting a pizza with a dude cheating

528
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
You need to break up with him

529
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
You need to break up with him be are you sure

530
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
That's not the name of some kind of crazy new sex thing

531
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Kids today

532
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
With him

533
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
With him gross and I kissed

534
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
You I just kissed you I'm gonna go

535
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Vomit and then cut my tongue off

536
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
I think just as a

537
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Good ground rule don't make out with anybody

538
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
That's not your significant other

539
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
Just to be on the safe side

540
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Probably don't make out with anybody else

541
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Unless they're famous

542
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Unless they're famous and that's always

543
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Just for the story

544
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920

00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
On 9-11 some flights are a bit cheaper

551
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I am wondering why

552
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Jake Sully

553
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Was not as you might imagine

554
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Booking a flight to Pandora

555
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
He would do that on 9-11

556
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
If that was the only day it was available

557
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Is that international travel flying to Pandora

558
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
On 9-11

559
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Is that the guy from I still haven't seen

560
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Pandora is that yeah Pandora

561
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
By James Cameroon what

562
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
No it's called Avatar

563
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Oh right again

564
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Was that a

565
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Was that the 3D one

566
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
It's the one from

567
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
And he goes to the core of the earth

568
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
And then he finds smurfs

569
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
And they're giant giant smurfs man eating

570
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Smurfs and he and

571
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Native Americans

572
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Fight to defend the core of the earth

573
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Justin how did you get into my dream last night

574
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Now that's a movie James Cameroon

575
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Either that or T4

576
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
That's what I want from you

577
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Or is it T5 I guess

578
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Jake Sully listen

579
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Jake Sully

580
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Lightning don't strike twice in the same place

581
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
I think I would

582
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
I would only fly on 9-11

583
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
That is the safest day to fly

584
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
That is the safest day to fly

585
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Everyone knows that if there's one thing

586
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Terrorists are afraid of it's cliches

587
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
9-11 been there done that

588
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I was in the 9-11

589
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Yeah I was in the 9-11 before it was cool

590
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
9-11 was so 2001

591
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Ever since

592
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Ever since they used 9-11

593
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
In that episode of the OC it was like

594
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Everybody was in the 9-11

595
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I was like well kinda over it

596
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
9-12 I think

597
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Is what you need to be worried about

598
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
9-12 is the day man

599
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Or 9-10 where everybody is just getting psyched

600
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
For 9-11 and then it's like what happened?

601
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Doing some pre-gaming

602
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Actually what you need to be afraid of

603
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
3-12

604
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Just trust me I've got a bad feeling

605
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Really?

606
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
3-12

607
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
I have a question I hope you can help me with

608
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
In 2012 you mean

609
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
My wife and I have two kids

610
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
A two year old girl and a five year old boy

611
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Ever since my son could speak

612
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
I've been discriminating about one thing

613
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
What's called his private area

614
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
My wife, I would just call it his bedroom

615
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
But my wife being a traditionalist

616
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Refers to it as his penis

617
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
I being a little more hip call it his junk

618
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Now when he refers to it

619
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
As his junk

620
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
My wife cringes and gives me dirty looks

621
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
What do you guys think?

622
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Where do you stay on the matter?

623
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I think you need to think about what's creepier

624
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
That or a little three year old kid saying

625
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Excuse me papa my penis

626
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Eww

627
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
What happened to wiener?

628
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Why can't kids call it their worm?

629
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
You know what, yeah there it is

630
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Wormy was my option until

631
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
The sophomore year of high school

632
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
The sophomore year of high school

633
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Which got awkward

634
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Once the intimate times started up

635
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Like at a high school dancing

636
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Can you feel

637
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
My wormy poking through these

638
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
These Jess pants

639
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Here comes the wormy

640
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
These fashionable slacks

641
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
The early bird gets this wormy

642
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
What do you girls think is going to be the early bird?

643
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
I think you should teach your son

644
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
To be ashamed of his sexuality

645
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
And not refer to it at all

646
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Yeah, just every time he brings it up

647
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Hose him down

648
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Have you considered my shame?

649
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
My shame, my evil, my pants evil

650
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Now what is

651
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
What's going on in your five year old's life

652
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
That this is a

653
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Recurring problem for you

654
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Yo pops, what do I call this thing?

655
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
What's the deal with the dangle?

656
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Can you talk about my junk?

657
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Jimmy kindergarten says

658
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
To call it my cock and balls

659
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Teach gets mad when I call it that

660
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
What do I calls it?

661
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Well Ali G

662
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
I don't know how you got in place

663
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
With my son, can I suggest

664
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Maybe you let him name it

665
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
I just came up with a bad name for it

666
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
His wiener machine

667
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
His wiener machine

668
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
What about something nice and

669
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Non specific like coach

670
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Coach is good cause he like

671
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
He tells you what to do

672
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
And plus he's got a whistle

673
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
He's got a whistle

674
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Do you guys not have that?

675
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Don't gatorade on him

676
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Call yours coach and call his assistant coach

677
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
And then one is your special teams coach

678
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Special teams coach, that's your b-hole

679
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I think the real problem you're faced with is

680
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Your two year old girl will eventually need to have

681
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
The same conversation

682
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
And my advice to you is

683
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,920
You need to get out of it

684
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
There's gonna be a house word for this

685
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
And you've gotta be careful because someday

686
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
Your little girl is gonna be married

687
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
And she's gonna be

688
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
You see the problem here

689
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
This has gotta be a nice non specific word

690
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,920
You know what I mean

691
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Like vagina flower

692
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Don't call the penis the vagina

693
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
That is not gonna teach him anything

694
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
How about

695
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
How about this

696
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,920
How about

697
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
What about penis

698
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I think your wife is right

699
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
I think if everybody's calling it a penis

700
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
You're gonna take the power away from that word

701
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
And plus you set up that really great moment

702
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
In sex ed in high school

703
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Where she just slowly raises her hand

704
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
She's like um

705
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
I'm very confused

706
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
What about pistol

707
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
And tell your girls hers is called a stamen

708
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
It'll just really mess them up

709
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
I have

710
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
That one was from Scott by the way

711
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
We didn't say his name

712
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
We don't want you to get confused

713
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
That was from you

714
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
If somebody else had written it

715
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
We might have given them a different answer

716
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
What's our final decision on this

717
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Coach and pistol

718
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Or coach pistols

719
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
I have conflicting views about pornography

720
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Says an anonymous writer from gmail

721
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I love it

722
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
But I realize in most of its forms

723
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
It's degrading to women okay

724
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Also my girlfriend commanded I quit watching it

725
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
And I hate to have to lie to her

726
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
Because I still watch it anyway

727
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Quit watching it

728
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Should I try to resist these animal impulses

729
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
And live a life of celibacy

730
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Only jerking off to my imagination

731
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Or am I blowing this out of proportion

732
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Should I try to find feminist porn

733
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Does it exist

734
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Um

735
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm sure it exists

736
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Are you listening to it right now dude

737
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Turn it off and let's just talk

738
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
For one second

739
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
No off don't just mute it off

740
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Thank you

741
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
If there is foot crush porn

742
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
There is probably feminist porn

743
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I don't think that's up for debate

744
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Um

745
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
I think you could probably google it

746
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Though I

747
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Be careful

748
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Um cause you could end up with

749
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Femma piss porn that's not good

750
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Or Femma mist porn and that's

751
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Really weird

752
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
And listen buddy we understand where you're coming from

753
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
And we know you better than this

754
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
But the next time you have this conversation with someone

755
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Leave out the phrase animal impulses

756
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
It sends

757
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
A bad message that I don't think

758
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
You wanna put out there

759
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Listen anonymous here

760
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Is hungry like the wolf

761
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
For sweet internet

762
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
He's on the lookout

763
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
I think he just wrote us to get recommendations

764
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
On sites

765
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
What are the hot sites you guys are into

766
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
These days for feminist porn

767
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
First off thank your girlfriend

768
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
For

769
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Porn can so quickly

770
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Turn kind of stale

771
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
So thank your girlfriend for making it dirty

772
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
And elicit and sexier than ever

773
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
By foreboding

774
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
You from looking at it yes

775
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
The danger

776
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
The trick is something he brought up

777
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Which is his imagination

778
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Let me tell you something

779
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,920
The scenarios

780
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
You can invent up in your noodle

781
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Up there way better

782
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Than anything on the net

783
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Well hello Ms. Ellen DeGeneres

784
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Except

785
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,920
This is me

786
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
But

787
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,920
To answer your question really

788
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,920
Don't be a sicko

789
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Shit's unhealthy

790
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
There is nothing sick about watching porn

791
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Throwing it out there

792
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Yeah it's not good you should never watch porn

793
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
You guys

794
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
I'm trying to make it dirtier

795
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I'm trying to make it dirtier for him

796
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
My brother and me and my girlfriend

797
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Listen here naughty boy

798
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
It's so bad

799
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Oh god it's gross

800
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Take off those dungarees and let's get you punished

801
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
No

802
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Get that one out

803
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Oh no

804
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Benjamin

805
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Benjamin writes to us from gmail

806
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Um

807
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Good luck

808
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Can you put this in here

809
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
That may have been me

810
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Okay

811
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
This one's for you

812
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
I love your show

813
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
I'll be 13 on August 20th

814
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Griffin is my favorite person on MB&B AM

815
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
But I love Justin and Travis

816
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
I would really like it if you just randomly said

817
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Pick chicken rules

818
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Pick chicken rules

819
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Thanks oh yeah

820
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
I also follow you guys on Facebook and Twitter

821
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,920
And I'm dry as a popcorn

822
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Okay

823
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
I imagine that says

824
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Popcorn fart

825
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
But I can't be certain

826
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
It's hard to say

827
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
His 12 year old hotmail account

828
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Automatically censors that word

829
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Benjamin

830
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Pick chicken rules and thank you for listening

831
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,920
Pick chicken doesn't fart

832
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Yahoo answers user

833
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Duke power hand

834
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,920
What

835
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,920
My whole day is about that name now

836
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
What is it again

837
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Duke power hand

838
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Duke power hand

839
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
That sounds like the greatest peripheral ever

840
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
He asks

841
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Obama implements a

842
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
White only tax?

843
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Uh

844
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
He explains tanning beds

845
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Doesn't this tax fall disproportionately

846
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
On Caucasians?

847
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Yeah so does the mayonnaise tax

848
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
I don't think they flip it out

849
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
This Kenny G tax

850
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Is killing me

851
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
This is killing me

852
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I gotta tell you guys I was on Yahoo today

853
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
And it was a hotbed

854
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Of political and religious discussion

855
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Was it?

856
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
I can't like

857
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Just people going back and forth like

858
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
God doesn't exist God totally exists

859
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Obama

860
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Is a Muslim

861
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
And he's taxing whites

862
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Actually it's such

863
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
It's you know

864
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
People helping people

865
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
That's the point of this website

866
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Today it was just

867
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
I don't know it really brought me down

868
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
People waging war on each other

869
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,920
I can't say it enough

870
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
When you want to have an important

871
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Political and religious discussion

872
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Yahoo answers

873
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Is the place to go

874
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
Is the place to be

875
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Yeah it's a hotbed of learning

876
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Philosophical growing

877
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I graduated last year

878
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
And I've been working for the past 10 months

879
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
And saving most of the money

880
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,920
This is from Jen's via Gmail

881
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm 20 years old and I've been planning to go traveling later this year

882
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Mostly in Asia

883
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
My problem is that my friend I was going with

884
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Bailed and is going to start studying again

885
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
That's what most people might soon be doing

886
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
After getting anxiety for not doing shit and just staying at home

887
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Note to yourself Allen

888
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
This is you in 5 years get your shit together

889
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
So what do I do?

890
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Because all my other friends are either studying or just out of cash

891
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
It's basically impossible to get one of them to come

892
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
So I either go alone which is kind of scary

893
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
And not as fun or I find some random person

894
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
On the internet to join me which seems weird

895
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
And you might get sick of him or her

896
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Pretty fast yeah it is weird

897
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
You know what's scarier?

898
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
A random person on the internet traveling with you

899
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Yeah I've never seen Hostel

900
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
But this sounds like how that

901
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Movie plays out

902
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Imagine that moment you wake up in the train

903
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Car and they're just staring

904
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
At you

905
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
With your own eyes that they've pried out of your head

906
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
You sleep so nicely

907
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
I just love it

908
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Gents don't travel

909
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
What? No

910
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Just don't travel

911
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Think of all the things you could spend

912
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,920
That money on that you've saved up over the past 10 months

913
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
That you could keep for longer than

914
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
The duration of your travel

915
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,920
No Griffin you know what never goes away?

916
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Memories

917
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm not taking off Ginkgo

918
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
You can easily lose that shit

919
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
And then it's like oh man I totally should have

920
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
Spent that 2000 dollars

921
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
On a scooter

922
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
And then you die

923
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
I just need a lifetime of buying Ginkgo

924
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
And then pump it directly

925
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Into my brain

926
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
So there you have it gents

927
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
I guess

928
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
My advice is travel by yourself

929
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
It seems scary

930
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
But think of it like a vision quest

931
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
You know what I mean you'll get more out of it

932
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
And you'll feel more

933
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Self assured and independent or

934
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
You'll get knifed in an alley

935
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
In Hong Kong

936
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,920
At which point you learn something else about yourself

937
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
And that is that you are vulnerable

938
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,920
You could go on a real vision quest

939
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Just

940
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Go into the desert with some peyote

941
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
And then

942
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
It'll feel like you're traveling in Asia

943
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Because the sky around you will turn into

944
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Artwork from Asia albums

945
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Um

946
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Um

947
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
You

948
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Yeah it's hard

949
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I would say maybe

950
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
If you got this money socked away right

951
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Just um

952
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Just keep it socked away like you can

953
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Always just keep adding to it

954
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
And soon you'll meet someone who

955
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Would be down to go with you

956
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
I don't think going by yourself is a great idea

957
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
First off you're going to need someone to talk

958
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
To or you're going to go crazy with jungle madness

959
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Second you

960
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Want someone to be able to take pictures of you

961
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
And or because without pictures

962
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
It didn't happen

963
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Gosh this next email we're running along

964
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
But this next email is so good

965
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Okay let me just read real quick

966
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I'm 16 from Vancouver Canada and my

967
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Grandmother moved in with my family a few months ago

968
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Recently she's been trying to connect

969
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
With me which in her mind

970
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Means going out to buy gangsta clothes

971
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Baggy pants and lots of Ed Hardy

972
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Bling and lots of rap

973
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,920
Music now she follows me around

974
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Asking what's up J-Dog

975
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
And blasting 50 cent

976
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
From our home speaker system

977
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
At first it was easy to

978
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Ignore but now she's talking like

979
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
This G-Ma thing as she calls

980
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
It outside and even approaches

981
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,920
My home dogs

982
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
When we're at the mall and stuff

983
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
What's even weirder about this whole situation

984
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Is that I'm more of an alternative guy

985
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,920
Or even hipster myself

986
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
So I have no idea

987
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Where she got this scheme from

988
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
It's terrifying

989
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Help me I'm so confused

990
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
As to what to do

991
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Should I mock her or something

992
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
James from Gmail oh christ James

993
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
I have to ask

994
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
James would it be better if your Grandma was a huge hipster

995
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Like

996
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Dressed up in like one of those

997
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
One piece tunics and it's like hey did you hear that new

998
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Animal Collective album?

999
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
That sucks nothing's good anymore

1000
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Well I think James' bigger problem is

1001
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
He's trapped in the Tyler Perry movie

1002
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,920
What

1003
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,920
Tyler Perry movie is that Travis can you come up with the name real quick?

1004
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
What's your favorite one?

1005
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Madea but I haven't seen any

1006
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
I've never seen a Tyler Perry movie

1007
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
You choked

1008
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
There's Madea Goes to Jail or Madea's Family Reunion

1009
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
I think you just love

1010
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
I just think you just love

1011
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,920
You need to love your G-Ma

1012
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Love her as much as you can I think that's fresh

1013
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,920
That she's putting in the effort

1014
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
I think you should encourage her to just be

1015
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Yourself

1016
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Unless she's a racist and a lot of people

1017
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
I hope people are

1018
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
So

1019
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,920
It's a tough call to make

1020
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,920
I say you cherish it because I think that's badass

1021
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,920
I think you cherish it because I think it's awesome

1022
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
I think you need to have interviews pictures taken

1023
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
With her she can be big on the net

1024
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
On the web maybe you need to turn her into

1025
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
An internet celebrity I think that's your first

1026
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
How about this my podcast

1027
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
G-Ma on me

1028
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Oh my Jesus

1029
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
I'll put her on I'll take Griffin

1030
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Off put her on

1031
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
I want to hear Griffin's last question

1032
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
But first

1033
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
I want to

1034
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Well

1035
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
I want to read you an email first and then we'll get to the other stuff

1036
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
We got this email from our buddy Tristan

1037
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,920
The Marine

1038
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,920
And it's a little long

1039
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
But Tristan's a real close friend of the show so I

1040
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,920
Want to read it he says

1041
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Hey brothers McElroy

1042
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
And hello to all you amazing good looking

1043
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Listeners Tristan The Marine here

1044
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
I'm writing this email with a heavy heart and a frown on my face

1045
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Because it pains me to say the following the next

1046
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,920
MB&B AM will be the last episode of

1047
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
McElroy goodness I will get to listen to for three long

1048
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Months see I'm leaving for boot camp at

1049
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Recruit Training Depot Paris Island

1050
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
August 8th other than occasional

1051
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Letters I will have no contact with the outside world

1052
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
For 13 weeks I wanted to

1053
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Write to tell the three of you and again

1054
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Those of you listening

1055
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
That what an encouragement you've been to me

1056
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
And how much joy you brought in my life

1057
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
In the time since MB&B AM launched

1058
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
I've had a wild ride getting ready to go to boot camp

1059
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
While I will never doubt my commitment to serving my

1060
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Country and protecting our precious freedoms

1061
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
There have been times when the light at the end of the tunnel was very very dim

1062
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Over the last

1063
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
I'm going to skip ahead a little bit

1064
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Over the last few months MB&B AM has reminded

1065
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Me what I'm joining for I'm joining for the people

1066
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Of this nation like Justin Griffin and Travis and all the

1067
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Listeners who care more about quality of life

1068
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
For other people than themselves

1069
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
The people who are always willing to tell you straight up that you need

1070
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
To pack your shit and get the hell out of your situation

1071
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Because it is the only way

1072
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
I'm proud to serve my country and even more proud

1073
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
To know that I'm serving for amazing people like you

1074
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Again thank you from the bottom of my heart

1075
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Now seriously pack up your bags

1076
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
No one wants you around with all the pride and

1077
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Gratitude Tristan the Marine

1078
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
And he gives a special

1079
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Shout out to Bob Ball

1080
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
For the encouragement and all the listeners for

1081
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Encouraging him and he says

1082
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,920
So

1083
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Tristan

1084
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Much much much love

1085
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Safety continued safety

1086
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
And I hope

1087
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
That once you get a taste of

1088
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Killing you're still able to find

1089
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Humor in situations like our podcast

1090
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
And you don't turn into a murder automaton

1091
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Though that is a distinct possibility

1092
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
So thanks

1093
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
So thanks but

1094
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
Always make sure you murder for America

1095
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
Not against America

1096
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
That is so key

1097
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
So important you cannot

1098
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,920
Enforce that enough so we love you Tristan come back soon

1099
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Good luck Tristan

1100
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Get me an ear

1101
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
I don't know a lot about the military

1102
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,920
I think boot camp is pretty sick

1103
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I still want him to bring me an ear

1104
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Bring me a necklace

1105
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Of ears

1106
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Tristan I want a necklace of ears

1107
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Carved from your enemies

1108
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
I don't care who they come from

1109
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Yeah

1110
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
I do

1111
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I want you to be the people who

1112
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Say ill words about our show

1113
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Make sure you play it for them

1114
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
On a boombox held over your head outside

1115
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
So I want to hear Griffin's last question

1116
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
A couple quick notes

1117
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,920
Today is the last day

1118
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
You can pre-order a t-shirt

1119
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,920
For my brother my brother and me

1120
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
After that after today

1121
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
You may be able to order them

1122
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
We have no idea of how many are going to get

1123
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Made

1124
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Other than our pre-orders

1125
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,920
If you want to guarantee yourself one in the size and style

1126
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
That you would prefer

1127
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
You need to go over to my brother

1128
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920

1131
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,920

00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Don't contemplate don't debate

1133

Just do it

1134
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
Don't masturbate well just not to

1135
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,920

1136
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920

1138
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
If you want it it's two bucks if you don't want it

1140
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
From there you can ask questions from there

1141
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
We have a little bit of bonus content

1142
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Maybe we should put that rap

1143
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
That rap tune on there

1144
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
That rap tune

1145
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920

1146
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920

1154
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
Fun for that really awesome review

1155
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Thanks to everybody who bought

1156
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,920
T-shirts and the app

1157
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
It's really nice

1158
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,920
We'll promise to spend the

1159
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,920
Money on microphones and stuff

1160
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Just a little bit of blow

1161
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,920
Just a

1162
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Not an excessive

1163
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
Amount of blow but just

1164
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
I just want a pile of it on my desk

1165
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
I don't think anything

1166
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
Is going to make the show

1167
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Better

1168
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
More better than a quick pregame

1169
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Bump before each episode

1170
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
Maybe just a bumpette

1171
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
Just a little bump

1172
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Just a little

1173
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Snoot

1174
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,920
Griffin

1175
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
What is our last question?

1176
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
I'll be honest I've got like three

1177
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm just going to have to

1178
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
Think about this Griffin

1179
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,920
This is Tristan's last episode of My Brother My Brother Me

1180
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,920
For months

1181
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
You've got to

1182
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:38,920
Nail it

1183
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm Justin McElroy

1184
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,920
Travis McElroy

1185
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,920
I'm Griffin McElroy

1186
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
This has been

1187
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
My Brother My Brother Me

1188
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
You will never know me

1189
00:43:50,920 --> 00:44:08,920
Because your dad's square on the lips

1190
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Music
