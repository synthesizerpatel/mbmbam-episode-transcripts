1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,040
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:58,640
era. Cyber Monday is here, and I'm Justin Cyber McElroy. And I'm Travis, Mr. Roboto McElroy.

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,520
ASL, it's Griffin McElroy, your youngest baby brother. I put on my wizard hat,

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,520
and prepare my body for you. This is the value day, folks. If you head over to

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,120
the number one shopping site in the world, BezosPlace.com, if you go to BezosPlace,

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,680
you can get a bunch of great deals on all the latest and greatest in tech toys,

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,680
gadgets and gizmos, plenty. Finally fucking put Toys R Us out of business this year,

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,760
so we're all kind of on a high from that. And who will be next in 2019?

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, let's see who you want to see Bezos eat next.

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,520
I'd say Brookstone's had it fucking coming for a while, huh? You got your expensive, like,

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,720
you know, $240 Wi-Fi enabled nutcracker. Bezos comes around. Now, Brookstone's in me. I am

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,320
Brookstone. I don't know that Skywall still exists. I mean, Bezos might have already eaten that one.

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,640
He got that one. He got that one already? Fuck. He travels a lot. He's on planes a lot. He sees it.

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,840
He gets hungry. Bezos is going to eat the air mall. You know what I would like to see? I think

19
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,880
that he has conquered it to the point where I think Bezos needs to walk away from Amazon,

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,120
leave all his money behind and start again and see how long it takes him to catch back up to Amazon.

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
Yeah, if you think you're such hot shit. Yeah.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,600
Yeah. So what you did at once, anybody can make a multi-billion dollar company once.

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,880
Do it again if you're such hot shit. And now you know what you're doing enough

24
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,920
that I feel like you could catch back up in like five years.

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Yeah, why don't you just sort of send everyone, you know, $2.4 million, which as far as I know,

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,200
you can do. And then let's see what else you innovate there, you lucky dipshit.

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
Got him.

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,880
I could do another one right. I could do one right now. A sequel to Amazon. Here's,

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,320
do you want to hear it? Please.

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,840
Yeah. This is the new one. This is the new one. Okay.

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,760
You know how they have, if you get prime with them, you get two day, free two day shipping.

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm going to go for free one day shipping. Okay.

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,880
How about that? Like, how about that? Now I'm bigger than Amazon.

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah. It wasn't hard.

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
Can I pitch one? Can I pitch one? Can I pitch one?

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,160
Yeah.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,160
With every $30 purchase or more, one free back rub.

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,040
From Beesbos?

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,160
No, here's the thing. From whoever you want.

40
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,480
Oh, wow. And this is now a legal law of the land?

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,360
Can I do this to, you know, Tony Romo? Can I just say Tony Romo? Come rub these shoulders. Okay.

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Now you will have to schedule. I mean, like, if you're like Oscar Isaacs,

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
like I need, I need that back rub. Like you're going to have to schedule it.

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
You know what I mean? Like he's probably pre booked up at this point.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,320
You know, it's a good thing that I don't run Amazon. This is why I can't be a big rich hot

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,480
shot like Jeff Beesbo. This is why. Okay.

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,960
It's because I would wait until Cyber Monday and then I would just put an animated video of myself

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,360
and with Flash on the front page of website and just say, it's all books again.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
Now it's just books again.

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,560
Buy it or don't. I don't care. I'm incredibly wealthy, but this one is just books.

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:22,960
Damn.

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
I'm doing this for books.

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,000
I should have never gotten away from books. It's all books again.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,920
I love petulant Cyber Beesbos saying, oh, we'll pay our workers a fair living wage.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:41,360
In exchange, it's all books again. Not going to get your Black Friday Cyber Monday deals on those

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
house slippers unless you're going to shove your paws into two big books.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,760
I hope you enjoy your dash button for kitty litter. Press it all fucking day.

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,200
The only thing I'm going to bring you is a book about cat ownership.

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,920
Maybe that's why it's time for Beesbo to walk away from it. Fill a sack with books

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,840
and then walk across the country hand delivering books to people

62
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
while he thinks about his next big deal.

63
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,440
Either that or maybe, because at this point, let's be honest, Amazon,

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,080
you've got to have a whole giant warehouse just full of the books you forgot that you

65
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
were supposed to sell.

66
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,160
Absolutely.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,360
Maybe start hollowing those out and shipping people the things they ordered in books.

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
Well, what do you think HQ2 is going to be made out of, Trav?

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,920
Made out of books?

70
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,920
No, the bones of employees that Jeff just kind of uses as, you know, dude sucks.

71
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Hey, can I tell you guys something horrible, though?

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,240
What's that?

73
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
Did you see the Al Roker thing from Thanksgiving?

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,320
Yeah.

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,560
No.

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
Yeah, I saw a headline and I skipped it.

77
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Oh, you shouldn't have. You should have really patronized that click, bud,

78
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,360
because this is a very, this is a good like meal time prep for me

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
because Travis posted our mom's old sweet potato casserole recipe

80
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,480
that I had not seen in a while.

81
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
It's like my favorite dish that she made for Thanksgiving.

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,360
I was so psyched.

83
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,000
I made it.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
It was so ballin'.

85
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,640
And so I sympathize with Mr. Roker,

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,040
who on the Today Show presented his mom's sweet potato based Thanksgiving food recipe.

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,960
It's kind of a casserole, but with chunks of pineapple and like a heaping handful

88
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,600
of baking soda in it, which I'm still trying to wrap my mind around almost as far.

89
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,320
And again, I do not, I'm not dunking on Mr. Roker or his mom or anything like that.

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,120
I would never do that.

91
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
I respect the game.

92
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,520
The recipe he did say on television a few times was sweet potato poon.

93
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,960
And Al Roker said it with his mouth on the television.

94
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,520
And my ears, and I'm assuming lots of other people's ears heard the waves that he created

95
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,920
and then were sort of digitally synthesized, sent over the airwaves

96
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,640
and then into sweet potato poon.

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,040
He really hit it, poon, and he hit it hard.

98
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,760
Loud plosives, loud everything.

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,480
So that was the highlight of my year.

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,600
That sounds very good.

101
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,080
Where were you, Justin, when you saw it on a website?

102
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,280
You didn't even hear the word, did you?

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
No, I saw dad.

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,840
Al Roker popped up on TV and dad got really mad at him because he hates Al Roker now

105
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
because he was mean to us that one time.

106
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,400
I don't know how I feel now.

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,640
I was mad at him and then the poon thing happened and now actually I think he gained a few points.

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,840
Because how bold and brazen.

109
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,960
I get that you're trying to share your mom's sweet potato casserole recipe.

110
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
It's a beautiful instinct, right?

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,840
But maybe have a talk with the producers, a frank talk with the producers.

112
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
There was a fucking chyron that said sweet potato poon.

113
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,120
Somebody designed it.

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,040
Somebody sat down and said, you know what?

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm gonna put a lot of love into this sweet potato poon graphic.

116
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:53,200
And even the Today Show Twitter account tweeted the video with the caption,

117
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,920
what do our guest judges think of Al Roker's sweet potato poon?

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,040
They love it.

119
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,320
Yeah, and I don't like it being-

120
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
We love Al Roker's poon.

121
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,640
Yeah, I don't like it being possessive like that, huh?

122
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,000
It's rough.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
The guest judges love Roker's poon.

124
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
And now here we are saying it.

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,680
And it's a word we would literally never say in any other context

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,640
because it's arguably one of the worst ways to refer to genitalia.

127
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,000
But I guess it's okay because it's actually referring to a marshmallow-y sweet potato treat.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,120
I don't know what's more offensive,

129
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,440
the use of poon or the use of marshmallows on sweet potato.

130
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
Yeah, we have feelings.

131
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,800
Listen, we have some poonions.

132
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,440
It's no big deal.

133
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
Did you say a poonions?

134
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,680
We have some poonions.

135
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,320
It's the worst.

136
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
So this is an advice show, okay?

137
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,640
And what we do basically on this one is we just give you advice.

138
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
You send us your questions and we turn them out,

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,960
coming like into wisdom.

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
The Christmas creep,

141
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I don't even think I need to tell you all is officially on.

142
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,200
The candle nights for many of you have begun.

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
We've been hearing about it starting to come in across the wires.

144
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
So thank you for those updates.

145
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Candle nights, because I feel like we haven't discussed it in a little bit, wholesale.

146
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:16,240
Candle nights is a pan-religious, pan-sexual, personal pan holiday for everyone.

147
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,160
So it is our holiday.

148
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
It is a, oh, probably the most important thing in this special time of year

149
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,200
to remember about candle nights is that it is a registered trademark of Big Giant Head LLC.

150
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,760
Correct.

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,560
All rights reserved.

152
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,480
And so that is the most important thing about helping candle lights grow

153
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
is that it is our trademark that only we can use.

154
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
Let's get that first question going.

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,840
I work overnights at a facility with a washer and a dryer.

156
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,360
Ooh, no need to brag.

157
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,560
On certain nights, we have less to wash than others.

158
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
Am I committing some sort of weird work crime

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,960
if I were to throw my own laundry on slow days?

160
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,400
It'd save me money at the laundromat,

161
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,560
and I'd still use my own detergent.

162
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
That's from Worried Washer in Washington.

163
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,480
So, holy crap, this is confusing.

164
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,960
They work at a facility with a washer and dryer.

165
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Correct.

166
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
On certain nights, we have less wash to do than others.

167
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,220
Yes.

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,960
So they work in a facility, like say, like in a hotel

169
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,360
where they're washing linens and sheets and stuff.

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,320
No, no, no, this is a binnie.

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,080
This is a binnie of the job.

173
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,600
It's embezzlement, Griffin.

174
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,080
No, shush, shush.

175
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,600
You can't embezzle that.

176
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
This isn't embezzling.

177
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,000
Listen, every job that you will ever have in your entire life

178
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,920
is there's so much coyness that goes into the hiring process.

179
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
They're gonna tell you salary.

180
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,080
You can go back and forth, blow by blow,

181
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,120
and try and raise that up.

182
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
That's cool.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
They are gonna tell you their expectations,

184
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,080
give you an idea like the schedule's gonna be,

185
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
what training's gonna be like.

186
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,120
And then they're gonna tell you, you know,

187
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
if it's at a retail place, what kind of benefit you can get

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,320
vis-a-vis a discount.

189
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
But every job you'll ever have in your life

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is gonna have these secret benefits

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that they cannot put down on paper.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,520
This place cannot write down.

193
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,040
And also, you can do your laundry here for free.

194
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,880
Hush, hush, don't tell nobody.

195
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
Yeah, don't ruin it.

196
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
Don't ruin it for everyone.

197
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,760
Yeah.

198
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,600
Like at the GameStop that I worked at,

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
the secret benefit there was that Nintendo DS games

200
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
were just fair to steal.

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Because it was 2008, the DS had started a decline.

202
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,080
3DS was just around the corner.

203
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,720
And so I gave a knowing look to my manager.

204
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,080
He looked back at me and nodded.

205
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,920
And a nod that said, you go ahead and grab, you know,

206
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,120
Zelda Phantom Hourglass there, tuck it right into your shoe,

207
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
like a little bag of cocaine, and go on out of here.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,800
It's a benefit.

209
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,480
When I worked at Best Buy, the added secret benefit

210
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
was like, you can just like play Wii Bowling for hours

211
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,960
and say you're working and demonstrating the game

212
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,760
for people.

213
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,640
A great benefit.

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,280
Really, you're just really protect-

215
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,360
Like, I was really perfecting my form at Best Buy,

216
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,920
and that's why I'm a professional Wii Bowler now.

217
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,480
Yeah.

218
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680
So thank you, Best Buy.

219
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
At the blockbuster Justin worked at,

220
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,720
it was you can steal one movie a month,

221
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
just don't touch Fight Club.

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,680
And then he took a big bite of that forbidden apple.

223
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
He just couldn't resist.

224
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,760
This is a penny.

225
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
You're good.

226
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm not sure I agree with you guys.

227
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,800
I hate to be the stickler, but I am not opposed-

228
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
I don't think it's a problem to like use the washer

229
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,760
and dryer stuff.

230
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,920
What I do have a problem with is how do you like maintain,

231
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,800
like do the work of laundry?

232
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
Laundry doesn't do itself.

233
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,480
Like once you throw those clothes in,

234
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,840
maybe that's not a big deal,

235
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
but you are gonna need to fold those.

236
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,320
If you throw them in your trunk, unfolded,

237
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,400
all you're gonna end up with is a big pile of wrinkly clothes,

238
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,680
and nobody likes that.

239
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,640
So are you gonna take-

240
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,160
Is it not bad enough to take the boss man's detergent

241
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,400
and water and now you're an electrician?

242
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,280
They will use their own detergent, Justin.

243
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,680
Okay, fine, but now you're using his time.

244
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,640
That's company time, Dilbert, to fold your laundry.

245
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,000
You couldn't have picked another name.

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
Couldn't have picked another name.

247
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
There was none other ones there right in there at that time.

248
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,080
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

249
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,280
How have we not-

250
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,760
We have shaved so many of the edges off

251
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,240
the laundry doing process, right?

252
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,280
Like you go back and you look at the origins of laundry,

253
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,560
and you know, you wash-

254
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,320
It's my favorite Radiohead album, by the way.

255
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,880
Yeah, it's great.

256
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,400
You wash your clothes in the river,

257
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,360
or you get the wash-

258
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,600
The wash tub with a little thing that they play

259
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
as a little cool instrument.

260
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,840
A washboard.

261
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,960
A washboard.

262
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,720
And you know, we got that fixed.

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,480
We got now a machine that gets the clothes wet,

264
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,240
tumbles them around, gets them soapy,

265
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
and another one that dries out the work of the first machine.

266
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
And it's like we got that far,

267
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
and we left the one big, very sharp, very deadly edge on it,

268
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
which is now you have to do origami

269
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
and sort and carry all of your heavy clothes.

270
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,080
How have we not been able to like,

271
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,520
then they, you know, are injected into a small pellet

272
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,320
that you can then just like pull out of your drawer.

273
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
It'll be labeled, Griffin's nice red shirt,

274
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
and then you just spit on it,

275
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,720
and the capsule disintegrates,

276
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,400
and there's your shirt ready to go.

277
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,680
Soaked in spit.

278
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,400
No.

279
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,880
Perfect.

280
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,280
The capsule caught most of the spit.

281
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
It will have some spit on it,

282
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,880
but you didn't have to carry it like,

283
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,600
you know, you just carry a box of pills.

284
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
And then we'll need a fourth machine to wring out the spit.

285
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
Listen, it's all I'm saying.

286
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,160
Get my capsule machine going.

287
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,040
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

288
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,480
Yeah, I love that.

289
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,920
Here's one sent in by Nick G.

290
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,480
Thanks.

291
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,440
It's a Yahoo Answers user, Ashley, who asks,

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,240
is it possible to create a poem in your dreams?

293
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Huh.

294
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,840
About two months ago, I had a dream about a book of poetry.

295
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,280
I opened it and read a poem,

296
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,240
and the theme was Where the Green Sky Meets the Blue Earth.

297
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
I only actually read, I only actually read the first stanza,

298
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
and the poem was amazing.

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,960
I was so, I was so enveloped by the poem

300
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,880
that I was actually sucked into the book

301
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,640
and experienced the poem.

302
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,440
Okay.

303
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
I've certainly never read a poem

304
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,080
and I've searched and searched,

305
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,800
but I can't find a poem about a green sky and blue earth.

306
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,160
I really didn't think it was possible

307
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,680
to create literature in a dream,

308
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
but now I'm not so sure I really want to find that poem.

309
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
Is it possible to write a poem in a dream?

310
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
If anyone can help me or at least point me

311
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,080
in the right direction, that would be great.

312
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
I dreamt a poem.

313
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,480
I did, it seemed a little long and a little tough

314
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
and I had, you know,

315
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,360
some nude parts of the dream I wanted to get to.

316
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
So I did only read the first stanza,

317
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,480
but it was amazing.

318
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
I was so enveloped by the first stanza,

319
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,080
which was all I allowed myself to read

320
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
because of how boring it was.

321
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,080
I was sucked into the book

322
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,800
and experienced this green sky and blue earth firsthand.

323
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,520
Holy shit.

324
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,640
Why is the sky green in this?

325
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
It's a fucking dream poem, Travis.

326
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,080
There are two answers to that, Travis.

327
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,120
One, it's a poem.

328
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
Two, it's a dream.

329
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,640
Yeah, but even in a poem you're not like,

330
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,800
look at that, I don't know, purple tree

331
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,280
and it's like, oh, you're nailing it with this poem thing.

332
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,720
You're like creating some very wild boundaries

333
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,800
around what poems can have.

334
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,320
Poems can do pretty much whatever,

335
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
but if they get the color of the sky wrong,

336
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,360
it's like, next, next poem, please.

337
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
That's not about creating art

338
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,560
and your beautiful, I don't know, rhymes or not rhymes.

339
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,760
Come on, poems.

340
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Come on, not rhyming.

341
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,960
Anybody can not rhyme things.

342
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,160
But then you're also like making the sky green.

343
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,040
What are you talking?

344
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,080
And earth is brown.

345
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,040
That's entirely possible.

346
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,640
Do you remember when Travis was a copy editor

347
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,760
for E.E. Comics?

348
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,800
How many of his works he just, nope,

349
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
sent back, no, no, no.

350
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,520
Where's the punctuation?

351
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,320
Listen, I think your typewriters got messed up keys in it

352
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,560
or something because this is all fucked up, E.E.E.

353
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,280
I just wrote back more commas across the top.

354
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,640
More commas, one line.

355
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,320
This is a sentence, E.E.E.

356
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,520
You can do better than this.

357
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,200
Gosh, I wish I knew other poets.

358
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,020
I know.

359
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,200
Man, there's gotta be other ones, right?

360
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,560
I've been wondering about this lately.

361
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,400
I am married to a poet

362
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,680
and you would think at some point

363
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,520
I would have learned like through osmosis

364
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,400
or just from, you know, like just kissing.

365
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,120
Like I would have absorbed some sort of like knowledge,

366
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,640
but literally none.

367
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,720
I feel like there's one named Yeats.

368
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,400
There's one named Yeat for sure.

369
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,860
Okay.

370
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,200
My favorite one is Lord Byron

371
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,480
because where does he get off?

372
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,440
Yeah, that's pretty good.

373
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
So did you dream, can you dream,

374
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,120
hmm, did all of the George Lucas have a dream about Star Wars?

375
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
Woke up, wrote it down.

376
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,640
Not a poem.

377
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
No, no, no, but Griffin, here's, I'm sorry,

378
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
but what you are saying, yeah, of course,

379
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,360
of course you can dream an idea.

380
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
This is words.

381
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,840
What this person is saying is that they dreamed

382
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,280
about a poem that does exist already

383
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,400
that they themselves have never read or seen.

384
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,520
So they are trying to find the poem

385
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
they dreamed about.

386
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
Yeah, a very, very helpful user

387
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,920
who like deserves a medal of honor

388
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,360
for going above and beyond on Yahoo fucking answers

389
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,800
named Evelyn says best answer,

390
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,760
a rainbow by Donna Brock curving up,

391
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
then down, meeting blue sky and green earth.

392
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,200
Evelyn, it's clearly the opposite though.

393
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
Green sky, blue earth.

394
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,160
But Evelyn is correct.

395
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,480
I appreciate your help, but you did, come on.

396
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,200
Come on.

397
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,920
Evelyn gets an A for accuracy.

398
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:34,800
So.

399
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
And a P for poem.

400
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,080
And an R for rainbow.

401
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,360
And an L for letters.

402
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,720
There were many.

403
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,680
She gets all of them.

404
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,480
This would be-

405
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,280
Is this a poem?

406
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
Is this episode a poem?

407
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
I mean, come on.

408
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,280
What is in a poem?

409
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,600
Fuck.

410
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
I mean, lots of, most stuff isn't.

411
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,800
Most stuff ain't poems.

412
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,520
Most stuff ain't poems.

413
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,480
What do you know?

414
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,680
Okay, point to something right now and conclusively prove to me

415
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,720
that it's not a poem.

416
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,720
I mean, I guess anything can be a poem.

417
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
And if that's your philosophy, then a 99

418
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,360
and then like a funny number of.999s after it.

419
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,960
Like I would go on for a long time and you'd be like,

420
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,840
wow, that sure is a very small number of things are good poem.

421
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,720
This episode, yeah, you could maybe write it down

422
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,560
and then submit it to poetry class.

423
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,640
You'll be expelled from the school for this.

424
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,960
Or lauded as like the next poet laureate of the world.

425
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,920
I do know this.

426
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,640
I do know this.

427
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,880
You have to be right.

428
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,440
You have to be right in a poem to make a poem.

429
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,080
And it is hard to do it.

430
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,720
And I think saying out loud that anything's a poem.

431
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
So fuck y'all is maybe a bad tact to take on Travie.

432
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,800
I mean, we're looking down on Wayne's basement,

433
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,640
only that's not Wayne's basement.

434
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,840
Isn't that weird?

435
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,960
And then Wayne says, Garth, that was a haiku.

436
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,760
So he was not intending to write a poem,

437
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
but he did write a poem with his phraseology.

438
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:09,840
Sure.

439
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,400
Or just went like Drew Barrymore in Die Dracula's like cellar door

440
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
and everyone's like, oh god, it's fucking beautiful.

441
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
So both those things you just mentioned

442
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,560
were professional actors reading off a script

443
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,480
that somebody had written.

444
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
Somebody did write that haiku intentionally, Justin.

445
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,760
So I'm going to come at you.

446
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,440
And for Travis's example, didn't do a poem.

447
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm pretty sure she read a poem written by a poet at some point.

448
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Both of you guys are just, you fucking tanked so bad there

449
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,640
on both of the points you're trying to make.

450
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,280
Poems are hard.

451
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,560
You got to try to make them.

452
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:40,960
I don't think you-

453
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,680
That's a poem.

454
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,800
You just made a poem.

455
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,440
Poems are hard.

456
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
You got to try to make them.

457
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,680
That could be a poem.

458
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Cut, print, rap.

459
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,400
Griffin.

460
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,120
Is it?

461
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,800
Now, was it a rap?

462
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,300
No.

463
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,560
No.

464
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,680
Are poems raps?

465
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,480
Are raps poems?

466
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
Some of them are, yeah.

467
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,040
I don't know why I'm having to explain this to the two.

468
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,280
It doesn't seem like the sort of taxonomy of these things

469
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,240
is too difficult to understand.

470
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,840
I feel like as someone who is married to an appreciator of poetry,

471
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,280
you, Griffin, are wanting to put a lot of bounds

472
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,600
on what is and ain't poems.

473
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
And I think what Travis and I are saying is very empowering.

474
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Yes.

475
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,840
Because what we're sort of saying is, who knows?

476
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,560
Yeah, yeah, sure.

477
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
I think this is a scenario, Griffin,

478
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
where when this episode goes up,

479
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,800
poets will actually be coming at you.

480
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,360
Oh, okay.

481
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,440
They're trying to limit their creativity,

482
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,760
where I'm saying literally everything is a poem

483
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,120
and anything could be a poem.

484
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,680
And you're like, no, a poem's got to be like this.

485
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,200
And you're like old man poet who's trying to box them in

486
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,520
and I'm opening the door and setting them free.

487
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
I feel like maybe I'm not putting boundaries on them

488
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,960
because a poem can take so many forms.

489
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,160
But what you all are saying, you're coming up and over me

490
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,320
and saying that like fettuccine Alfredo,

491
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,880
the dish of thick food, can be a poem.

492
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,120
Yes.

493
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,720
And I hate that.

494
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,160
It smells stuff out with the noodles.

495
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,480
Yeah, sure.

496
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
Or maybe you do it in such a way that somebody eats it

497
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
like you're fucking noodle poet, Derek.

498
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah, the cream spills on the Olive Garden table

499
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,400
and the sunlight shining through it

500
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,560
makes a prism on the floor and you point out that

501
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,480
and say, look, everyone, a poem.

502
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
Look before it goes away.

503
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,320
Yes, it's a pasta poem.

504
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,520
All right, all right.

505
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm just saying that maybe as always,

506
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,800
I'm right and you're wrong.

507
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,160
I'm just saying what Travis,

508
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,760
I think what Travis and I are saying is

509
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,920
maybe poems are a collection of letters

510
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,280
and spaces and persuasion.

511
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,920
Maybe they're a collection of gluten and dairy products

512
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,320
and peppercorns.

513
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,880
You know what I mean?

514
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
Like it could be whatever you-

515
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,040
You're talking about discovered poems.

516
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,440
I'm talking about undiscovered poems.

517
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,080
Like I'm looking at the periodic table of poems

518
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,840
and you're looking at the first two lines

519
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,480
and I'm saying maybe there's even more squares

520
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
and lines of poems that we haven't even discovered yet.

521
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
Griffin is okay.

522
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,760
Griffin didn't know about undiscovered poems.

523
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
Yes, of course.

524
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
A problem with a lot of poems.

525
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,480
Let me clear this up for Griff and Travis

526
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,520
before I might be so bold.

527
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,000
Please do.

528
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,440
Yeah, I'm obviously having some trouble here.

529
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
The problem with a lot of poems

530
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,880
is that people haven't realized that they're poems yet.

531
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,680
Correct.

532
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,720
So the hard work,

533
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,040
a lot of people write poems

534
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,880
and it's almost like wasteful

535
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,760
because there's lots of poems out there already

536
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,320
that we just haven't sort of unearthed yet.

537
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,960
You know what I mean?

538
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,760
That are just waiting to be discovered.

539
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,160
That's true.

540
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,680
I guess it's not like anybody's ever kicked in the door

541
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
to plowshares and said,

542
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,600
hey, here's a Pettuccini Alfredo,

543
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,280
print this you fucking cowards.

544
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
Yeah, I think that's fair.

545
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,680
Now what a lot of people are wondering

546
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,360
is what's plowshares?

547
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,920
Yeah, it's a...

548
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,640
You know what?

549
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,160
I don't think that's as important

550
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,200
as the fact that Pettuccini Alfredo can be a poem.

551
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
Did you just say Pettuccini Alfredo?

552
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,320
Yeah, how would plowshares, a literary journal,

553
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,400
how would they go about printing Pettuccini Alfredo?

554
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
They squeeze it between the pages of the book, Griffin.

555
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,080
Each one, okay.

556
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
Like pressing a flower.

557
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
I thought maybe you upended on the Xerox,

558
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,640
whatever shape it takes is the poem.

559
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
Oh, maybe that.

560
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,480
Oh, I like that.

561
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
No, that sounds more like of a McSweeney's thing.

562
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,640
Griffin, you're kind of getting the hang of it now.

563
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
Yeah, I'm proud of you.

564
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
You're a poet now, boy.

565
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,680
When did you start plowshares?

566
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,600
I didn't even know about it.

567
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,560
Yeah, I was doing a weed in the 70s

568
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,400
and eating the most delicious bowl of,

569
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
not Pettuccini Alfredo, but in that family,

570
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
sort of a carbonara situation.

571
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,960
And I let out a hearty burp.

572
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,040
My friend Tim said, that's a poem.

573
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,960
And so the rest is history, baby.

574
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
Burp into this book, quick.

575
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
Yeah, I burped into the book.

576
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,800
I burped all my secrets into it.

577
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,120
Tim said, that's a poem, quick, slam the book.

578
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,760
Slam the book shut before the burp poem gets away.

579
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
And so that was how that worked.

580
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,880
And there are people who are never gonna listen

581
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,960
to our show again because of this bit.

582
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,160
Because they're too afraid of how truthful it is?

583
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,480
Like, maybe this episode's a poem?

584
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,760
I've been doing this for a long time now

585
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
that I can sense these things.

586
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,160
I feel like there are some people that have gone beyond mad

587
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,960
and found emotions that are somehow beyond mad,

588
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,920
which hopefully will be useful to them in their poetry.

589
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,320
I've never thought of our podcast as us being the Cenobites

590
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,840
from the Hellraiser movies,

591
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,880
just like trying to make you experience new sort of,

592
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,600
by subjecting you to new sort of torturous body horrors

593
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,160
by desecrating the things that you're passionate about.

594
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,600
You can find new, you can transcend the base emotions

595
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,800
into something more beautiful

596
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,480
that you can then turn into poetry, yes.

597
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,200
Yes.

598
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
I'm only passionate about one thing.

599
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,920
Do y'all know what it is?

600
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,440
Money?

601
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,000
Money zone?

602
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,480
Money.

603
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,120
Yeah, it's money.

604
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,600
It's money.

605
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,240
It's the one thing.

606
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
This is the year that you can finally tackle

607
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,640
your holiday shopping early.

608
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,160
Guess what?

609
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,960
You can just get everybody underpants and stuff.

610
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,100
Okay.

611
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:18,960
Yeah.

612
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,920
Well, no, there's a reason

613
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
because we're sponsored this week by MeUndies

614
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,360
and MeUndies uses the coveted micromodal fabric,

615
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
which is three times softer than cotton.

616
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,920
And let me tell y'all, if you like their underpants,

617
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,240
you're gonna love their lounge pants.

618
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,880
Yeah.

619
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
I was wearing the lounge pants yesterday.

620
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,120
My little baby boy grabbed like the cuff of the pant leg

621
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
down at the bottom near my foot

622
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,880
and just started playing with the micromodal fabric.

623
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,640
Just kind of stretching it and playing with it

624
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,760
and having a great time.

625
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,640
Great for kids.

626
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,840
Folks, let me tell you,

627
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,400
these aren't pants to wear all the time.

628
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,160
If you have things to do, don't put these pants on.

629
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,720
Yes.

630
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
This is not work and wear, folks.

631
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,600
You're gonna put these on and be like,

632
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,640
I'm just gonna stretch out here on the couch and do Tuesday.

633
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,920
What?

634
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,520
I got fired from my job because you're so darn comfortable.

635
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
And here's the thing,

636
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,440
you can choose from four different cuts of underpants,

637
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
all of which are available from classic colors

638
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,360
to adventurous prints.

639
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,400
And the lounge pants, they come,

640
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,520
the ones I have are in this very fun black and red,

641
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,200
like kind of very seasonal prints

642
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,960
that I really enjoy, like a plaid.

643
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,840
Mine are green and black.

644
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,360
Ooh, really?

645
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,080
It's fun.

646
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,880
Yeah, they're different.

647
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,440
And speaking of prints,

648
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,400
they'll be releasing a new print every Tuesday.

649
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,160
Speaking of prints, Raspberry Beret, killer tracks.

650
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,560
So sick.

651
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,600
And along with lounge pants, they got onesies,

652
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,360
they got hoodies, they got t-shirts.

653
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,480
I have a meandee t-shirt that is like one of my favorite.

654
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
Because it feels like a hug.

655
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
I've been wearing their hoodie

656
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,520
since the weather changed here in Austin.

657
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,960
It's been nice, nice friend.

00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,880

673
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440

674
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120

This one is for Zoe, Amy, Danny, Jude, Manny, Sky,

699
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,320
Dania, Noelle and Jess and it's from Nico who says

700
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
salutations.

701
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,880
I'm sure you're wondering why I've gathered you all here today.

702
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,040
It is important that I tell you that I am Nico

703
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,320
and you are all my friends.

704
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,120
The important ones clearly because you listen to this show.

705
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,680
Zoe, one day I will get you to stop committing food crimes.

706
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,800
The rest of you, it's 420 somewhere so please 420 blaze it.

707
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,080
For me, Jumbotron adjourned.

708
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,120
I love that.

709
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,680
I love that.

710
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,920
A lot of times we get letters and people say

711
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,160
I don't know when to stop listening to the Jumbotron

712
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,520
and this one had a little like, you know, over and out on it.

713
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
Which I think that Jumbotron was a poem.

714
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,600
How about this next one then?

715
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,560
Let's see about that.

716
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,880
Okay.

717
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,680
I'll read it I guess because nobody else is doing it.

718
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,200
This is you introed it.

719
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,960
It's for Perry Buto.

720
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,640
Sorry if I fucked that up.

721
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,240
It's from Michaela Johnson Blanchard or Blanchard

722
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,800
who says hey specialty pizza.

723
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,440
I purchased this message to commemorate how far we've come

724
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,240
since our days listening to my bim bam and knitting on your bed.

725
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,280
We don't like that show anymore obviously.

726
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,360
We've come way past it.

727
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,960
It's really grown.

728
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,400
We've grown and evolved and it's for we've put away our childish things now.

729
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
You're almost done with your master's

730
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,800
and I'm finishing up my first quarter of grad school plus getting married.

731
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,280
I am thrilled that you continue to be an important person in my life

732
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,560
and I hope hearing some love from these boys brightens your day.

733
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,320
Looking forward to our next adventure.

734
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,680
It's a sweet message.

735
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,800
Sometimes we get stuff like this

736
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,680
and I worry that we aren't rubbing enough love into it.

737
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,800
We're just sort of reading.

738
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,960
So like I guess Perry we love you.

739
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,080
We love you.

740
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,280
Hi I'm the JV Club podcast Janet Varney

741
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,680
and I used to suffer from indecision.

742
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,040
I couldn't choose between Star Wars and Star Trek

743
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,960
whether to call or text or the best way to cook my eggs

744
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,080
but now thanks to my weekly dose of We Got This on Maximum Fun

745
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,680
my decisions are made for me.

746
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
Thanks Mark and Hal.

747
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,040
Warning, We Got This may cause shouting,

748
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
foam throwing, the illusion that the hosts can hear you,

749
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,560
laughter on public transit, and death.

750
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,640
We Got This with Mark and Hal.

751
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,520
We know what's best.

752
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
How about a next question?

753
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,320
Before we do that I have a special segment I'd like to introduce to you now.

754
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,200
It's a new segment.

755
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,200
It's a new festive segment.

756
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,480
There's a jingle I wrote for it

757
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,400
if I could just sing the jingle real quick.

758
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,720
Okay.

759
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,280
Of course.

760
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,780
Okay.

761
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Come and sit with me now in the candlelight.

762
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,280
Yeah this Christmas we're gonna do right.

763
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,160
Hang some lights on the tree.

764
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,360
Yeah that's a Christmas to me.

765
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,360
Put your arm around the fire.

766
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,760
Yeah I don't want any more knock.

767
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,240
Yeah you're calling me a liar.

768
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,560
But I'm gonna go out for a jog.

769
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,560
That's a Christmas to me.

770
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,840
That's a Christmas to me.

771
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,080
You and me and her and a tree.

772
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
Learning about birds and the bee.

773
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,680
That's a Christmas to me.

774
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
So this is my new segment.

775
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,920
That's a Christmas to me.

776
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:18,960
And it's a segment where I'm gonna read you three descriptions from Hallmark Christmas films

777
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:29,280
Two of them are going to be real films and one of them is going to be a film that I've engineered.

778
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,320
These are challenging questions that I don't want anybody to leap to snap decisions to.

779
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,640
I want you to really chew these over okay.

780
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,200
We have three films today.

781
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,880
The first film is called Let It Snow.

782
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,720
When Falcon Resorts acquires family-owned Snow Valley Lodge from retiring owners

783
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,920
Carla and Paul, driven executive Stephanie Beck must spend the week before Christmas

784
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,520
in Maine preparing a proposal on the property's renovations.

785
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Determined to impress Falcon's president, her detached father Ted,

786
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,480
Stephanie reluctantly departs her warm Arizona home to immerse herself in the lodge's property

787
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,960
and decide how to change it to fit the hip young Falcon brand.

788
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,720
While preparing to rebuild the Snow Valley Lodge from the ground up,

789
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,840
Stephanie butts heads with her property guide Brady Lewis, Carla and Paul's son,

790
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,720
who has decided to leave his family's business over creative differences with his dad.

791
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:31,280
A self-defined grinch, Stephanie begins her stay at Snow Valley Lodge immune to Christmas sentiment.

792
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,560
But as the lodge's festive traditions provide, the Christmas Stephanie never had growing up

793
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,640
with her distant father, Stephanie finds herself enjoying every minute.

794
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,960
To complicate her professional duties even further,

795
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,640
the combative feelings she felt towards Brady turned into romantic ones.

796
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,840
With Stephanie's newfound Christmas spirit and unexpected holiday romance,

797
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,800
she begins to question Falcon's overhaul.

798
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,400
As her Christmas Eve deadline approaches, she's faced with a decision.

799
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:05,440
She transform the lodge into a new winter hotspot or embrace tradition and let it snow.

800
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
Oh, the latter one because it's the name of the movie.

801
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

802
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,760
That's our first film. It's called Let It Snow.

803
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
I want to get through our other two films.

804
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,440
Their descriptions are slightly shorter, mercifully.

805
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,960
These descriptions, by the way, are direct from the Hallmark Company's website.

806
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,360
Yeah, but I didn't think you wrote these for the shows.

807
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,080
Okay, thank you.

808
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,640
This one's called Cast Away for Christmas.

809
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,880
When San Francisco- When they sit down to watch the Tom Hanks movie,

810
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,480
Cast Away. When you watch it and watch the whole thing, it's awesome.

811
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,040
Cast Away for Christmas.

812
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,520
When San Francisco oil executive Nick Sperling

813
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,880
comes to the remote Canadian hamlet of Cedarwood Island,

814
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
he's only looking for one thing.

815
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,400
The rumored oil deposit under Cedarwood's only tree farm slash bed and breakfast.

816
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,480
In the hopes of endearing himself to its owner, single mob Lisa Craig,

817
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,240
Nick pretends to be a bed and breakfast critic

818
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,880
looking for Canada's most charming holiday escape.

819
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,400
When a snowstorm shuts down ferry service off the island,

820
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,880
Nick finds himself stranded on what the natives jokingly call Christmas Island

821
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,360
in honor of how the town goes all out for the holiday.

822
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,120
Before long, Nick starts to doubt his plans to raise the farm in search of oil

823
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,080
and starts to wonder if he could make a life with Lisa.

824
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,320
But after she learns the truth, will she ever want to see him again?

825
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,680
Is the truth that he's a ghost?

826
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,600
No, the truth is that he's an oil executive.

827
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,560
He pretended to be anyway.

828
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,280
Oh, right, right, right.

829
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,360
Okay, last film, Christmas in Love.

830
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,720
Good.

831
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,400
I can't believe one of these isn't real.

832
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,840
I haven't even heard what this is.

833
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,680
Ellie Hartman is an aspiring crafter working in her small town's bakery

834
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,160
making famous Christmas kringles.

835
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,080
When the new big city CEO Nick Carlingson visits the bakery,

836
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,000
he arrives filled with modernization ideas destined to lay off many employees.

837
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,080
During his visit, Ellie is to teach Nick how to make a kringle

838
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:05,680
and determined to show him it's the people who make the business success, not machines.

839
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,760
Nick meets more of the employees and townspeople,

840
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,280
visits the food bank and begins to see all the kindness that is shared

841
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
and he begins to soften.

842
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,360
They're not convinced automation isn't better.

843
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,400
Struggling with chasing her own entrepreneurial dreams, Ellie begins to fall for Nick

844
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,920
but not before feeling betrayed when she inadvertently sees Nick's laptop

845
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,600
filled with automation plans.

846
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,360
When Nick finally tells the employees his future ideas for the company,

847
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,400
Ellie must decide if she should trust him but more importantly,

848
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,840
whether to take a leap of faith in making her own dreams come true

849
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,080
and that's Christmas in Love.

850
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,600
The three films again are Let It Snow

851
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,840
and that's about the woman who goes to the resort to find out how they do Christmas.

852
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,320
Change it.

853
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,640
Change it and knock it down.

854
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,720
Castaway for Christmas is about an oil executive

855
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,760
that goes to a Christmas island to not probably knock down the tree farm

856
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,640
in order to build his oil thing

857
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,840
and Christmas in Love is about a guy who's gonna go destroy the bakery

858
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,600
to replace it with robots.

859
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,560
That one has a Blade Runner vibe that I'm super into by the way.

860
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,120
I do want to ask you because I am not as familiar

861
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,440
with like the Hallmark Netflix original.

862
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,800
Channel 312 Trav on DirecTV.

863
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,280
Get there.

864
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,080
Thank you.

865
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,440
But is it just, did you specifically pick these three movies for the theme

866
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,680
or is it just a super common theme of like,

867
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,080
person comes to town to destroy a small business.

868
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh no, love saved the business.

869
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
This is Netflix's Christmas Inheritance too.

870
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,240
It's just, it feels like some, what was the first,

871
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,000
what was the urr movie for these that was just sort of then passed down

872
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,560
through a game of telephone and became all,

873
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,200
and you know what?

874
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm talking about this just in completely ignoring the fact that one of these is fake.

875
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,320
One of these is, you wrote.

876
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,520
And I have to say kudos.

877
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,160
Thank you.

878
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,880
Kudos, yes.

879
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,160
It's a very realistic.

880
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,760
I have to give half the credit to Sydney who helped me.

881
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,240
By the way, we cooked up our film in 10 minutes

882
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,000
while she folded laundry and I kept the baby from killing herself.

883
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,040
So it's like-

884
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,080
Not the hardest.

885
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,040
It's not the hardest.

886
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Anything can be a urban person goes rural romantic Christmas.

887
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,640
Be careful- Learns that people are maybe worth those shits.

888
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,560
Yeah, yeah, there's, I think that that's definitely,

889
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,920
Travis, you stumble on one of the common themes in Hallmark Christmas movies.

890
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,960
The three big ones I would say are big city person who fucking doesn't,

891
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,400
has never heard of Christmas, never had it, somehow missed it,

892
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,200
and then goes to one small town where they're like,

893
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,040
yeah, we got Christmas coming out of our ass.

894
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,720
Here, have a little bit extra Christmas.

895
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,320
The second theme is white.

896
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,880
The third theme is like automation and preservation of business

897
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:59,120
in favor of like a profit versus keeping jobs and tradition.

898
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,240
So literally saying like,

899
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,160
this is more important than the money we would need to pay people who work here.

900
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,680
Yeah.

901
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,120
The people are what matters.

902
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,680
I'm so worried about giving away anything.

903
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,480
I know, I know, I know.

904
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
I really hope Christmas in Love is not the fake one

905
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,840
because I feel like Jeff Bezos could really love to watch that one.

906
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,000
I have to say it's Christmas in Love too.

907
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,560
You do?

908
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,320
Well, wait, no, I'm not saying that one's fake.

909
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,160
No, I'm saying I don't want that to be fake.

910
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,200
I think Cast Away for Christmas is for sure the fake one.

911
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,640
I think it's Christmas in Love.

912
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,080
Justin?

913
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
So what are our votes?

914
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Sorry, one more time.

915
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,240
I'm Cast Away for Christmas.

916
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
Travis is Christmas in Love.

917
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,240
Christmas in Love is the one with the kringles, right?

918
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,880
Yeah.

919
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,480
Okay, then that's what I'm going with.

920
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,160
As the fake one?

921
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,800
Yes.

922
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,840
All right, the winner of this round of That's a Christmas to Me

923
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,320
is Griffin McElroy.

924
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,960
Cast Away for Christmas is a fake film

925
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
that my wife and I came up with at 2.45 today

926
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,240
before we started recording.

927
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,080
Holy shit.

928
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,360
Thank you very much.

929
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,920
It was good.

930
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I'm not saying it was fake because you gave yourself away.

931
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,520
It just seemed like-

932
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,640
You had to pick one.

933
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,880
I had to pick one and it seemed like the oil was maybe-

934
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,040
The one with kringles was real?

935
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,160
Here's the wildest thing.

936
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,240
If I may divert about Christmas in Love real quick.

937
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,160
So the CEO of the bakery company comes

938
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,240
and he's the son of the current CEO

939
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,160
and he's going to be the new CEO, right?

940
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,920
He comes to the bakery company.

941
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,840
This is where they bake all the things

942
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,160
and he's from the home base in San Francisco.

943
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,720
He is the son of the owner, okay?

944
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,200
He shows up in this town of like where everybody loves Christmas

945
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,640
and this woman bakes Christmas kringles,

946
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,400
shows up in the town

947
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,160
and pretends he's not, just pretends he's not that

948
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,600
because in all these films,

949
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,760
the one thing that's very important is deceit.

950
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,920
There's always deceit in these films.

951
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,520
It's extremely important.

952
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,240
This woman doesn't know what the son of the owner

953
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,840
of her company looks like.

954
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,440
She allows herself to be lied to

955
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,760
for the entirety of the film about his identity.

956
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,560
It is, it says absolute madness.

957
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,120
I am not as much of a business expert

958
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,800
as I am a poetry expert.

959
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,680
Is it common for a headquarters

960
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,200
of what sounds to me like a single bakery-

961
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

962
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,840
To be not in the same place as where the bakery is?

963
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,760
I'm going to set up my office thousands of miles away

964
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,120
from the only building that matters to my company?

965
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,680
Yes.

966
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,480
Yes, listen, we need to give thanks to Netflix

967
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,080
for making bold films like A Christmas Prince

968
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,360
that break the fucking mold.

969
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,520
Like fucking Christmas Chronicles,

970
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,160
which is about a Santa who does fuck for sure.

971
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,520
Excited to watch that.

972
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,240
I haven't watched Christmas Chronicles yet,

973
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,440
but it is on my 40 Christmas movie to-do list.

974
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,840
Yeah.

975
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,640
Still looking for 10 more suggestions, by the way.

976
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,680
Can we do a Yahoo?

977
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

978
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,480
We've only answered one regular question this episode.

979
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,520
Maybe we should do that first.

980
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,960
You got it.

981
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,840
I recently discovered that my landlord has a secret toilet

982
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,280
hidden in my basement.

983
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,360
I live in a house with an unfinished basement

984
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,400
and there's a door down there

985
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,680
that the landlord keeps locked

986
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,200
and has told us is off limits.

987
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,200
One day when I was in the basement,

988
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,320
I noticed the door was unlocked.

989
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,440
So of course I took a peek.

990
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,280
Inside was a toilet and a half-used roll of toilet paper.

991
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm really not sure how to proceed from here.

992
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,240
Call the cops.

993
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,920
Does he come to my house just to poop in my basement?

994
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,560
Yes.

995
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,680
What do I do?

996
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,200
I announce we're doing laundry

997
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,960
and suddenly I hear it flush

998
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,680
and he comes out of his secret bathroom.

999
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,800
Should I be afraid?

1000
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,360
Should I tell him I've discovered his dirty little secret?

1001
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,320
Please help.

1002
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,080
That's from Bathroom Shy in Michigan.

1003
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,000
You can't tell him.

1004
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,840
He'll silence you.

1005
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,360
Yep.

1006
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:43,600
Yeah.

1007
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,080
If I had a toilet somewhere in the world

1008
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,920
that only I knew about,

1009
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,160
I would protect that with my life.

1010
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,840
Yeah, he will put you in the ground.

1011
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,320
No question.

1012
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,880
Holy shit.

1013
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,160
Have you guys ever thought about this?

1014
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,600
Just now.

1015
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,880
I guess I was reading it.

1016
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,760
No, listen.

1017
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,720
I put it in the question.

1018
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,240
Stop, stop, please stop and listen.

1019
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,120
Please stop and listen.

1020
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,620
Listen.

1021
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,480
There's not a toilet on earth that only you have used.

1022
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,080
There is not a toilet on the planet that exists

1023
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,880
that only knows your brand.

1024
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,120
Every toilet you have ever used,

1025
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,960
you may have been the first one to use it

1026
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
and maybe in that moment you were the only,

1027
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,160
but that was not, it's not permanent.

1028
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,400
There's no, there are very few people,

1029
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,640
aside from the mega rich, I assume,

1030
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,840
who just don't, don't have their own toilet.

1031
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,560
And I think your landlord has that

1032
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,280
and knows that he is special because of it

1033
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,880
and has to keep it somewhere.

1034
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,580
Huh.

1035
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,480
You got to call the police.

1036
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,880
They exist for this exact reason.

1037
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
911, what's your emergency?

1038
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,320
Listen, this is going to sound weird,

1039
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,880
but I found a toilet in my, we'll be right there.

1040
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,800
Every cop in the world is on the way.

1041
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,880
Listen, we're going to take good care of you.

1042
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,920
Don't panic, but get out of the house.

1043
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,960
Do you have a cupboard you can crawl into and get small?

1044
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,120
Do you know, let me get through this thought.

1045
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,960
Do you know how ragged your action has to be

1046
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,040
that the first time that you move in with your new bride

1047
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,920
and you use the bathroom, she grabs you by the lapels

1048
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,440
and she's coming out and says,

1049
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,160
you look at me, Ralph Sperling, I'm not going to leave

1050
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,320
because I made a promise in front of the God

1051
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,640
and our family and everything.

1052
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,880
But if you ever, ever do that in our home again,

1053
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,840
I, God, I need you to buy another house

1054
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,360
to put those in because you're not going to my house

1055
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,400
with my dad's ashes and all my different paintings

1056
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,920
and my wedge wood and everything.

1057
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,360
You're not doing that in my home.

1058
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,280
We're going to have children here someday.

1059
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,880
You can't do that here.

1060
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,080
You're going to buy another house.

1061
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,680
This is an antique couch.

1062
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,880
This isn't happening here.

1063
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,840
Who's going to live there?

1064
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,600
I don't give a shit who lives there, Ralph.

1065
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,520
Hopefully nobody for their sakes,

1066
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
but that is where you will put these crimes.

1067
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,840
You lock that shame in the basement.

1068
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,120
They can't even know you do it there.

1069
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,920
That's locked up.

1070
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,800
And then every year I just come and brick over it.

1071
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,320
Cascavina Montalano style.

1072
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,560
So no big deal.

1073
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,760
It's completely fine.

1074
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,200
Once the toilet starts to melt from my leavings,

1075
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,880
I should just brick over the room.

1076
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,680
That's probably what this is.

1077
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,840
It's just like, you know, there is,

1078
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,040
for a fact, bunkers.

1079
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,200
There was one planned,

1080
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,960
or it was built in West Virginia,

1081
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,360
that Greenbrier for like,

1082
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,800
this is a case of nuclear attack.

1083
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,640
This is where we take people from the government.

1084
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,400
But once you know that location,

1085
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,920
like, well, we got to build another one.

1086
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,080
Like, I think that this is that,

1087
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,280
like he probably has a secret toilet

1088
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,200
that if you, like, let him know,

1089
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,200
like, your house is going to probably be gone tomorrow.

1090
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,400
Yeah, or it dissolves from the stuff you do in it,

1091
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,800
and then you got to sell that house and buy a new house.

1092
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,480
Could we get an HGTV show out of this?

1093
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,520
And maybe you only get one episode a year.

1094
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,560
Toilet hunters.

1095
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,600
I'm thinking Flip or Plop.

1096
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,520
Okay, very good.

1097
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,080
I like that.

1098
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,040
I'm thinking Plopperty Brother.

1099
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,280
One you should do is Flip or Plop Las Vegas

1100
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,600
to make people think that there's other ones

1101
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,960
that were very successful,

1102
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,080
so they should probably watch.

1103
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,920
Wow, this is a rough one.

1104
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,120
I mean, just let your landlord have this.

1105
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,120
I mean, what my advice to you would be

1106
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,400
if they'll cut you in on the action.

1107
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:36,960
Yeah.

1108
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,560
Okay, I'm going to let you have this secret.

1109
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,960
I don't know who you're keeping it from.

1110
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,680
I don't care.

1111
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,520
I'm not paid to ask questions,

1112
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,360
but you are going to give me a key.

1113
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,600
It's going to be our little secret now.

1114
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,960
Yeah, that could work.

1115
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,360
I'm saying that there's another possibility here

1116
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,480
that we have looked at this

1117
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,160
as like a secret bathroom for your landlord.

1118
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,240
But what if when you tell your landlord,

1119
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,120
like, what's the deal?

1120
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,600
He's like, you didn't use it, did you?

1121
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,440
The last 10 people to use that toilet died

1122
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,720
in a horrific accident within 24 hours.

1123
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,360
It's at the ring.

1124
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,080
You got to get somebody else to sit on it.

1125
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,640
Can you leave a note in there that says I know?

1126
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,240
I mean, yeah.

1127
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,800
If you wanted to put everybody on blast,

1128
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,760
I think you could get,

1129
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,720
you'll need a 3D printer and a bunch of marbles,

1130
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,360
but you 3D print out something that looks like toilet paper

1131
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,120
and they reach over to get the scrape that they need

1132
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,920
and they realize it's not real.

1133
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
It's 3D printed and it looks really real.

1134
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,240
And so they can't yell for help.

1135
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,200
And so they do that shameful walk

1136
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,600
that they do out into the basement.

1137
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,400
Well, what's that?

1138
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,680
The marbles are there.

1139
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,720
And now you record.

1140
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,320
And that's just for you.

1141
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,320
And then you never pay rent again.

1142
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,760
Never again do you pay rent.

1143
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,280
Jesus, that's right.

1144
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,120
This is a good opportunity, actually.

1145
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,080
You play this right.

1146
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,200
This is about as controlled as rent could get.

1147
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,960
Play this wrong and that's the ball game.

1148
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,240
Yeah, you'll be killed.

1149
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,640
Or they will.

1150
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,480
It's really important to play it right.

1151
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,040
There's a lot of ways that this could go bad.

1152
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,120
Hey, I got a Yahoo here I'd love to read.

1153
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,040
It's from Ava Willard.

1154
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,760
Sorry again if I mispronounced that.

1155
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,680
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

1156
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,320
I'm gonna call Sperling who asks,

1157
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
is there a place where I can make my own sandwich?

1158
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,520
Not the house because if you say the house every year

1159
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,160
as funny as every Yahoo Answers user on this page.

1160
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,600
Travis, go ahead and say what you're gonna say.

1161
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,840
No, go ahead and say what you're gonna say.

1162
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,360
No, I was going to say I assume you mean like a restaurant.

1163
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,360
Yes, a restaurant where you can go and grab what you want.

1164
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,120
Nobody else has to touch it.

1165
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,640
I have eaten at Subway maybe twice since the day

1166
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,480
that I saw somebody cut their hand open

1167
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,680
while making me a sandwich.

1168
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,800
I saw that and I said,

1169
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,040
I don't think I can come here as often as I do.

1170
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,320
This person wants a place where they're in,

1171
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,640
they want a place where they're in control.

1172
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,840
They want a Dugway for Dugs to get together

1173
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,920
and make their own damn sandwiches.

1174
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,760
Where they can be the sandwich artist.

1175
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,480
Exactly.

1176
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,120
Let me eat a sandwich that's like a paint by numbers place,

1177
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,040
like a wine and paint place.

1178
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,480
Just let me grab the meat with my own hand.

1179
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,240
My initial instinct to this was to say,

1180
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,880
no, there are no restaurants

1181
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,560
where you can make your own sandwich.

1182
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,800
And then it occurred to me, I've never asked.

1183
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,760
I think if I'm like, hey, just leave the pylons there

1184
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,480
on the bar and let me take a spin on this one.

1185
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,640
I'm something of a budding,

1186
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,640
I'm an outsider sandwich artist

1187
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,280
and I feel like I got a new style that could bring to it.

1188
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,600
I'm the E.E. Cummings of sandwich artistry.

1189
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,100
Sure.

1190
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,640
When I was in high school,

1191
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,560
I was shown in a science class the film,

1192
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,760
The Andromeda Strain,

1193
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,560
the Michael Crichton adaptation, The Andromeda Strain.

1194
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,320
And there's a lot from that movie that's very like,

1195
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,280
it's a good flick,

1196
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
a lot of stuff that still stands out in my mind from that.

1197
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,040
One time I watched it, you know, 13 years ago

1198
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,640
and the thing that sticks out the most

1199
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,400
is when they're going into the compound

1200
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,520
where they're gonna study this virus that's ravaging the world,

1201
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
they have to pass through this chamber

1202
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,560
and they walk through this like fluid that covers their legs

1203
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,080
and then there are these bright lights

1204
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,200
that flash them with this super bright, hot burst of heat

1205
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,280
that hits them very, very fast and hot

1206
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,440
and it burns off like the top layer of their skin

1207
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,040
just like instantly and painlessly

1208
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,360
so that they're fully, fully clean.

1209
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,200
And I'm gonna need one of those in the entrance

1210
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,320
to every Dugway

1211
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,320
if we're gonna be handling big piles of lunch meats together.

1212
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,560
I'm gonna need everybody to lose a layer

1213
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,800
and then go on, they'll have to be nude

1214
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,160
and they lose a layer of the skin

1215
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,120
and then you get your clothes back

1216
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,040
and this is what the sandwich artists will be doing

1217
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,200
is they'll be like facilitating this process

1218
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,400
so we don't lose any jobs.

1219
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,480
I like that part.

1220
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,680
As a concerned citizen,

1221
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,840
I love that we're not losing any American jobs.

1222
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,840
My favorite part is when we burn all the skin off

1223
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,320
so I don't have to touch anybody else's sin.

1224
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,440
Somebody just came from their secret basement bathroom.

1225
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,240
I don't wanna be the next one to make a roast beef.

1226
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:08,880
You know what I mean?

1227
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,760
Can we get a vending machine?

1228
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,720
Some sort of, or individually wrapped sort of slices.

1229
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,720
Maybe there's other solutions other than burning all the skin.

1230
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,160
Here's the thing.

1231
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,320
I was gonna give this a hard time of like,

1232
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,880
just make it at home.

1233
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,200
But I know, I realize, I know Griffin, I know.

1234
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,640
But then I also realized that there are restaurants

1235
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,960
that you go to where you buy an uncooked pizza

1236
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,280
to take it home and make it yourself.

1237
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,200
That's right, we discovered this, this territory.

1238
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,080
So this has to exist of like, here's the bread.

1239
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,640
Here is, I don't know, different forms of greens.

1240
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,520
Here is some meat options and we'll look the other way.

1241
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,360
It's just the one you've made the most already of.

1242
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,240
Did that sentence get across the point I wanted?

1243
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,120
I'm not sure.

1244
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,680
A sandwich is, of all the things you've made

1245
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,320
for yourself already of, sandwiches number one for sure.

1246
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,360
If I go to like a Korean barbecue place,

1247
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,400
it's exciting for me.

1248
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,840
I'm preparing my own sort of meal experience

1249
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,880
and it's exciting for me

1250
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,800
because I don't make Korean barbecue all the time.

1251
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,560
I'm still throwing down three, four sandwiches a week.

1252
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,280
And so I don't know that it's that,

1253
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,080
it's exciting for me to do this.

1254
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,520
And maybe it's a bad idea.

1255
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,640
I know we don't usually put those up.

1256
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,440
Usually we're just putting up solid gold basketball shots,

1257
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,160
but this one seems like it may actually be quite bad.

1258
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,960
I will say I'm afraid to dagwood at home.

1259
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,440
Oh God, that's what it is.

1260
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,040
But I could dagwood somewhere where people might be like,

1261
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,640
I'm impressed, right?

1262
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,680
And like, that's why I could see this being like,

1263
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,240
can you make a sandwich we've never seen before?

1264
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,280
Get your name on the wall, like with a photograph.

1265
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,880
That kind of thing I'd be down with.

1266
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,120
There's some dissonance there.

1267
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,160
If I see the orange cat Garfield

1268
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,160
or Travis's friend dagwood make a tall sandwich

1269
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,240
and then eat it every time I see one of those

1270
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,240
on the printed page of my Sunday Funnies,

1271
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,880
I think, damn, that looks good.

1272
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,280
If I was confronted with a nine inch tall or bigger,

1273
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,760
a 14 inch tall ham sandwich that was just piles of meat,

1274
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,960
I would see that and say, that seems quite unappetizing.

1275
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,280
That seems like a lot of ham to get through.

1276
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,720
The thing that's always bothered me

1277
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,800
about those cartoon strip sandwiches, by the way,

1278
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,120
there's always like a chicken leg or something on there

1279
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,320
and there's a bone in there.

1280
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,280
There is a bone in that.

1281
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,320
I can't chomp through that.

1282
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,920
Maybe Garfield can with his powerful jaws.

1283
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,280
What are you thinking?

1284
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,240
And there's always like a toothpick with an olive on top.

1285
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,880
You can't eat that toothpick.

1286
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,800
That's gonna hurt your intestines.

1287
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,080
Not for cats.

1288
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,800
Yeah, Justin, you like sandwich?

1289
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,280
Yeah, I love a good sandwich.

1290
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,720
I'm pretty much kind of just a meat and potatoes sort of guy.

1291
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,040
All right.

1292
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,720
You put meat and potatoes on your sandwich?

1293
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,560
I just kind of felt like you were letting me and Trav

1294
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,080
handle most of the legwork on this one.

1295
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,440
I thought maybe you don't like a sandwich.

1296
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,360
I wrote like a third of the show earlier,

1297
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,080
so I was kind of toasting.

1298
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,800
I heard that bit.

1299
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,520
I heard that bit.

1300
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,720
I was just toasting a little bit.

1301
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,320
Can maybe say like one, like contribute.

1302
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,520
Maybe like help, like build the bit like with one.

1303
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,920
If you weren't paying attention,

1304
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,720
I suggested like we burn everyone's skin off who goes in.

1305
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,480
Travis is like, we can make tall sandwiches.

1306
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,640
So if you want to like get a hand on the ball, what would it say?

1307
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,160
Yeah, I got a bit that I've been working on.

1308
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,680
It's where I mean kind of lead up to it.

1309
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,000
Yeah, but just say, I'll be like, give me the rock.

1310
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,600
And Travis, you say like, here's the rock.

1311
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,120
Okay, give me the rock.

1312
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,080
Oh, here's the rock.

1313
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,680
Thanks for listening to our show this week.

1314
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,040
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1315
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,400
This is the end of the show that we've worked so hard on for you.

1316
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,600
There's a new episode of Till Death Do Us Blart,

1317
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,200
a podcast we create with Tim and Guy

1318
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,960
from The Worst Idea of All Time,

1319
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,760
which excitingly is heading into its fourth season.

1320
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,240
You can hear all about that on this new episode

1321
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,280
of Till Death Do Us Blart.

1322
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,240
But if you never listened, Blart's a,

1323
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,000
Death Blart, as we've come to call it,

1324
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,920
is an annual review of Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

1325
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,360
hosted by us and Tim and Guy.

1326
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,080
And it is a show that will last forever

1327
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,640
because we have selected who will take our place

1328
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,400
if we are unable to fulfill our roles.

1329
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,760
And this is our fourth year watching it.

1330
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,920
And folks, it isn't getting better.

1331
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,600
It is for me.

1332
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,160
It is for me.

1333
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,200
The show's getting better.

1334
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,480
The movie's getting better for some of us.

1335
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,320
Our enjoyment of it is not.

1336
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,680
So find that wherever podcasts are right now.

1337
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,120
I will also say, well, you're going to be in Austin

1338
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,160
and Denver next week.

1339
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,840
So if you are going to be at those shows-

1340
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,600
This week, the current week you're hearing this.

1341
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,720
Yes, if you're going to be at those shows,

1342
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,880
send your questions in ahead of time.

1343
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,120
Put Austin or Denver.

1344
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,800
And just quick clarification,

1345
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,440
because I know we now do this in the audience portion.

1346
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,760
This is just for that live first half where we read them

1347
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
and you don't have to stand up and read it.

1348
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,080
Yes.

1349
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,920
So if you have one of those questions,

1350
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,360
email it to us with Austin or Denver in the subject line,

1351
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,120
depending on which show you're going to be at.

1352
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,960
Yahoo's too, please.

1353
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,040
So thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1354
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,640
for the East 4 theme song, It's a Departure,

1355
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,400
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1356
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,440
It's a very, very good album and good dude.

1357
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,840
And also thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1358
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,880
You can go to MaximumFun.org.

1359
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,400
Check out all the great shows there.

1360
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,600
Shows like Story Break and Switchblade Sisters

1361
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,600
and Jordan, Jesse Go, and so many more, MaximumFun.org.

1362
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,880
I want to do a quick plug.

1363
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,320
We just put up a bunch of new holiday merchandise

1364
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,200
in our store, McElroy Merch.

1365
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,240
McElroyMerch.com.

1366
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,000
We have ornaments for the Adventure Zone,

1367
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,440
My Brother, My Brother, Me and Sawbones.

1368
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,720
We have a What's Up, You Cool Baby decal.

1369
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,280
Just went up.

1370
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,200
We have a new entry in our line of podcast merchandise.

1371
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,440
It's a cross stitch that says,

1372
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,960
In this house, we don't say happy holidays,

1373
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,320
we say podcasts.

1374
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
We have a Joyce Candle Nights pin.

1375
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,640
Of course, all the normal great stuff that's in there.

1376
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,200
So please go to McElroyMerch.com

1377
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,680
and buy those things.

1378
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,920
That candlelight spin is only up for this month,

1379
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,600
so don't sleep.

1380
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,880
You only got a few more days.

1381
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,040
Also, just real quick, we've got a mailing list,

1382
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,160
a mailer that goes out.

1383
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,840
You can sign up for it at bit.ly slash McElroy Mail.

1384
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,920
It is not a pyramid scheme.

1385
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,360
I think maybe that got printed in The Times.

1386
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,960
I'm not sure where that's coming from,

1387
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,240
but that is incorrect.

Where'd it go?

1396
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,200
Oh, it's hiding on the other monitor.

00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,240
You sneak thief.

1398
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,360
It's there and something went wrong.

Ah, no, fuck it.

00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,440
