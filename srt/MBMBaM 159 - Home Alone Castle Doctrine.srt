1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,520
Just jumped right into it, huh? I'm just getting right to it. I'm very excited.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And I'm Edward Snowden.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,880
Oh, so many, so many problems.

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,400
I want to thank, I want to thank My Brother, My Brother, and Me for granting me a shalom.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,240
I have looked long and hard, and finally I found a new place to make a home.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,360
Now, not a lot of people know this, but Edward Snowden is the ghost of

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,840
a Victorian-era matchstick girl. No, I am a hacker, and I possess mini secrets.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Is this, now can I ask, is this actually you talking to us, or is this some sort of

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,400
artificial intelligence subroutine that you have programmed to make comedy jokes?

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,480
This, I have not finished my relocation. This is my shalom hologram.

16
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,960
Okay.

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,080
I will be joining you soon in a shalom.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,840
Can you, can you tell us where your physical presence, your body, your form,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
your ectoplasm, where is it at right now?

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,680
Abs, absolutely not. I cannot grant you that. I do appreciate the podcast, a shalom,

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,160
but I unfortunately cannot divulge the specific Denny's that I am hiding under a table.

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,400
Note, note that it is a Denny's. I am under a table. There's room for my secrets,

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
and me, and the Grand Slam.

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,080
Now, are you-

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,600
So there's room for your secrets?

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,320
I know my secrets.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,720
Are you-

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
Uncle Sham, you've been naughty.

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,840
Can you even get like the kind of high bandwidth internet access that you need

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
to project a Snowden hologram?

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,920
I have, I have Ishanet, yes.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,160
Okay.

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,400
It's plugged in from the table. It's complimentary with every Grand Slam.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
They also have given me a bib.

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
I have never been offered either of those things at a Denny's.

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
Well, you've never revealed Uncle Sham's secrets, have you?

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
Oh, yeah. They are not big fans of Prism at Denny's, because they have, they got some shit

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,080
that they don't, you can't work at Denny's unless you've got some shit in the closet.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,400
They are all, Denny's is run by libertarian, like really hardcore libertarians.

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Sure.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
They want all the secrets out, and Snowden has them all.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,520
That was, I believe it was Dennis Cromwell, who, who the founder of Denny's,

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,760
who just hated just Uncle Sam's watching over him, watching over his secret, his buried gold.

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,920
That's how he earned the title, Dennis the Annoyance.

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,040
And we feel like they really missed an opportunity there,

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
but they're pretty set in stone on that name.

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
I want to shank you gentlemen again.

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,800
You want to shank us?

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Jesus Christ, no.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm sorry. I do not mean, I meant, of course, to thank you.

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,520
Do you have a lisp or an aphasia?

52
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,760
Because you keep, you keep dropping on things that aren't S's.

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,120
I'd love to tell you that, but unfortunately it's one of my secrets.

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,040
Once I'm there, I'll give them all a little vogue.

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
Okay. Okay.

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,200
Well, thank you.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,960
I can't wait to, I wish Justin was, I'll be honest, Edward,

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,240
I wish Justin was here and not, not you, just because.

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
Well, that's fine.

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,800
Listen, he's here at the Denny's with me under a table.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
I'll pass him the microphone.

63
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,200
How big is this table that I can fit?

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
Stare at him.

65
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,800
It's one of my secrets.

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,280
Okay.

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,480
And I'll stare at him as he records the comedy.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,320
That's going to be very, very distracting.

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,840
This is my home, I feel I should become acclimated with your waves.

70
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,720
Okay.

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
Well, again, thanks for joining us.

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
I hope that this doesn't get us in any more legal hot water.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,760
Of course, it's been my pleasure.

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,040
Okay.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Hey guys.

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,960
Hey Justin.

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,360
Hi Justin.

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,640
Hey, can Snowden hear you right now?

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,680
Can he hear us?

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,520
He's literally two inches from my face.

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,200
Can he hear me or do you have headphones on?

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,080
Let's, I do have headphones and he's just that close.

84
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,880
Let's just.

85
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
I need you to ditch him.

86
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
No, don't ditch him.

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Here's a, he's got a pretty huge bounty on his head

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
and we could really, really, really use the money.

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,600
But we, but guys, we, we granted him asylum, asylum.

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,840
Right.

91
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,640
But the thing is that we're not a fucking country.

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,480
So like, we can't actually do that.

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,160
We can't actually.

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,800
He just walked into the door and yelled sanctuary.

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,280
Right.

96
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
And that's not the same thing.

97
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,760
Well, it is in a Denny's, but, but we, I have, I have no allegiance to this fool

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,720
because I, I love prism, I love it so much.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,840
I want to know what everybody's doing all the time.

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,320
Exactly.

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
I should introduce myself, by the way.

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

103
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
We've helped Edward Snowden and I think now we should help someone else.

104
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,840
It's only fair.

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,760
Anyone ever get him confused with the vampire guy from the Twilight movies?

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,720
Only constantly.

107
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
I hate talking on the phone.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
I can barely understand people and I don't like having to stop whatever I'm doing to

109
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,240
have a conversation.

110
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
So I've developed a policy.

111
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,200
I don't answer the phone unless someone calls multiple times.

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
So it's probably an emergency.

113
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,560
Or if they text me beforehand to ask if I'm free to talk.

114
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,360
If they leave a message, I will usually respond via email.

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
If text, if possible.

116
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,720
My question is there a way to explain this policy in my voicemail message, I like people

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
to know I'm not answering, but I don't want to sound like a jerk.

118
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,320
And that's from phone phobic.

119
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,080
Oh, oh, there's an intrinsic problem there, though.

120
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,800
I say this and with all the love in my heart, you are kind of you're kind of being a jerk

121
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,440
a little bit.

122
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,520
Like, I wish there was a loophole, too, because I despise talking on the phone immensely.

123
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,040
I don't care who's calling.

124
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,400
I don't care what the context is.

125
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,480
I despise talking on the phone.

126
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,120
Always, constantly, I'm starting to get the feeling that that's like 80 percent of the

127
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,400
population of the earth.

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,000
Like, I'm sure there are people that love just chatting away for hours, but I don't

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,960
know any of them.

130
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,840
And so my there you might know them as women.

131
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Oh, come on, what's up?

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
I have actually I've reversed my position because I used to be on that side.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,480
But now, like the inefficiency of SMS, like, drives me up a fucking wall because it's like

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,080
what what should I bring to the potluck?

135
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,840
Wait 10 minutes.

136
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,800
I don't know, whatever.

137
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,880
A grain and then send it back like literally 30 seconds later.

138
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,320
Like, can you be more specific about what kind of grain you want me to bring in gluten

139
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,720
free?

140
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
Wait 10 more minutes.

141
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,040
And then it's like couscous.

142
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,280
And it's like, I don't think is couscous even a grain.

143
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,400
And then you have to wait 10 minutes.

144
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,840
And like, get me on the phone and I'll knock out this couscous discussion like super fast,

145
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,560
super quickly.

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,440
I think the problem here at question asker is that there is no way to frame this without

147
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,280
it sounding like you're screening because you are definitely because and that's why

148
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,360
you're afraid of sounding like a jerk because it is is a jerky move that you're saying.

149
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,280
Like, if it is important enough, then I will deign to speak to you.

150
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,960
Otherwise, I will respond in written communication so as not to waste my time.

151
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,320
This is just like anything else.

152
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,800
Like, yeah, you can build these walls, but don't expect it to not have a detrimental

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
effect on your relationships.

154
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,320
I mean, it yeah, absolutely, like, but I understand the impulse.

155
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,840
But these kinds of human interactions are sort of the the toll you pay.

156
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,720
They're the building blocks of relationships.

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,040
That was the most sociopathic thing I think you've ever said.

158
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,600
Sorry.

159
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,080
I mean, this is human talking to other humans is the toll you pay to live.

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,560
Like, what?

161
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,120
I get what you're saying, because this is what leads people to like when it's like,

162
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
hey, let's all hang out tonight.

163
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
Oh, give Tommy a call.

164
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,320
Oh, no, Tommy never wants to do anything because you don't answer the phone and like,

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,040
talk to people.

166
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Like, this is how you start to like surgically cut yourself out of people's lives.

167
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
And it's it's not really cool.

168
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
It's a slippery slip.

169
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,720
That's all.

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,200
I mean, I yeah, you can cut this off and then people just stop calling and then it's

171
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
like hermit in your full.

172
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,360
Also, there's no way that you can make your voicemail message something that explanatory

173
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
and still keep it like fresh and poppy and fun.

174
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,960
You know what I mean?

175
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,160
Dave, thanks for calling me.

176
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
I didn't answer because I probably don't like you.

177
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,280
No, but it's like, how can you leave like your catchphrase like a joking catchphrase

178
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,760
on your foot?

179
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Like a socket to me or like answering on the flip flop.

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,640
Hey, hey, Meryl Streep.

181
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,240
Leave it at the beep and then wait and then I'll leave it at the beat.

182
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,040
I want to just I wish there was a technological way for me to have my voicemail just be like

183
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
answering machine messages from the 80s.

184
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,400
There should be a great website for that where you can just import those because some of

185
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,960
those were great.

186
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,480
We had a tape of them, of all these classic great bits.

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
I think there was a guy pretending to be Barney Fife.

188
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,520
I'd love to get that as a voicemail.

189
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,280
Shit, we should just cancel the podcast.

190
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,360
Just release those over.

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,600
Just release those as our podcast.

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
You know that West Virginia just instituted a law.

193
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Travis, I should have warned you.

194
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,160
Well, I guess you didn't come to West Virginia, so you're fine.

195
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,360
West Virginia just instituted a law on July 1st that you can't talk on the phone while

196
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,840
you're driving.

197
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,040
It's actually a primary offense.

198
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,400
You can get pulled over for that, so maybe you could always pretend like you were driving

199
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,160
or you could always be driving.

200
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
Well, then people are going to start to think like you're a truck driver.

201
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,560
Maybe you are.

202
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
Maybe that's your escape.

203
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
You know, no, I can't hang out with you tonight.

204
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm shipping a hollow NyQuil through Northeastern Oklahoma.

205
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm deep in a convoy right now.

206
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,760
I can't break out of here.

207
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
I'm fucking and fucking.

208
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,960
Listen, I'm on a mountain of meth, and I'm not going to come down for 18 to 19 hours,

209
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,800
so I can't waste that high on going to go see Iron Man 3 with you.

210
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,320
You could just start answering the phone saying, ask acid grass, nobody rides for free,

211
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,080
and then people will be like, I can't give you any of those things over the phone.

212
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,920
I guess I can PayPal you, but then I can't ass or grass you that way.

213
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
I can't send you ass through PayPal, sadly.

214
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,960
How about it, technology?

215
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,080
Hey, pay.

216
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,560
Hey, Griffin, do you have any Yahoo?

217
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,760
Yeah, just as soon as I think of a fun name for what PayPal would be called for.

218
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,760
OK, let's just take a second and let's see what we can come up with.

219
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
PayPal with benefits.

220
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,520
That's pretty good.

221
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,800
There you go.

222
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,800
This Yahoo answer.

223
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
Thank you, by the way, everybody who sent in Yahoo answers.

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,880
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Julie Kin.

225
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,520
Thank you, Julie.

226
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jamie, I Jamie.

227
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:00,400
Jesus, Ricky, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

228
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,040
Shameless.

229
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,240
Jamie is who asks.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
How to cheaply catch a thief cheaply?

231
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,400
Need some clever ideas about how to catch someone stealing from a walk in cupboard.

232
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,960
Only person going in there for this would be the thief, but pretty sure traps are illegal.

233
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,360
Need something cheap as we're poor, lol.

234
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,760
Thanks.

235
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,680
Hold on.

236
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,640
OK, wait, hold on.

237
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,560
I don't understand the parameters of this question.

238
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
Are you telling me you have a cupboard that exists solely to be burgled?

239
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,000
Is that what you're telling me?

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,080
But no one walks in except the thief.

241
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,120
It seems like the best trap then would be to watch and see who walks in.

242
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,520
I think this person is saying this cupboard has has been so thoroughly burgled

243
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:46,080
that they are willing to change it into a fucking reverse panic room.

244
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,800
That is just burglable.

245
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,440
If you think about it, this room is just full of chalices.

246
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,960
If you think about it, prisons are all reverse panic rooms

247
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,040
because it just puts the danger inside and then everything else is safe.

248
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,240
That is what this person is talking about.

249
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,920
They're pulling a reverse Jodie Foster, which is also my favorite sexual position.

250
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
I feel like we played enough like Sega CD FMV games

251
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,000
that we should be able to answer this question.

252
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
I think there needs to be a lever on the wall that you pull and the floor drops out.

253
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,240
What Sega CD FMV games are you talking about other than Night Trap?

254
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,320
He's talking about Double Switch also.

255
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Wasn't there one called Maniac Mansion too?

256
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
Maniac Mansion was something completely different.

257
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,720
That was an adventure game.

258
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,680
Anyway, lots of great references.

259
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,680
Keep your Sega CD in there and then you notice it's missing.

260
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,280
The only person you're going to catch in that fucking honeypot is Justin McElroy.

261
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,320
Oopsie daisy.

262
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
Where is this cupboard, by the way?

263
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,200
The imaginary cupboard I invented.

264
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,120
Gotta get over there.

265
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,920
This person is probably right in that traps are illegal.

266
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,520
You watch Home Alone and everyone has a good time and a good laugh.

267
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,560
They get hit with a paint bucket.

268
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,120
They get electrocuted with an amount of voltage that would kill a fucking elephant.

269
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,600
And we all have a good time and we all have a good laugh.

270
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,080
But that shit that that little kid pulls is wicked illegal, right?

271
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,240
I mean, the thing about-

272
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,640
Hold on.

273
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,080
You think the Sticky Bandits are going to take him to court and be like,

274
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm suffering serious trauma?

275
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,440
I think the Sticky Bandits would have a fucking great case against that kid.

276
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,160
Yeah, absolutely.

277
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,640
They set his head on fire.

278
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,680
Now here's the thing about it though-

279
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,520
But they were going in to kill him.

280
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
Okay, it depends on what you're talking about.

282
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,160
If you're talking about Home Alone 1,

283
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,720
I think that the people versus Kevin McAllister is going to be very weak because Kevin is-

284
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,160
Justin, I hate to interrupt, but I think you mean the Bandits versus Kevin McAllister

285
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,080
because I don't think the people of the city have banded together to support-

286
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,640
No, no.

287
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,000
They're going to be a criminal trial first and then-

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
Take it to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

289
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,720
Okay.

290
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,160
Yeah, so anyway, in Home Alone 1, people versus Kevin McAllister is going to be very weak

291
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,560
because Kevin McAllister was defending his home and absolutely the impetus, I think,

292
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,120
is on him to defend that in any way he sees fit.

293
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,160
He could have killed them.

294
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,640
Oh, you're saying-

295
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,200
He could have shot them with a shotgun.

296
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,640
Chicago, as we all know, the castle doctrine is very much in play in Illinois.

297
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,440
Yeah, absolutely.

298
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,280
He has unlimited power, unlimited lethal power.

299
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,280
Problematically, though, in Home Alone 2, your case, if you're Kevin McAllister,

300
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,440
is going to get very weak because you have sadistically, I would say,

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,200
lured these men into your trap of hurting and just to defend a toy store, pretty much.

302
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,920
He could have called Lamp up in that hotel, had Tim Curry bringing him waffles.

303
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,720
Now, it's been a while since I saw the movie, but isn't his final trap house,

304
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
isn't that like his uncle's house?

305
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,320
Or it's a relative's house of some sort, right?

306
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,880
And that's how he's-

307
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
It's his uncle's house.

308
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,280
That's what's fucked up is that it's his uncle's house.

309
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
They're rebuilding it.

310
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,640
They're remodeling it.

311
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,320
So if those fucking guys hadn't come that night, there would have been a score of contractors

312
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,680
who would have perished at this little kid's hands.

313
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,480
Right? There is almost certainly more trap.

314
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,400
There's no way he hit them all.

315
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Those contractors are going in the next morning like,

316
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,680
why is this knob sticky?

317
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,960
Ah, electricity.

318
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,160
I wish that the whole second movie was just spent with Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci screaming,

319
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
what are the odds?

320
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,880
How could this happen again?

321
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,400
Twice?

322
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,800
Twice?

323
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,360
Really?

324
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,320
Is anything-

325
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,960
We went to the biggest city in America.

326
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,280
And we ran into the same 10-year-old.

327
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:55,200
Are you also telling me that like, job one, once you get out of prison for being the wet bandits,

328
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,680
job one isn't, listen, we've got to start carrying guns.

329
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,720
We just have to buy a gun and use it on a child.

330
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
We see a child and he's got a trap.

331
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,040
We just gotta shoot him.

332
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,440
Shoot the child.

333
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,800
I know it's hard.

334
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,160
Many of the traps are automated, I'm sure, but most of them are being deployed by the child on us.

335
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,280
And if the child is dead, we have nothing to fear.

336
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,040
We don't even have to pursue him anymore.

337
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,400
We just move on.

338
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,920
We don't even have to worry about fucking Brenda Fricker launching palm after palm of bird feed

339
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,800
at us to attack us with her army of birds.

340
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
She's like, fly my children at bam bam.

341
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
Oh no.

342
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,240
You know, we give him a lot of credit for being sort of a master strategist.

343
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,440
But if your end game relies on the possibility that an old woman is gonna throw seeds at your assailants,

344
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,680
you do not have a strong plan.

345
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,680
You know, you've actually just made me realize, in both movies, he would be dead if it were not

346
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,960
for the creepy old people that he encountered along the way.

347
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,520
For elderly intervention.

348
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,960
Yeah, no question about it.

349
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,680
Oh wow.

350
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,200
You think old people aren't worth anything anymore, but.

351
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
How scary is Brenda Fricker in that movie?

352
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,760
So scary.

353
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,320
Is there anything scarier than her in that movie?

354
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,680
I don't understand how she did that movie in that movie.

355
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,400
Tim Curry's not.

356
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
Yeah, yeah, he's pretty scary.

357
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,720
You know what's scary?

358
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,760
I'll tell you what's scary.

359
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:29,680
Timeline wise, the wet bandits have been in prison for about 12 months for home invasion

360
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,080
and like trying to kill a child.

361
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,320
They were put in prison for, let's say a year.

362
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,720
They escaped, don't they?

363
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,920
They're escapists.

364
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
Yeah, they escaped.

365
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
They dig out of the ground.

366
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,800
They escaped from prison.

367
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,240
They can't escape a 10 year old child with paint cans on strings, but they've escaped.

368
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,720
Well, that was the, that was the, they got sent to a prison run by devious conniving

369
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,080
little kids who just, who it was, it was just an open field with hanging paint cans suspended.

370
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,400
It was like, it was like the open prisons of Siberia.

371
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,520
It's actually really troubling that the two elder, the elderly interventions in Home Alone

372
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,600
one and two, I, I refuse to acknowledge the existence of three and four.

373
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,920
The, the elderly, elderly interventionists in one and two actually send a really confusing

374
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,280
message to America's kids because what it says is, you know what we've been telling

375
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,800
you about strangers.

376
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,600
That's true.

377
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,240
But if they look really creepy and are homeless, that's the thing.

378
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,160
Yeah, there is a chance that they might be cool and protect you and will only do so if

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,280
you interact with them.

380
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,760
So maybe by interacting with strangers, you're not putting yourself up for danger.

381
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,320
You're actually making an investment in your future state.

382
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,520
I think that had they gotten to a third movie with Macaulay Culkin, with Macaulay Culkin,

383
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,200
canonical third movie, then the stranger he met would be like covered in blood and like

384
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,080
wielding a knife.

385
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,560
But turns out he's just a butcher because like in the first one, he's not homeless.

386
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,360
He owns a home.

387
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,440
He's just a dude that like salts the sidewalk and that's and everyone's like, oh, he's

388
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,160
a murderer.

389
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,120
Yeah, because he's got a shovel and he's old.

390
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,240
Kids, great job.

391
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,520
Kids are so cruel.

392
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,520
And you're 10 years old and some sort of choice is presented to you where you have to choose

393
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,120
between Joe Pesci or Brenda Fricker and one of them is going to murder you and the other

394
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,440
one is going to provide you is going to is going to provide you sanctuary.

395
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,640
And you have to make this choice between Pesci or Fricker.

396
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,000
One of these is going to murder.

397
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,480
Which one?

398
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,040
Which one would you choose?

399
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,400
It would obviously be Fricker.

400
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,840
She would eat you.

401
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah.

402
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,840
No question about it.

403
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,640
Now, how sweet would it be, though, Travis?

404
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,320
You know what you're suggesting about the old the crazy old person turning out to be

405
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,680
genuinely crazy.

406
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:57,040
How sweet would it have been for Home Alone 3 if the threat turns out to be so real that

407
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:04,960
Macaulay Culkin has to team up with what would they be at that the the slippery bandits, the

408
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,000
moist bandits, the tactile bandits, the tacky bandits, the scratchy bandits, the goopy bandits,

409
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
whatever they are.

410
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,520
He has to team up with them to defeat this larger threat.

411
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,120
Like, I would watch the hell out of that movie.

412
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,000
Are you kidding me?

413
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,040
And then they turn on each other, match.

414
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,480
I think they have guns this time.

415
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,000
I think Home Alone 3 is actually technically the last 45 minutes of Skyfall.

416
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,120
Let's move on.

417
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,120
How do I gently bring up the issue of my sister leaving her hair in brushes?

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,480
We're a family that has a bunch of hair brushes and no one claims particular ownership over

419
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,160
any brush.

420
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,240
It's a communist hairbrush society.

421
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah, me and my sister.

422
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm a guy, by the way.

423
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,880
We both use the same too.

424
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,960
But every other day I see a big old mess of red hair on the brush and I have to take it

425
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,920
out myself.

426
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,840
I don't want to piss off my sister and otherwise irker as I think outright saying,

427
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,240
hey, don't be so gross and clean up.

428
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,200
Would piss her off.

429
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Would piss her off.

430
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
That's from Hair Horror in Her Majesty's England.

431
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,680
Boy, it's a shame that Christmas has already passed because if only there was some way

432
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,160
for you to secure your own private hairbrush.

433
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,000
Fuck, but this question is it sounds like they have ample brushes for everybody to have

434
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,800
their own brush.

435
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,080
This person doesn't need another brush.

436
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
They need a fucking six dollar labeling machine that they buy at Walgreens.

437
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,840
Especially when you have two brushes shared between two people.

438
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
Tiffy up the brushes.

439
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
This is not like a Solomon-esque like split the brush in half.

440
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
Everybody gets half a brush.

441
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,200
Oh, I got the handle end.

442
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,120
I can't do anything with this unless I want to curl it, I guess.

443
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,080
But this isn't a known issue, though.

444
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:54,720
I would say that like, so my wife will take a hairbrush that I have and it's like put

445
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,800
it somewhere, I don't know, wherever she dries her hair, which could be in different rooms.

446
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,400
I don't know where she's going to do her hair.

447
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
And then I have to go find my brush and then I'll buy a new brush and think, well, this

448
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,560
one will be Justin's private brush.

449
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,920
And then no matter what, it somehow slips into the cogs of that machine and it becomes

450
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,720
her brush again.

451
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,600
And it's a vicious cycle.

452
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,680
I don't know why she likes to appropriate my brushes.

453
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,600
What you have to do is you have to put your brush in a special drawer and then in front

454
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,360
of that drawer, spread out some micro machines and some Christmas ornaments.

455
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,200
That would just make her want it all the more, though.

456
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Yeah.

457
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,440
Also, we would be creating a home alone forever scenario because Sydney would leave Justin.

458
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,480
Home alonist.

459
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,040
Oh, here's a solution question asker.

460
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,360
And it's going to be gross at first, but stick with me.

461
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,920
Collect the hair and then give her a sweater knit out of her own hair and that'll teach

462
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,400
her.

463
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,840
Teach her that you're a psychopath.

464
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,800
You could make a new sister out of that hair, a politer sister.

465
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,280
This is my new politer sister.

466
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,320
This is my new polite sister.

467
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,200
Watch what she does.

468
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
And then you move her hair hand onto the brush.

469
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:16,160
Although I do think that it is going to be really hard for you to make a case for you

470
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,800
finding your sister's hair gross when you spend literally every waking hour sculpting

471
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,840
it into a new human.

472
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,160
Yeah, creating a hair golem.

473
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,800
I think you run a real risk of Stockholm syndrome setting in with that hair.

474
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,360
Where you become obsessed with it and everybody hates you.

475
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,840
This is the dumbest.

476
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,440
Just buy a new fucking brush and put a new brush and keep it secret.

477
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,680
What if she catches you though?

478
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,960
Like, what the fuck?

479
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,600
What is that?

480
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,400
What is this?

481
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,920
I thought we were cool.

482
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,040
That brush looks so dope.

483
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,240
I want to put my hair in it.

484
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,440
Ah, damn it.

485
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
Then you just got to let it go and buy another brush.

486
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,640
And then eventually your parents are like, what is up with all these brush receipts?

487
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,920
Oh, and then you say, oh, I can't use any other brush.

488
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,120
This brush is prescription.

489
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,640
Ah, can you invent a prescription brush that you need for your dandruff?

490
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,240
Can you just have psoriasis and say it's contagious?

491
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,880
What about lice?

492
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,640
Are you saying fake lice or catch lice?

493
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
Well, now presented the option.

494
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,720
I'm going to go with fake.

495
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,280
Go down to your local kindergarten and rub your head on every head in the building.

496
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,120
Hey, and then you'll have a private brush that can't go within 300 yards.

497
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,560
Because you'll be in prison.

498
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,040
Hey, pubes.

499
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,000
Pubes suggestion.

500
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,440
All right.

501
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,000
That's all.

502
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,520
That's as far as the thought got.

503
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:39,840
All right.

504
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,560
That's the whole thing.

505
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm just saying if you don't use that brush.

506
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,160
Yeah, that's it.

507
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,280
That one's for pubes.

508
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,160
That one's for pubes.

509
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,360
That's my downtown brush.

510
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,600
I call that brush sculpty because it helps me sculpt them.

511
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
Into a perfect U.

512
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,200
I mean the letter U.

513
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,560
I'm not making a pubes sister.

514
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,880
Pube sister.

515
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,080
No, no, no, no.

516
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,640
That's not a song.

517
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
That's not a song.

518
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,640
How about a Yahoo answer?

519
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,080
How about a Yahoo?

520
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,960
You think by singing it, you can cataract my singing of the pubes sister theme song jingle?

521
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,120
Yes.

522
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,720
It's my only hope.

523
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,800
This Yahoo is sent in by Andy Hill.

524
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,440
Thank you, Andy.

525
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,280
It's about Yahoo answer user John.

526
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,160
It's going to get gross.

527
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,760
Here it goes.

528
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,000
John asks, detailed how to kiss, please.

529
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,040
Some girls like making out with me, and some say I use too much teeth.

530
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,480
Help me out here, guys.

531
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,280
How should you kiss?

532
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
You shouldn't use your teeth.

533
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,440
Teeth isn't bad.

534
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,320
Well, sometimes you get, you know, if it's getting all.

535
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,120
Of the enunciators, I would say that teeth are the least important in the equation.

536
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,680
And lips and tip of the tongue are probably much better.

537
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,640
Yeah, I don't think he's worried about hitting his hard consonants

538
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
while he's mouth deep.

539
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
Help with my plosives.

540
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,360
Guys, I actually just got a letter from my lawyer.

541
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,440
He says that it would be actually too weird for me to continue to participate

542
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
in this particular conversation.

543
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
I actually just got a letter from my copyright lawyer

544
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,200
who said that if I give away my secrets, I will be infringing on my patents.

545
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,760
Okay, but then let's go off the record here.

546
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,960
Oh, let me turn the chair around, and that officially means we're off the record.

547
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,760
And none of this.

548
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,720
Okay, just to be clear, any kissing secrets I give away here cannot be used professionally.

549
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,680
Do not tweet them.

550
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,320
Do not quote us in your local periodicals.

551
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,880
But we are about to drop some science on you.

552
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,320
Girls love it when you just run your teeth into their teeth.

553
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,600
If there's not a loud click.

554
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,000
I did that a lot in high school, and the girls would be like, ow, what the fuck?

555
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,040
And I'd be like, what's wrong?

556
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,600
Don't you know?

557
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,400
That's how it's good.

558
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,200
That's how it's good.

559
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,240
That's what's good.

560
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,680
That's good now.

561
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
Girls also like it when you sword fight with your tongues.

562
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,480
When you really get in there and Greco-Roman wrestle with that shit.

563
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,640
If you make a mistake and you seem to set them off right, set them off wrong, rather,

564
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:10,320
you need to pretend that it's the way they do it in whatever the next level of education for you is.

565
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,200
So if you're in middle school and your teeth click and they say,

566
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,040
oh, I hate that, you say, well, that's, listen.

567
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,760
This is what they do at the adult learning annex.

568
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,760
This is how they do it in my doctorate program.

569
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,440
So I don't know.

570
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,920
You just need to maybe get a little more mature.

571
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,600
If you do make a mistake, though, the best way to do it is to just lean in real close

572
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,720
to their ear and just go, uh-oh, cheerios.

573
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
Yeah, that's going to really ignite the night.

574
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,240
I think it's really going to set this situation ablaze.

575
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,920
The trick is to be thorough.

576
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:47,680
Like just get your whole mouth in their mouth and just sort of scout around like a surgeon fish.

577
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,400
My number one kissing rule is kiss every tooth.

578
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,520
Kiss every tooth one by one.

579
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:51,920
Let me see that.

580
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,720
Wait, y'all a muller?

581
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,360
And then, and if that starts to get stale, just start going around the face,

582
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,560
go for the eyes, the nose, no holds barred.

583
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,360
Use your nose.

584
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,800
Yeah.

585
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,120
Oh, do Eskimo kisses, butterfly kisses, especially butterfly kisses.

586
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,320
Girls fucking love butterfly kisses.

587
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,920
The oppression of Eskimo and butterfly kisses, they're so highly regimented and they don't

588
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,320
need to be because they're saying like nose on nose is Eskimo, eyelash on cheek is-

589
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Can we say Inuit kisses?

590
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,320
Yeah, sorry.

591
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Then you don't have to follow those rules.

592
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,600
Put your fucking eyelash on their tongue and like just give them some of that for a bit.

593
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,400
Put your nose in their ear?

594
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,760
Yeah, just act like you're a puppy looking for some stray pizza sauce after pizza night.

595
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,520
After pizza Thursdays.

596
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,120
Don't explore their mouth after pizza Thursdays though.

597
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,480
No.

598
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,920
And you know what else girls love?

599
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,880
Women and gentlemen enjoy that before you do anything, you ask, and I mean constantly,

600
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
is it okay if I kiss your eyeball?

601
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
May I kiss your nose?

602
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,480
Do you kiss them?

603
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm gonna look behind your ear for pizza sauce.

604
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,600
Yeah, or just if you're doing the mouth too, just give them like a, can I kiss your mouth?

605
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
No.

606
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,760
Can I kiss your mouth?

607
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,000
Can I kiss your mouth again?

608
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,120
I really like it.

609
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,040
And keep growing in intensity every time you ask.

610
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,920
Can I kiss your mouth?

611
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,760
How about that mouth?

612
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,320
Please.

613
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,960
Can I ask-

614
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,840
Give me that mouth!

615
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,480
How are we going to alert our listeners that it is now safe to walk across the room

616
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,240
and pick up the headphones that they have surely by now cast from the-

617
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,920
I've got like at least three more minutes of snitching tips.

618
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,320
Somewhere there's some dude with a notepad going, ask before you do any of this.

619
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,600
This is good, this is good stuff.

620
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Pizza Thursdays, okay, got it.

621
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,400
This is all good.

622
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay, butterfly kisses.

623
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,280
He is in breach of contract if he's doing that, so I have very little pity.

624
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,680
It is all about feedback.

625
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,800
Because you're worried about what you're doing, they're worried about what they're doing.

626
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,280
So give them like, like when you get a kiss from them, say something like,

627
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
just like mommy and daddy do it.

628
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,800
To just like let them know that they are doing like a perfect job, just like mommy and daddy do it.

629
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,120
This is how I've seen it done in movies.

630
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,400
Can we upside down it like Spider-Man?

631
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,920
Can you give me one Spider-Man?

632
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:26,000
All right, I want to genuinely help people with the only genuinely helpful portion of our program.

633
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,920
Farm wisdom.

634
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,960
Farm wisdom!

635
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,920
Farm wisdom!

636
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,760
Get a pitchfork in your hand, farm wisdom.

637
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,260
Ow!

638
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,800
Like the sharp end or the handle end?

639
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,600
I'm holding it.

640
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,160
Okay.

641
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,640
Oh, okay.

642
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,360
Travis, hit me.

643
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,320
This first one is very special, and it comes from Elizabeth Gilbert.

644
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,560
Just because she's a celeb?

645
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,160
It's special, it's more special than our normal listeners?

646
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,600
Elizabeth Gilbert has had two notable works.

647
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,240
The first, of course, being eat, pray, love, the second being the fact that if a goat eats poison ivy

648
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,920
and you drink the goat's milk, you get poison ivy immunity that she wrote into our show Farm Wisdom.

649
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,200
Thank you, Elizabeth Gilbert.

650
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,760
Now, the only question I have about this, and I'm going to have to do some research,

651
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,480
is if it is you have poison ivy immunity for the rest of your life,

652
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,800
or if you have it for a very brief amount of time, like you have it for like an hour,

653
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,480
and for that hour you need to like-

654
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,120
Just go.

655
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,040
Just go hog wild and just really-

656
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,600
Yeah.

657
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,400
Just tip fate, like rub your balls all over some poison ivy, like not today, poison ivy.

658
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,960
This is gonna be a good afternoon for me.

659
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,080
I wonder if you give the goat regular poison, can you like get like Rasputin?

660
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,400
Or is it whatever the goat eat, like so what if the goat eats paper plates?

661
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,760
Do you get paper plate immunity?

662
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,560
If the goat eats pizza, you can't taste pizza after you drink its milk.

663
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,160
The fate worse than death.

664
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,880
All right.

665
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
If the goat eats a bullet.

666
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,080
Oh, shit.

667
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,440
Think about it.

668
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
If the goat eats a passport, you get diplomatic immunity.

669
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,720
Asshole.

670
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,200
We got another one sent in to us from Senta.

671
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,040
She says, chickens are very stupid, and I wish that was the whole thing,

672
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,920
but when it comes time to gather eggs, you can replace the eggs with golf balls,

673
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,000
and they won't notice anything has changed.

674
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,360
Also, horses run around real fucking crazy right before a thunderstorm.

675
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,480
They just told, all right, Senta, thank you, but you just told us two things

676
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,040
we probably could have sussed out on our own, like yeah, chickens are super dumb.

677
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,880
Also, horses like to roll and run around and frolic and shit.

678
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,560
Horses do that, no, but horses do that in the case that there's a nature photographer there,

679
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,800
because they want to capture like an inspirational pic of a lightning bolt.

680
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,280
Did you get it?

681
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,920
I was blinking.

682
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,560
Okay, hold on.

683
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:48,880
Damn it.

684
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,120
Okay.

685
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,320
I had all three of my feet on the ground.

686
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,640
Let me try one more time.

687
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,600
Also, which fucking farmer Indiana Jones is like,

688
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,800
hold up, let me just do this perfect swap, whoop, got him.

689
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,600
Now, I haven't perturbed-

690
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,160
That's my question.

691
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,360
It's probably because chickens are sitting there thinking, God, farmers are stupid.

692
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,840
Yeah.

693
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,280
They could just take the egg.

694
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,840
Just take it.

695
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,440
It's like, it's my ovum.

696
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,720
I make one every day.

697
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,840
Just take it.

698
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,320
It's uncomfortable in there.

699
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,400
How much money are you spending on golf balls?

700
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,320
Do you have like a permanent one in, one out?

701
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,560
Like if you have like a hearty country breakfast, that's like,

702
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,920
I don't know.

703
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,480
That's like three cases of tidal mints right there.

704
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,560
The only bad thing is if you want to go golf, then you have to go buy a dozen eggs

705
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,920
because you need your balls back.

706
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,520
So you're going to have to swap in some eggs for the golf balls that you left there.

707
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,640
And then that's a vicious cycle.

708
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,800
That would be a much better test of how smart chickens are

709
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,280
if you just swapped an egg for a different egg

710
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,760
and just see if the chicken goes like, hey, hey, come over here.

711
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,800
Does this look different to you?

712
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,960
I swear I didn't look like that when I laid it.

713
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,880
The snake comes out of it.

714
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,400
And pantyhose come out of it.

715
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,440
Let's go.

716
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,000
This message is for Alex Solak.

717
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,280
Griffin, who's the message from?

718
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,640
It's from John Solak.

719
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,080
You guys know if you reverse the word Solak, it says koalas.

720
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,520
Mm-hmm.

721
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
That's not true at all.

722
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,000
It's pretty close, though.

723
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,720
Edward, what's the message?

724
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,440
Happy birthday to my favorite and only brother, Alex.

725
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,800
He likes science fiction, maximum fun, postulating about our inevitable

726
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,960
techno-organic future, being sociable friends, the internet in general, and spending.

727
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,360
He turned me on to boom, boom, boom, boom.

728
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,200
And I'm eternally grateful.

729
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,320
Have a great 26th birthday.

730
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
We are just going to have to refund this guy's money,

731
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
because none of that was intelligible.

732
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,680
That all made perfect sense to me.

733
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,040
And who better to speak on our inevitable techno-organic future than Edward Snowden?

734
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,160
That's what he's trying to prevent.

735
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,040
Robot plants?

736
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,160
You mean robot plants?

737
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,840
Something like that.

738
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,800
I think he's talking about when we are just melted down to sludge,

739
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:16,000
and then that sludge is like the synapse fuel that all of our world's wars will take place,

740
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,760
just in a digital recreation of mankind.

741
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,080
That sounds about right.

742
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,000
Have you read much Ellison, Travis?

743
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,800
You like to fuck?

744
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,800
Tired of doing it the old way that you used to do it?

745
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Well, there's new ways.

746
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,360
New ways you haven't even conceived of yet in your wildest dreams.

747
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,760
It's like-

748
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,400
Oh my shit.

749
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
I just had the best idea for a remake.

750
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,720
Okay.

751
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,680
Home Alone, but with all Extreme Restraints products.

752
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,920
Holy shit.

753
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
I would watch that.

754
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,040
So he opens the door and a bucket of lube-

755
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,680
Tell you what, a bucket of water-based lube falls on you.

756
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,960
Your day is over.

757
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,080
He's walking across the ground barefoot on studded butt plugs, just like,

758
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,680
ow, ow, ow, that's so gross.

759
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,880
Just sitting outside on the front step are two flashlights,

760
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,440
and then the rest of the movie is Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern just jerking it so right.

761
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,960
They get so distracted by all their jerking it that they don't even go,

762
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,720
I thought about Daniel Stern jerking it, no.

763
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
Why did it happen?

764
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,320
Just as a distraction technique,

765
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,080
young Macaulay Culkin never appeared without a giant dildo

766
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,760
attached to the front of his pants.

767
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,480
What do you say that?

768
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,040
Can you imagine if they're like,

769
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,680
let's get-

770
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,600
Whoa, hot you watching.

771
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,880
Oh, God's been good to you, huh kid?

772
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,120
That's quite a oops shotgun to the face.

773
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,800
Well, not a shotgun, it'd probably be a whip.

774
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,640
Wait, Macaulay Culkin just shot them?

775
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,280
He's wearing a giant prosthetic dildo that he bought at extremrestraints.com,

776
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,400
your adult superstore.

777
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,120
And he has a shotgun that he bought, I guess, in another store, not extremrestraints.com.

778
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,560
Oh.

779
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
You could do something with the spurs, they have medical instruments,

780
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,240
they have a Wartenberg wheel with a sheath that you-

781
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,600
What is that, like a what?

782
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,680
It's like a spur, it's like a wheel spur that you can run across your partner's skin

783
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,520
to excite them and titillate them.

784
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,600
And that's from King Industries, so you know it's quality.

785
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,400
The great thing about extremrestraints.com is that

786
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:35,600
if you use our coupon code, Sexabunga, then you can actually save 20% on your sex stuff.

787
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,400
So if you've got to defend your home, you're going to need those savings.

788
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,320
That's 20% more traps you can afford.

789
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Right.

790
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,600
And you don't know how many traps they're going to be able to make it through.

791
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,880
Maybe that extra 20% is what finally kills them.

792
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,280
Oh, my God.

793
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,960
How much different would that movie have been if the mom comes home at the end

794
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,560
and there's just two dead men?

795
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
Just dead-

796
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,400
Two dead man bodies just sitting there and fucking her son.

797
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,280
She's like, what?

798
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,840
What happened?

799
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,160
I don't-

800
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,920
And he's got a huge dildo dick.

801
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,560
I don't want to hug you now.

802
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,720
Take that off and then we can talk about Christmas hugs.

803
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,440
I was in a van with John Candy for 14 hours and I come home to two corpses and a sun dildo.

804
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,640
Worst Christmas ever.

805
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,120
Thank you.

806
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,800
Thank you, Kevin.

807
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,320
Thank you, Kevin.

808
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,880
Thank you, Kevin, for this righteous present.

809
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,520
I thought it was bad before.

810
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,240
This is worse.

811
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,160
I was picturing in my head the worst possible thing

812
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,920
that could have been waiting for me when I got home.

813
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,840
This is worse than you dead.

814
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,200
This is worse than you dead.

815
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,160
I got to say it.

816
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,800
This is worse than finding you dead.

817
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,560
I would rather have found you dead and all of our TVs burgled.

818
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,480
Like so many Sega CDs.

819
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,560
Fucking Home Alone 2, they get to their destination with Adam.

820
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,600
She's like, fuck it.

821
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:55,840
Nope.

822
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,640
He is staying behind this time.

823
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,200
Where's he at?

824
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't give a shit.

825
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
That kid's a monster.

826
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,840
I'm still thinking about Daniel Stern jerking off.

827
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,040
I got to fuck it.

828
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
We need a palate cleanser.

829
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
You got to cleanse your palate.

830
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,080
Give me something.

831
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,680
Give me another mental image.

832
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,480
Joe Pesci jerking it.

833
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,880
That's way, it's the same.

834
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,960
I am at, this is, this is weird.

835
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
This is zero sum game, switching those two out.

836
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,600
Fred Savage jerking it.

837
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,400
No, I don't want any, I don't want anything like that.

838
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,760
Fred Savage not jerking it.

839
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,680
Okay.

840
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,120
He really wanted to.

841
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,760
Getting closer.

842
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,800
But he's at like a funeral or something.

843
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,400
Guys, it's getting late.

844
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,680
Don't you guys need to get home?

845
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,560
Oh boy, I got to clean up from this party.

846
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,800
Hey, this is Aaron and Brian from Throwing Shade,

847
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,680
and we would love to throw some shade on you this summer.

848
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,000
Every Tuesday, we inject all sorts of news stories

849
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,160
concerning ladies and gays with silliness and sexiness.

850
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,920
Just in time for bikini season.

851
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,480
Check us out on Max Fun under Throwing Shade.

852
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,720
Okay.

853
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,600
They're not stupid.

854
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,120
I know, but yeah, they could be.

855
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,240
Why would you spell it out like that?

856
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,160
Well, because I was the spelling bee champion of the world.

857
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,360
I'm throwing my husband a surprise party a few weeks from now.

858
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,760
He's turning 30 and he's not thrilled about it.

859
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,520
So I want to make it awesome for him.

860
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,600
There's one dilemma I'm running into.

861
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,840
How do I get him out of the house while the guests arrive

862
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,480
and get things set up?

863
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,680
Treasure hot, next question.

864
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,800
My girlfriend of 2.5 years has recently really gotten into video games.

865
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,400
That's awesome because I've been a gamer all my life.

866
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,000
The only problem is she doesn't have anyone to play with except me and my friends.

867
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,160
She plays with us occasionally, but there are times

868
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,520
when I just want to hang out with the guys in a game

869
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,680
or the game we're playing is too difficult for her.

870
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,160
Okay.

871
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,080
She isn't a fan of single player games.

872
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,280
So how does she find other girls or guys to play with?

873
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,720
None of her friends are into games

874
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,000
and I'm stumped as how she can find some gamer friends.

875
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,800
That's from gamer hunting in Illinois.

876
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,160
Hey dog, I'm going to go out on a limb here and make a guess.

877
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,400
Yeah.

878
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,600
Yeah.

879
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,840
The reason she has gotten into games

880
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,200
is because she likes playing games with you.

881
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,120
I mean, that's a possibility.

882
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,000
I mean, that's not to say that she doesn't enjoy them.

883
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,840
It's like, it's something that you guys are sharing together

884
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,200
so she, you know, has fostered an interest in it.

885
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,640
I mean, that's why I learned to read

886
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,960
because my wife's always doing that and I thought, well.

887
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,040
That's also why you learned surgery.

888
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
Right, so we can have some common ground.

889
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:42,480
I think it's pretty kind of a little bit shitty for you to say like,

890
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,600
listen, I've got to find some other people to pawn you off on

891
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,960
because my friends and I,

892
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,000
we're going to ratchet the difficulty up to insanity

893
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,640
and I just don't think you're going to be able to get the head shots.

894
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,520
You're going to need to hang.

895
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,320
I'm willing to bet because like, for example,

896
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,240
Teresa likes playing board games and, you know, nerdy table game stuff.

897
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,160
But like, there are times when I get invited over to go somewhere

898
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,240
and we're going to play a game that I know she won't like,

899
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,520
you know, something like that where I just go,

900
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
hey, I think it's just going to be a dude's night.

901
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,440
And as long as that's not like the norm,

902
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,600
is that as long as that's like once in a while, that's not bad.

903
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,440
You guys are missing the best answer.

904
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,960
And that is you got to put her through an intense training regimen

905
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,600
of getting fucking tight at games because like.

906
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,880
Like montage style?

907
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
Well, no, I mean, it's going to take a lot of work.

908
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,640
It's not going to be like something you can fast forward through.

909
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,520
It's going to like when Rachel and I started dating,

910
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,840
her KD spread was, it was abysmal.

911
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,680
Her headshot percentage, it was like in the negatives.

912
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,800
Her accuracy, it was embarrassing to me.

913
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,400
She's in the other room, so I don't want to be too loud,

914
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,480
but it was embarrassing to me how inaccurate her gunfire was.

915
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,480
So I put her through the ropes, you know,

916
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
I imparted some of my master wisdom.

917
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,440
Now her KD spread is still not great,

918
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,200
but it's better than it was before.

919
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,960
She can hang is what I'm saying.

920
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,240
I had to, I had to berate, I had to berate her

921
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,080
like only a super racist homophobic 13 year old can

922
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,120
to just sort of prepare her

923
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,720
because it's partially a mental game.

924
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,880
It's partially about KD spread,

925
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,320
but it's partially just about not giving up

926
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,120
and believing in yourself.

927
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,040
And it's hard to do that when you're being berated.

928
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,000
And those are, you know what?

929
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
It might seem like a waste of time,

930
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
but those are life lessons you can impart anywhere.

931
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,760
Right.

932
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,880
Anytime you're getting yelled at

933
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,160
by homophobic 13 year olds.

934
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,320
Right.

935
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,960
Like the bank.

936
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,520
We need to stop employing homophobic 13 year olds

937
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,640
at the bank, by the way.

938
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,080
It's killing our economy.

939
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,360
You want some hundreds, Fruit Loops?

940
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,680
No problem, pussy.

941
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,440
Let me just, oh, sorry.

942
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,920
Just real quick.

943
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,240
I need you to put your account number on the deposit slip

944
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,040
and I fucked your mom.

945
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:52,880
Oops.

946
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,280
Oops.

947
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,520
What? Well, you call that a deposit slip?

948
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,720
Noob.

949
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:58,960
Noob.

950
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,800
You don't know your account number?

951
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,000
Lamer.

952
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,440
That actually is pretty close to how it is.

953
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,120
Yeah, it's actually me at my bank.

954
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,720
It's not that far from reality.

955
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,680
I have been going to the same bank

956
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,160
for a decade and a half now.

957
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,600
And I've never made a deposit

958
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,760
where I haven't just written my social security number

959
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,200
on there and asked them to look it up,

960
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,800
because I do not know my account number

961
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,240
and it has not changed for three presidential administrations.

962
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,800
Every other time I go to deposit a check,

963
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,920
I forget to endorse it.

964
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,320
And then they fucking come out of the little booth

965
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,480
and they yell L2P in my face and they hump me.

966
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,600
Some banks you have to pay extra for that,

967
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,640
but not a BB&T.

968
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,760
Not a BB&T, because it stands for balls, butts,

969
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
and taints all over it.

970
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,680
All over you.

971
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,360
That was the original name of the bank.

972
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,080
They shortened it.

973
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,800
It was too long to fit on the check.

974
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,680
My lady and I are going to get a dog soon.

975
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,960
While looking for the right hound,

976
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,040
we've discussed several different dog names.

977
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,360
If we get a female dog, she wants to name it Beyonce.

978
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:06,800
Being a white couple, I feel that might-

979
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,560
Can you give me that one more time?

980
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,600
I'm sorry, one more time?

981
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,160
She wants to name it Beyonce.

982
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,280
Okay.

983
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,120
I feel like that might come off as racist,

984
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:21,120
even though my dog is a big Beyonce.

985
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,680
Even though my girlfriend is a big Beyonce.

986
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,480
My dog is like-

987
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,080
You haven't even adopted a dog yet,

988
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,560
and you just said,

989
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,520
we can't adopt a dog that doesn't like halo, halo.

990
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,480
We gotta check its cred.

991
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,120
I think it might send the wrong message.

992
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,440
Is this a valid concern?

993
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,000
What's the rule for naming animals after celebrities?

994
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,280
Okay.

995
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,480
What is the rule for naming animals after celebrities?

996
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,680
Additional details.

997
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,520
The dog we're most likely to get soon

998
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,480
is a female black lab.

999
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,440
Changes everything.

1000
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:52,720
Yep.

1001
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,520
That I was with you until then.

1002
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,920
That's from Dogana in Minneapolis.

1003
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,280
Oh, I think that to answer the easiest question first,

1004
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,760
the rule about naming dogs after celebrities

1005
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,560
is it's okay as long as it's not like dumb.

1006
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,520
It's tough, but like I would never name a dog.

1007
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,720
No, I was gonna say French Stewart, but I would.

1008
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,280
I wouldn't do that.

1009
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,240
I wouldn't name a dog French Stewart.

1010
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,040
Yeah, but that's-

1011
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,960
I would name a dog Robin Williams.

1012
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,120
You would name the dog French Stewart

1013
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,800
in Beverly Hills Chihuahua too,

1014
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,000
and it would be ironic

1015
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,160
because there's no way that dog's a Chihuahua.

1016
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,760
I'm trying to think if there's any celebrities

1017
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,280
I wouldn't name a dog after.

1018
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,200
Wolf Blitzer.

1019
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,840
No, I would.

1020
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,880
Damn, it's right there.

1021
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,840
Wolf Blitzer?

1022
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,080
Absolutely.

1023
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,880
I don't think, I think,

1024
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,800
I think, here's the problem.

1025
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,440
The fact that we're all sitting here thinking about it

1026
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,240
makes me think that if you invited some friend over,

1027
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
if you invited five friends over to your house

1028
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,600
and you said this is our new black dog named Beyonce,

1029
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,920
maybe four, four out of five of them would be like,

1030
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,720
oh, that's racist.

1031
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,400
I think 20% of your friends would think it's not racist,

1032
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,120
or at least they would think, you think about it, you know?

1033
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,960
You think it's there.

1034
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,920
Like we live in a post-

1035
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,840
So four would think it was and one would abstain.

1036
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,080
We live in a, we live in a post-racial society

1037
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,080
the Supreme Court recently decided.

1038
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,280
So like I do guess it's not that big a deal,

1039
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,840
but there would be the specter of the thought

1040
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,880
looming over that dog

1041
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,320
that would overshadow all of its dog accomplishments.

1042
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,640
The problem you have is that

1043
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,360
you no longer have plausible deniability.

1044
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,520
You're thinking about now the possibility of it

1045
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,840
being misconstrued as kind of racist.

1046
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,360
And even if you yourself are not a racist,

1047
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,120
I don't know if you are, you didn't clarify.

1048
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,400
You've already thought it.

1049
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,520
So now you can't do it.

1050
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,920
But what if they had gotten like a golden lab

1051
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,960
and named it like Craig T. Nelson?

1052
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,720
Which is the Beyonce of white people.

1053
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,480
He's so multi-talented.

1054
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,600
He is.

1055
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,800
He acts, he sings, he dances.

1056
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
He looks almost dead all the time.

1057
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,880
He coaches, he does everything.

1058
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,440
I think the fact that you're thinking about it

1059
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,480
means probably here there'd be dragons.

1060
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,080
Could you name the dog Sasha Fierce?

1061
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,040
That's fucking great.

1062
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,400
That's a good name for a dog, I guess.

1063
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,680
Do you guys want Yahoo?

1064
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,080
Yeah, sure.

1065
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,640
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Max Jinnikov.

1066
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,280
Thanks, Max.

1067
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user AndyRuss13333

1068
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,840
who asks, what is a creative name

1069
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,640
for a large barbecue sandwich with the works and then some?

1070
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,840
I have a new idea for a huge barbecue sandwich

1071
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,640
at my restaurant.

1072
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,560
It will consist of a 1 quarter pound of barbecue,

1073
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,360
a couple strips of rib meat covered with salt,

1074
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,680
pickles, cheese, and baked beans.

1075
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,560
It is a very big sandwich and very sloppy as well.

1076
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,760
Feel free to be creative and thanks for your help in advance.

1077
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,800
Here I was going to not be creative

1078
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,400
and just say barbecue sandwich,

1079
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,680
but now that you fucking let me loose.

1080
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,400
Unleash the hounds as it were of creativity.

1081
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,760
Call it a fat Sammy.

1082
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,160
Fat Sammy is not great.

1083
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,560
What about a bean boy?

1084
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,960
A sloppy bean boy.

1085
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,840
A sloppy bean boy.

1086
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,720
How about you call it-

1087
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,400
A big fat sloppy bean boy.

1088
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,160
How about you call it the menu item nobody will ever order

1089
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,040
because nobody wants to eat beans on a sandwich.

1090
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,560
So somebody does.

1091
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,000
Now you're going to get people writing in

1092
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,920
and talking about how much they love beans on sandwiches.

1093
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,720
Call it the bathroom fast track.

1094
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,360
The whole day.

1095
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,520
Because if you eat a sandwich like that,

1096
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,480
that is your whole day.

1097
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,360
Hour later regret sandwich.

1098
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,680
What about sorry so sloppy?

1099
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,000
Griffin?

1100
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,720
Yeah.

1101
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,520
Grant my wish.

1102
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:03,840
Yeah.

1103
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,680
Tell me the people on Yahoo Answers

1104
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,120
have responded to this question as well.

1105
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:07,360
Sure.

1106
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,480
Sure, of course.

1107
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,920
I'm ready.

1108
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,560
The feast.

1109
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,320
I would call it this because it sound like

1110
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,480
getting your whole meal in just one sandwich.

1111
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,280
That's good.

1112
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:19,840
Makes sense.

1113
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,400
It's good.

1114
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,720
Thanks.

1115
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,120
The chain-

1116
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,240
I was wondering-

1117
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,080
That is the dream in case anyone was wondering.

1118
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,960
The chainsaw.

1119
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,320
Just sounds like a manly hefty filling sandwich.

1120
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,000
Or a chainsaw.

1121
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,360
Listen to how much over fucking reaching

1122
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,240
goes on in this next Yahoo Answer answer

1123
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,440
from Michelangelo.

1124
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,720
The overload sandwich series.

1125
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,920
The overload sandwich series.

1126
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,160
You can make a couple sandwiches like this one

1127
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,640
and have a promotional limited time only kind of thing

1128
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,840
there at your restaurant.

1129
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,920
Can be a great marketing plan also.

1130
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,960
Hey, dude.

1131
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,440
Hey, dude.

1132
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,200
This guy didn't just hire you as their fucking

1133
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,400
social media manager.

1134
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,280
He asked for your help for one sandwich on Yahoo Answers.

1135
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,880
Now you've committed it.

1136
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,560
How is he going to top the Bean Boy besides-

1137
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,920
The Big Fat Sloppy Bean Boy.

1138
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,800
Hey, have you considered making an entire Bean Boy franchise?

1139
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,760
Just a thought.

1140
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,800
Thanks, Yahoo.

1141
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,400
Hey, have you considered expanding beyond the Mississippi?

1142
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,320
Like, just name my sandwich.

1143
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,520
Have you thought about getting into the steel industry?

1144
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,920
Just a thought.

1145
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,560
Just a thought.

1146
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,120
Plastics.

1147
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:30,960
I don't know.

1148
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,000
That's all I can think of right now.

1149
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,200
Michelangelo, you thought of a lot.

1150
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,560
You have nothing to apologize for.

1151
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,120
You've created a whole expansion plan.

1152
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,760
Yahoo Answers user Joker says your mama

1153
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,040
and then there's five asterisks.

1154
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,880
So I guess bitch.

1155
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,440
This is the your mama bitch.

1156
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,960
It's delicious.

1157
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,040
Why would anyone order that sandwich?

1158
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,480
No one would ever say that.

1159
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:54,880
I'm just gonna-

1160
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,920
I want your mama bitch.

1161
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:56,960
Okay.

1162
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,040
I'm gonna go down the line just like quick fire.

1163
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,240
Barbecue on a bun.

1164
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,480
Sure.

1165
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,080
The Summit.

1166
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,040
Listen, we got to work this out.

1167
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,280
Let's have a summit together.

1168
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,520
The G8.

1169
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,240
The Belushi.

1170
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,880
The Scale Tipper.

1171
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,160
It's a sin, but I love it sandwich.

1172
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,200
That one.

1173
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,280
Feed me mama sandwich.

1174
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:25,760
Oh no.

1175
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,600
I don't need no side order sandwich.

1176
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,960
Oh God, cause they're all on your bun.

1177
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,160
Make it more of a sentence.

1178
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,880
Hey sir, I do not need any side orders.

1179
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,920
Thank you for asking though,

1180
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,080
but could I see a dessert menu sandwich?

1181
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,360
Big Mo or Big Jack or your name?

1182
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:43,840
What if this-

1183
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,840
Big Percy.

1184
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,800
That sounds like an Appalachian context.

1185
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,440
He's gonna eat yourself a Big Percy.

1186
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,160
Those are the highlights.

1187
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,960
I think you got a lot to go on in there.

1188
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,400
Yeah.

1189
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,640
Depending on if you want to name your restaurant

1190
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,240
or close it in a week.

1191
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,640
Is there bread in this sandwich?

1192
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,520
He didn't list it.

1193
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,920
It's just a pile of-

1194
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,800
It's like a KFC Originals bowl.

1195
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,680
It's just a fucking sloppy.

1196
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,200
All right.

1197
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,120
We got to stop recording cause now I'm starving.

1198
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
Yeah, I got to go down to Big Percy's

1199
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,160
and get a sloppy Papa.

1200
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,800
That doesn't sound healthy.

1201
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
How about the name of it's the messy secret.

1202
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,000
I know a thing or two about that.

1203
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,440
We call this sandwich the sloppy Snowden.

1204
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,800
Thank you so much.

1205
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
That's also a new way that you can do kissing

1206
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,320
is if you buy a sloppy Snowden

1207
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,600
and then you put it in between your mouse

1208
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,480
and kiss through it.

1209
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,240
That's the only way to keep the devil out.

1210
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,000
I want to thank people tweeting about our program.

1211
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,200
My brother, my brother and me using the MBMBAM hashtag.

1212
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,640
Lydia Lenore is a new listener.

1213
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,600
She just got on board.

1214
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,360
Hello to Steph Kingston, Andrew Tennyson,

1215
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,160
our buddy Alan Black, Tyler Matheson,

1216
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,680
Chrissy Matthew Bird, Brian Dorfman,

1217
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,080
Ellen Bailey, Nick Fracker, Mason Church,

1218
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,880
Abigail McCauley.

1219
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,600
Thank you so much to everyone tweeting about the show.

1220
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,280
When you tweet about MBMBAM,

1221
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,040
why not throw in a link to our sampler?

1222
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,720
It's bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM 2013.

1223
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
Hey, speaking of tweeting,

1224
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,960
I got dropped on the Twitter this week

1225
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,040
on July 4th to be exact,

1226
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,280
the MBMBAM mixtape volume.

1227
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,080
Oh shit.

1228
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,040
It's available now.

1229
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,320
It's available from True Tempo, T-R-U-T-E-M-P-O

1230
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,120
and done by Worship the Sky, formerly Rocky Horror.

1231
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,480
Check it out, it is so good.

1232
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,560
If you want to find it,

1233
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,040
go to twitter.com forward slash Worship the Sky

1234
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,800
or worshipthesky.com

1235
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,720
and you'll be able to find the link there.

1236
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,440
It's very-

1237
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,080
You can also go to truetempo.com and it's available there.

1238
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,040
It is very fresh.

1239
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,440
There's a whole twerking segment in it

1240
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
that I was listening to it in the shower

1241
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,520
and I just couldn't control.

1242
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,560
I was shaving my face

1243
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,680
and I had to start twerking while I was shaving

1244
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,960
and I got cut pretty badly.

1245
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,360
I look like Seal now.

1246
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,200
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1247
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,120
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1248
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,280
which is on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1249
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,320
It's an oldie, but a goodie.

1250
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,520
That's what I would-

1251
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,320
If I was like a radio DJ and I was putting this song on,

1252
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,120
I'd be like, here comes an oldie, but a goodie.

1253
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,640
And then I would put the song on and play it

1254
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,480
and I would get calls from people saying that is,

1255
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,840
it is both old and good.

1256
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,960
Is there anything else we need to say, Travis?

1257
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,440
I don't think-

1258
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,280
Did we mention the coupon code sexabonga

1259
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,160
for Extreme Restraints?

1260
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,240
Yeah, we did.

1261
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,920
It saves you 20% sexabonga.

1262
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,720
Sexabonga, sexabonga, sexabonga.

1263
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,760
And if you would like a spot on the Jumbotron,

1264
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,880
if you would like, let's say a personal spot

1265
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,040
to wish someone happy birthday or to apologize

1266
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,720
for something you did to them in the past

1267
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,560
or something you're going to do to them in the future

1268
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,560
or if it is, I don't know, a business opportunity,

1269
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,720
some kind of investment you would like people to make,

1270
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,240
just go to maximumfund.org forward slash Jumbotron

1271
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,960
and that's all you need to do.

1272
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,640
And just go through there and they'll set you right up

1273
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,480
and then you too can be on the show.

1274
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,600
We should also probably mention,

1275
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,960
next week's going to be a bye week.

1276
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,680
We try to avoid missing shows,

1277
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,880
but I'm going to be out of town for like eight days

1278
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,120
and Travis is going to be, it's tech week for Travis,

1279
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,800
which if you're in the theater community,

1280
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,920
you know that is a lot of work, I guess.

1281
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,560
And if you're not in the theater community,

1282
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,520
I'll be fighting robots.

1283
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,200
Yeah, every time, before a show opens,

1284
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,320
robots come and try to destroy it

1285
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,760
because robots hate live theater.

1286
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,920
Because if there's one thing robots hate, it's live theater.

1287
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,480
Right, so every, there's one night

1288
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,560
where everybody has to stand, hold vigil,

1289
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,440
and fight off the robot onslaught.

1290
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,440
People die, there's a lot of deaths.

1291
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,000
But it's worth it.

1292
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,880
But it is worth it.

1293
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,360
And also, on a much different note,

1294
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,800
there's some Max Funds who's putting together

1295
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,160
a Max Fund meetup in Philadelphia

1296
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,920
on July 20th, Saturday, July 20th,

1297
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,200
and they say around 4 p.m.

1298
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,920
It's going to be at Cafe Fulya, F-U-L-Y-A.

1299
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,200
We'll bully them into posting something on the forums

1300
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,880
and putting all the information there.

1301
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,120
But I want to make sure any of our Philadelphia

1302
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,040
and Philadelphia area listeners

1303
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,360
or any Max Fund listeners who want to hang out,

1304
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,680
just go hang out with some cool kids.

1305
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,000
One more thing, go listen to all the other Max Fund shows.

1306
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,960
There's a cornucopia of free comedy broadcasting

1307
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,160
all on MaxFundFund.org.

1308
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,120
You got Jordan, Jesse, Goat,

1309
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,120
Judgment on Honchman, Throwing Shades,

1310
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,680
Stop Podcasting Yourself, Risk,

1311
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,120
Wham Bam Pow, One Bad Mother.

1312
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,960
There's Bullseye.

1313
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,840
There's tons of shit.

1314
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,560
That's it.

1315
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,240
Nothing that, no others you can think of?

1316
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,400
No.

1317
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,280
I think that's it.

1318
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,240
Cause like it only counts.

1319
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,240
Oh, there's one called Bonesaw.

1320
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:00,740
Yeah.

1321
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,220
Come on, Bonesaw is ready.

1322
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,100
It's called Sawbones.

1323
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,380
It has me and my wife in it.

1324
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,340
It's about medical history.

1325
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:10,740
It's funny.

1326
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,460
You should listen to it.

1327
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,620
It hasn't been around that long yet.

1328
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,300
So they're like, you may want to give it a little bit of time

1329
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,660
for them to like find their groove.

1330
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,500
Or just like shelter it safely to your bosom.

1331
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,060
Keep it safe.

1332
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:21,620
Keep it secret.

1333
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,260
Like a bait.

1334
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,940
Don't tell any of your friends.

1335
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,980
Like a baby bird.

1336
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,980
Like this is your chance to get it on something

1337
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,700
on the ground floor

1338
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,900
and then keep it on the ground floor.

1339
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,540
So it's indie.

1340
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,040
Mm-hmm.

1341
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,500
Thank you.

1342
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,820
I was into Sawbones before anyone else was.

1343
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,180
Sorry, say it one more time.

1344
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,460
I was into Sawbones before anyone else was.

1345
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,900
You fucked it up the first time, Jeff.

1346
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,820
Jeff was making a joke because you fucked it up.

1347
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,300
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast, Griffin.

1348
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,420
You have a final question for us.

1349
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,660
This final Yahoo was sent in by Nicholas Guren.

1350
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,220
Thank you, Nick.

1351
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,740
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sebastian, who asks,

1352
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,620
what parts of the body can be shown in a medium core porno movie?

1353
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,820
I'm Justin McElroy.

1354
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,700
I'm Travis McElroy.

1355
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,820
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1356
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,500
These are my brother, my brother, and me.

1357
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,460
Kiss your dad.

1358
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,260
Square on the lips.

1359
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:29,140
You think, like, one nut?
