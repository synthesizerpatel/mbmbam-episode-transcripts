1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. Welcome

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,400
to a super sexy evening performance. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
I'm your middle-aged brother Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,160
And I'm famed R&B performer D'Angelo. Welcome D'Angelo to the show. We never record in the

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,400
evening, but it's Sunday evening. I've got an old-fashioned with one of those giant

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,080
round ice cubes in it. My sister Taylor got me the molds for Christmas, and I'm wearing some

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,080
red plaid pants and an Oh Yeah Dude t-shirt, and I'm just ready to get narcissistic.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,640
Does this count as an Oh Yeah Dude crossover, then?

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,040
No.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,160
This is an Oh Yeah Dude crossover episode. We wrote it all before the show.

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,520
We hope you like it.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
Got a great, we got a great script.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,400
You know what? I'm looking over it, and this script is basically word for word the

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
same as Thrilling Adventure Hour.

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,960
Yeah, only-

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Have we just been stealing all of our jokes?

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,400
Only a lot more anti-Semitic.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,200
A lot? Well, 50% more.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
Gotta take a red pen to some of this anti-Semitism. It's too late to do the show.

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
It's 8 p.m. on a Sunday.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,520
This is- It's only 6 p.m.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
This is my fucking special time.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
Guys, how was your New Year's?

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,080
Pretty good.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,720
I rung it in the only way I know how. Dressed as a monk at a murder mystery in a castle in the

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,080
middle of Ohio.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Just traditional Justin New Year celebrations.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,560
That's a real thing that you did. When you're doing all of that dumb, nerdy shit, do you also

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,520
like pop champagne and sing Auld Lang Syne and do the normal shit, or is it just midnight comes

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,240
and goes and you're like, oh, I missed it because I found a new clue?

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,840
No, there is a group sing, I should say. A bunch of people get together, pop the corks.

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
I didn't do that because I went to go be with my baby who was asleep, so I just kind of

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
stared at it as the New Year came in.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,880
Auld Lang Syne.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
Got some-

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,800
Looking handsome, baby.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
You are the future, baby.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
We got some 2015 promises to make and break.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,800
I had a fun experience. There's a cell phone reception, so we went to go eat at this pizza

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:06,480
restaurant halfway through the weekend, and then I got a tweet from someone, and the tweet

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,200
said, new mystery, Justin McElroy. I know we were spending New Year's Eve and I'm watching

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,520
you. Try to find me before it's too late.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:20,800
So that is like a crazy tweet, but it turned out it was just a very pleasant gentleman

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,760
and his lady friend or wife who were at the murder mystery also because they heard about

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,000
it on my brother and me. Yes, but I was very unnerving.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
So the tweet was just a red herring.

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
But that could have turned into a legit murder mystery, only not very mysterious because

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
it was the tweeter that didn't-

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
Check my tweets.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,240
Check his tweets. I'm Agent Johnson with Cybercrime, and let me check the tweets.

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,640
And it was this guy that did murder Justin.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,880
It was someone named Poops McGee.

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
That may not be his real name.

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,960
This week on Who Did Murder Justin, it was the Twitterer.

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,760
It took me three minutes on Twitter, and in that time I figured out that Justin was killed

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,240
by Thomas, and also I know the lyrics to every One Direction song that is possible.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,960
Also, that Jaden Smith, pretty crazy, huh?

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,120
Creepy, but basically the coolest person who's ever lived, and he's eight.

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,320
So this is our advice podcast where we turn your questions alchemy-like into wisdom.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
I'm ready, if you all are ready-

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,840
I'm ready and sweaty.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,880
To get rolling.

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,640
Try this email from Empty Stoppings that you forwarded over.

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,160
Was that for reading on the program?

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
Um, I mean, if you want to, it was more just for you to enjoy.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
I just wanted, well, I'll take a quick sidebar, because we're in the new year now.

71
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,360
Twenty-grifteen, the con is on.

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
So the charity is behind us, but I did want to tell you all-

73
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
This is our friend, my brother, my brother and me.

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
Farewell to charity.

75
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,640
Farewell to charity, the con is on.

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,600
I got a very nice email for those of you who participated in the NBNBAM Angels program

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
where we help fill empty stockings in the Tri-State region.

78
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,160
Um, I got an email from Terry over at the Cabell County Community Services org

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
who said, we receive calls and Christmas gifts from your listeners,

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,560
including those from California, Colorado, Indiana, and Virginia.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
We were able to help thirteen hundred and f-

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
Sorry, we were able to help three hundred and fifteen people.

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,760
Not quite as great as thirteen hundred.

84
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,120
Three hundred is pretty good, but add an extra thousand to that

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
and it's a whole different ballgame.

86
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
Maybe next year.

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Your listeners have a wonderful caring and giving spirit

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
We appreciate everything that you did to help us.

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,000
We hope you and your listeners have a very blessed year.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,880
Thank you, Terry.

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,920
The con is on.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,560
The year will be blessed.

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
Unfortunately, Terry, there will be no reprise

94
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
because we arbitrarily decided not to go with 2015.

95
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
If only we had removed that one letter.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
Oh, if only.

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,440
Thirteen hundred human souls, but unfortunately the con is on.

98
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,320
Sorry, Terry, who also said that our listeners have a wonderful caring giving spirit.

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,120
I know better.

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,200
I know that basically our listeners are trying to make up for some secret sin

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,280
that they can never expunge from their souls.

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,400
This year, all sin.

103
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,040
We are Fagan and you are Fagan's boys, listeners.

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
Have you guys seen Leverage?

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,320
It's like that, where they do good, but it's because they're bad.

106
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,880
Nope.

107
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
2015, the con is on.

108
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,440
Jims and bonds.

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,160
I want them both.

110
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
Jims and bonds.

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,440
Jims and bonds.

112
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800
So, let's answer some questions.

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,760
P.O. Box 54.

114
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,920
I recently went into a restaurant with the sole purpose of purchasing a gift certificate

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,480
for a friend of mine who had expressed interest in that establishment.

116
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,040
Pretty good gift.

117
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,760
P.O. Box 54.

118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,240
When the bartender brought me the check, I noticed there was a line on which to enter a tip

119
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
for the bartender who had served me.

120
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,080
I was unsure about how to tip or if to tip at all in this circumstance,

121
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
so I shrugged, threw in one dollar tip and signed.

122
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
Brothers, did I do the right thing?

123
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,080
Did I tip too little?

124
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
Or is tipping not necessary in this situation?

125
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
As from tipping remiss in St. Louis.

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,400
In case you were wondering, the gift certificate was for $50 and they tipped a dollar.

127
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay, but that's okay.

128
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,040
Does it matter?

129
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
It's a fucking gift card.

130
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,520
Here's why it matters.

131
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,040
First of all, you fucked up.

132
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,880
But second of all, here's why it matters.

133
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,720
I really like the logic of saying, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tip or not.

134
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,800
I know.

135
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,320
I'll tip 2%.

136
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,040
Right.

137
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,040
It's sort of like you would probably, it would probably be less offensive to tip nothing.

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,280
Yeah.

139
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,640
But this, this motherfucking bartender-

140
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,000
One drink, one $50 gift certificate, it's a dollar either way.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
This fucking bartender didn't put fucking mint into a mortar and pestle and then grind

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,720
those oils, those essential oils out and then light like an orange peel on fire over it

143
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,600
and spritz it with forbidden citruses and then said, okay, here's your gift card.

144
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,320
He swiped it through the thing and pressed like three buttons.

145
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,600
You give him fucking a 10 spot for that?

146
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960
This is no, this is a no-go.

147
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm saying that you didn't need, but this is very indicative.

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,040
I feel guilty whenever stuff like this comes up.

149
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,600
And I think it's just like, now it's just standard that most receipts print off no matter

150
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,160
what, especially like you're at a bar already.

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,320
So it's like, it's going to print off with a tip.

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,080
You're probably safe here.

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,920
But I kind of dig on a dollar though, because it's like the same amount of effort that would

154
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,400
be required to get a fucking Miller Lite out from the cooler and then pop the top of that

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
delicious refresco beverage and then hand it to you.

156
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,920
And that's $3 and you give them one, right?

157
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,400
That's the quintessential buying a beer at a bar sort of transaction.

158
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,320
And I think that you give them that same single, that Miller Lite single.

159
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,880
I don't know.

160
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,320
I just feel like giving them a tip on that is saying like, you need this more than me.

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,680
No, it's recognition.

162
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,960
It's game recognizing game.

163
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
It is good to tip.

164
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,600
Okay, to be clear, I think it's important to tip when you get carry out, right?

165
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,840
Like you guys tip when you're getting a carry out.

166
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Oh, absolutely not.

167
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
What, really?

168
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,940
Yeah.

169
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,300
Why not?

170
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,980
But they did that work.

171
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,540
Who did that work?

172
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,260
They carried it.

173
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,180
They carried it to you in a bag.

174
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
From one place, from like 18 feet?

175
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,060
Sorry, what do you think they're doing normally?

176
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,860
It's like 36 feet.

177
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,140
Yeah, but then it's repeated things.

178
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,460
It's water and it's bread and it's more bread and then it's butter and then it's more bread.

179
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,420
And then are you serious?

180
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,900
More bread.

181
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,340
And then seriously more bread.

182
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,380
I'm worried about you.

183
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,020
Please stop.

184
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,460
It's 2015.

185
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,500
Take care of yourself.

186
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,300
I have a gluten opposite of allergy.

187
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,020
Addiction?

188
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,740
Yeah.

189
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,580
Okay, Griffin, I'm going to tell you why it's the same thing for me.

190
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,220
Okay.

191
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,060
I am tipping waiters and waitresses and servers and whoever to make sure to protect me and my food.

192
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,540
That's it.

193
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,580
It's not the service.

194
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,540
It's not all that.

195
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,060
I'm tipping them to make sure the transaction goes smoothly.

196
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,380
It's food insurance?

197
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,420
Yeah, basically.

198
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,940
I don't want to roll up to pick up my carry out and they're like,

199
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,860
oh, sorry, that didn't go through or wasn't ready or whatever. It's cold now.

200
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,460
Oh, they forgot the fries.

201
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,260
You asked for bonus wings and we gave you a bone in wings.

202
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,500
Tipping is an end of game transaction.

203
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,900
They cannot fuck it up and they cannot take that shit out of your hand back to you and say,

204
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,300
hold on, sir, we forgot to fuck this up for you.

205
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,940
That's why it's an exercise in trust.

206
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,420
You're trusting and they're trusting and everybody's trusting.

207
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,300
What if they look at your tip, aren't pleased with it,

208
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,860
and they just take your carry out box and smash it in your chest?

209
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm going to have to take the fries out of here and just pretend like we forgot them.

211
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,300
Enjoy.

212
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,820
Ah, God, why can't we all just do it in the Japanese style where you just don't do it?

213
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,540
There's no tipping because everybody's paid a great wage.

214
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,180
Everybody's paid a great wage and you don't have to worry about shit like this.

215
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,380
I'm a great tipper.

216
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,380
I truly am a tremendous tipper.

217
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,340
Cab rides, hotel service, meal service, not carry out because fuck that noise.

218
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,540
But carry out's a perfect example.

219
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,660
It's one of those in between.

220
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,940
It's one of those gray areas.

221
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,940
If I go to an airport Hudson News and I buy my vitamin water zero lemonade flavor

222
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,980
and there's a fucking spot to tip on that Hudson News, I don't think so.

223
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,260
Have you guys ever tipped a shuttle driver at the airport?

224
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,220
Oh my God, that just...

225
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,740
Okay, I just got back from the airport.

226
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,300
Okay.

227
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,140
Flight to St. Louis and I saw someone do it.

228
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,220
It's the first time I've ever seen anyone do it.

229
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,300
Exact same thing happened to us.

230
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,620
I felt so terrible because I was like, that's a whole other fucking echelon.

231
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
I haven't even considered why can't we do it.

232
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,300
In the Japanese style.

233
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,220
If you're traveling in America, not in the Japanese style,

234
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,740
if you're traveling in America at this point,

235
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,220
you should pretty much just get a wad of ones

236
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,220
and just walk around with your left arm extended.

237
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,860
I don't, right.

238
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,140
Just like a bouquet of ones.

239
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,540
Just please, if you're supposed to take one of these, will you please just take it?

240
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,460
Honor system, need a dollar, take a dollar.

241
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,580
Am I supposed to say, if I'm supposed to give you a dollar,

242
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,700
please just take as many as I'm supposed to give you.

243
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,060
I wish it wasn't so awkward to just look at someone and go, do I give you this?

244
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,300
Is this for you?

245
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,100
Do I do this?

246
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,940
And they go, no, it's okay.

247
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,100
I never have cash dollar bills on me.

248
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,900
So what am I supposed to do?

249
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,020
Like turn to the fucking airport shuttle driver and be like, do you have Square?

250
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,180
Pardon me, sir.

251
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,180
I see this shuttle bus is equipped with a handicap ramp.

252
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,620
Does it also have Square?

253
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
Tap to pay with my iPhone?

254
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,100
Is that cool?

255
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,820
Do you have near field communication technology, good sir?

256
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,940
What's your email address?

257
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,300
Let me PayPal you $3.

258
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,780
What a nightmare.

259
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,260
Why can't we just-

260
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,620
It will be a transaction fee.

261
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,220
You are not friends nor family.

262
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,460
We've already declared that 2015 is when the con got on.

263
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,300
But I think 2016 is when we all start trying to convert everything

264
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,620
we possibly can to the Japanese style.

265
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,620
You can't even ask.

266
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,180
You can't ask if tipping is appropriate because they're basically saying like,

267
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,060
do you want some money?

268
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,540
Yeah.

269
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,340
I have some money.

270
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,220
Do you need it?

271
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,380
That's why there needs to be a second person on like the shuttle that works for them,

272
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,580
but it's not the driver that you can go to and go, do I tip the driver?

273
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,420
And their only job is to say yes or no.

274
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,620
And then do you tip that person, Travis?

275
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,460
Well, then it becomes like a matryoshka doll, I think it's called.

276
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,020
And you just have to keep asking tinier and tinier people.

277
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,900
Exactly.

278
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,420
And then in the back of the shuttle, a very, very, very tiny bathroom attendant.

279
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,380
He's like, I got mints.

280
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,740
And it's like, I don't want mints.

281
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,740
Do I still need to give you like $5 for offering me mints?

282
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,700
And by the end of it, you're just asking Amelie for advice,

283
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,340
who you can't tip because the coin's too big for her and knocks her over.

284
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,860
Don't try to tip or you'll kill her.

285
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,940
Please leave Amelie out of this.

286
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,340
Please.

287
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,260
I'm under your 50 cent piece.

288
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,020
Please help, I'm dying.

289
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,820
Do you guys want a yahoo?

290
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,980
Yeah, yahoo.

291
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,260
This yahoo is sinning by level.

292
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,140
By the way, yahoo me is something I've tried out for 2015.

293
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,860
Look for the t-shirt.

294
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,380
Oh wait, do it like a question.

295
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,420
Like yahoo me?

296
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,020
Yeah guys, what do you think about this?

297
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,940
Yahoo me, this is sinning by level, billion Drew Davenport.

298
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,500
Thank you, Drew.

299
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,940
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Master Ahmad, who asks,

300
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,340
can anyone tell me who invented hatred?

301
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,460
I mean, in other words, which specific individual that created

302
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,100
invented the idea of hatred in the first place?

303
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,700
The answer is the devil.

304
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,660
That's Cain.

305
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,020
That's actually the top answer on Yahoo Answers.

306
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,140
So thank you, Travis.

307
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,940
By which I mean Travis, by which I mean Yahoo Answers user,

308
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,100
Woofer Duff, who provided that answer for Cain.

309
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,140
Is that really where it came from?

310
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,620
Like biblically speaking, Cain was like, oh no.

311
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,420
Oh, I'm going to get that, Abel.

312
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,980
They were kind of a, they were very much like a road runner

313
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,180
and coyote kind of thing.

314
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,540
So nobody up to that point, like it fucking-

315
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,300
There were only three other people.

316
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,860
Right, but Abel like fucking kicks Abraham in the shins

317
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,900
because he's a shitty little kid.

318
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,100
And Abraham's like, thank you, I guess.

319
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Abraham wasn't there, Griffin.

320
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,460
Yeah, it was Abraham, Father Abraham, Cain, Abel, Adam.

321
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,580
Not Steve though, that's important.

322
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,540
I've always found this story confusing because I remember

323
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,700
being in church camp and the guy, the youth pastor,

324
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,580
made a big deal of this was the first murder in the Bible.

325
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,060
This is the root of murder, Cain and Abel.

326
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,020
And then as I was walking back to my door room,

327
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,820
probably to masturbate, I thought to myself,

328
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,100
you know what, he's also the first person to die,

329
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,820
which must have been a trip for Cain.

330
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,420
Whoa, wait, what?

331
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,860
Hey, Abel, I hit him really hard and now he's not getting up.

332
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,060
I just like, Abel, get up.

333
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,460
I like hit him with a rock as a fucking goof.

334
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,060
Like what the fuck?

335
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,540
I even said heads up when I did it.

336
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,380
It was supposed to be like a thing.

337
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,420
Abraham, yo, Abel's like stopped.

338
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,620
Abel like stopped, what's up?

339
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,540
There's not even a word for it.

340
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,580
Is there a word for this?

341
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,660
He just stopped, I brokeed it in.

342
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,060
You know what?

343
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,980
I had an Abel but I breaked him.

344
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,460
What happened?

345
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,300
I never thought about it, but it's like Edison, Einstein,

346
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,780
Cain, he invented death.

347
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah.

348
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,620
That's pretty big.

349
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,420
And hatred.

350
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,220
I don't know how much more we're gonna goof on this,

351
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,980
but Griffin, do yourself a solid and stop referencing Abraham

352
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,380
because you're exponentially increasing the number of tweets

353
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,740
you're about to receive from the Venn Diagram crossover

354
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,420
of biblical scholars and my brother, my brother,

355
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,060
my listeners.

356
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,580
So it was Adam and Eve that popped them out, Cain and Abel?

357
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,060
So all the babies came from just Adam and Eve?

358
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,220
No, it was Adam, Abraham, and Eve.

359
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,900
So there's a little DNA mix up.

360
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,460
Okay.

361
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,780
Well, I think that this is probably 100% true.

362
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,020
I think Cain probably invented it.

363
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,540
And then just like the only other two people on earth

364
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,780
saw it and was like, that looks all right.

365
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,340
Hatred?

366
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,500
Yeah.

367
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,620
Let me give that a try.

368
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,500
And that's where it all focused.

369
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,580
We should all just keep this train rolling.

370
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,060
Yeah.

371
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,860
What is that called?

372
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,340
Hatred?

373
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,860
Let me give that a shot.

374
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,660
Oh, I hate you birds.

375
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,820
Do you think that God at that point was like,

376
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,060
I kicked you guys out of the garden for eating an apple

377
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,460
and then step two was this.

378
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,900
You fucked up.

379
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,060
Yeah.

380
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,020
I was just thinking that, Travis.

381
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,460
Gama's been like, okay, there are like four of you.

382
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:43,780
Yeah.

383
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,180
Can you slow your roll for one sec?

384
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,700
I was gonna let you back in.

385
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,420
Ask Jesus.

386
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,860
I was just talking to him when I said like,

387
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,140
you know, I think I'm gonna let him back in.

388
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,180
Jesus, I felt bad last night.

389
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,100
He was like, I'm gonna put him on a 30-day probation.

390
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,620
They fucking murdered, there were four of them.

391
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,780
They had a one in four chance.

392
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,940
He killed, name another criminal of history

393
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,820
that killed 25% of the human race in one day.

394
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,380
With one stupid ass rock.

395
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,940
Uh, uh, Adam's only got so many fucking ribs.

396
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,020
I can't keep fucking popping these dudes out.

397
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,940
Griffin, I think at that point,

398
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,180
Adam and Eve had making people covered.

399
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,340
Maybe, they only did it twice.

400
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,540
I'm not, they're not experts.

401
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,820
They're not the fucking Duggars.

402
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,100
19 kids and counting and oh, wait, 18.

403
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,500
Damn it.

404
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,180
Oh, wait, shit.

405
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,220
There's like 12.

406
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,580
What's going on?

407
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,780
Hi, the rocks.

408
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,500
Wasn't me.

409
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,900
Fuck.

410
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,220
I mean, I want to read that Family Circus comic now.

411
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,780
Follow just like the bloody footprints

412
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,900
around the Garden of Eden.

413
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,980
Where's Kane?

414
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,340
Wasn't me.

415
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,540
Let's, uh, another question.

416
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,940
As a cable guy, I can really get into intimate parts of your home.

417
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,660
Whoa, fuck.

418
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,740
Stop with the presses.

419
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,860
As a cable guy, I can really get into intimate parts of your home

420
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,140
out of routine necessity.

421
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,220
So I'm privy to a lot of secrets.

422
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,460
Secrets.

423
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,060
What do you think I should do if I find something potentially dangerous

424
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,020
but incriminating, like drugs under a kid's bed?

425
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,980
Do I narc?

426
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,740
Are you fucking kidding me?

427
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,180
Let me finish.

428
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,020
I don't want to create a chaotic atmosphere while I'm doing my job.

429
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,780
Your cable guy works hard, you guys,

430
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,020
but I don't want to just let someone get hurt through inaction.

431
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,180
How would you handle this kind of situation?

432
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,460
That's from Brothers.

433
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
How would you handle this kind of situation, brothers?

434
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,260
That's from Indecisive in Indianapolis.

435
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,780
I would recommend that you just be fucking cool for, like, a second.

436
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,340
Yeah, could you just be cool and not try to narc on Kenny,

437
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,980
the 12-year-old who's just trying to sell some weed,

438
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,820
to buy Pokemon cards?

439
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,900
Is there, like, a cable guy oath that you take that's, like,

440
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
and keep your shit quiet?

441
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,220
Or it's, like, while in the course of your duties,

442
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,100
if you spy with your little eye something pinky?

443
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,340
That's it.

444
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,820
I think Ty Mourner is in cahoots with the fucking one time.

445
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,220
I think everything's autopsy-tervium,

446
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,420
canceling all my cable.

447
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,060
Just kidding.

448
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,140
I haven't had cable for eight years

449
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,060
because I have a lot of weed stashed all over my house.

450
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,940
I'm afraid they'll find my secrets.

451
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,580
What are you even fucking talking about, do you narc?

452
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,900
It's not your goddamn family to ruin.

453
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,260
Yeah, ma'am, just sign here.

454
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,740
Oh, yeah, that's your warranty there.

455
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,740
And also, your son has some sweet, sticky weed under his bed.

456
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,780
Okay, bye.

457
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,020
Is this hypothetical or is this a fucking quandary

458
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,220
that this person's wrestling with?

459
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,140
Because we can put this to bed super easy.

460
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
Be fucking cool for, like, a second.

461
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,740
Just put the cable in and walk out.

462
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,220
And walk out.

463
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
Do your goddamn job and walk away.

464
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,060
What are you even talking about, do you narc?

465
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,980
Is there a thing, like, you find under the kid's bed,

466
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,860
like, a stash of, I don't know, like, guns?

467
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,780
Do you say something?

468
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,500
No, no, because a second amendment guarantees

469
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,860
a certain freedoms, Travis.

470
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,940
Like, gun, like, infinite guns forever.

471
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,740
Unless you have a knife that has, like,

472
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,420
a note attached to it that says, like,

473
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,820
four Darryl's guts and then a date.

474
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,780
And your name is Darryl.

475
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,420
And also, your name is Darryl and, oh, god,

476
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,220
look out behind you.

477
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,220
I think you just-

478
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,740
That knife was a red herring.

479
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,420
Do you really want people to start-

480
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,940
Do you want to give human race another reason

481
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,700
to dislike the cable guy?

482
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,940
Really, have you guys had it so easy

483
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,060
in the rep department that you also want to add narc

484
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,220
to the list of, oh, god, where is he?

485
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,780
If a cable guy narked out my fucking son,

486
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,980
I would say, I have no reason to trust you,

487
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,860
Time Warner.

488
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,220
Get the fuck out of my house.

489
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,500
It's kind of a situation where, like, okay,

490
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,620
yeah, my son's in trouble.

491
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,580
Also, fuck you.

492
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,260
Yeah, fuck off.

493
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,740
I think, also, I can't imagine a situation

494
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,260
in which you don't say anything

495
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,700
and then, like, something goes down

496
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,100
and someone goes, well, why didn't the cable guy

497
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,820
say anything?

498
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,900
He was here.

499
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,340
Surely, if he had seen something,

500
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,700
he would have said something, right?

501
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,660
It's his responsibility as our cable installer.

502
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
I think that it's not, none of your business,

503
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,900
not your job, don't worry about it.

504
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,300
Now, now, now, let's approach this

505
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,340
from a 2015 mentality.

506
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,900
If the con is on, I have considered extorting Kenny.

507
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,940
Oh, my god, you have control of the cable.

508
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,780
Get a public access station that only goes

509
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,060
to Kenny's house.

510
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,700
Wait till he turns on the box at night.

511
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,180
Kenny.

512
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,260
Kenny turns on the midnight channel.

513
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,740
What's up?

514
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,900
I know about your doobers, Kenny.

515
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,940
Yeah.

516
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,020
But then, pretty soon, the Kenny Only channel

517
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,700
gets really high ratings

518
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,620
and the people from the VHF channels

519
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,900
come to shut you down.

520
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,620
Yeah.

521
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,140
But look out, Kramer's there

522
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,660
and he's gonna help you raise some money.

523
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,460
I'm just saying you could be rich

524
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,980
with Pochamon cards

525
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,860
if you play your goddamn Pochamon cards, right?

526
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
By which, I mean, you wanna have a deck

527
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,180
based on two discrete energy types.

528
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,340
I prefer psychic and fighting

529
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,900
and you don't wanna rely too heavily on evolutions

530
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,980
because that's gonna be predicated

531
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,500
on some pretty lucky card draws.

532
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,820
This has been Pokemon Card Game Strategy Tactics

533
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,220
with your old buddy, Griffin McElroy.

534
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,020
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

535
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,060
Mm-hmm.

536
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,780
This Yahoo was sent in by Kevin.

537
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,580
Thanks, Kevin.

538
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,220
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Marley, who asks,

539
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,860
do you say thank you after sex?

540
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,980
My boyfriend does at times.

541
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,100
Not sure how to take it.

542
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,660
Justin, I can hear your fucking old fashioned.

543
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,740
I can hear those greasy ice cubes in that high ball.

544
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,340
There's just one ice cube

545
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,140
and it's the size of a tennis ball.

546
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,580
It's amazing.

547
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,620
To answer this question,

548
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,300
I think it all depends on the tone of voice

549
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,580
with which he says it.

550
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,060
Thank you?

551
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,220
Thank you.

552
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,860
So glad that's over with.

553
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,660
What if they sing a little bit of the song

554
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Thank You by Jewel?

555
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
Crosses fingers, hopes it's Jewel.

556
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,180
Thank you, Stephanie, for that sex scene.

557
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,420
Thanks for doing the thing with your calves.

558
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,380
With your calves?

559
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,420
Wait, hold on.

560
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,100
What special move does she do with just her calves?

561
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,500
Listen, the whole bit was that it was a weird body part.

562
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,420
Don't maybe open up the Bitcoin and take you inside of it.

563
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,300
Don't maybe dust off the cobwebs of this bit

564
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
and show you the cave paintings on the walls.

565
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,580
Just accept it for what it is.

566
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,340
Jess has got on some forbidden scrolls the Kama Sutra too.

567
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,180
And it's made with calf paste.

568
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,380
A lot of calf stuff.

569
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,860
A lot of calf stuff and a lot of cleanup.

570
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,460
Because the first couple times you're not gonna do it right.

571
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,860
No.

572
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,140
You're not gonna do it right.

573
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,500
I mean, it's pretty.

574
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,180
You just put your calves together and go.

575
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,580
You know how to make love, right?

576
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,860
Just put your calves together and go.

577
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,260
Fuck.

578
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,580
Just take the meaty part of your calf and put it against your mouth.

579
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,500
Okay, hold on.

580
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,060
Thank you.

581
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,540
Thank you.

582
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,500
Isn't it better than some other thing?

583
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,940
He could say like, I'm sorry.

584
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,060
No, but-

585
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,180
I'm sorry would be a bad thing.

586
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,460
There's infinity.

587
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,300
You can say anything anytime.

588
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,220
So let's not broaden it to like all of the things that a person can say.

589
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,780
Look out.

590
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,020
Yeah.

591
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,220
Thank you.

592
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,780
Finally.

593
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,900
Nope.

594
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,780
Just thank you.

595
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,420
I did it.

596
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,820
I think thank you is kind of nice.

597
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,100
It is nice.

598
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,700
Thanks for sharing that gift with me.

599
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,540
Until the one time he does it.

600
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,340
No, that's the thing.

601
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,780
If he's gonna do it every time and he does it like a hundred times in a row, right?

602
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,820
And then the one time they make love and he just like, okay, good night.

603
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,700
And you're just like, where's my fucking thank you?

604
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,500
They're falling asleep and she's like, ah, you're welcome.

605
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,100
Thank you.

606
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,820
Oh, what if you get a Pavlovian response to gratitude and you like, you hold the door

607
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,500
open for someone and they're like, thank you.

608
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,700
And you instantly get a boner.

609
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,260
You're welcome.

610
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,340
Also, also I nutted.

611
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,940
You can probably let the door go.

612
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,700
Like nobody else is coming in.

613
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,620
Well, I just want to be sure, you know, you can never be too sure late arrivals and whatnot.

614
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Just keep my roast beef warm.

615
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,380
Are they at Arby's?

616
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,900
Why is it always at Arby's Justin?

617
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,180
What?

618
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,340
Any situation you invent in your mind is always at Arby's.

619
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,380
Is always at Arby's because it's good mood food.

620
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,860
Thank you.

621
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:26,820
Let's go to my next question.

622
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,220
90% Justin, what's that?

623
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,220
90%.

624
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,820
That's the percent of your life that you're in underwear and underwear gets old fast.

625
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,420
That number seems high.

626
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,260
It seems really, really, really high.

627
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,820
High for me.

628
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,620
You know, I don't sleep.

629
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,740
I sleep.

630
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,380
I don't need inflatron.

631
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,220
Sans pantaloons.

632
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,580
Sans pantalones.

633
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,380
And so it's higher for me.

634
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,740
But anyway, I do wear underwear and I got some me undies.

635
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,900
I know we all have gotten them.

636
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,620
It is, as the advertising states, it's the most comfortable underwear I've ever worn.

637
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,140
And it made me mad that I'm just now getting on this train and I've been wearing, excuse me,

638
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,540
but bad underwear, crummy underwear for 34 years.

639
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,180
Chronically wet underwear everywhere.

640
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,380
Just the worst.

641
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,900
Just inexplicably wet.

642
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,180
Why are you so wet?

643
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,860
Me undies has become my like, I will not travel unless I'm wearing the me undies.

644
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,900
They are the best, most comfortable underpants.

645
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,820
And this is not, this isn't any of that flashy advertising bullshit.

646
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,340
This is straight from the heart.

647
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,380
I love me undies.

648
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,140
They don't ride up.

649
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,740
They pull moisture away from your skin so you can cool all day long.

650
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,260
It's environmentally friendly.

651
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,460
It's low carbon footprint.

652
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,300
There's a very sleek panty line.

653
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,340
Yeah.

654
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,540
Oh, the, yeah.

655
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,180
Oh, and the material is so comfortable.

656
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,980
They're barely, it's a barely their panty line.

657
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,220
They have one pattern that they've sent me that's black and white stripes.

658
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,700
And it makes my dick look like Beetlejuice.

659
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,340
Which is what we've always wanted.

660
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,180
That's what everybody wants.

661
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,220
Am I right fellas?

662
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,580
No, no.

663
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,060
Fellas.

664
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,900
You know when he's that snake on the railing of the stairs?

665
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,020
Makes your dick look like that.

666
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,900
It's like that.

667
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,100
Jump in, Delight.

668
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,300
Talk your body on time.

669
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,940
Okay.

670
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,940
I got a pair that makes my dick look like the monster that Gina Davis turned into with

671
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,500
the big open beak and the eyeballs in her mouth.

672
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:35,380
I got one that makes my dick look like Jim Carrey from Earth Girls Are Easy with Gina Davis.

673
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,180
I got one that looks like the cover of Earth Girls Are Easy.

674
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,060
My dick looks like a spooky Winona Ryder.

675
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,140
So if you go to meundies.com slash my brother.

676
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,220
Do you guys think that's a reference to the room?

677
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,980
Sydney and I were debating this.

678
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,220
What?

679
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,780
Meundies.

680
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,660
No.

681
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,860
No?

682
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,420
Don't think.

683
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,500
No, cause the line in the room is me under wears.

684
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah.

685
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,460
I know, but that's a long URL that they probably...

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:06,740
Anyway, meundies.com slash my brother is gonna get you 20% off your first order and free

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,860
dudes.

695
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,020
They sent some to Sydney cause we're advertising them on Sawbones.

696
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,220
She's crazy about it.

697
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,580
Make your vagina look like a spooky Winona Ryder.

698
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,860
And that's all I'm gonna say about it.

699
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,420
meundies.com slash my brother is the address.

700
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,060
Thank you.

701
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,780
We have a new advertiser this week and I am so excited about it.

702
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,060
It's like the coolest idea.

703
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,540
I love it.

704
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,300
Do you want me to tell you about it?

705
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,860
Cause I will.

706
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:48,900
Hit me.

707
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,860
Just do a good job.

708
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,500
Okay, I'll try.

709
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,620
It's called Blue Apron.

710
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,580
It's our first time with them and I just want to make sure it's a good one.

711
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,540
It's called Blue Apron.

712
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,060
And basically here's how it works.

713
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,700
We all want to eat better.

714
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,740
Everybody does.

715
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,700
We all want to eat well.

716
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,420
Also health conscious, right?

717
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,900
But sometimes you get busy and you're like, oh, I don't have-

718
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,780
The con is on right in 2015.

719
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,740
And if you got to get your look right, if you want to scam like sexual prowess is like

720
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,780
and just being physically sexually attractive is like one of your most valuable tools.

721
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,140
For conning?

722
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,100
As Sawyer.

723
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,060
Yeah, for conning.

724
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,580
Absolutely.

725
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,980
That's why there's no uggos in Ocean's Eleven.

726
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,540
That's not true.

727
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,100
Think about it.

728
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,820
Even even Carl Reiner, looker.

729
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,500
Can we please read?

730
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,060
All right.

731
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,540
We were doing an ad and we were doing such a good job.

732
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,180
And then we all took turns talking about how we fuck Carl Reiner.

733
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,660
What happened?

734
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,340
For $9.99 a meal-

735
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,620
Welcome to the show, Blue Apron.

736
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,540
You can get your money back on the way out.

737
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:52,660
For $9.99 per meal, Blue Apron will send you a refrigerated box with the right high quality

738
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,660
ingredients in the exact right proportions, simple step by step recipe instructions right

739
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,100
to your door to make a meal that is fresh and delicious.

740
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,300
And a fucking low cal, 500, 700 calories per serving.

741
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,900
And you would never think that because good tasting food usually upwards of 14,000 calories.

742
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,660
And you're probably sitting there thinking like, oh, is this like a weird like rice and,

743
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,940
you know, vegetable stew thing?

744
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,460
Like I would get it like Weight Watchers.

745
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,580
No, how about this?

746
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,500
Short rib burgers on pretzel buns.

747
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,820
Kung Pao chicken tacos.

748
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,180
Put that in your face.

749
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,460
I don't know why I'm getting aggressive.

750
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,780
Have a romantic dinner with Carl Reiner and then maybe afterwards you'll get some calf stuff.

751
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,340
Thank you.

752
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,420
Here's the fact, here's the fact of the matter.

753
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,580
If you want to get healthy, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to cook at home.

754
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,900
You have no, you ever tasted something good in a restaurant?

755
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,940
You know, it's secret is butter.

756
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,300
It's always butter.

757
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,820
Guaranteed.

758
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,300
So, so that is a healthy choice.

759
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,860
And you know what?

760
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,340
$9.99 per meal is, is already pretty good.

761
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,500
But if you think about like how much it would cost to go to buy ingredients for a meal and

762
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,500
what you won't use, like what you'll waste, guarantee you'll end up spending more than

763
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,860
that buying ingredients for stuff.

764
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,900
It's an amazing deal.

765
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,260
So maybe you want to go check it out.

766
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,300
Maybe you're just not sure yet.

767
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,380
I don't know why not, but maybe you're not sure yet.

768
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,020
Well, good news.

769
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,420
Go to blue apron.com slash my brother and you'll get your first two meals free.

770
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,380
So you can check out the menu, see what's on the menu this week.

771
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,580
Get two meals for you by going to blue apron.com slash my brother.

772
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,300
Go check it out.

773
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,380
It's, it's a really, really cool service.

774
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,740
I'm fucking legit going to do this as soon as we hang up this scape call.

775
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,940
I got a message.

776
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,300
I got a message for Kitty Bear and it's from Seagoat.

777
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,980
Seagoat says a very happy birthday.

778
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,140
I was going to do like an impression of a goat underwater, but then I thought it's too

779
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,700
easy.

780
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,060
So I, instead I elected to do nothing funny.

781
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,580
Seagoat said a very happy birthday to the best wife a dummy like me could possibly ask

782
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,140
for.

783
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,100
I hope you have an unbelievably perfect year and most of all, thanks for vibing with me

784
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,060
and keeping it real.

785
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:56,740
Also fish and poos say happy B-day as well, but they are too cheap to chip in XOXO.

786
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:02,660
And I imagine that's some sort of secret code that activates some sort of sleeper cell.

787
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,540
But happy birthday to Kitty Bear.

788
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,220
Can you just use the real names?

789
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,100
I feel like I'm talking to a couple of angel fire websites.

790
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,540
Those, those are their, those are their given names.

791
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,300
I don't think that they are.

792
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,020
Wait, let me check.

793
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,060
Yeah, they are.

794
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,420
Those are their Christian names.

795
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,460
I don't think we've said one true thing this whole episode.

796
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,300
No, we talked about Carl Reiner being attractive.

797
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,500
He's super fuckable.

798
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,700
I have another message for Joe Lee, Lee Fieri.

799
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,980
Hold up.

800
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,220
They provided a, a phonetic pronunciation and I'm still fucking it up.

801
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:41,300
Joe Lee Fieri crushed it and it's from Greg, Sean, Ryan, and John.

802
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,940
Greg, Sean, Ryan, and John say we'd like to wish a happy birthday to the world

803
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:53,620
class graphic designer and overlord of felt, Joe Lee Fieri, though he bears the form of

804
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,940
a roguishly handsome man of 29 years and claims November 6th for his birthday.

805
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:03,140
He is in fact an immortal deity who has sworn never to leave his house of girders until

806
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,500
his space seed has created a race of Superman.

807
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,060
Correct.

808
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,460
So all right, this is like our third or fourth deity that we've canonized on the show.

809
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,020
So thanks.

810
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,940
Welcome to the halls of honor, Joe.

811
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,260
Uh, we will sing songs in your name and we will light braziers in your honor and we're

812
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,780
going to burn stuff in those braziers.

813
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,580
But when the time comes for the end of days, we will have to kill you to siphon your energy.

814
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,340
We hope that's cool with you.

815
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,820
It'll be worth it.

816
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,940
We hope that's all right.

817
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,820
Yeah, I feel it's an even trade.

818
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,180
It's all right.

819
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,140
I have to tell you guys before we move on back to the comedy, not that this hasn't been

820
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,540
funny and we did that great Carl Reiner bit, went ahead and got my two free meals from

821
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,900
Blue Apron while we've been sitting here.

822
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,460
Got to tell you on the menu this week, Mexican style rice and beef casserole with black beans

823
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,860
and Monterey Jack cheese, chicken malagatua nice soup with kohlrabi and basmati rice and

824
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,620
pistachio crusted catfish with Israeli couscous, roasted fennel and orange salad.

825
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,180
Mother don't mind if I fucking do.

826
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,620
Those sound delicious.

827
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,180
Also, Justin, do you feel that you were giving your undivided attention to Kitty Bear and

828
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,500
to Joe while you were doing that?

829
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,380
Guys, if I know anything about fucking Kitty Bear and Joe, it's that they would want me

830
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,940
to not miss out on the Mexican style rice and beef casserole.

831
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
It would have been there 15 minutes later.

832
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,620
You're not going to get that.

833
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,180
It's not like there's an expiration date on that website.

834
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,900
You don't know that.

835
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,420
You are fucking guessing.

836
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,780
Hold on, let me look at the website.

837
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,980
Yep, they're out of pistachio crusted catfish or whatever you said.

838
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,660
You got the last one, Justin.

839
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,780
Glad I caught on it.

840
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,900
Totally worth it.

841
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,500
So, happy birthday to Joe.

842
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,700
It's too late.

843
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,180
Happy birthday to-

844
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,060
No, no, you missed it.

845
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,620
It's too late.

846
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,380
No, listen, let me get in here.

847
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,420
Make room for Justin.

848
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,660
They don't want to miss out on my special brand of humor.

849
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,380
Hold on.

850
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,740
Let me get something for you.

851
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,300
Kitty Bear, it's like two animals together.

852
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,740
Joe Le Fieri, kind of like Guy Fieri.

853
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:02,900
Yeah, they specifically provided the phonetic pronunciation

854
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,580
so that we wouldn't say Fieri.

855
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,300
Griffin, go ahead and just edit those jokes in.

856
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,340
I don't have to edit them in.

857
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,220
They're already in the show.

858
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,140
What a subpar product.

859
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,740
I hope you choke on that fucking delicious

860
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,980
pistachio crusted catfish, you piece of shit.

861
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,860
You don't mean that.

862
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,220
You don't mean that.

863
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,500
This shows nothing without me.

864
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,700
As the last two sponsored messages proved,

865
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,220
this shows nothing without my attention as we went off the rails.

866
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,180
I listen to Bullseye to be cooler and more cultured

867
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,340
than the people who don't know about Bullseye yet.

868
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,740
Of course, then I tell them about Bullseye,

869
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,660
so it doesn't usually work for very long.

870
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,820
Bullseye's your guide to what's good from MaximumFun.org and NPR.

871
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,540
So I'm happily engaged to a wonderfully bearded

872
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,820
So I'm happily engaged to a wonderfully bearded man.

873
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,500
It's wonderful bearded man, but how delightfully bearded?

874
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,540
I'm engaged to an inescapably bearded man.

875
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,180
An unavoidably bearded man.

876
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,140
We both love food and go out to eat often.

877
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,540
This is great fun, except for one detail.

878
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,860
Every time we go out to the restaurant,

879
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,260
he has to leave at some point to use the bathroom.

880
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,780
My dog.

881
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,180
Except I often get pity looks from the wait staff,

882
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,620
and sometimes they even ask if I've been ditched by my date.

883
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,860
How do I avoid this unwanted attention?

884
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,060
My boyfriend, my bathroom, and me in bold.

885
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
How long is he gone?

886
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,300
I thought that fucking beard was gonna come into it.

887
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,700
Like you get soup in there and it's yucky.

888
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,380
You dropped your own little red herring there.

889
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,260
You did your own con.

890
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,980
Sydney says that I can't go into a public place

891
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,460
without using the bath, like if they have a bath.

892
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,940
We've talked about this.

893
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,580
I've gotta check it out.

894
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,180
You always fucking keep your exits wide.

895
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,980
You always slice the pie every time you go into a bin again.

896
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,340
So you're like, excuse me, we need a table for two

897
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,340
and I need a map of the facilities.

898
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,740
I have gotten better about this.

899
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,460
Here's what I think is fair from your perspective.

900
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,740
I think it's fair to say, listen,

901
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,740
I understand you wanna go in and make some room

902
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,740
or wash your hands or whatever you're doing in there.

903
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,540
Can you please just try to keep it like infill, ex-fill,

904
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,340
super stealth, no scope, seal team six, in and out,

905
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,100
and not leave me sitting at the table for ages.

906
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,700
Or just leave your jacket on the chair.

907
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,100
Can you just leave your jacket on the chair

908
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,860
so people know you're coming back?

909
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,980
Or a little note that says like, be back in five minutes.

910
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,700
Bathroom and bathroom and again.

911
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,740
Oh, maybe we just need like Oscar seat fillers.

912
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,780
That, oh God, Travis, that's a really good idea.

913
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,100
You can go to the bathroom for as long as you want,

914
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,460
but to stand in for me, his name is Kyle Pearson.

915
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,260
He's from Central Cast and he's handsomer than I am.

916
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,340
He's ready to talk about whatever you wanna talk about.

917
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,660
See, in 10 to 15, I had beans earlier.

918
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,140
Can we not?

919
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,860
I'm sorry, that got, it got cheap at the end there.

920
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,060
I was trying to think of a meal

921
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,580
that would make it difficult to poop.

922
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,860
And a bunch of bubblegum and beans was all I had.

923
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,100
Right, excuse me, excuse me.

924
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,140
Is your boyfriend gone?

925
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,700
No, he ate a lot of bubblegum earlier.

926
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,660
Are you okay?

927
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,180
He's having a rough time, but he's definitely real.

928
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,380
He's very real.

929
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,260
He eats bubblegum only.

930
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,540
Bubblegum and string and it gets real rough down there.

931
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,500
Do you think it's hard for aspiring actors

932
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,500
working as waiters to see people getting solid work

933
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,140
as bathroom seat fillers at restaurants?

934
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,580
Like they can aspire to that?

935
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,100
Like man, I love that.

936
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,260
I bet they're really uppity and artsy about it

937
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,860
and they're like, yeah, I could sell out

938
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,420
and be a bathroom seat filler too,

939
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,180
but I'm holding out, you know what I mean?

940
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,340
Like, yeah, there was an audition

941
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,820
and my agent tried to send me to be a bathroom seat filler,

942
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,820
but I said, no, I'm gonna wait and be on NCIS New Orleans.

943
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,940
Yeah, shoot for the stars.

944
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,020
Which I just watched the other day

945
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,620
and Bakla is so good in it.

946
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,140
Yeah, of course he is.

947
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,100
Bakla is Bakla in NCIS New Orleans.

948
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,020
Did you guys know that the fucking sun came up this morning?

949
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,220
As long as we're like talking about shit

950
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,020
that everybody knows.

951
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,820
Everybody knows that Bakla is gonna knock it out of the park.

952
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,780
This is why Bakla is amazing at NCIS New Orleans, Griffin.

953
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,700
Not only does he do a fine job,

954
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,100
but at no point do you get the feeling

955
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,060
that he's embarrassed to be on NCIS New Orleans.

956
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,620
No, of course not.

957
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,380
Like he's giving it not only his full talent,

958
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,060
but his heart and soul.

959
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,300
Yeah.

960
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,060
And it was even a crossover episode

961
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,220
with the people from NCIS Florida,

962
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,020
I got whatever the NCIS progenitor was.

963
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,220
It was a full crossover so that dude

964
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,660
who played the awesome secret service agent in West Wing

965
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,620
was there too.

966
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:55,860
Yeah.

967
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,620
And Bakla just outshone them all.

968
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,500
Outshone them all.

969
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,340
NCIS Vero Beach, Florida.

970
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,100
That's the fucking Bakla guarantee.

971
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,260
He puts his heart and soul into everything.

972
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,780
If he were my seat filler.

973
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,300
Well, first of all, if you were my seat filler,

974
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,540
I would come back and oops, no wife.

975
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,340
Wife's gone.

976
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Wife's gone, Bakla's gone, car's gone.

977
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,580
House is gone, life is gone.

978
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,460
Family gone.

979
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,500
Future.

980
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,860
He 20'd off-teamed you.

981
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,140
Oh, I got conned.

982
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,820
Only it didn't take a whole year, did it?

983
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,020
It took 14 seconds.

984
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,900
Are you Scott Bakula?

985
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,380
Yes.

986
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,020
Are you sure?

987
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,580
Yes.

988
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,300
Do your NCIS New Orleans accent for me.

989
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,260
You're a high-other.

990
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,060
Oh, okay.

991
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,860
To the car.

992
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,340
Come on.

993
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,460
We can make love on the way.

994
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,420
We can make love on the way.

995
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,940
I will say thank you the whole time.

996
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,660
I will say thank you.

997
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,380
On the way to where?

998
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,500
Wherever.

999
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,380
Take me wherever.

1000
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,420
Take me to New Orleans.

1001
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,820
My life with Griffin is over now.

1002
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,860
It was good while it lasted,

1003
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,020
but you're Scott fucking Bakula.

1004
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,380
Can I just say the greatest guesspert get?

1005
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,100
Don't, don't say it.

1006
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,500
Don't say it.

1007
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,300
Don't even jinx it.

1008
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,020
Don't even jinx it.

1009
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,660
Fucking 2015, Bakula, if you're out there,

1010
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,300
and I know you are.

1011
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,420
So you're saying it.

1012
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,820
Please.

1013
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,700
You're just saying it now.

1014
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,780
What's wrong with saying it?

1015
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,820
You're just doing jinx it.

1016
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,780
Don't you guys know how the fucking secret works?

1017
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,580
Law of attraction.

1018
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,540
You write down a secret.

1019
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,820
You bury it in your yard.

1020
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,660
You hand it to Scott Bakula.

1021
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,420
You got to put the vibe out into the universe.

1022
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,480
Okay.

1023
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,000
Okay.

1024
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,380
Do you guys want to know Yahoo?

1025
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:21,860
Yes, please.

1026
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,340
Please.

1027
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,820
It's Yahoo.

1028
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,660
It was sent in by Jesse Stanchak.

1029
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,300
Thank you, Jesse.

1030
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,740
It's by Yahoo Answers user Matt,

1031
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,260
who has a 100% best answers rating.

1032
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,740
So we're dealing with banking royalty.

1033
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,300
Here.

1034
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Matt doesn't step into the game very often,

1035
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,020
but when he does, he crushes it.

1036
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,300
In fact, he only-

1037
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,700
He's from an alternate reality Yahoo Answers

1038
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,580
where people only answer if they have a fucking answer

1039
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,940
to answer the thing with.

1040
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,980
Anyway, Matt asks,

1041
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,700
with all of his infinite wisdom,

1042
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,340
astral projection sex?

1043
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,540
And then in parentheses, noob question.

1044
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,220
I'm noob.

1045
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,860
I'm a noob to astrally projecting myself into sex situations.

1046
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,780
I would like to try to have an out of body experience.

1047
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,220
I've been reading about astral sex.

1048
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,460
More like an into body experience.

1049
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:13,940
Stop it.

1050
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay.

1051
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,300
No, you can keep doing it.

1052
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,180
Okay, thank you.

1053
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,100
I've been reading about astral-

1054
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,540
Because what I was saying was like,

1055
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,060
you're going into someone's body.

1056
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,940
Yep, yep.

1057
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,180
I've been reading about astral sex

1058
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,220
and that if you have astral sex with say,

1059
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,820
someone like your crush,

1060
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,940
they will dream about you sexually in the physical world.

1061
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,820
Hold up.

1062
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,620
Wait, if you have sex with them astrally,

1063
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,140
they'll dream about you sexually in the physical world.

1064
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,500
Okay, now I'm on board again.

1065
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,820
Got it.

1066
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,780
All makes sense.

1067
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,260
I see this as impossible,

1068
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,060
but yet I read it happens.

1069
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,260
So is this possible?

1070
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,300
So this is this person's first astral experience

1071
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,540
and they think just out the gate,

1072
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,660
they're going to leave their body into the fucking ether

1073
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,100
and then be fucking up there?

1074
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,020
No, you got to walk before you can run

1075
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,140
before you can have sex.

1076
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,700
You have to astrally hold hands first.

1077
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,260
Right.

1078
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Well, you have to astrally develop hands.

1079
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,700
You're just going to be sort of an amorphous swarm

1080
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,140
of thoughts up there.

1081
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,580
Can I just say that like,

1082
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,580
it beautifully sums up people on the internet

1083
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,700
to say the sentence,

1084
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,220
I don't think this is true,

1085
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,100
but then I read that it was.

1086
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,380
So is it?

1087
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:27,780
Is it?

1088
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,500
You know, every time you have deja vu,

1089
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,420
that means that someone just had astral projection sex with you

1090
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,620
while watching the matrix?

1091
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,540
Suck on that copper top.

1092
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:41,940
I don't.

1093
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,220
I got it.

1094
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,620
This has to be two people projecting themselves, right?

1095
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,300
Because you can't just like astrally project

1096
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,140
of fit.

1097
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,340
You can't manifest physical change in the material realm

1098
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,020
when you are just a fucking thought swarm up there in the ether.

1099
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,900
So you have to be with somebody else's astral existence

1100
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,380
and then fucking them and they're fucking you.

1101
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,820
And then it's a very cordial thank you.

1102
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,220
Thank you.

1103
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,700
Use it back into your bodies before midnight

1104
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,860
or else you are going to stay the animal

1105
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,300
that you anamorphed into forever.

1106
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:19,620
Correct.

1107
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,780
Correct, correct.

1108
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,980
My question is this.

1109
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,900
The end result of this, like, you know-

1110
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,180
You have all question.

1111
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,980
Yes, just to clarify.

1112
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,060
Everything else, totally clear.

1113
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,380
The end result of this-

1114
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,460
Was it the anamorphs thing that you got lost in?

1115
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,140
Cause it got a little tangly.

1116
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,100
No, I followed that.

1117
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,420
If you do this, right?

1118
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,860
I'm trying to follow the chain here.

1119
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,580
You astrally project have sex with someone, right?

1120
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,660
Then they dream about it because you're astrally fucking them

1121
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,420
and they're dreaming about it.

1122
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,300
Is the hope that then the next day they walk up to you and go,

1123
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,980
hey, this is going to sound weird,

1124
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,180
but I dreamed last night that we fucked

1125
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,300
and it was so, so good that I want to do it in RL.

1126
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,380
So the partner who's not astrally projecting is dreaming.

1127
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,300
They're not also astrally projecting.

1128
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,060
That's not, it's two different realms.

1129
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,060
The dream realm and the astral realm.

1130
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,340
Are you fucking kidding me?

1131
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,900
Wait, so are you astrally projecting into their dream?

1132
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,420
You can't do that.

1133
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,460
That's science fiction.

1134
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:15,860
I have a very-

1135
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,380
So you're astrally projecting,

1136
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,340
having sex with their essence?

1137
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,940
Yeah, their astral essence.

1138
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,980
It has to be, listen, we're getting into semantics now.

1139
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,220
I have a much more important question for us.

1140
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,540
Okay.

1141
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,980
To all ponder, to really put into our thoughts for a while.

1142
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,220
Say you anamorph into a lion.

1143
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,500
Are you both paying attention?

1144
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,620
Yeah, so on it.

1145
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,900
It's really important.

1146
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,060
Okay, I'll stop ordering my blue apron meals.

1147
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,180
Yeah, put that away for a second.

1148
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,740
Close the tab.

1149
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:50,660
Okay, you anamorph into a lion for an animorse mission

1150
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,860
and you accidentally stay morphed for over two hours.

1151
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,340
Okay.

1152
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,060
And when you do that, you're that animal just for life.

1153
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,860
Correct.

1154
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,380
That is what happened to Tobias.

1155
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,500
Tobias done turned into a fucking hawk because he's a dummy

1156
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,780
and he didn't look at his fucking hawk.

1157
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,780
No, he had to stay hidden up in the rafters

1158
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,460
or else he was gonna get caught, Griffin.

1159
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,460
You're a lion now for life.

1160
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,260
Okay.

1161
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,140
And you got other animorphs buddies who are more responsible

1162
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,460
than you.

1163
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,340
They can turn human and they know like, oh, man.

1164
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,900
Oh, Steven, he's a lion now.

1165
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,620
Leo.

1166
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,500
No, that's too easy.

1167
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,060
Lion-O, he's a lion now.

1168
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,820
Steven, he's a lion now.

1169
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,140
And you're still lying and they come to visit like,

1170
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,340
hey, Steven, you're like,

1171
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,380
because you're a lion.

1172
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,900
Growl, growl, growl, beef, beef, beef.

1173
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:42,820
My question is what is the length of time you have to go

1174
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,740
before you can start fucking lions?

1175
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,460
Because you've been a human this whole time and you're human.

1176
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,020
Your rolling crew, your animorphs road dogs,

1177
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,660
fucking know that you used to be a dude

1178
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,820
and now you're fucking lions.

1179
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,780
Well, Griffin.

1180
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,660
What's the length of time?

1181
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,340
What's the comfort zone there?

1182
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,820
Griffin.

1183
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,940
There is a time, because what happens to Tobias is

1184
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,420
eventually his humanity starts to slip away

1185
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,260
and he starts to like actually hunt

1186
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,140
and like become more of a hawk type of person.

1187
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,060
So, or that's Tobias wanting to fuck some hawks

1188
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,300
and saying like, oh, I guess I just really became a hawk.

1189
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,100
Oh, no, it's what?

1190
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,060
Oh, animal instincts.

1191
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,620
I don't know.

1192
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,820
Gosh, I'm losing my humanity.

1193
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,300
Be right back.

1194
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,460
Fucking thank you.

1195
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,060
Oh, my God.

1196
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,100
I'm gonna lay an egg.

1197
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,820
Is that how it works?

1198
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,940
It took me.

1199
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,220
It took me roughly two decades to figure out

1200
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,180
if human women wanted to have sex with me.

1201
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,020
So I think it's pretty fucking like optimistic to think

1202
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,580
I'm gonna jump into the lion world midstream.

1203
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,140
Be like, son, new to the game.

1204
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,260
And it'll be my decision.

1205
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,020
All on the prowl and ready to growl.

1206
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,900
Come on, ladies.

1207
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,540
Yeah.

1208
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,900
Hey, good news, ladies.

1209
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,420
I'm a really shitty lion who's ready to fucking clown.

1210
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,220
Don't ask me to hunt or do anything

1211
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,980
or do like any of the mating rituals.

1212
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,420
I don't know any of that shit.

1213
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,060
I just wanna get up on that.

1214
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,220
You know that someone's gonna see Steve

1215
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,660
and make this lion transformation

1216
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,900
and get all the fucking lion play,

1217
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,500
all the fucking feline action he could ever hope for.

1218
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,660
And then all of a sudden, maybe a week later,

1219
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,260
oh, what happened to Mark?

1220
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,180
Mark, you stayed over two hours.

1221
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,740
Whoops, guess I'm a deer forever.

1222
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,100
Mark, hurry and change back.

1223
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,620
It's been an hour and 58 minutes.

1224
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,540
Yeah, okay, let me try.

1225
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,820
Ooh, weird, it's not working.

1226
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,940
You must've set your watch wrong.

1227
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,580
Be right back.

1228
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,180
I mean, on the one side, you're a lion

1229
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,780
who knows none of the mating rituals.

1230
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,820
On the plus side, you do have an ATM card.

1231
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,660
And you can drive a car.

1232
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,740
You can drive a car and buy as much meat

1233
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,180
for the other lions as you want,

1234
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,700
which is a pretty powerful move.

1235
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,200
Yeah.

1236
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,640
The hardest part about picking up female lions

1237
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,160
is how do you neg them?

1238
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,040
What do you say?

1239
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,720
They're perfect and sinewy.

1240
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,160
They're perfect sinewy beautiful.

1241
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,840
There's nothing you could take away from them.

1242
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,080
Hey, fat haunches, get over here.

1243
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Nothing, you have nothing on them.

1244
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,680
They're perfect killing machines.

1245
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,080
I guess I just think your jaws are too powerful.

1246
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,880
Like your whiskers.

1247
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,880
No, wait, I don't like your whiskers.

1248
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,000
Are we having sex?

1249
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,320
Us?

1250
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,720
Are you a former anamorph that got trapped in,

1251
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,840
oh, nope, just a lion.

1252
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,880
Okay, you can never tell.

1253
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
This has been our show, my brother, my brother and me.

1254
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,120
We hope you've had some lofts.

1255
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,960
Also hope this isn't your first episode.

1256
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,420
Woof.

1257
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,360
So we live shows coming to a town near you in 2015.

1258
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,160
We're doing a show in LA that sold out,

1259
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,080
but we are doing another show at San Francisco Sketch Fest.

1260
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,640
I believe tickets for that are still available.

1261
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,080
That's with JJ Go.

1262
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,480
So you're getting a pretty great value for that.

1263
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,320
That's February 7th at 1pm at Cobbs Comedy Club.

1264
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,280
You can get seats right for that show at the address

1265
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,560
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Sketch Fest.

1266
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,920
Also, we've got new live shows coming out.

1267
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,680
Like Justin said, we're going to announce those next week.

1268
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,160
So make sure you tune into the Twitter

1269
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,200
and you tune into the show.

1270
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,360
Also, if you're listening to this,

1271
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,440
either on the day it comes out or the day after,

1272
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,160
so the 5th or 6th, on the 6th,

1273
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,360
we have me and Andy are doing a Bunker Buddies live show

1274
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,840
with Jordan Jesse Go at UCB Franklin at 11pm.

1275
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,840
And tickets for that are still available.

1276
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,080
They're only $5 and we really want to see you there.

1277
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,240
This is the first Max Fund Presents

1278
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,560
and we want to do more at the UCB.

1279
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,960
So we really appreciate you guys coming out and supporting us.

1280
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,840
You can get tickets for that at bit.ly forward slash BBJJGO LA.

1281
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,000
All lowercase and we really want to see you out there.

1282
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,760
It can be uppercase too, Travis.

1283
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,320
Oh, sure.

1284
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:53,720
Okay.

1285
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,240
And actually, it actually can't.

1286
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,280
We fucked around with that.

1287
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,080
You're kidding me.

1288
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,920
Before, you know, it's case sensitive.

1289
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,040
What the fuck, internet?

1290
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,400
You changed overnight.

1291
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,040
Speaking of Bunker Buddies and Jordan Jesse Go,

1292
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,840
go check out all the other Maximum Fun.org shows.

1293
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,160
They're all incredible.

1294
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,680
Let's do a special plug for the Adventure Zone

1295
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,920
because several people will tell us

1296
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,120
every time a new episode is released

1297
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,360
that they didn't know we were doing this.

1298
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:24,200
We do a D&D fantasy adventure with our daddy, Clint,

1299
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,400
where we, you know, basically just play D&D and you listen.

1300
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,880
And people have been really, really nice about the show.

1301
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,960
It's our most popular show by far.

1302
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,200
It is one day going to supersede my bim bam

1303
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,360
and become the flagship of the empire.

1304
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,000
Believe that.

1305
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,480
So go look for the Adventure Zone on iTunes,

1306
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,080
subscribe to it, rate it, review it if you can.

1307
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,160
You know where they can fucking find it?

1308
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,520
At the-

1309
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,120

Theadventure.zone.

00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,600
It is our website.

1312
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,600
We got episodes, we got character sheets,

1313
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,800
we got fucking art.

1314
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,800
There's a dude, Leon Rosilar, I believe is his name,

1315
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,160
who's done art for the past two episodes.

1316
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,160
That is like a summary of the episodes

1317
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,600
and they're fucking incredible.

1318
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,520
You can find those at theadventure.zone

1319
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,680

00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,160
So go there, subscribe.

1321
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,520
If you could tweet also,

1322
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,480
if you get into D&D as a result of our show,

1323
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,440
please tweet at Wizards of the Coast

1324
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,800
just to say like, hey, you know, I'm into this

1325
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,200
because maybe they'll tweet about our show

1326
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,600
and then we'll get famous and maybe get free shit.

1327
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,440
We also want to say thanks again to MeUndies

1328
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,240

1329
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,320

So that's pretty cool.

1333
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,200
Here's a great reason to go to theadventure.zone by the way.

1334
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,680
You can see a picture of our dad cosplaying

1335
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,200
as his character, Merle Highchurch, at our holiday show.

1336
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,480
Don't miss that.

1337
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,560
And also don't miss your chance

1338
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,880
to get a great deal from Blue Apron.

1339
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,720
You can get your first two meals free

1340
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,040
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

1341

Get all that stuff.

1342
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,320
Big thanks to the Long Winters

1343
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,280
for the use of our theme song,

1344
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,600
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1345
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,360
It's a great, great album, great song,

1346
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,240
great music, great friends, great times, great-

1347
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,160
Good brews.

1348
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,480
Great summer, great summer party times

1349
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,320
and just like the best spring break I've ever been on.

1350
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,820
Yeah.

1351
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,000
Is that it?

1352
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,480
Is that everything?

1353
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,440
We got a new animated short,

1354
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,160
Grift of the Magi.

1355
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,120
It's on our YouTube channel.

1356
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,600
YouTube.com slash NBNBAM.

1357
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,080
You can find it there.

1358
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,760
Go subscribe and rate and review that

1359
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,880
and share it with people.

1360
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,720
It's a really good way if you've been trying to figure out

1361
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,400
how to get other people into it.

1362
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,160
I think those cartoons made by our boy Tyler Crowley

1363
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,880
are a pretty good way of getting people into the show.

1364
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,480
So go check this out.

1365
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,280
I think it's everything.

1366
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,760
Grift, do you have a last Yahoo answer for us?

1367
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,480
Yeah.

1368
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,440
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by game recognized game,

1369
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,160
Rachel Sperling.

1370
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,800
Thank you, Rachel.

1371
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,320
It's by Yahoo answers user K who asks,

1372
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,720
Does fish oil make your booty pop?

1373
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,640
I'm Justin McElroy.

1374
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1375
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1376
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,480
This is from my brother.

1377
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,280
My brother may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1382
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,000
Hello, I'm Taco, the elephant magician.

1383
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,600
Well, hi church here.

I'm Magnus Burnside, the fighter.

1386
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,360
Did you guys like that?

1387
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,160
Did you, the listener, like that?

1388
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,200
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic

1389
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,680
where anything can happen and anything is possible.

1390
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,560
I am Griffin McElroy, dungeon master for the Adventure Zone,

1391
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,400
a new podcast on Maximumfun in which magic and mystery intertwine

1392
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,080
for a very erotically charged role playing experience.

1393
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,520
You can catch it every other Thursday here on Maximumfun.org or iTunes.

1394
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:06,440
It's for Dungeons and Dragons, but with family.
