1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,120
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:04,080
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Ooh, ooh, ooh, have an Anna? Have ooh, ooh, ooh.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,480
Amy, pretty, smart, smart. Gorilla, gorilla, gorilla.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Ladies and gentlemen, it's certainly become clear to you by now.

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,200
We have Dawn of the Planet of the Apes of the Fever. Yeah, we're crazy for it. New picture

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,440
coming out this week. Got Andy Serkis as Caesar, of course, doing that mocap. Jason Clarke is here.

12
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,160
Keri Russell, Felicity, and monkeys in one movie. Thank you very much. Halfway through the movie

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,240
is the monkey cut her hair. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. I do have to, and I hope this isn't

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,200
sacrilege because we do all have monkey fever. How whack does your movie have to be before

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,800
James Franco is like, sorry, I can't do that, and also I was in Spring Breakers. Like, I can't get

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,720
there with you for a sequel. We can't do this together. You want me to act with virtual monkeys?

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,640
No thank you. I'm going to go kick it with Vanessa Hudgens. No thank you. A virtual Vanessa Hudgens.

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,800
Virtual Vanessa Hudgens in Spring Breakers? It's just, it's a man, it's a gaffer with a big bushy

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
beard, and he's holding a tennis ball, and he's saying, Franco, look at the tennis ball and pretend

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,920
it is Vanessa Hudgens. Now touch it with your nose and get a treat. Touch it with your face.

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,320
It's Vanessa Hudgens face, and when you see this tennis ball, hold on, let me get my Sharpie up.

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Okay, I've drawn a face on this. Okay, he's not doing it. He's distracted. Hold on one second.

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,160
Let me smear a little peanut butter on the tennis ball. Go, Franco, go. Yummy.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,920
Um, I gotta admit, I'm more, I have, I'm more excited about another film. I've got boyhood fever.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,640
Okay. Like Scarlet fever? I would not go around loudly proclaiming that you have boyhood fever.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,080
I have boyhood fever! It's a new Linklater film. It's a bold filmmaking experiment. It shows a boy,

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,720
and they filmed him for like 11 or 13 years or something, until he became basically a man.

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,400
Griffin, uh, when you loudly proclaimed that you had boyhood fever,

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,520
did you instantly grow a perfectly coiffed mustache?

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,160
Where is this tucked in, tucked in button-down shirt coming from?

31
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,680
You can laugh if you want.

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,720
If you hadn't heard of this movie, which I had until last night, apparently they shot,

33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,240
uh, it over 12 years, so you see a boy becoming a man.

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
I just said that.

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
In many ways, this podcast is our boyhood.

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,560
It's our boyhood, sure. No, I was, I was, but low onto a child when, when we started this thing.

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
I was 22 fucking years old. Can you imagine anybody that young, ever?

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,480
Nobody's ever been that young.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
And when you were a child, you goofed like a child,

40
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,000
but now as a man, you've put away such childish goofs.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,440
The one, the only time I felt that young, I think, in recent memory,

42
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,040
is when I was sitting in the theater for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,560
and I saw all my favorite characters, all the classic monkeys returning for another, uh,

44
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,600
Chim Chim,

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Caesar, uh,

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,880
The Monkey King,

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,560
Grondo,

48
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,360
The Strong One,

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,240
Gronk,

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,880
Gordito,

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,560
Beaver,

52
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,400
Bumblebee,

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
Optimus Primal,

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,680
Banana Boy, Banana Boy with an I, and that's not a monkey.

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
That's like a man, that was like a man that they kept around.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,120
Gorilla Grodd.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,960
I can't wait.

58
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
This movie's been getting great reviews.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,760
It's 91% fresh, and that doesn't even need any more debate.

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,320
If you haven't seen a movie in a while, and you've been looking for an opportunity,

61
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,080
I don't even think you need to see the last one.

62
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
You'll go ape for it.

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,000
You'll go ape for it. You will, Travis.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,840
That's funny because, um, uh, in the title, the monkeys.

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
I want to go-

66
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
Please don't email us, like, telling us the difference.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
Do we fucking get it? That's the fucking joke.

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,080
That's the fucking joke.

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,520
Do we need to take you to fucking-

70
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
We need to give you a fucking comedy clinic right now?

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
You piece of trash.

72
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
That's the fucking-

73
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Wow, we really turned on a dime there.

74
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
About my science books and-

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
Fuck you, that's the fucking-

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
Do you think-

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880
Just go ahead-

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
I love it when people are just like,

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,480
Oh, I don't know if they're being serious or not,

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,960
so let's just assume the shittiest thing about them.

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
There's a fucking joke.

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,000
And you know what?

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Let me give you a little secret about your science book.

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
You know, people want to throw science books in our face all the time, constantly.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Duck, you know, here comes another one.

86
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,360
But here's the thing about that.

87
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,760
That's going to be outdated in five years.

88
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
It'll all be like, remember that last book?

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,560
It was bullshit.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
We were lying about all of it.

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,760
Here's the new shit, but this is really real.

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
Apes and monkeys are the same thing.

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,760
Look at the apes.

94
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,240
They're just-

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
They're bigger.

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
And if we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?

97
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,240
You know?

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
Uh oh.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,640
Come on, science.

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,360
We are disassembling science one step at a time,

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,760
but we're helping you to rebuild your life.

102
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,400
We'll check back in at the end to knock down some more science.

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
I promise you that all our advice will not be

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,040
go see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in theaters this weekend.

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Which one is it?

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,440
Rise is the first one, but I think that's confusing to me, right?

107
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,920
Because Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it's not.

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,240
And Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not the same.

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
It should have been Dawn first.

110
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
That's what always confuses me.

111
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
You can't rise before the dawn.

112
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
It's Dawn and then Rise.

113
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
Why wasn't Dawn first and then Rise?

114
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,200
It makes me very angry.

115
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,920
I love these movies and I love this franchise.

116
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,320
And this is the only thing wrong with it so far.

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,040
This is the only thing they've fucked up so far.

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,400
The rest of the movie is like the best movie ever, basically.

119
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Yeah, that-

120
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
Yeah, the only thing I don't like about it.

121
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,560
It's like if they made a sequel to Boyhood and called it Baby.

122
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,120
Babykins, a Richard Linklater film.

123
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,840
Baby Genius.

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
Did you see the geniuses?

125
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
Did you see the new Richard Linklater Baby Geniuses?

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,160
It's just two Baby Geniuses walking through the streets of Versailles.

127
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,320
And one of them's dying and they're just talking about-

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,160
One of them's dying and they're talking about the nature of life and death.

129
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,880
And then they'll take a break and someone will write them a poem below the Arc de Triomphe.

130
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
And also Ethan Hawke is there.

131
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
I really want to see this movie now.

132
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
Man, it was a fucking good movie.

133
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
There was no Baby Geniuses 3.

134
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,200
There was Super Babies Baby Geniuses 2.

135
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,160
And that's the one where they had a little person

136
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,400
with a baby's face superimposed over their head as they danced.

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,840
I did not enjoy that scene.

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
That was a troubling scene.

139
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,960
But this is a troubling podcast and we're going to try to untrouble you.

140
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
We have time for one and a half questions now.

141
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
All right, let's spin it up.

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,960
In a moment of weakness and lacking insight from the brothers wise,

143
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
I agreed to let my nephew move into my basement.

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,080
He's in a band.

145
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,960
He pays no rent, eats all our food, leaves messes, and generally acts like a 14 year old.

146
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
How can I get him to pack up his bags and move away?

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,640
That's from Carl the Grumpy Old Man in Lincoln, Nebraska.

148
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,200
Is he 14 years old?

149
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
That's a really good question.

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
I don't understand how all this lines up.

151
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay, there's a if he's 32, this is a much different question than if he's like 19.

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,920
You know, it's so rare that you get to do something nice for somebody like this.

153
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,400
You could, I could connive a few ways for you to get rid of them.

154
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,520
You know, like, I mean, there's fake ghosts, fake haunting, the basis on it.

155
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,000
That's easy.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,960
You could gaslight them.

157
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,840
Gaslight them.

158
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,760
That's just every day remove one article of something from their room.

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,000
Something from their room and put it like in storage or move it to an apartment.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,880
This is going to be a really long term plan, but like just one sock, you know, on Monday

161
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,680
and then like a CD on Tuesday and just slowly move them out of the house.

162
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,840
Can you start an even louder band on the top floor?

163
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,480
Do you know what I mean?

164
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,440
Like if he's rocking all day and night on his his strat, then maybe you buy an even

165
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
bigger Marshall stack, point that towards the ground and just start like laying down

166
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,000
some like kidney stone rattling bass riffs.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Oh, I love this.

168
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,280
And if whatever their band is called, you call your band that, but bigger.

169
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,440
Right.

170
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
So if his band is perfect death, it was like, we're a perfecter death.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
Er.

172
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,220
Er.

173
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
More perfect death.

174
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
And then you get incredibly popular.

175
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,320
You buy him his own house behind your house.

176
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,560
You're going to have to entourage this shit.

177
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,640
Why would you want it if you went to all the trouble of buying him another house?

178
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,080
You don't have enough money to buy another plot of land, so you can only build him a

179
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
small dollhouse in your place.

180
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
You still love him.

181
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
You don't want to be you love him.

182
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
You don't want to be too far away.

183
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,360
But you will have you will have a witch cast a spell on him to make him little enough to

184
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
live in a dollhouse.

185
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,240
Basically, this is this is called the candor is what is that we have.

186
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,040
You put him in a bottle city that you keep in your den.

187
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,320
Why have you not told him to stop being a dipshit?

188
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,920
Yeah, I mean, life has to tell you that you know the guy who owns your house gets to tell

189
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,640
you that I'm pretty sure like our dad always told us when we were being idiots.

190
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,120
You're his dad now because you own his you own the house.

191
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,600
Correct.

192
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,240
You're like any sitcom in which like a non direct family member or friend moves in.

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,760
You you now are responsible for them like a parent.

194
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
That's what the Matthews did for Corey.

195
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,640
Sorry, Sean.

196
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,920
Corey was their son.

197
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
Or like in in step by step.

198
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
I believe it was Cody and then Flash.

199
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,280
You got to treat them like you're your child.

200
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,560
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air him.

201
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,120
There you go.

202
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
You've got you're the uncle Phil to his Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

203
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,880
You got to uncle Phil him with your love.

204
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,320
But you kind of want to help him grow.

205
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Sounds sounds to me like you want to DJ Jazzy Jeff.

206
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,680
That's what you okay.

207
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
This is the conversation you sit down saying you need to make a decision right now.

208
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
Are you going to be my Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?

209
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Are you going to be my DJ Jazzy Jeff?

210
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm I kind of he doesn't get the reference out.

211
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,160
He goes out.

212
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,560
He goes.

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
He's obviously a Jeff.

214
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,880
This is what I'm saying.

215
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
It is Will Smith.

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
The I said Fresh Will.

217
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,040
Was his name just Will in the show?

218
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,600
Yes.

219
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,360
That's some bullshit.

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,760
He couldn't.

221
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
It was Will.

222
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
It was William.

223
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,200
William Enium.

224
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
That was his name.

225
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,440
William Enium represented a pretty tremendous.

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
You go back and watch that show.

227
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,560
Pretty tremendous amount of character growth throughout the run of

228
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,200
Fresh Prince.

229
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,960
DJ Jazzy Jeff was was almost belligerently stagnant.

230
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,720
Well, to be fair, he was thrown on his head several times, right?

231
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,080
So I mean, I there definitely is a physiological element to it.

232
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm just saying that DJ Jazzy Jeff.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,480
By the end of the series finale, like we're going to go to college now.

234
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,280
And he was like, I just want to party all night long.

235
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,040
And then he puts online where she's all night long because he's like fucking stuck.

236
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
You know what I mean?

237
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,160
Right?

238
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,480
Yes.

239
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,080
Now he has no opportunity.

240
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,520
He has nothing.

241
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,320
Also, did he ever DJ on that show fucking once ever?

242
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,160
I don't ever.

243
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,040
I don't think so.

244
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,840
I believe he did.

245
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,120
There is a an episode in which will rent out the house for our music video.

246
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,800
And I believe DJ Jazzy Jeff sneaks in and he's doing a little mixing on the old ones and twos.

247
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,760
That's fun.

248
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,560
And that's a fun.

249
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,520
That's a fun episode.

250
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,840
How how frustrating must it be to be a genuine like actual musical artist,

251
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,200
but for a generation of white people, you are that guy that got thrown out of the house.

252
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,480
Like, no, I had like a whole career before this.

253
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
You go, oh, god damn it.

254
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,920
And before we get right in, I just remembered that I believe it was not will that rented out

255
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,240
the house.

256
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
He was trying to stop it from happening.

257
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
In fact, Carlton rented out the house.

258
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,680
That seems not like Carlton.

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,240
Was that the same episode?

260
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,320
Was that the same episode where Carlton bought a gun?

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,040
That was a real good one.

262
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,840
That was Carlton's like breaking bad the entire series in one episode for him.

263
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,480
The best episode, I think, is the one where will has to convince Carlton that racism exists.

264
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,840
Did you guys ever?

265
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,960
I do remember that.

266
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,840
Yeah, he was driving slowly and he got pulled over and he thought it's because he was driving

267
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
so slowly.

268
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,640
And Wilson was like, no, racism exists.

269
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,520
And it blows Carlton's mind because he's never experienced it before in his life.

270
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,440
No, that's like a it's not like a fun.

271
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,840
And that's not like a laugh a minute episode.

272
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,920
It goes like really hard.

273
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,040
It's actually hard.

274
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,560
They go fucking hard on that show.

275
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,200
We give that show.

276
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,640
I'm just saying that we do.

277
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,040
We goof about that show because it's called Fresh Prince of Bel Air and there's a character

278
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,280
on it called DJ Jazzy Jeff.

279
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,720
They tackle some fucking heady, heady subjects.

280
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,400
There's an amazing episode in which will goes off about like his dad.

281
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,040
Leave it.

282
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,080
Oh, yeah.

283
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
It'll rock you to your very core.

284
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah.

285
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,520
Y'all want to Yahoo?

286
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:04,960
Yeah, this Yahoo was sent in by level 165 Yahoo Shaman Diamond member Drew Davenport.

287
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,760
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

289
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,920
He needs a rebrand.

290
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,920
Maybe double D.

291
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,960
Maybe double D.

292
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,720
Double D or the Drew.

293
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,680
The Drew.

294
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,000
Thank you.

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,400
The Drew.

296
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:22,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user The Walrus who asks how to lose weight in my nipples.

297
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:31,200
I was fat and now I'm not fat, but my nipples are still fat and they are in quote, Hershey's

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,080
kiss nipples.

299
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
First of all, you need to rebrand because if you lost the weight, you shouldn't be

300
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,120
going by The Walrus anymore.

301
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
What are you doing to yourself?

302
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,200
Well, no, now it's like now he changes up those expectations.

303
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, I see.

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,080
You hear The Walrus coming and out in walks a really svelte man with like huge nipples.

305
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Huge nipples you can see through his blouse.

306
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,000
Crazy big nips.

307
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
Huge nips.

308
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,120
And we're not even talking about like-

309
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,560
Wait, are we sure this is a man?

310
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
I mean, The Walrus.

311
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,720
Okay.

312
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,280
Oh, okay.

313
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,920
Wait, hold on.

314
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,680
Walr I can also be.

315
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
They have to reproduce.

316
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,280
That's a good point Travis.

317
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,520
Yeah.

318
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,800
I guess you really undid me.

319
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,640
You really unspooled my logic there.

320
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,200
I think-

321
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
Either way, I think we can talk about this in a gender.

322
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,680
I mean, we can talk about anything in a gender neutral sense.

323
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,280
I think you-

324
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,520
Imagine like I'm having a hard time visualizing these nips.

325
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,760
Okay.

326
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
I'm not.

327
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,520
And I'm usually super good at that.

328
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,840
I've been practicing for this day since I was 12.

329
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,760
What I'm saying is-

330
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,720
Given the least amount of information, I get verbally bitched.

331
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,120
I had a good decade long run of trying to imagine what nipples look like.

332
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,200
So I am well acquainted.

333
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,880
Are we talking about like plump tipples?

334
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,400
They literally say Hershey Kisses.

335
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,880
Imagine Hershey Kisses with bumps on them.

336
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,240
So we're talking about pieces of paper sticking out the end.

337
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,920
We're talking about areolas that are elevated somehow.

338
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,840
They are topographical.

339
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,640
They just don't quit.

340
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:12,880
Can't.

341
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,240
They can quit.

342
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
Can we please approach this with a more clinical-

343
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,640
These are all medical terms.

344
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,800
I'm afraid you got Hershey Kissed tipples that just don't quit.

345
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Itis.

346
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,640
We'll probably have to put you in some kind of, I don't know, sanitarium.

347
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:29,840
Yeah.

348
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,360
Here's one thing I know.

349
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
There's a fetish for everything.

350
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,240
I guess.

351
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
You just gotta find that one person that loves that look.

352
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,560
Cannot get enough.

353
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,200
I bet there's a whole website-

354
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, excuse me, Adam.

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,120
I see that you have a grocery cart just full of bags of Hershey Kisses.

356
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,080
Well.

357
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,440
Are you in for a treat?

358
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,640
Do I have a treat for you?

359
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,480
There's a part of my body that looks like that?

360
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,200
Would you like to enjoy it?

361
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,480
There's a whole sub-sign on Brazzers that's just Hershey Nipples.

362
00:16:59,520 --> 00:16:59,920
I don't-

363
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,440
What are you talking about?

364
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,400
Is it like a porn thing?

365
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,120
There's like another tab just for Hershey Nipples.

366
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,920
You mean YouTube?

367
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,280
No.

368
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,680
No, you can't find this kind of stuff on YouTube.

369
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh, Prince Griffin.

370
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,240
How do you-

371
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,040
Are there-

372
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,000
Is there like a-

373
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
Is there like a Kegels-

374
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Is there like a shirt-level Kegels?

375
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,560
Is there a torso-based Kegel regimen?

376
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,200
I think it-

377
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Yeah, I think it's called like push-ups, right?

378
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
But those aren't gonna affect the sinews.

379
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Right.

380
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
The treble sinews.

381
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
Well, here's what it is.

382
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,520
It's a long-term commitment, because what you have to do is stand there and with two

383
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,760
fingers of each hand, just push as hard as you can for like-

384
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,640
Get back in there!

385
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
It's like 12 hours a day for like a year.

386
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
Please get back in me.

387
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,600
And to say that you have this vocalization to you, you have to visualize smaller nipples.

388
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,240
Get back in my chest.

389
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,880
Because if you miss a day or do it for like 11 and a half hours, it actually gets worse.

390
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,560
I think you exacerbate the issue.

391
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,280
Yeah, no.

392
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
They're gonna come back in greater numbers.

393
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,560
Could you cut-

394
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,160
All right, when I cut my finger, it heals, right?

395
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,520
It heals, right?

396
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah.

397
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
Could you cut your nipples off and hope that-

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
No, you're absolutely correct.

399
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,000
You have to inject yourself with some lizard DNA first.

400
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,320
Okay.

401
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,800
Now I have lizard nipples.

402
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,600
Great.

403
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,080
That's the catch.

404
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,640
Wonderful.

405
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
And then you have to commit crimes.

406
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,360
That's a big impact.

407
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,320
Now I have to do a crime.

408
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,360
You can probably tuck them.

409
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,400
It's probably some sort of tucking maneuver there.

410
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
Like fold them over.

411
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
Depends on if they're functional or not.

412
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,400
I guess it does depend on like, if you ever want to get anything from these nipples,

413
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,760
the solution is probably gonna be different.

414
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Then you probably will want to go more homeopathic.

415
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:04,640
If you're like cool with them just being more ornamentary, then you can really, I mean, take

416
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,200
your pick.

417
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,760
Take your choice.

418
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Could you have a wizard paint a painting of you in which the nipples of the painting get

419
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
bigger as yours gets smaller?

420
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Yeah.

421
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,320
But then-

422
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,440
And you have to put it into the attic and never look at it because look at those gross

423
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,160
nipples.

424
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,960
Yeah, but I mean-

425
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,760
Is it gross?

426
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,320
Yeah.

427
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
Then you could just have like a couple of little garbanzo beans down there if you let

428
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,200
that spell get out of control.

429
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, that's the gypsy twist, because it just keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,640
and smaller.

431
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, until they disappear.

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
Mm-hmm.

433
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,800
That's what the original draft of Finner was.

434
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,120
Mm-hmm.

435
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
You hit my niece with your car.

436
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,880
Little do you know-

437
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,560
She'll be fine, but just as a little thing to make you feel bad.

438
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,280
No, she's dead.

439
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,840
No nipples.

440
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,080
Oh crap.

441
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
No, she's dead.

442
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,240
So I'm going to lay upon you the most bodacious gypsy magic.

443
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,560
I just started dating a 24-year-old guy.

444
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm 34.

445
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,560
He's super sweet.

446
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,720
We have just enough in common and not that it's fun and interesting getting to know each

447
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,280
other.

448
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
He stays at my place a couple of times a week and asks for a key to my place.

449
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,920
I glossed over it, but I'm sure it will come up again soon.

450
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,400
How do I handle this without making him feel bad?

451
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,560
That's from Aged in Astoria.

452
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,840
I'm guessing the bad feelings.

453
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,560
You didn't say that you don't want to give him a key.

454
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
I'm assuming that's implied.

455
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,160
That's a pretty good-

456
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,680
If that solution were available to us, we would hope that you would disclose that.

457
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:35,840
So here's, sometimes the ambiguity of when you say you just started dating him, but then

458
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,680
you say he stays over a couple of times a week.

459
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,240
So it's been enough weeks that it's formed a pattern.

460
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,040
Are we talking like a month, two months, six months?

461
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
If you just started dating and it's less than a month, by all means, no.

462
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,280
That's crazy.

463
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
Don't give him a key.

464
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,760
The only sort of chronological like measurement we have is that they say that they just started

465
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,240
dating him.

466
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,880
So no, that's no, no, no.

467
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,320
Because like, listen, everybody, I love New York.

468
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,080
It's a tremendous city full of bright lights and big people.

469
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,040
I heart NY.

470
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,080
I do.

471
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,560
It's, everybody there is on some sort of chase or some sort of grind or some sort of groove

472
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:31,280
or some sort of mystery, by which I mean that a lot of them will just take your shit.

473
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,780
Yep.

474
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,680
If you let them into your place and you don't pay attention for a second and they're on

475
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,280
that grind too hard, you can just, you're new and you don't pay attention.

476
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,840
Your new Keurig is like their Keurig now.

477
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,480
24 is so, 24 is so young.

478
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,720
He might as well be one of Fagan's boys.

479
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
You might be dating the Artful Dodger.

480
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,600
Are you ready for this?

481
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,080
I just figured out how I handled this situation.

482
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
Oh, see, I had a good one too, but let me hear yours and see if it's as good as mine.

483
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,160
Okay.

484
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,040
Because mine's great.

485
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,560
If he brings it up again, you tell him that the landlord asked you not to make a copy.

486
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,880
Yes.

487
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,160
You two.

488
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I wish I had, I wish I could be your brother someday.

489
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,480
I wish I just had like that brotherly link.

490
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,560
Because here's the best thing about it.

491
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,920
If in the future you decide you do want to give him one, you say like, listen, I really

492
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:33,200
fought the landlord on it and I convinced him to let me do this for you.

493
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,600
Yeah.

494
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,680
No, that's a great thing about that is that you can continue to use this fictional landlord

495
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,200
throughout your relationship.

496
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,080
Sorry, he told me not to buy you an anniversary present.

497
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,520
The landlord said I had to be, the landlord said I had to be big spoon.

498
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,480
I don't know.

499
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
Landlord said I should finish the milk and not replace it.

500
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
He said it's a city code thing.

501
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,640
I don't know.

502
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,720
The only, the landlord said the only way I can not get evicted is if you do mouth stuff

503
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,280
to me.

504
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,400
It's a weird thing.

505
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,080
And I don't know how we could even prove that.

506
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm actually thinking about breaking my lease because he is, this is very crazy.

507
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,080
This is really, but no, if you insist.

508
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
Now, but okay.

509
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,960
So now that we've solved the problem for you, the question I have about it is, is there

510
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,080
times that he's spending in your apartment that you're not there?

511
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,200
Because if not, it's kind of a non issue, right?

512
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
Like, as long as you're always there, why does he even need a key?

513
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:22,960
Yeah.

514
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
Why has he got to be there that you're not there?

515
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,840
That's what I don't like.

516
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,600
That's what's implicit with the key issue.

517
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,720
Yes.

518
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,960
I think the only time that that giving someone a key, that's it.

519
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,120
There's a reason that in like sitcoms and movies, it's always such a big step because

520
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,680
it is.

521
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,800
And it's way bigger than I think people make it out to be these days.

522
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:40,960
Yeah.

523
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,360
But like, there's a big difference between someone who's basically living with you and

524
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,680
someone who is living with you, right?

525
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,640
Now giving them the key is saying like, Hey, you're living with me now.

526
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
It's an important boundary.

527
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,760
Let me ask you a question.

528
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,600
When you ask him where he's living, does he give oddly vague answers?

529
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,800
Sort of like, uptown, sort of here and there kind of answers.

530
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm kind of a citizen of the world.

531
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
Kind of a citizen of the world.

532
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,680
Does his breath always smell like beans?

533
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,280
Don't.

534
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,520
No.

535
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm not saying he's homeless.

536
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm saying he's a hobo.

537
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,480
There's a big difference.

538
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,280
He's a free spirit.

539
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,320
He's a rail rider.

540
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,120
Rail rider.

541
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,400
He's a whale rider.

542
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,280
He's a whale rider.

543
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,800
An adventurous whale rider.

544
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,240
An important storm, though, a hobo of the seas.

545
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,760
A hobo, sea hobo.

546
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,880
I mean, it's supposed to be an important boundary.

547
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,760
Yeah, like Rachel doesn't even have a key to my car.

548
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
I don't know what she's gonna do with that thing.

549
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,120
I don't trust her.

550
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,200
Yeah, you know, it's one of those there are questions and there are probably other ones

551
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,320
that I'm just not thinking of right now.

552
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,440
But like, there are things that should never be asked.

553
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,320
They can only be offered because it's such an imbalance of power, right?

554
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,080
It's not like, can we move in together?

555
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,600
Because I think that's a sacrifice from two people like looking to make a decision together.

556
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,080
Can I have a key to your place is like, that is, I have nothing to lose and you have everything

557
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,640
to lose because if you look at every relationship that's ever happened in the history of the earth,

558
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,040
no one at a month in thought, I bet this guy would take my TV.

559
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,920
I bet this is the kind of guy that would poop on my floor and then leave.

560
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,400
You know, I had a roommate once and her boyfriend, every so often I would like come out of my

561
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,800
room and find her boyfriend there to find out that she was not home and he was just

562
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,160
there hanging out in our living room and like hanging out at our house.

563
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,480
And they'd been dating about three or four weeks at this point.

564
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,360
And later after they broke up, I said, so why was he around so much in her response?

565
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,320
Oh, his mom kicked him out because he sold their electronics for drugs.

566
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,360
Awesome.

567
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,800
Cool, cool, cool.

568
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
And this is the dude that we just like had in our home.

569
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,200
So here's the thing is like, even like, you don't know this dude.

570
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
You don't know him that well.

571
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,360
And even if you do, there's no rush to this.

572
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,080
Like if he needs to hang out at your place, that's a much different discussion than to

573
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,120
have constant access to it all the time, no matter what, no questions asked.

574
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,920
You know what I mean?

575
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,440
Happy we could help there.

576
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,240
We seem very helpful.

577
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
Yeah, just lie, I guess.

578
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,120
How about another Yahoo?

579
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,040
If you're sure, we got a lot of good questions too, though.

580
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,080
It's up to you.

581
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,560
Yeah.

582
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,600
Not like your shitty Yahoos.

583
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,760
Well, I don't know why we have to be so combative about it all of a sudden.

584
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,960
I mean, I'm just saying that real questions are better.

585
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,440
Just don't let me-

586
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,360
How about just like a quick Yahoo, just a quick thinker.

587
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,720
We don't even actually have to talk about it.

588
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,240
I just want to sort of project this into the consciousness of America.

589
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
Just like an amuse-bouche.

590
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,560
I just want to amuse-bouche this into the hearts and minds of the real America.

591
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,840
These are fucking amusing-bouche.

592
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,960
And if you're a part of real America, you know that I'm talking to you.

593
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,880
You know what I mean?

594
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,360
Yes.

595
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,240
Amuse our bouche.

596
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
I didn't write down who gave it to us.

597
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
Oh, it was, of course, Drew Davenport.

598
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,840
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

599
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,240
Yahoo Answers user Zenaida asks, and again, let's just like,

600
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,960
let's make an agreement right now that we won't address this.

601
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,800
I'll just say it and then project it into the minds of the real America and then we'll move on.

602
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
But how does cat dog go to the bathroom?

603
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,880
Does it come out of one of their mouths or something?

604
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
So that's just out there now.

605
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,080
Now it's in the sphere.

606
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
Now it's in the ether.

607
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,200
And people can, you know, digest that and just talk about it on our Reddit.

608
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,520
Just like sort of put it out there.

609
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
Here is another one by Drew Davenport, though.

610
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rachel who asks, fast and furious party?

611
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm having a party for 18 year olds and can't think on what I can do for it.

612
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,720
They all have their own character to be like for the night,

613
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,520
but can't think of what else there is to do.

614
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,920
I don't want the drugs side of it because we are all not like that.

615
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,440
So has anyone got any ideas on what I can do?

616
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,760
So we're talking about a themed.

617
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,840
Okay, first I want to say I've seen at least four fast and furious movies.

618
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,320
Okay.

619
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,200
Drug use does not play into these movies.

620
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Not in a significant way.

621
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,680
Not in any way that's like played up and addressed.

622
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,600
Wait a minute party party thrower.

623
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,280
Is it possible you haven't seen the fast and furious movies?

624
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,080
Because if so, that would make this much more difficult.

625
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Because here's the key thing about these movies.

626
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,480
It's driving cars.

627
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,200
So unless you're driving cars inside this party,

628
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,720
you're pretty much just people dressed in like tank tops.

629
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,760
I mean, it's not all you are selling these.

630
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,720
You are doing these movies at a tremendous discredit.

631
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,560
Oh no, they're awesome.

632
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,600
No, no, no, but I'm saying that there is a lot of human drama

633
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,360
drama taking place not behind the wheel of the car.

634
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
Not anywhere near a car.

635
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,320
Away from cars is what I'm saying.

636
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,160
They are non-car related.

637
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,040
Non-car related friendships, loss, relationships, tanks, helicopters,

638
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,960
helicopters, jet skis, four by fours, four wheelers.

639
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,240
You should just come as a Tokyo drift character and say fuck everybody else.

640
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,120
Fuck all y'all.

641
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,200
This is the best flick in the franchise.

642
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,560
Y'all don't even realize it.

643
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,240
It's a future.

644
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,080
I don't know a post cool.

645
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah, it's not even a see.

646
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,200
Every other Fast and Furious movie is a prequel to Tokyo Drift.

647
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,960
It's all leading up.

648
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,880
It's all building up to the past.

649
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,760
Seven is a sequel to Tokyo Drift.

650
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,040
Oh, is that true?

651
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,240
Yeah, because Tokyo Drift is set in like 2015.

652
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,240
You're making shit up.

653
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
It's set in 2015.

654
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,600
Like that's some future destiny.

655
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,160
Well, when it came out in like 1999,

656
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,200
come with us into the world of 2015.

657
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,040
Your Mitsubishi still has wheels?

658
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,480
I guess.

659
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,320
All right.

660
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,000
Come on my hover Mitsubishi.

661
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,280
Uh, there's a, I just looked at the Wikipedia page for Fast and Furious

662
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,720
and there's a bit about future.

663
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,480
Like what the future of the franchise would be.

664
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,880
The very first line is Vin Diesel indicated that he loves Fast and Furious 7.

665
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,560
Great.

666
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,240
What, what precisely would be the first folks?

667
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
You know what, I'm going to go on the record here.

668
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,480
I like this movie.

669
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,840
That was a really solid Vin Diesel.

670
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,360
I'm going to go on the record here and say, I like this film that I did.

671
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,040
I did a film and it's, uh, it's pretty great.

672
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,920
Um, Tokyo Drift.

673
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,120
Can we talk, thank you.

674
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,200
Can we talk though about, cause this is literally, I, I have,

675
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
I'm always thinking about Fast and Furious movies.

676
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,920
It's like my power jam in my head.

677
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,840
It's not like a little song I sing to myself.

678
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,920
It's just, I think about those movies and it makes me like fucking psyched.

679
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,960
Um, but we do need to talk about Tokyo Drift because I've never really

680
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,800
thought about this before in my life.

681
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,280
Imagine if there was a series of skateboard films, a series of skating films.

682
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:14,560
And one of the films they did was just called Skater Boys 4 Jumping.

683
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,120
And it was about, and it was about a sect of skate.

684
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
Australia jumping.

685
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,920
It was about a sect of skateboarders who have now realized that they can

686
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
get these goddamn things off the ground.

687
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:37,200
It's talking, it's the feature that the star of Fast Fur3 Tokyo Drift was not

688
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,640
whatever that, that hillbilly was that they cast in the lead role instead of the beautiful

689
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,720
angelic Paul Walker.

690
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,080
The soon to be DFI, the soon to be DFI Paul Walker who had a limited amount of acting

691
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,720
time on this earth and they fucking squandered it and gave it to that fucking hillbilly.

692
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,000
I do have a serious question that just to interrupt real quick.

693
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
If anybody knows this, please let me know because I've never seen Tokyo Drift.

694
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,760
Is that character supposed to be Paul Walker's character's son?

695
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,320
No, no, no.

696
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,240
Because they have a baby in like six.

697
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,520
No, no relation.

698
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,640
You are trying to build a connection, a thread that does not, a through line.

699
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,080
It just doesn't make sense.

700
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,200
That can be your side fiction.

701
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,480
That can be your, your Ferris Bueller doesn't exist.

702
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,160
I'm saying, I'm saying the hillbilly hack.

703
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,440
Andy's mom, Andy's mom owned the guy from Tokyo Drift.

704
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,680
I'm saying the hillbilly hack who starred in that movie was not the star of the movie.

705
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,680
The star of that movie was a thing you can do with cars.

706
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,160
It's like if they did Fast and the Furious Five, fast braking.

707
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,040
And then it was all about fast braking.

708
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,760
And then they made Fast and the Furious Six reverse driving.

709
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,160
What they blew it on is what they should have done is at the end.

710
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,200
Well, maybe they still will.

711
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,840
At the end of Fast Seven, a car drifts and somebody goes, hold on.

712
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,120
Wait a second.

713
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,880
They've got something there.

714
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,760
I'm going to go develop this technology in Japan.

715
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,480
It would be like if in the movie Burger Time series, Burger Time 4 was just called ketchup.

716
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,960
And at the beginning of the movie, someone like stepped on a tomato

717
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
and poured some vinegar on it accidentally.

718
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,360
It was like, the game done changed.

719
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,840
Yeah.

720
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,800
Here's your burger.

721
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,000
You ain't got no ketchup.

722
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,640
And then that would be Chris Tucker.

723
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,880
Was that Chris Tucker in the movie?

724
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,320
Burger Time 4 ketchup?

725
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,160
Is Chris Tucker the star of that film or is it more of a cameo?

726
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,600
Don't you know about condiments?

727
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
Chris, get over here.

728
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,040
Yeah.

729
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,360
Yeah, that movie, it really is all about drifting.

730
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,600
I don't know if you've seen Tokyo Drift, but it really is like they're racing in parking garages.

731
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,360
And he like buses whip the fuck up because he's trying to get up those spins

732
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,760
like through regular acceleration means.

733
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,680
I wish I could be in the pitch meeting for that movie where they said like,

734
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,920
hey, you know how much people love Fast and the Furious

735
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,000
and then the sequel Fast and the Furious 2?

736
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,560
Well, I've got another idea for a Fast and the Furious movie.

737
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,760
Here's the twist.

738
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,040
It has nothing to do with those other Fast and the Furious movies.

739
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,160
Somebody just drives a car real fast and slides into things.

740
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,480
Yeah.

741
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,040
Sounds good.

742
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,400
How much you want?

743
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,040
Can I say something?

744
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
Can I say something perhaps contentious?

745
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,480
It's a pretty fucking tight movie.

746
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,600
What?

747
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,480
How does it compare?

748
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,440
Do you like it better than your base Fast and the Furious?

749
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,320
It lacks the bombast of Fast 5 and Fast 6 onward.

750
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,760
Does it have a buddy feel to it on the same level of Walker and Diesel?

751
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
There will never be another buddy feel like that buddy feel.

752
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
God took it away from us.

753
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,560
Thanks, God.

754
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,480
I've lived my whole life for you and this is how you do me.

755
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,680
I was so excited about the triumvirate of Diesel, Walker, and Rock.

756
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,440
Yeah, we were all pretty fucking excited about it.

757
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,480
And God was like, oh, nope, nope.

758
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,280
This is too cool.

759
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,080
They're not ready for this.

760
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,560
It's too cool.

761
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,840
Puh-luck.

762
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,400
Let me just get that real quick.

763
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,960
Fourth time.

764
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,240
It's fucking a shame.

765
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,960
This is too cool.

766
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
This was supposed to be the last thing they ever did.

767
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,240
We can't let them get here yet.

768
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,600
Let me just pull up.

769
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,280
This is the end of humanity.

770
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,720
This is supposed to be the big finale.

771
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,240
Are they making a Bill and Ted's 3?

772
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
They've been talking about it forever, but whatever.

773
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,560
In this one, I want him to travel to heaven again and get Paul Walker and bring him back.

774
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,720
I mean, that's not how movies work.

775
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,240
Can we go to the My Zone?

776
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,640
I'm so fucking mad.

777
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,360
I know.

778
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,480
It's just like, I'm not, this isn't like a goof.

779
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,120
This isn't like a goof thing that I do where I talk about, oh, aren't celebrities weird?

780
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,920
It's like, I'm fucking mad.

781
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,400
To say nothing of the fact that, and I feel like we kind of gave God a pass on this when

782
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,680
it happened, but like, God took one of the deedles.

783
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,640
He took half of the deedles from us as if this wouldn't be enough.

784
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,800
The only still functioning deedle.

785
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,480
The only deedle who is still an active deedle.

786
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,760
Shit.

787
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
This is how you do me.

788
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,960
Oh my God.

789
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,520
Fucking Fast and the Furious deedles crossover.

790
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,600
Other deedle rolls up.

791
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,720
I mean, we can't.

792
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,680
Sorry about my brother.

793
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,400
We can't now.

794
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,240
But I'm here to take over.

795
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,440
It's all in the deedle verse.

796
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,120
You see Paul Walker and Steve Van Warman together, you think deedles.

797
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,480
You see Steve Van Warman by himself and he's, who's that?

798
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,720
I have partial face blindness that only extends to Steve Van Warmer, not in the presence of

799
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
Paul Walker, which is to say forever now.

800
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Thank you, God.

801
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,920
Do appreciate you killing one of the deedles.

802
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,480
Not at all.

803
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,400
What a jerk.

804
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,640
Great A job up there.

805
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,920
Great A job.

806
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,200
They didn't even make two.

807
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,960
They didn't make deedles two.

808
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,240
Big bad deedle borgs.

809
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,200
By the way, big bad deedle borgs would have been the fucking sweetest.

810
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,120
Fast eight big bad deedle borgs.

811
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,520
They find, they get armor.

812
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,560
I mean, it would be called fast and the furious.

813
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
No number armor boys.

814
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,640
And then it would be about armor.

815
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,440
But here's the problem.

816
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,760
We couldn't have Paul Walker and that other fuck you just said in the picture.

817
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,400
It would have to be some another hillbilly hick.

818
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,240
Another piece of garbage actor.

819
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,280
That's not Paul Walker.

820
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,200
Fucking fuck it.

821
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,520
Fuck.

822
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,800
Just do the money zone.

823
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:26,240
Surf Wyoming, damn it.

824
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,720
Guys, coding is the most desired job.

825
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
Surfing is not.

826
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,560
You have like, so let's like go.

827
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,720
Let's let's go behind the curtain here.

828
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,640
Well, I want to talk about one one HTML.

829
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,360
Let me give you the big pitch.

830
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,840
It's the easiest way to learn code to build websites.

831
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,960
You do 30 minutes a day for 30 days and you'll build an actual website starting from day one.

832
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,240
You'll be welcomed into a community also of 12,000 other students who are learning online.

833
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
So you want to go inside something.

834
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,440
You've been doing this.

835
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,840
You've, you've actually been, you've been doing this.

836
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,800
I signed up.

837
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,760
It is, it is extremely reasonable for the, the one month class.

838
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,520
I'm taking HTML, the one month HTML course.

839
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,920
Does that cover cascading style sheets as well?

840
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,400
There is some CSS in there.

841
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:18,640
Yes.

842
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
So the way it works is actually really good for me.

843
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,640
For my like way of doing stuff is that you watch a video basically in one window

844
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,040
and then in another window and sort of the HTML editor,

845
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,840
you code along with what they're doing.

846
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,800
And after the, like the first few lessons, like I had actually like,

847
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,880
like I had a functioning website.

848
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
I literally, I work on the internet.

849
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,000
I, I, I am the managing editor of a website.

850
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,600
And after one week of this course, I think I understand like exponentially,

851
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,120
exponentially more about this entire process.

852
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,600
And like, I have designed my own website now as part of the project.

853
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,560
Like that's how it, that's how it ends at the end of the first week

854
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,240
is you making your own website.

855
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,760
That kind of put you, and I felt like comfortable doing that,

856
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,240
at least having like enough vocabulary.

857
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,640
Honestly, the biggest problem I have with this,

858
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,680
this class is not doing more than one day's worth of classes in,

859
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,040
in a setting because it's really fun.

860
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,160
It's intoxicating.

861
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,640
Yeah.

862
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,480
It's a lot of fun and I'm really enjoying it.

863
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,600
You can enroll at one month.com slash my brother,

864
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,160

866
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,040
And even that's not like, like I, I have a huge,

867
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,800
much better understanding of HTML.

868
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,480
Like after a week, I understand so much more and it's a lot of fun to do.

869
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,000
And you can get a 25% discount from us.

870
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,880
So go to one month.com slash my brother and go, go learn yourself a new skill.

871
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
While you're doing that, you're going to have one key,

872
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,360
hand on the keyboard, rattling out functions,

873
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:06,480
rattling out, um, transistors and, and like functions and stuff.

874
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,400
And your other hand is going to be, is going to be wrist deep in a sweet bag of,

875
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,360
Oh, I don't know.

876
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,160
Baked sweet potato fries, peanut butter, nom-noms or dark cocoa almonds.

877
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,560
Cause you're going to become a nature box subscriber.

878
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,200
If you aren't already one, we're talking about,

879
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
this is something I want to, okay.

880
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,520
Sometimes we sell things and like, you need to start doing this.

881
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
You're already snacking now.

882
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,920
Yeah, this isn't a thing we're asking you to do.

883
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
We're asking you to revolutionize.

884
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,240
We're asking you to, uh, I got some, they have a few new recommendations.

885
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,600
They have cinnamon, sugar, corn kernels, sort of like, uh,

886
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,800
in the corn nuts vein, but like sweet and crunchy.

887
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,560
Yeah, it's like really good.

888
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,800
And then there's a, what else did we get?

889
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,760
Chocolate, quinoa, granola.

890
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,240
Yeah.

891
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,840
Ooh, I still don't understand the structure of that snack.

892
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
You eat that with a spoon.

893
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,920
You know what I do?

894
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,560
I crumble it onto my yogurt.

895
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,080
You crazy mother fucker.

896
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,720
I know.

897
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm against the grain.

898
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,800
Change the game.

899
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,040
Yeah.

900
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,840
And Sydney likes it on her ice cream.

901
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,200
So that's, that's how we do.

902
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,040
Um, that sounds really good.

903
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
Now it won't make your ice cream healthy.

904
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,280
It doesn't work.

905
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,240
No, not like that.

906
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,120
It's not.

907
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,080
It makes it neutral.

908
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,760
No alchemical properties to it.

909
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,480
It about, it doesn't do that either.

910
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,240
Um, but it is tasty.

911
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,520
Go to naturebox.com.

912
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,040
We're going to get you 50% off your, your month's first box.

913
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,560
Just go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

914
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,360
All one word, naturebox.com slash my brother.

915
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,080
And, uh, you're going to get a healthy treat for half off.

916
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,200
Let me say in any other, more than any other product we advertise in the show,

917
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,160
people get on board with, uh, nature box.

918
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,440
Um, maybe, maybe not more than any other, but, but it's certainly up there.

919
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,840
And, uh, we see a ton of pictures of people getting them and very much enjoying them.

920
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,640
Yeah.

921
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,160
It's, it's so great too.

922
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,320
When everybody, uh, tweets about, you know, that they were on that, uh,

923
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,960
nature box tip because the awesome and makes us feel good.

924
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,920
And it also shows our advertisers how much power we wield.

925
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,800
So thank you everybody for the crazy, like we shouldn't know one man should have all

926
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,880
this power, especially when they're just like three fucks that like just three

927
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,360
chuckle fuck just like chuckle fuck in their way through life on a wing in a prayer.

928
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,560
Um, a one month HTML tweeted at me after I said, I had started the program and they said,

929
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
you're doing great, Justin.

930
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,560
I guess Griffin was wrong about you being a chuckle fuck.

931
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,440
I'm not sure about that.

932
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,520
Um, I have a message for Arjuna.

933
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,560
You think that's how that said?

934
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,360
Yeah.

935
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,880
I like it.

936
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,000
Or Arjuna.

937
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,360
Is it a hard J?

938
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,560
I think it's soft J, Arjuna.

939
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,120
Okay.

940
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,920
Arjuna Logan young, uh, from David and will who say, Hey, it's your birthday.

941
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,040
You big, beautiful bitch.

942
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,600
I am so sorry that I said that out loud to you about you, but I didn't read anything.

943
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,640
I'll read it.

944
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,840
I'll say whatever.

945
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,480
But, um, David, that was David and will.

946
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
So just like imagine I'll say it in like a different.

947
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,760
It sounded more like David than will.

948
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,040
Yeah.

949
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,960
That's more of a David vibe for sure.

950
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm going to do a different voice.

951
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,160
So nobody can like take this and put it in like, uh, and we can like splice it.

952
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,880
You know what I mean?

953
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,720
And make it sound like I'm calling somebody a bitch.

954
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,520
Cause I never would.

955
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
I don't use that word ever.

956
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:15,920
Okay.

957
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,160
Hey, it's your birthday.

958
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,360
You big, beautiful bitch.

959
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,040
No, that feels weird.

960
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,240
You are finally fulfilling your lifelong goal of being a part-time stripper.

961
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,080
And the only thing that can make your life better is having the brothers McElroy

962
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,600
judge your life choices.

963
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,240
We love you.

964
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,120
Happy birthday.

965
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,600
P.S.

966
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,680
We hope they had fun trying to pronounce your name.

967
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah.

968
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,760
I mean, you, you did get us on that one.

969
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,080
You did pull, you did pull a fast one.

970
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,000
We do not do here as judge.

971
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
No, especially people's life choices.

972
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,200
Like we were over that face.

973
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,440
We're good for you.

974
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,320
Enjoy stripping.

975
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,600
Do you guys sometimes feel like you're more sensitive than like other people that you

976
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,520
know, because of this podcast where we have learned how to just like fucking be, you know?

977
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,720
Yeah.

978
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,960
I don't think we were good at just like being before we started this show.

979
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,720
Just do you, you know, JK, JK living Arjuna.

980
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,360
That's what I say.

981
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,320
You want to be a stripper?

982
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,880
Fuck it.

983
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,200
Do it.

984
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,600
JK.

985
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,160
Rowling.

986
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,720
JK.

987
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,680
Rowling Arjuna.

988
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,400
Do it.

989
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,720
Do it.

990
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,240
This next message for Elliot.

991
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,800
It's from.

992
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,280
Happy birthday.

993
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,800
Happy birthday Arjuna.

994
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,640
And his next message is for Elliot.

995
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,360
It's from Matt Hall.

996
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,840
This is probably the best.

997
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,440
I don't want to like put too much pressure on this message.

998
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,760
But of all the personal messages we've ever read on the show, this one is my favorite.

999
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,240
Oh, wow.

1000
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,080
Sometimes people will write one and they'll like go over their character limit.

1001
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,800
So to like cut short or try to like put too much in.

1002
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,240
It gets really confusing.

1003
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,840
I feel like Matt has nailed it.

1004
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,280
And Matt says, thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight.

1005
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,880
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

1006
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,400
So fast.

1007
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,680
I'm so fast.

1008
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,400
Full stop.

1009
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm fucking uncomfortable with the funniest thing that has been said on this episode so far.

1010
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,200
Being authored by somebody who isn't us.

1011
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,080
It's the bet.

1012
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,080
Like, please, people concision.

1013
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,640
Look at how well Matt Hall has done.

1014
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,680
You don't even need to know what occasion this is for.

1015
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,720
And do you know what that is?

1016
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,280
Good job.

1017
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,040
This is almost, I like it almost as a like a fungible measurement of Elliot.

1018
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,520
You got 350 characters for your hundo bucks.

1019
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,480
Is it a hundo bucks?

1020
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,320
150?

1021
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,960
But who knows?

1022
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,440
Who knows?

1023
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,640
It's in that range.

1024
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,520
You can get a message on the show, maximumflood.org slash chumbotron.

1025
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:39,840
For your money, you only use maybe 25% of your allotted characters.

1026
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,240
So that's you saying, that's you like pissing that money away because you fucking got it to piss.

1027
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,280
And I love that style.

1028
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,120
That's a big, that's a big move.

1029
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,200
So I don't know what to reiterate here.

1030
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,560
Happy life.

1031
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,360
Happy vibing.

1032
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,600
You're fucking doing it every day.

1033
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, you're crushing it, Elliot.

1034
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,760
Apparently, thank you for vibing and keeping it tight.

1035
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,280
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

1036
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,880
I also like people paying $100 to communicate benign messages to each other.

1037
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,080
I do too.

1038
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,160
Hey, on your way home, bring home some milk.

1039
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,040
Thanks, McElroy's.

1040
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,840
Here's a C note.

1041
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,680
Especially when it is next available.

1042
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,360
So he's just on his mobile.

1043
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,800
And he said, I want to tell this pointless message to my friend in a month and a half for $100.

1044
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,640
It's like we're like, we've invented a new like, we've like developed this new communications app.

1045
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,880
It's like the new Snapchat, except it's the shittiest imaginable.

1046
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,240
And it costs you a ton of money.

1047
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,840
It costs a ton of money and people are crazy about it.

1048
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,040
And you have no idea when it's going to happen.

1049
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,480
It's like worse than the Pony Express.

1050
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,400
Hey, feeling lonely?

1051
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,920
My name's Jesse Thorn.

1052
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,920
My name's Jordan Morris.

1053
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,920
Do you want to listen to a program where two good friends get intimate with amazing guests

1054
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,920
like Maria Bamford, Rob Corddry, and other comedy superstars?

1055
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,240
Jordan Jesse Go is here for you.

1056
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,640
Every week we'll spill our guts for you and then make some jokes.

1057
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,400
Jordan Jesse Go, free at MaximumFun.org.

1058
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,840
A celebrity couple just moved in literally across the hall from my girlfriend and I.

1059
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,000
We met only the husband who we didn't recognize at first, but he looked familiar.

1060
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,280
And after telling us he worked in entertainment, we looked him up on IMDB.

1061
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,160
Turns out he's married to someone very famous and an actress.

1062
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,000
And both my girlfriend and I really like.

1063
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,160
How do we acknowledge we are fans of their work without coming off as creepy from Anxious in Atlanta?

1064
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,840
How could you do this to me?

1065
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,520
How could you write a question like that and not say who it is?

1066
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,480
What in the fuck?

1067
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,240
Are you protecting their anonymity?

1068
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,440
We don't know who you are.

1069
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,200
Or, I want to tell you guys, this is, I found, listen, look at this.

1070
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,360
Yahoo Answers has provided a service to me.

1071
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,880
Yahoo Answers has provided value to me as a person.

1072
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,080
Here's the question.

1073
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,080
Which celebrities live in Atlanta?

1074
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,320
Okay.

1075
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,480
Now this was answered six years ago by Spider-Man 7086.

1076
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,880
So, X.

1077
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,760
So, it may not be current, but let me hit you with some of the people.

1078
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,160
It could be that this person has seen in Atlanta.

1079
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,400
I live in Atlanta and so far I've seen.

1080
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,520
Okay.

1081
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,120
The yin yang twins.

1082
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,040
Probably not.

1083
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,160
They are married to each other.

1084
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,960
Not in Georgia they aren't.

1085
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,360
Lil Jon and the East Side Boys.

1086
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,520
Hey, little girl, let me whisper in your ear.

1087
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,880
Can you please walk the dog and on your way home get some orange juice?

1088
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,440
I love you.

1089
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,960
Lil Jon and the East Side Boys.

1090
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,160
Mm-hmm.

1091
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,840
All of them married to each other.

1092
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,440
Now you could go knock on Lil Jon's door to say,

1093
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
Lil Jon, turn down for what?

1094
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,080
The what in this case is you live across the hall from me.

1095
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,760
Please turnt it down.

1096
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,400
And I've got an important meeting in the morning and I just really need to catch up.

1097
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:00,800
So that is why.

1098
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,240
A crazy, crumping dude just like crashed through my ceiling.

1099
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,080
And somehow I feel like you are the one to blame.

1100
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,440
So turn down, please.

1101
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,960
Please do turn down for this.

1102
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,360
For this.

1103
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,800
This is the cause.

1104
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:11,920
Usher.

1105
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,680
Hmm.

1106
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,880
Jermaine Dupree.

1107
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,520
Janet Jackson.

1108
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,040
No.

1109
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,840
Because here's the thing.

1110
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,360
They didn't recognize him at first.

1111
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,960
If it's fucking Janet Jackson.

1112
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,920
You're going to recognize him.

1113
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,280
Who is that again?

1114
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,000
Okay.

1115
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,960
Here's where things get a little weird in this list.

1116
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,640
There's a few more people that I would probably recognize.

1117
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,720
T-Pain, Ludacris.

1118
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,960
The problem with recognizing T-Pain is it could also be a monster.

1119
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,840
You could accidentally identify as a monster.

1120
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,560
It could be a monster boogie man who's come to steal your soul.

1121
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,360
That's the other problem with T-Pain.

1122
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,480
But Ludacris.

1123
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,600
Okay.

1124
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,160
You would know.

1125
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,120
You would know.

1126
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,080
The guy who invented the Ziploc bag.

1127
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,680
No.

1128
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,080
Okay.

1129
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:57,920
Who?

1130
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,560
Okay.

1131
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,440
Important thing.

1132
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Who recognizes that guy on site and puts that in the Yahoo Antics?

1133
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,680
Had to have been wearing a t-shirt.

1134
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,480
Had to have been wearing a t-shirt that said ask me about my invention on the back.

1135
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,160
I think that's Anthony Ziploc.

1136
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,600
Ask me about my super tight bags.

1137
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,520
Is that Tony Ziploc?

1138
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,000
I think so.

1139
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,600
He's got the super tight bag shirt.

1140
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,800
Are there any other celebs?

1141
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,680
Because we haven't answered this question.

1142
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,480
Ted Turner.

1143
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,520
Sure.

1144
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:19,760
No.

1145
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:20,640
Yeah.

1146
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,160
He just moved in across the hall.

1147
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,040
Tyler Perry.

1148
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,960
Okay.

1149
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,520
Okay.

1150
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:25,840
All.

1151
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,080
Okay.

1152
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,520
All the Braves, Falcons, and Hawks.

1153
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,240
So yes.

1154
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,040
I mean, yes.

1155
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,280
Yeah.

1156
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:31,600
All right.

1157
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,400
Fine.

1158
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,760
Andre 3000.

1159
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,480
Big boy.

1160
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,280
Young Jeezy.

1161
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,000
Bone Crusher.

1162
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,800
Young Bloods.

1163
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,520
Young Jock.

1164
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,000
CeeLo.

1165
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,500
Okay.

1166
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:39,840
Jane Fonda.

1167
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,120
I've just had a question occur to me.

1168
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,360
Okay.

1169
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,920
And I'm going to try to phrase it very, very carefully.

1170
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
Because I do not mean to offend the question asker.

1171
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,320
I do not know your living situation.

1172
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,520
I don't know what this building that you live in is like.

1173
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,080
What is a celebrity couple that is just like renting an apartment across from you?

1174
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,320
So.

1175
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,840
Oh, people do that all the time.

1176
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah.

1177
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,480
I was.

1178
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:00,880
Yeah.

1179
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,120
Here would be my guest on a shoot maybe.

1180
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,560
Maybe on location in Atlanta.

1181
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,000
Or maybe they have like family in Atlanta.

1182
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,560
It's not where they want their main house to be, but maybe they got like a little.

1183
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,760
Maybe they'll have like a loft there.

1184
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,240
Sure.

1185
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,040
Yeah, absolutely.

1186
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:20,880
I would like to think that it would be totally chill if you just like ran into the hallway

1187
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,920
and said like, oh, hey, I loved you and such and such.

1188
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,040
Nice meeting you.

1189
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,400
Welcome to the building.

1190
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:26,800
Okay.

1191
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,920
See you around.

1192
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,200
I bet it would be so novel for this person if you would just not.

1193
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,040
Maybe you could just like.

1194
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,680
What if you just like.

1195
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,480
That's where I'm at.

1196
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,240
Like a housewarming present or like invited him over for dinner sometime and treated him

1197
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,440
like a normal human being.

1198
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:39,600
Right.

1199
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,920
But that's not how normal human beings operate.

1200
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,160
Travis, when have you ever gone next door?

1201
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,760
Well, not normal macro human beings, but like normal sociable.

1202
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,400
We are the most normal human being.

1203
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,280
We represent.

1204
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,200
Real America.

1205
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,760
We represent an identikit of real America that like we are the mold.

1206
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,200
Travis, nobody does this.

1207
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,680
Have you gone upstairs to your neighbors upstairs and be like, hey,

1208
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,960
we made pot pie.

1209
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,320
Come on down for our pot pie.

1210
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,000
No, but by the way, I loved you and failure to launch.

1211
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:18,240
I just like I can't be I can't even I'm trying to be funny.

1212
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,280
I can't stop being so angry at this person for not telling me who this person is.

1213
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,280
I mean, here's because here's the thing.

1214
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,600
I agree with you, Justin, not only because I desperately want to know who it is,

1215
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,440
but I also think that it's an important fact.

1216
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,080
If it's somebody who's like known for being totally chill and cool and,

1217
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,280
you know, or if it's someone who's known for being kind of reclusive

1218
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,160
and not wanting to talk to the press, that's a huge difference.

1219
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,520
Can I hit you with this?

1220
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,680
Can I hit you with this Donald Faison?

1221
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,360
A Donald Faison, I think perfectly fits this mold of somebody you recognize.

1222
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,160
You're not sure what probably dating some sort of celeb,

1223
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
probably got like a bungalow somewhere.

1224
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,880
And you say, I love his work.

1225
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,240
Do I go talk to Faison?

1226
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,160
He seems fucking super friendly.

1227
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:12,320
I cannot imagine a reality in which I would not be more stoked to meet Donald Faison.

1228
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,680
I cannot think of an actress I would be more stoked to meet than Donald Faison.

1229
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,080
I can't think of a person I'd rather get a hang on with than Donald Faison.

1230
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,200
Seriously, that's what I'm saying.

1231
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,240
He seems like the chillest, best guy ever.

1232
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,880
Because we are the real American mold.

1233
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,360
We're nervous.

1234
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:27,920
We wouldn't talk.

1235
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,320
We're shy.

1236
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,080
We understand these social norms.

1237
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:37,120
But that Faison is such a honeypot, such a sweet, sweet honeypot.

1238
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,720
And you just want to Faison it.

1239
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,240
Here's the thing.

1240
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,240
Okay, so while I agree with you that we are a perfect, perfect slice of real America,

1241
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,440
I try to, when I am faced with decisions like this and circumstances like this,

1242
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,600
the way I think about it is, in 10 years, will I more regret embarrassing myself

1243
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,360
by talking to this person?

1244
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,200
Donald Faison, we don't have to be, we don't have to be obtuse about it anymore.

1245
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,640
It's Donald fucking Faison.

1246
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,040
Would I, will I look back and be like, man, really glad I didn't embarrass myself

1247
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,120
by talking to Donald Faison or will I say-

1248
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,680
Faison.

1249
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,760
Yeah, I fucking met Donald Faison.

1250
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,000
I talked to him and like, we ended up hanging out.

1251
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,440
We played Call of Duty together.

1252
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,160
It was super chill.

1253
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,720
Why did you play Call of Duty?

1254
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,320
We came over for pizza a couple of times.

1255
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:20,560
Yeah.

1256
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,400
He ended up being best friends.

1257
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,240
How do you make new friends with Donald Faison?

1258
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,760
Not to exclusively talk about scrubs, but I do want to supplement this,

1259
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,440
this tale with a personal sort of warning from my own life.

1260
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,000
I was at LAX last E3, not this E3, but the E3 before.

1261
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,680
I was at LAX and I saw John C. Reilly in the security line like-

1262
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,000
Fuck.

1263
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Of course, looking like so dope, had a guitar case,

1264
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,120
had like the dopest look for his whole steez.

1265
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,000
His whole thing was like he had a cool hat and he had a cool look

1266
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,120
and he had such a cool look.

1267
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,240
I saw him, identified him.

1268
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,520
That's Mr. Cellophane.

1269
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,400
That's my guy.

1270
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,440
That's Steve Rule.

1271
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,240
That's my dude.

1272
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,560
But in my head, the name I had attached to him is John C. McGinley.

1273
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,640
No, Justin.

1274
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,080
Now, hear me out.

1275
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,160
I didn't go talk to him.

1276
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,280
I saw him at the ATM after the line and was literally a hair's breath away

1277
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,000
from saying,

1278
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,480
uh, hi, Mr. McGinley.

1279
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,920
I'm a big fan of your work.

1280
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,320
So fucked because I was literally in Charlotte before I was like,

1281
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,480
Oh God, that was John C. Reilly.

1282
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,920
That was not John C. McGinley from scrubs.

1283
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,360
Do you know why you didn't act on that?

1284
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,640
And I think it's the, I think this is the most important factor

1285
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,160
in these types of decisions.

1286
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,440
You had, it is a biblical concept, which is appropriate.

1287
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,680
You had mustard seed faith.

1288
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,720
You had a mustard seed sized faith that you were a dumb shit.

1289
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,320
You had, you would, there was a doubt, a small grain of doubt.

1290
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,880
And you acted.

1291
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,480
And you walked on the water and ran away.

1292
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,000
You had acted on that doubt.

1293
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And you said, I, there's a, there's a 0.01% chance I could be wrong.

1294
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,160
That is the core of social anxiety is that somewhere deep down in you,

1295
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,320
deeper than all your other secrets, you have a suspicion,

1296
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,360
bordering on certainty that you are a dumb shit.

1297
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,680
Yeah, that's the core of it.

1298
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,200
But okay, but okay.

1299
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,760
I hope that this helps the person asking this question,

1300
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,480
but I look at it this way from my point of view.

1301
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,320
This isn't like they're out today.

1302
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,480
They're not like at a, you know, opening or something in which they are

1303
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,800
characterized as fancy star person.

1304
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,880
They're in their home, just being a regular person.

1305
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,200
If you run into them, don't acknowledge it.

1306
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,480
Just treat them like a regular person.

1307
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,080
Treat them like you would anyone else.

1308
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,320
Yeah.

1309
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,760
Have a party, have a party.

1310
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,320
This is what you do.

1311
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,960
You have a house party or a bungalow party.

1312
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,760
You knock on the door.

1313
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,080
Hey, I'm just want to let you know, we're going to have a party tonight.

1314
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,440
We'll be done before 11.

1315
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,960
So we're not going to go too late and be too loud.

1316
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,840
But by the way, we're going to have we're going to have nachos.

1317
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,640
It's a nacho part.

1318
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,320
It's a fast and the furious party.

1319
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:12,400
So Donald, if, if if you and your, your wife, Casey Cobb want to swing by,

1320
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,240
this is wife's name, according to INDB.

1321
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,120
Then we would love to have you.

1322
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,960
We'd love to hear some stories on the set.

1323
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,520
Would love to hear what it's like to work with John C. Reilly.

1324
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,080
Anyway, that's just the invitation.

1325
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,880
Just putting it out there.

1326
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,520
It was nice to meet you, Donald Faison.

1327
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,840
I have a, I would like to suggest this.

1328
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,560
This person has to, the actress and, and I guess to some extent,

1329
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,240
the actor who seems to be less well known.

1330
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:45,040
But I think that it's different because you live so close to them.

1331
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,040
I think that the best thing that you can do if you,

1332
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,400
if you really care is to ignore them because they go around being recognized

1333
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,600
and like they're in their day to day life constantly and their,

1334
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,200
their home should be a sanctuary from that, I think.

1335
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,840
And I think the best thing you could do is just give them privacy and not try to like,

1336
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,800
I mean, if you see them, but like, I don't try to establish a connection.

1337
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,400
You don't need to don't kick in the door.

1338
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,920
Don't slide notes underneath there.

1339
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,520
Big fan.

1340
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,280
Justin, I'm not saying that when you see them,

1341
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,000
you start snapping pictures and go, Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God.

1342
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,480
And faint.

1343
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,720
I'm saying like, imagine that they were just a normal person

1344
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,560
who moved across the hallway and then follow your behavior appropriate.

1345
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,480
There's no reason to ignore them.

1346
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,960
Draco Travis, these are one in the same.

1347
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,680
These are twain.

1348
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,040
My normal behavior would be to ignore them.

1349
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,240
My neighbor mowed my lawn.

1350
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,760
You should totally treat them like that.

1351
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,080
I don't, I'm saying that.

1352
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,400
I don't think when you run into Donald Faison in the hallway,

1353
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,040
you have to avert your eyes and say, I'm sorry.

1354
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,440
I looked at you.

1355
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,360
Mr. Faison, I'm sorry.

1356
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,280
Oh, you burned, you burned my retinas.

1357
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,560
You're so beautiful.

1358
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,120
I should.

1359
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,640
May I touch the hem of your garment?

1360
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,000
Please, please, Mr. Faison.

1361
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,640
Am I worthy?

1362
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,280
Um, which I was here, it opens in theaters July 18th.

1363
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,880
This is a new picture from Zach Braff.

1364
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,640
It does have Donald Faison in it.

1365
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,360
They're buddies in real life.

1366
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,200
Getting it back together.

1367
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,440
Oh, they're the next ones though.

1368
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,760
Shit.

1369
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,200
Which one's God going to take this, this friendship, this,

1370
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,120
this cinematic friendship is too beautiful.

1371
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,000
I know who I'm pulling for, but I don't want to say it.

1372
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,600
It's Zach Braff, right?

1373
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,200
I didn't want to say it.

1374
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,840
I hope he does first before Faison and not because I hate Zach Braff.

1375
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,200
I think he's wonderful.

1376
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,640
Um, I just, I like Donald Faison more, I guess.

1377
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,520
Um, guys, I know that I don't, uh, I kept this as a surprise for you.

1378
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,240
I know, I know I don't prep for the show.

1379
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,240
I don't, I'm not the one who-

1380
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,520
That's not a surprise.

1381
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:47,760
Okay.

1382
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,280
I don't prep for the show, but I did prep for this episode.

1383
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,200
I brought a special news story that I saw on CNN this morning when I was going over, uh,

1384
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,000
my headlines.

1385
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,640
I have a, and this is, this is-

1386
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,200
Is it, is it, if you were sending this in an email to us, would it be re-Donald Faison?

1387
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,520
No, there's no Donald Faison connection, but I think it is a story that you will, uh,

1388
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,400
very much enjoy.

1389
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,200
It is a, I'm going to tell you the headline and then we are going to see how long we can

1390
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,960
read details and it remains funny, but here is the headline.

1391
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,520
Are you ready?

1392
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:22,960
I guess.

1393
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,800
Are you sure?

1394
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,400
I'm not sure because I know nothing about the scenario that you've-

1395
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,640
Here is the headline on CNN.

1396
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:33,600
Okay.

1397
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,720
Cake boss gets lost in layer of fog.

1398
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,920
Cake boss and friends lost in layer of fog.

1399
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:55,040
Buddy cake boss Valisotra's gastronomical gifts were of little help when his 32 foot

1400
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,720
Boston Whaler got lost in heavy fog in New York Harbor.

1401
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,960
People were scared, cake boss told CNN of the harrowing journey Friday night with his

1402
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,760
wife, another couple-

1403
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,000
CNN, that's not how you credit a person.

1404
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,960
I, I'm sorry, that was my, that was my editorial.

1405
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,640
That was your attribution, okay.

1406
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,640
I mean, it is easier to say than his last thing.

1407
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,800
People were scared, cake boss told CNN of the harrowing journey Friday night with his

1408
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,840
wife, another couple of-

1409
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,840
The frosting on the boat started to melt off.

1410
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
I didn't know which way to look.

1411
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,440
Left, right.

1412
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,120
I couldn't even see in front of me.

1413
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,080
That's how fog do.

1414
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,920
And then an angel appeared.

1415
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,720
I can't see the city, said cake boss, who owned a boat for six years.

1416
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,080
I'm thinking it's dark.

1417
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,760
We wind up going into this deep, deep fog where you couldn't see 10 feet in front of

1418
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,240
you.

1419
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,680
We started to get really scared.

1420
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,280
That's how he, he lost his mind on the boat.

1421
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,560
He left a piece of himself out in the Atlantic, right?

1422
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,680
And he was just like saying to his friend, he was like, somebody else had to take the

1423
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,480
wheel from him because he was like one of those captains that loses their mind and just

1424
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,560
like points their boat to the nearest rock.

1425
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,160
Like, here's where our souls are going.

1426
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,760
And he was just rocking back and forth, just saying, I can't see my city.

1427
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,800
I can't see my, I can't see my city.

1428
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay.

1429
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,240
Cake, cake boss can't see the city.

1430
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:21,680
Just to put a capper on this, cake boss said a fire department vessel responded about 10

1431
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,720
minutes after his distress call followed later by a police boat.

1432
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,000
I want to bake them a cake.

1433
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,640
He said, I want to do something good for them.

1434
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,520
It's all I know.

1435
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,080
He didn't even realize who I was until the end.

1436
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,200
It was all business.

1437
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,080
I'm not the kind of guy to say I'm the cake boss.

1438
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,560
The cake boss.

1439
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,080
You have to keep, keep me alive before everyone else.

1440
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,360
I'm the cake boss.

1441
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,680
The cake boss in distress made it.

1442
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:52,240
They found him on a boat, a raft made of the human bodies of his friends that he took out.

1443
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,760
He was lashed to the wheel.

1444
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,080
Right.

1445
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,160
Oh Jesus.

1446
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,320
He said, my wife was flipping.

1447
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,680
I couldn't pick a worse bunch of people to be on the boat stuck in the fog with.

1448
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,120
Nobody kept their head on a swivel.

1449
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:12,080
So just to be clear, if cake boss is ever in an emergency situation, the people he

1450
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,800
definitely doesn't want there are his wife and his children.

1451
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,120
So that's our news segment.

1452
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,520
I was so excited.

1453
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,440
Can I tell you something?

1454
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:28,000
I was, I was, I was disappointed when I found out a boat was involved.

1455
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:34,160
I had envisioned maybe a thick fog, maybe landed on the lower east side.

1456
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,480
And he was like, wait, what the wait, fuck.

1457
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,960
Am I in fourth now or oh fuck.

1458
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,600
Oh fuck.

1459
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,680
I can't see my city.

1460
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,200
Cake boss, Mayday, cake boss in distress.

1461
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,560
Oh man.

1462
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,600
So anyway, that's our show.

1463
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,520
My brother, my brother made it's an advice show or whatever.

1464
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,040
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

1465
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:01,440
We have an exciting, exciting, I guess, announcement, I guess.

1466
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,480
I don't know if it's announcement.

1467
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:02,720
Yeah.

1468
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,560
Of the Gespert?

1469
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,320
Yeah, we have a new Gespert coming up.

1470
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,280
Donald Faison.

1471
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,520
We're going to record this in a week.

1472
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,320
So you have a week to submit questions to us for this Gespert.

1473
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:20,880
You can send them to mbmbam at maximumfun.org and just put Gespert in the subject line.

1474
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:30,000
Our guest is Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of Eat, Pray, Love and the Signature of All Things.

1475
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,360
Like a real, she's like, that's a real ass awesome person.

1476
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:43,760
She wrote my favorite book that I've read in like years, and she's going to be on the show.

1477
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,840
So that's kind of crazy.

1478
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,280
Here's OK.

1479
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,840
She threw out a bunch of different subjects on which she could Gespert.

1480
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,520
And here's some of my favorites books, getting them written.

1481
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,840
Clests, basic creative encouragement, general goats, their lore and care.

1482
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,040
Public speaking, 19th century botanical exploration.

1483
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,600
OK, moving from town to town for no particular reason.

1484
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,160
We got that one.

1485
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,000
Yeah, optimism.

1486
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,960
We already did that one.

1487
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,560
Yeah, we've got that.

1488
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,760
All due respect, Elizabeth Gilbert, we have got movie town to town for no particular reason covered.

1489
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,560
I would say maybe books, maybe books and goats.

1490
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,480
I say use any of those like any, whatever you want.

1491
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,400
Have a question for Elizabeth Gilbert.

1492
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:36,000
Elizabeth Gilbert, she is a listener to our show for reasons that defy explanation.

1493
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,480
And she's going to be here with us.

1494
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,360
So that's awesome.

1495
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:47,120
What if the three of us, it's probably because the three of us each represent one of the ideals

1496
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,560
in the Eat, Pray, Love trifecta.

1497
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,840
Oh God, I'm eat, aren't I?

1498
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,080
Yeah, you're totally, totally eat.

1499
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,120
Justin, I think you're love and that leaves me with pray, which that leaves me with pray,

1500
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,360
which makes I think makes a lot of sense.

1501
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,360
Yeah, you're a very godly man.

1502
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,400
Travis, I've been seeing some action on our YouTube channel.

1503
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,120
Can you fill me in?

1504
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:04,720
That's correct.

1505
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,520
So, you know, we've been a little bit lazy about it and we are vowing to fix that.

1506
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,000
So we've released a couple of videos just this last week.

1507
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,760
Pop up videos, I've seen people call them.

1508
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,120
Pop up videos.

1509
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,160
I call them fun facts for, you know, copyright reasons.

1510
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,400
But friend of the show, Jeremy Frank also recorded the 930 New York City live show.

1511
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,760
So we're we're releasing clips of that.

1512
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,840
And in case you listen to the last one, the audio quality is better on the video.

1513
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,280
You'll really enjoy it.

1514
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,560
We're also doing fun facts videos, just kind of releasing old episodes with fun facts about

1515
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,800
the episodes, about us and about just random things.

1516
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,400
So go check it out.

1517
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,440
Go to our YouTube channel, MPMBAM.

1518
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,240
Make sure you subscribe and then tell all your friends about it.

1519
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,200
You know, hopefully everyone will like it.

1520
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,520
And with the fun facts, it should be an easy way to get people who maybe don't listen to

1521
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:57,760
podcast.

1522
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,840
Yeah, we basically just want to get more full length episodes of the show on YouTube.

1523
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,000
Just like make it as easy as possible for people to listen to it, however the hell they want.

1524
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,840
Because you can share it at a specific point, too.

1525
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,520
So if there's a specific event on one of those.

1526
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,960
We actually, it'd be great.

1527
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,480
What we need to do is time code those.

1528
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,440
I know.

1529
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,280
Well, we had the Wiki project.

1530
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,080
Well, I mean, we didn't.

1531
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,320
Somebody was working on a Wiki, but I don't think it ever reached completion.

1532
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,000
Anyway, there's also the other stuff.

1533
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,640
Twitter, MPMBAM on Twitter.

1534
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,760
All of our names on Twitter will get you to us.

1535
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,520
Facebook fan page has been popping off lately.

1536
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,360
And the appreciation group, I'm sorry, has also been popping off.

1537
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,440
You can find those.

1538
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,880
Appreciation group, you have to request permission to join.

1539
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,360
It's how we keep them spammers and haters out.

1540
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,320
But we're usually pretty quick to admit people.

1541
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,960
And am I forgetting any other social channel?

1542
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,560
Well, I mean, our greatest source of publicity, our biggest advertisement is you listeners.

1543
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,520
So, I mean, can we say our only advertiser, like we don't, our only advertiser is you.

1544
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,560
So if you like the show and you've got a friend that you think would like it,

1545
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,680
tell them about it, burn them a desk, send them a link, get them to listen to it.

1546
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,720
Because that's the only way.

1547
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:13,200
And you guys, I mean, really, we've grown over the years because of you guys and you've been awesome.

1548
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,800
We haven't spent a red cent on advertising.

1549
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,120
It's been, it's been fully grassroots.

1550
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,800
And we don't thank you guys enough for that.

1551
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,120
Thank you.

1552
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:21,440
Thank you.

01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,280
We love you.

1558
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,320
We love you very much.

1559
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,880
Thank you to John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1560
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,360
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1561
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,920
He was a recent guest on our show.

1562
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,880
He's fucking fantastic.

1563
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,960
You can also listen to him on Roderick on the line with Berlin man, another terrific podcast.

1564
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,480
Speaking of terrific podcast, there's a lot on the maximum fun network you should be listening to.

1565
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,280
Bullseye, Jordan, Jesse go, judge, John Hodgman, stop podcasting yourself, throwing shade.

1566
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:53,600
Oh no, Ross and Carrie, the goose down, one bad mother, lady to lady, song, exploder, risk.

1567
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,440
There's a fucking, there's a crazy.

1568
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,000
Wow, really?

1569
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,000
Oh yeah.

1570
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,480
Saw bones.

1571
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:58,960
Thank you.

1572
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,320
I'm, you know, I just figure every, I mean, I, you did every other show on the goddamn network.

1573
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,040
I look at your,

1574
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,280
it's just an hour long commercial for solve, right? That's what I'm saying. I look at your

1575
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,040
download. I'm only talking when I posted it.

1576
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,760
So when I post you like one third of this episode, you will like one half of the solve.

1577
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,680
I'm saying your show is as big as ours.

1578
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,560
Now I'm saying everybody who's listening to the show is already listening to your show.

1579
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,200
I bet I don't, I don't know that's accurate.

1580
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,160
I'll see you're looking at also a special thing in our download numbers.

1581
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,360
Yeah.

1582
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,840
