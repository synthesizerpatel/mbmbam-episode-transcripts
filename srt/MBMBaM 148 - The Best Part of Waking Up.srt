1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello, everybody. Welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. And boy, do we have an exciting,

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
exciting way to kick off the show this week.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,760
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy, before Justin just skips all the way over to me.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,360
Yeah, I'm the baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And it's been a few episodes since I've

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,560
said my name, because I feel like this shit really just runs off the rails

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,880
pretty much as soon as we start. So thank you for the opportunity.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,760
Yeah. So this is a formal world exclusive. We have obtained through some unscrupulous methods,

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,160
a leaked track off the Daphne Punk. Is that what you said, Griffin?

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,800
Daphne Punk, yeah. Do you know the name of that album? Can you just...

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,680
The title isn't even out there. I think it's called Daphne Punky Brewster.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,640
Okay. Now, Griffin, you've got a... Sorry,

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,320
Daph Punk. I'm reading my cue cards here. Daph Punk. Can you tell us a bit about the track we're

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
going to be hearing? Sure. So Daph Punk is a... They're one of those bands, sort of like extreme

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,960
music that just does songs for commercials for, you know, like for The Gap. There was that one

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,760
Gap commercial where the girl from Cape Fear just sort of danced in her jeans and was having a good

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,120
time, and two friendly robots came along and just played her a song for her to enjoy the jeans in.

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,680
Would I have heard them on Echoes with John D. Libertas?

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,000
Were there Gap commercials that ran interstitially? Almost exclusively.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
Okay. Well then, yeah, probably, if it was like mid-2000s.

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,000
All right. Let me just push... Let me get the cart here. I'm going to pop it in to the old...

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Okay, it's all loaded up. Is it eight tracks? Jesus. Yeah, and I'm just pushing play.

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,040
Bring the beat. Gonna fuck the beat. Oh, yeah. Bring the beat. We're gonna fuck the beat.

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,400
That's what a robot voice sounds like. Do you have some oil? Do you have some oil,

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,760
oil? Do you have some oil for my robot legs? My fingers are USB drives,

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,360
and we are gonna dance all night long today. What emotions.

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,280
They make sure to, like, really specify when the dancing is going to take place.

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,800
From 7 PM to 1 AM. We want a solid chunk of time.

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Do you want to dance before you'll be electrocuted? We are your dance lords.

34
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,520
Just a reminder, we have to be out of the rec center by 10.

35
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:33,120
Music ordinances kicking at 10.30. Please buy a CD. That's their new CD. Or a t-shirt or a Bible.

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,840
It's pretty good. Pretty good goofs. Man, guys, I think Daft Punk has lost a step.

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
I've never heard their music before, but I can't imagine it wasn't better.

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
Or is it edgier than it's ever been? That's a good point. Their formula is really

39
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,120
just say a bunch of verbs. Just say a bunch of verbs or adjectives. Just back to back to back,

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,800
and it's like solid. How are they with gerunds?

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,240
Gerunds? Texting, walking, running, looking. I would listen to that song.

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,560
It's basically Schoolhouse Rock Live with a vocoder.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,440
So, let's actually help some people this week. Thank you first before we go any further. Thank

44
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:22,240
you to everyone who helped us to crush our maximum fun drive goals. To those of you who are new

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,600
donors, thank you so much. We're sure you're enjoying the show in a much more appropriate

46
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,440
way than you ever have before. Or perhaps you are placing more scrutiny

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,360
upon us than you've ever decided to expend. All sales are final.

48
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,920
Well, they're not final. It's a monthly recurring thing.

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,960
All sales are final. All right, cool.

50
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,920
Let's answer some advice. Also, thank you guys so much, and thank you to Daft Punk.

51
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
Thank you for coming on the show. Thank you.

52
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,000
I recently visited a college that's five hours away with a friend from school.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,480
He'd been planning the trip for weeks and had intended to go alone. He invited me to accompany

54
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,720
him at the last minute. On the way home, he was very clear that he expected gas money from me.

55
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,120
He knows I don't have a job. Am I a freeloader for not feeling that I should pay for something

56
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,560
that he has been prepared to pay for himself for weeks? That's from Possible Cheapskate in

57
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,960
Chesapeake and Friend of Friends. First off, that is a great name for you're so lucky that your

58
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,560
region dovetailed grammatically so well with Cheapskate. Secondly, that sucks.

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,040
Yeah, he did a little rope-a-dope there.

60
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Well, let's answer some, because there's so many variables, right? There's so many variables.

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,080
Where were you going? Were you going to Chicago? Were you going somewhere cool that you sort of

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
did you enjoy the trip in any way? Because if it was just a favor for your friend,

63
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,760
then fuck that guy. But if you went there for a destination hot dog,

64
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,600
then you got something out of the experience. Yeah, maybe you should have to pony up.

65
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Well, here's the thing. I would say that if there was no discussion beforehand

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,200
about splitting gas, if he was just like, hey, I'm headed up to Syracuse, you want to go?

67
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Yeah, I think that in most situations, there is an implied, I'll help out with gas,

68
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,760
but if it was never discussed, you're not obligated.

69
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,920
Oh, it's so tough.

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,680
It is tough. And luckily, this is the kind of thing that when you get a little bit older and

71
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,400
hopefully you and everyone you know becomes a little bit more financially secure, things like

72
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,440
this and things like splitting the check just sort of stop being a problem or at least has

73
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,320
big of a problem. But I mean, if he knows that you don't have any money, how do you not know

74
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,120
what your friend's financial statuses are and then not put them in a situation

75
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,480
that makes them uncomfortable?

76
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,520
Yeah. Yeah, general rule. Hey, everybody out there, as it's getting to the time of year

77
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
when everyone's going on spring break together and college visits and everything,

78
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,600
stay to your friends beforehand. Like, hey, I'm going to need you to pony up some cash

79
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,000
afterwards. And don't do it like you're going to break their knees because they got a free ride.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,200
But he was doing a favor. I mean, this should have been obvious. Like,

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,120
you were obviously doing him a solid by going on this trip and not making him go alone to go

82
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,000
college hunting, which will be a bummer. Also, side note, this guy's going to move five hours away.

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,640
That $20 isn't going to move five hours away. That $20 is just going to be gone.

84
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,200
Yeah.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,320
So I think that if he wants to sever your friendship, that's his problem.

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,560
He also totally invited you. So it's a little sketchy to be like, hey, you want to go with me?

87
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
Oh, by the way, now that you want to come, it's going to cost you.

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,120
By the way, if you're going to split gas money, you got to do it tank by tank. And you fill up

89
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,640
one tank, he fills up the other tank. If you're going to split it, that's how you do it.

90
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,640
You don't fill up all the tanks and say, let me crunch some numbers real quick.

91
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
Do some mileage calculations.

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Let me see it. With the mileage and the juice, you now owe me 65.

93
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Large.

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,920
65 large. It's 65 large.

95
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
It's $65,000.

96
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,840
I drove there on plutonium, purest plutonium. What a dick.

97
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,560
My car is fueled by Justin Bieber's fingers. So that is very pricey.

98
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,200
Why is it his fingers? Did you see that fool?

99
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Did you see that?

100
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,840
Did he do the funniest thing?

101
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,600
The fucking, Travis, did you see this?

102
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,640
No, what was it? I don't even find the exact quote. Hold on.

103
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,920
So Justin Bieber visited the Anne Frank house like you do.

104
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,840
Is this where your friend took you for a five-hour drive?

105
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Because that's insane.

106
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,320
We're going to go to Anne Frank University.

107
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,960
That's a destination hot dog. You're going to love it there.

108
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,480
He went there and he had such a great time. It's very meaningful. It's a stirring experience.

109
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
One is struck at the Anne Frank Museum.

110
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Um, and being so struck, Justin Bieber picked up pen, put it to the guestbook and wrote.

111
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,560
Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl.

112
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
Hopefully she would have been a Belieber.

113
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,680
That almost sounds menacing, doesn't it?

114
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,840
Like if she knows what's good for her.

115
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,320
If she wasn't a Belieber, fuck that broad.

116
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,960
If she walked the true and honest path, then my love would have protected her.

117
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,400
Do you know what I think she would not have actually been a fan of?

118
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,120
Anything that emitted any kind of sound whatsoever that may betray her position.

119
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
She was a discreet young woman.

120
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,960
And I think that you screaming the word baby, like some sort of shrieking

121
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,640
mandragora would fucking put her sort of off a little bit.

122
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,520
The man wears giant sunglasses and gold gloves. Like she's trying to keep a low pro.

123
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,040
She's trying to skirt it under the under the raid.

124
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,240
And you are about as above the raid as there possibly is.

125
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,560
Plus she couldn't she wouldn't be able to help herself from screaming and just

126
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
grabbing at you, grabbing at your gins.

127
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
We're getting off topic.

128
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,680
We're getting off topic for the first time ever.

129
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,600
No, but this is a bet. This is a legitimately shitty move.

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,560
You weren't going you were going to try to help him out.

131
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,880
You were certainly like not this was not like a shared buddy trip.

132
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,800
I mean, I think I think that unless you're thinking about the college too, in which case,

133
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,560
like, I mean, I guess.

134
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,280
But even then, it seems kind of weanery because it wasn't discussed beforehand.

135
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,360
Like he blew it, you know, if he wanted that to be part of the arrangement,

136
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
he should have brought it up before.

137
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
I think that you are well within your rights to not necessarily be like,

138
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,440
uh, no, fuck you.

139
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm not giving you half the money.

140
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
But to say, listen, man, I don't have that money,

141
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,280
but now I owe you a favor for the ride and I'll hit you back later.

142
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,840
You know what I mean?

143
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,360
And then it'll probably just drop and never be a thing again anyways.

144
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,320
You got to kill your friend.

145
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
You got to kill your friend.

146
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
You got to kill your friend.

147
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
Man, we haven't dropped one of those in a while, have we?

148
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,960
Listen, I've been watching a lot of Justify.

149
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,200
And when you don't got that money, you got to kill him.

150
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,280
You got to either kill him or like you got to trick somebody into getting the money

151
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,960
for you from some bank that apparently has been robbed 18 times.

152
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,120
The whole reason we have that Bob Ball disclaimer at the top of the show.

153
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,840
Thank you, Bob Ball.

154
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,280
So we can advise people to kill people as a joke and then we can't get sued for it.

155
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
And we are squandering that.

156
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
Hey, can I tangent off for a second, you guys?

157
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:36,880
Sure.

158
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,920
Sure.

159
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
I saw a commercial last night.

160
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,720
You know, those pass it on commercials where it's like integrity, pass it on,

161
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,400
you know, sportsmanship, pass it on.

162
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,040
I saw one.

163
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
Those are for Scientology, right?

164
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,040
Yeah.

165
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
I saw one last night where like a teacher is in a classroom and it's all these middle

166
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,680
school students and she's given a test and the kid starts passing a note.

167
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,960
So she rolls over, like pins down the note with her ruler and all the kids like, oh,

168
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,000
and she opens the note and it says, let's not cheat.

169
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,920
And she like looks at the kids and nods and the title comes up.

170
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
Honesty, pass it on.

171
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
Wait a minute.

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
The conspiracy is off.

173
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,440
Abort, abort.

174
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,080
But like, is the phrasing of that note not something that the teacher would go, wait,

175
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
hold up, wait.

176
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,240
So like until this moment, it was down.

177
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
Like, oh, you know what?

178
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,120
On second thought, guys, let's not cheat.

179
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,520
What a wonderful way of casting dispersions on your seatmate.

180
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,760
You want to pass him a note as I, on second, actually despite what you said.

181
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
I don't know what he's talking about.

182
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
No, I will not gay kiss your wiener.

183
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,720
Let me see that note.

184
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,760
No, I will not gay kiss your wiener.

185
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,960
Honesty, pass it on.

186
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Todd, Todd.

187
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
This is an all girls school.

188
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,640
You're an absurdist comedian.

189
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,520
I think you're fantastic.

190
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,480
I think you're great.

191
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
I love your work.

192
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,560
Like a young Andy Kaufman.

193
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,280
You want a yahoo?

194
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,640
Yeah, please.

195
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,800
Uh, this yahoo.

196
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
Oh God, it's the Ira Ray show this week.

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,040
Um, hold on, I'll give it, I'll give it to you.

198
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
I'll give you the fucking prompt.

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,440
Okay.

200
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,960
This yahoo was sent by-

201
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
I want to make sure I'm ready.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,960
This, oh fuck.

203
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640
Are you going to warn me beforehand?

204
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll say is I'll say the only prompt that you have, that we know that you've come to know

205
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,520
the relationship that we built.

206
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,720
I wasn't going to betray that.

207
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,920
This yahoo was-

208
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,400
Thank you.

209
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,760
This yahoo was sent by Ira Ray.

210
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
Wait, I wasn't ready.

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm done.

212
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,920
Uh, thank you Ira Ray.

213
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
Just one, just give it, give it to me one more time.

214
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
This one was sent by Ira Ray.

215
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,640
Ira Ray, who wants to know?

216
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,240
How did you do that with your mouth?

217
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,280
You're going to have to pass it.

218
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,440
Can you pass into tabulature to, to that song?

219
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,320
Cause it sounded like you played a J shark.

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
It sounded like you played an R, R minor seventh.

221
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,480
It also sounded a little bit like you were just giving him like in Western movies.

222
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,960
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

223
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,460
Thank you.

224
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,820
Nope, that's not it.

225
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,380
Here it is.

226
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,940
It's not gonna-

227
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,900
Are you Ira Ray?

228
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,260
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

229
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:16,980
Thank you Ira Ray.

230
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,060
It's by yahoo interviewer Fairix who asks.

231
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,340
Please don't interrupt it because it's so good.

232
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,840
Okay.

233
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,500
How does one become the official Ronald McDonald?

234
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,900
I see that McDonald's uses basically one actor for all their media.

235
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,260
And just out of curiosity, was wondering how one goes about applying to be the Ronald McDonald.

236
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Have checked out their website and it is never a job position open.

237
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,180
Not that I want to be him, but just was curious how someone would go about becoming.

238
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,220
First of all, horse shit.

239
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,500
Of course you want to be him.

240
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,860
Obviously everyone does who, who in their right mind would fucking look up to see if

241
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,660
that position was open.

242
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,860
If they weren't trying to be him.

243
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,300
Look up to see if that position was open if they weren't trying to fill it.

244
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,060
And you know you want to do it for the ladies.

245
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:11,540
Gentlemen, I have before me a list of all the actors who've ever played Ronald McDonald.

246
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,220
They only use one at a time.

247
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,100
Is this, is this for real?

248
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:22,260
Yes, I'm gonna ask you skill, skill testing questions about the actors who've played

249
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,740
Ronald McDonald.

250
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,460
First off, since 1963, how many actors do you believe have played Ronald McDonald?

251
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,700
Twelve.

252
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,140
Since 1963?

253
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,380
Yeah.

254
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:30,740
Six.

255
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,220
Incorrect, nine.

256
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,260
Nine.

257
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,900
Split the middle.

258
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,660
We would have fucking had it, Travis.

259
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,100
Let's work together on the rest.

260
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,500
Okay.

261
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,940
No, Travis, wait.

262
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,740
Let's not cheat.

263
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,620
I don't want to cheat anymore.

264
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,300
I probably, I came up with the idea first, but let's abandon that.

265
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,340
Let's abandon that.

266
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,420
I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you four names.

267
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:01,540
You're going to tell me whether or not they were actual actor, the name, the actual names

268
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,620
of actors that played Ronald McDonald.

269
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:03,860
Okay.

270
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,420
Jack the Pecky.

271
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,300
Okay.

272
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,380
Joe McGard.

273
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,220
Okay.

274
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,500
King Moody, Squire Fridell.

275
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I'm going to say all are actual.

276
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,740
All are real.

277
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,860
King Moody played Ronald McDonald from 75 to 1984.

278
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,380
With a name like that, you simply cannot have a bad day.

279
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,900
I also imagine, I want that to not be his Christian name.

280
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,740
I want that to be like, he was sitting there going, I just need something to set me apart

281
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,780
from the other applicants.

282
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:41,140
Or like his wife was like, man, why are you so down all the time, King Moody?

283
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,900
And he's like, fucking stop digging.

284
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,220
You have struck gold, my lady.

285
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,260
I also want to point out how much Joe McGard sounds like, oh my God.

286
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,060
Joe McGard.

287
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,580
Joe McGard, you guys.

288
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:59,380
I am horrified of this person who walks into a McDonald's with Ronald McDonald clown makeup

289
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,260
and kit.

290
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,860
He's wearing his Ronald McDonald glad rags and he walks into a McDonald's like, here

291
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,580
I am.

292
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,300
Look no further.

293
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,740
Look no further, you found me.

294
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,860
Is this the audition zone?

295
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,860
Is that what they call those?

296
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,140
I'm ready to ace this thing.

297
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,740
I'm ready to ace this audition in the audition zone.

298
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,100
Sir, please get out of the ball pit.

299
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,300
Why not?

300
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,780
This is what this is what McD does.

301
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,620
This is what me, McDo.

302
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,420
He played the role.

303
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,500
King Moody played the role for like seven years.

304
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,620
It's insanity.

305
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,340
Yeah.

306
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,100
You know, I would like to see it like you see a list of like all the heavyweight champions

307
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,420
where it's like King Moody versus blank.

308
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,100
Because I think it's like a yearly thing.

309
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,060
Someone steps up and they're like, I'm ready to be the new Ronald.

310
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,060
And then you got to fight it out.

311
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,420
And then eventually someone displaces and that's how they become the new Ronald.

312
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,820
Who was the Ronald McDonald during our childhood?

313
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,220
Well, it was mainly Squire Fridell, I guess, who was who had the part.

314
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,340
Is there an active?

315
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,660
There's not an active agent right now, right?

316
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,140
He's asleep.

317
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,260
He's a sleeper.

318
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,980
No.

319
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,140
Brad Lennon is the active agent.

320
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,700
What the fuck?

321
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,740
I haven't seen a fucking Ronald McDonald in a commercial in a grip.

322
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,100
I actually really like-

323
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,220
Is he just a body that they did the cast of for the statue that sits out on the bench

324
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,340
with his arm around you?

325
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,220
And that is actually a coffin made just for him.

326
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,860
That's where he lies in wait.

327
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,220
Ready for the activation order.

328
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,660
Actually, if you click on the bio of Brad Lennon right now,

329
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
it takes you to the page for Ronald McDonald,

330
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,900
which is a very sort of Dread Pirate Roberts vibe that I enjoy.

331
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,220
By the way, guys, I conducted a survey among our listeners a couple of weeks ago

332
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,500
and they said their favorite thing is when Justin does internet on tape.

333
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,860
Who has the time to read the internet when Justin can just read the whole thing to you?

334
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,740
You know, someday I'm gonna get through the whole thing.

335
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,540
IMDB is so deep and it's like it would take me ages to read all of it.

336
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,420
Don't worry about it.

337
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,700
Don't worry about it.

338
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,660
Justin's got you for your car, for your kitchen, for your home.

339
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,260
I will read the internet to you anywhere.

340
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,740
Anywhere.

341
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,300
Anytime.

342
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:13,060
I hope to high heavens that McDonald's never does the thing that

343
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,620
I feel like a couple places have done it.

344
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,860
Wendy's is the latest transgressor where they take their mascot

345
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,780
and they turn it into a real human being with like real human being attributes

346
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,980
and then have them talk about how fun their food is.

347
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,540
Like Wendy's has-

348
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,220
Are you talking about that red haired girl?

349
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,100
It's a red haired girl and she's like a real girl now

350
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,340
and she's just like, you know, an attractive looking-

351
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,300
But you know what's funny?

352
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,140
I've never once seen a single Wendy's commercial though where she is called Wendy.

353
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,420
No, but come the fuck on.

354
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,300
There's clear-

355
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,260
Well, no, here's the troubling thing though about this commercial.

356
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,380
There's also a Wendy's commercial airing opposite that one that features actual Wendy

357
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
and she's an overweight middle-aged woman.

358
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,420
So that's gotta be hard to see that they've like recast you as the person you are.

359
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,100
They also have a Wendy's commercial in which the cartoon emblem of Wendy's speaks.

360
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Yeah, I don't like that either.

361
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,420
So it's like a father, son, and holy ghost kind of thing that they've got going on

362
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,300
that's really creeping me out.

363
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,140
One of these Wendy's is gonna do it for you.

364
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,700
You will be able to beat it to one of these Wendy's.

365
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,540
I hope to Jesus, if you're a McDonald's executive

366
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,300
and you're listening to this episode of the podcast,

367
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,260
thank you for your patronage,

368
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,860
but also if you ever make a commercial featuring a Ronald McDonald who is not a clown,

369
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,100
can you imagine like a hip reinvention of Ronald?

370
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,500
He's like a 22-year-old hipster that just like talks about how fun it is to eat chicken dippers.

371
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,860
Well, I mean, he's carrot top.

372
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,620
If we bring him into the real, if we bring him out of cool world and into our world.

373
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,380
I referenced that movie the other day.

374
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,740
I said the cartoon movie with Brad Pitt that wasn't Roger Rabbit

375
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,300
and people thought I was fucking smoking crack.

376
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,820
Let me get with it.

377
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,100
Yep, get with the program.

378
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,140
How do you pick?

379
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,540
Okay, so the question, the pressing question.

380
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,420
Actually, how much when they pick a Pope,

381
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,220
they dig deep, right?

382
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,780
Like they have to get into his history.

383
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,260
You do that with the president when you're vetting your presidential candidate.

384
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,060
Like how deep do you have to go into the closet

385
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:34,180
of the man who will be playing the giant child befriending clown?

386
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:40,260
My opinion, my take on it, I bet it is like president vetting plus Pope times three.

387
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,500
Yeah.

388
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,460
Oh, it's gotta be.

389
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,020
Well, yeah, because how do you find a clown?

390
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,500
Because I imagine they're looking for former clown experience.

391
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,220
How do you find a clown that hasn't at least killed one kid?

392
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,300
Mm-hmm.

393
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,100
How do you do that?

394
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,620
Good luck.

395
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,980
How do you thread that needle?

396
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,260
You can't thread that needle.

397
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,260
You gotta like Captain America it and just take like a normal guy who hasn't been a clown

398
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,500
and then get Stanley Tucci to inject stuff in him.

399
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,380
How do you think clowns know what kids find so funny?

400
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,300
It's because they've cut them open.

401
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,900
They got inside there.

402
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,780
This is getting dark.

403
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,020
I don't know how Squire Fidel is so easily able to touch the heart of a child.

404
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,820
Yeah, because he knows like exactly where it is.

405
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,780
Exactly where the aorta starts.

406
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,620
Do you think at this point he's Knight Fidel?

407
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,340
I hope so.

408
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,620
Let's answer your question.

409
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,340
I'm fucking freaked out.

410
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,900
Oh, one other note about Squire Fidel super quick.

411
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,260
He was the Ronald McDonald in Mac and Me.

412
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,420
So if you've seen Mac and Me.

413
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,820
Please turn to side two.

414
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,660
I knew that one though.

415
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,420
I didn't know.

416
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,340
You didn't know shit.

417
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,900
Mac and Me only made back half of the budget.

418
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,940
Stop it.

419
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,340
Stop it, please.

420
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,540
You want another question?

421
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:55,940
Jesus.

422
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,180
Not Mac and Me related and not from Wikipedia.

423
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,980
Is that what you're telling me?

424
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,480
Yes.

425
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,100
At the college dorm in which I resided for the past semester,

426
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,020
there is a shared set of washing machines and dryers for students usage in the building basement.

427
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,980
While my laundry is washing, I'll generally spend time up in my room or chatting with friends.

428
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,900
However, if I'm away from my clothes for any amount of time they are done in the wash,

429
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,060
it's likely another resident will remove my clothes, place it on top of the washing machine,

430
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,500
and set their own clothes to wash.

431
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,820
This happens also when I use the dryer and my friends have all tested the same.

432
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,540
Am I mistaken in thinking this is a violation of my right not to have my underwear viewed publicly

433
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,340
and touched by foreign hands or am I just being oversensitive?

434
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,820
What should I do to prevent this from happening again?

435
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,900
Not a nudist in New England.

436
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,420
There's a really easy solution.

437
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,220
Yeah.

438
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,500
To keep this from happening again.

439
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,220
And that's fucking just take your shit out of the shit when it's done.

440
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,740
Because people are busy too.

441
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,020
Other people are busy.

442
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:00,180
I would also ask, kind of the one factor is it depends on the size of the laundry room.

443
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,300
Is this like you guys share one set of washer and dryer

444
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,580
or there's like 20 sets of washer and dryer and someone's just being an asshole?

445
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,140
I mean, it's obviously-

446
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,500
Wait, is your question, someone will see an empty washing machine,

447
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,140
see a full one of your clothes and say, well, fuck that guy.

448
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,940
You know what?

449
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:22,180
At my college in my dorm, there were sets of washers and dryers that people just wouldn't use

450
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,180
because they all had different opinions of like,

451
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,620
oh no, it takes way too long to dry in those and it won't get it all the way done

452
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,540
and that washer smells weird.

453
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,460
So yeah, there would be like people had favorite washers and dryers that they would do that.

454
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,900
That's fucking bonkers.

455
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,300
It was.

456
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,380
And then I saw one time like somebody put tennis shoes in a fucking dryer.

457
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,780
Oh.

458
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,140
I'm like, just destroy it.

459
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,860
How's that-

460
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,060
Destroy the dryer.

461
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,780
How's that potpourri spreading?

462
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,820
Yeah, let's heat these up.

463
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,100
Let's get the funk out of these.

464
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,700
And they like duct taped the dryer shut because like, you know, it would knock the door open.

465
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,220
It was the fucking stupidest thing.

466
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,500
You are living under the assumption that everybody in your dorm is a pervert

467
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:11,460
and that they will, like when they are taking your poopy boxers out of the washer,

468
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,900
they're like looking at them and just like, oh God, yes, this is just how I wanted to spend my Tuesday

469
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,580
is touching something that has touched a complete stranger's bung.

470
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,100
This is just what I needed.

471
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,980
Even that sexual, the sexual evidence has been erased by washing.

472
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,940
Exactly.

473
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,140
You can't even trick yourself and the thing is there's some still young-

474
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,900
And they are soaking wet.

475
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,220
Oh.

476
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,260
There's young fresh bung butter on there somewhere.

477
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,220
Oh God.

478
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,460
God.

479
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,500
You fool.

480
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,460
This is exactly what I-

481
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,140
You fool butthole.

482
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,900
If there's anything I love touching more than strangers undergarments,

483
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,220
it's when they're also moist.

484
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,260
Fuck.

485
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,140
No, it's gross and it's kind of rude.

486
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,020
And you did it.

487
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,740
It's your fault.

488
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,220
And you did it.

489
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,340
Just go downstairs and wait to open, like wait to do that.

490
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,220
Find out how long-

491
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,740
If your complaint is, man, I hate waiting for my laundry to be done.

492
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,300
Yeah.

493
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,700
Yeah.

494
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,740
Yeah, everybody.

495
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,620
Everybody does.

496
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,980
You know what people also hate?

497
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,540
Waiting to start doing their laundry, waiting to wait for their laundry to be done

498
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,380
because somebody left their shit in the shit.

499
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,420
Just take it out.

500
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,780
Set a timer now.

501
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,100
That said, I'm going to tell you how to do it.

502
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,660
Okay.

503
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,180
And I've never done this before but it occurred to me and I think it would work.

504
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,980
And it requires that when you put your laundry in the machine,

505
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,420
no one else is in there.

506
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,660
Okay.

507
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,700
Okay, you're going to pop a sign the same size as the window of the washer and dryer

508
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,900
that says out of order.

509
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,940
Oh, okay.

510
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,260
Your shit is done and people come downstairs.

511
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,340
They're like, oh, well, that one doesn't work.

512
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,700
And they're going to leave your shit alone.

513
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,780
Let's just hope they don't come in while it's-

514
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,700
It's all fucking functioning.

515
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,820
Even then, my point being that it will put a seed of doubt in their minds and they're like,

516
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,740
well, someone put their clothes in, but what if it is like,

517
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,900
you're not supposed to, you know, burn their clothes there to like,

518
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,100
make their clothes smell like dookie.

519
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,620
Well, then why don't you put more, make it more specific

520
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,420
and put a sign on it that says like, this is super hot.

521
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,940
It'll cook your clothes.

522
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,300
Or if you just put a sign up on the dryer that just says, is a microwave.

523
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,260
Do you like that?

524
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,380
That would be pretty good.

525
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,660
The first time that you go to leave your washing or drying unattended

526
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,020
and you put jelly on the handle, then you went,

527
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,700
you went, if you could, ideally you would be waiting in an adjacent washing machine.

528
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,580
You could just pop out and there's jelly.

529
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:36,100
Justin just fucking went through college with a bandolier of Vaseline around it,

530
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,700
just dishing out justice.

531
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,220
Like, you parked a little close to my car.

532
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,700
Let me just-

533
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,500
Vaseline might be more pleasant though.

534
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,900
Like, if you have jelly on your hands, that's like your whole day.

535
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,740
Oh, syrup, syrup.

536
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,180
Oh, syrup fucking forms a bio fuse with your hand.

537
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,940
It melds with your DNA.

538
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,820
Or like, poop.

539
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,140
Come on, Trav.

540
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,460
What?

541
00:27:59,460 --> 00:27:59,860
I-

542
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,580
Come on.

543
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,700
A logical conclusion.

544
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,060
Come on.

545
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,580
You're right.

546
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,460
How do you get poop from your butt to the handle of the washing machine?

547
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,380
We were talking about like, things you can put on pancakes and then you-

548
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,420
Just some jinx, man.

549
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,300
Not like-

550
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,180
We're talking about hijinks, not like fucking federal prison.

551
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,780
Goddamn, for butts.

552
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,820
God, Trav.

553
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,060
Fuck.

554
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,780
Listen, I feel awful.

555
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,940
You really shot the cannon indoors on this one, Trav.

556
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,740
I feel awful.

557
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,060
Yeah.

558
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,940
Do you guys want Yahoo?

559
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,540
Yeah, I do actually.

560
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,220
Oh, this is such a great segue.

561
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,500
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

562
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,500
Are you Ira Ray?

563
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,180
Who wants to know?

564
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,500
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Bob, who asks,

565
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,700
how to hurt someone stole your money.

566
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,340
Someone stole $20 from me and I know they will try again.

567
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,420
I was thinking of putting a mousetrap in my pocket,

568
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,300
so the next time they try to take it, pop, ow.

569
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,740
Yep.

570
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,380
Should I do this?

571
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,500
Couldn't backfire at all.

572
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,660
Should I do this or something else to cause more harm?

573
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,700
I want to have evidence, but I don't want to ruin my pants in the process.

574
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,900
Maybe a needle?

575
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,940
Indian ideas?

576
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,620
What?

577
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,900
Indian-

578
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,620
Any ideas?

579
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,500
Okay.

580
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,980
Okay, wait.

581
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,780
Okay, so they had a $20 bill in their pocket.

582
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,660
They noticed the $20 bill had gone astray and they thought that what had happened was

583
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:31,460
someone had reached into their pants pocket and taken a $20 bill out.

584
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:38,100
This same person has a sort of fundamental misunderstanding of just mousetrap physics.

585
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,540
Or just physics, just spatial physics in general.

586
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,980
Unless you're wearing some fucking jinkos, unless you're sporting those jinkos,

587
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,900
you could put a fucking landmine.

588
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,460
You could put a claymore in those things and it would be fine.

589
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,900
Some jinkos come with landmines.

590
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,940
That's actually the best answer.

591
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,180
It's by Yahoo Answers user Fred who says,

592
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,100
go to Walmart, buy duct tape and several PVC pipes, oil, and glass.

593
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,260
Also buy a radio and a receiver.

594
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,980
Put the oil and shards of glass inside the PVC pipes and close up the ends with duct tape.

595
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,700
Once you do this, put a radio receiver on each PVP pipe.

596
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Use your radio to set off the pipes once you put them in and around his house.

597
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,460
The result of this-

598
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,700
That didn't make any- what?

599
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,020
The result of this is that he will die.

600
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,500
That's how you get back at him, smiley face.

601
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:31,780
Source?

602
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,620
Ex-Marine.

603
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:34,920
Yes!

604
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,000
Oh, Ex-Marine, you've solved the problem so elegantly.

605
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Whiskey Tango Fox try.

606
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,600
Come on, Ex-Marine, Ex-Marine.

607
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,960
The one ingredient you left out of your explosive device is any kind of explosive.

608
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,920
Well, they said oil.

609
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,920
So like, you know how whenever you are on a walkie talkie and you send a message to

610
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,760
one of your friends and it electrocutes them a little bit?

611
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,600
Just a bit.

612
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,800
And it's fine-

613
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,440
God forbid they be anywhere near any kind of oil.

614
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,880
I saw this happen on Mythbusters.

615
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,520
It's fine.

616
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:09,720
I think that if you are building a solution to a problem, if you're constructing a solution

617
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:17,480
to a problem, chief among the requirement for it to be a valid solution is that it does

618
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
not kill you in the process.

619
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,000
And I think that you are really robbing Peter to pay Paul for this one because you will die.

620
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,520
Well, it'd be great too, though, if you destroyed his house and he just barely survives and

621
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,280
looked at you and was like, why did you do this?

622
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,920
I'm like, because you took that $20 out of my pocket.

623
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:41,160
You mean the $20 that is now glass covered, burning ash across the highway?

624
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,600
That used to be your asshole?

625
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,400
That was a full King Solomon.

626
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,760
You just like destroyed it so neither of you could have it to prove that you love that

627
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,720
$20 bill more.

628
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,080
The butt surgery you require tragically is going to cost much, much more than that.

629
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,200
And then after all is said and done, you remember that like you loaned him that $20 when you

630
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,700
were drunk.

631
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,320
I think you got to put a plastic bag in there and you put some sort of some sort of material

632
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,440
on there that just cover your $20 in Vaseline.

633
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,760
Yeah.

634
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,960
Or maybe if there was God, if there was some sort of some sort of secure, some sort of

635
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,640
way to secure your wallet, like to your body that would look cool and also kind of tough

636
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,880
and sort of like let people know what kind of music you listen to.

637
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,600
What if the material you put in your pocket that gets on his hand is some sort of bioluminescent

638
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,120
marking fluid that signals the drone strike attack?

639
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,040
This is that is predicated on you also having access to Drone Sex Marines.

640
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,640
I also though I would counterpoint by saying that it's important that whatever solution

641
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,480
you come up with costs less than $20.

642
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,440
Why don't you just kill them with this drone strike that cost me $20,000 worth of $20,000?

643
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,520
Worth it.

644
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,200
Or just start carrying around $10 bills and then they get they go through all the work

645
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,360
to pickpocket you and they say what it's a 10 and you turn around and say enjoy enjoy

646
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,040
the $10 bill it's half of the haul you thought this isn't pretty good.

647
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,360
Well then you just turn around and go in this economy and then you kick them in the face.

648
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,800
Yeah you say that doesn't fix anything.

649
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:24,760
I got a soda outside of the ATB because I was just parched and I put in $2 for the $1.25

650
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,720
charge for the soda.

651
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,880
It was a wild cherry Pepsi so I was pretty excited.

652
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:35,160
It's rare that I treat myself to a wild cherry Pepsi and the fucking machine spat out seven

653
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,360
dimes and a nickel and I just I swear to God I just turned and walked away from it.

654
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,800
I said nope that's going to be some that's going to someone's going to enjoy that but

655
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,760
it's that's not for me seven times a nickel that's not for me thanks three quarters and

656
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,360
then we can fucking talk about it.

657
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,320
What if you have big enough pockets right and you just converted it $20 into like into

658
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,640
dimes or like nickels and like somebody went to pickpocket you and they're just like what

659
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,480
the fuck I'm gonna be here all day.

660
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,480
I'll tell you an element that would help to set this goof off if there was some coin

661
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,440
smaller than nickels.

662
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,960
Listen I didn't want to get ridiculous okay Justin two thousand pennies you wouldn't be

663
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,840
able to walk.

664
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,440
Yes you would and your fucking ginko jeans it's like you haven't watched Dawson's Creek.

665
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,960
You would have to triple belt it.

666
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,800
Oh god.

667
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,840
Let's go to the money zone.

668
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,160
Seeing you stealing money.

669
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:39,400
Happy belated birthday to Adam Rhodes from Marlena.

670
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,280
His b-day was March 1st.

671
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,440
You missed it by a bit.

672
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,120
Missed it by a skosh.

673
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,600
Here's the thing though this is not Marlena's fault.

674
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,360
We done fucked up.

675
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,920
What did we do?

676
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,680
Jumbotron 5000 our robot our robot Jumbotron 5000 blew up.

677
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,640
He had it he was working on his new Daft Punk album and he messed this one up so.

678
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,760
He lost track of time.

679
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,440
We are very sorry about that.

680
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,560
Running walking going to the store and buy.

681
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Oh wait fuck what day is it?

682
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,120
Ah fuck oh shit I missed her birthday again.

683
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,600
Is he gonna call and apologize?

684
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,400
Of course not.

685
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,760
No he leaves that to us.

686
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,880
The third member of Daft Punk is just a drunk deadbeat dad.

687
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,920
I forgot to pick you up from soccer practice oh no.

688
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,720
Today tonight we will go getting ice cream from the Baskin Robbins at 7 30.

689
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,800
After your sister gets home from ballet.

690
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,320
This was a goldfish that I left in my van and now it's dead.

691
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,440
But I thought you'd like it anyways.

692
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,520
I thought you'd like it anyway.

693
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,840
Either way you learn about real life.

694
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,600
So happy birthday to Adam.

695
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,200
He's officially in his mid-20s.

696
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,600
He's an old man and Marlena says she hopes that this year brings you a wonderful balance of success

697
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,960
and fun.

698
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,200
So we are sorry that we messed this up by six weeks and we're very sorry.

699
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,040
I'm turning 26 this week and I was debating.

700
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
What?

701
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,720
Yeah am I gonna be in my mid or late 20s?

702
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,080
Mid.

703
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,360
Mid.

704
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,120
When does it cross over like 20?

705
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,520
First three years is early 20s mid three years is mid 20s last three years is late 20s.

706
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,280
Okay you got an extra year there.

707
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,720
Travis is telling himself that because he's about to turn 30.

708
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,520
That's correct.

709
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,400
Dirty 30 though.

710
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,320
Yeah.

711
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,360
Flirty 30.

712
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,040
I'm gonna buy myself a Jumbotron message.

713
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,000
Squirty 30?

714
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,840
No.

715
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,080
No.

716
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,400
So Travis we got any other messages?

717
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,440
Yes.

718
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,000
They're on the paper in front of you.

719
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,440
I know that you know that there are.

720
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,320
Do you want me to read them?

721
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,120
Yeah just one of them.

722
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:54,920
Okay.

723
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,680
This next message-

724
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm watching you read two simultaneously.

725
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,240
That would be a real time saver.

726
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,200
I can try.

727
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,000
This next message is for Calvin and it is from Maria.

728
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,000
And Maria wants to wish Calvin happy 30th birthday Calvin.

729
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,480
Calvin is my sexy nerdy best boyfriend.

730
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,280
Well I hope he's also your only boyfriend.

731
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,600
Yeah.

732
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,640
I went with her.

733
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,680
Why aren't you down with-

734
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,000
You know what you're right Griffin in this day and age.

735
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,680
I hope that she has several wonderful boyfriends but Calvin is the best hands down.

736
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,120
Yeah I mean regardless of how it shakes out that's kind of rude I think.

737
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,680
Calvin's the highlighter he's on top.

738
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,880
I bet he is.

739
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,680
Sexy.

740
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,240
He introduced her to my brother my brother and me on a road trip from Vancouver to Montana.

741
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,760
And you still bring this 30-year-old man to tears laughing.

742
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,120
I think that's once to us.

743
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,920
Oh that's hard to tell.

744
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Semantically I'm confused.

745
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,080

It's all about the things that happen.

755
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,240
It's all about big beverages.

756
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,880
I'm gonna drink it now.

757
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,160
This spring Mary Roach gets refreshed.

758
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,480
Some people like Sprite but I prefer Sierra Mist chapter two.

759
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,560
Brace your brace your bladders we're we're getting 42 ounces of learning into this chapter.

760
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,200
Did you know you can drink things with your vagina chapter three.

761
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,360
Speaking of which there's only one way to get liquidated.

762
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,360
In your vagina I bet and that's with a toy from extremistraints.com not a toy.

763
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,360
It's not a toy you know what I mean toy a screwdriver isn't a toy.

764
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,840
It is a tool that is that is used for a purpose to achieve a goal.

765
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,920
It's all for play.

766
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,880
It's all for fun.

767
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,800
I've never once heard someone say like I'm gonna go buy myself a new sex tool.

768
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,120
Well that's because it's a toy.

769
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:24,600
I've never once heard someone say like I'm gonna go buy myself a new sex tool well that's because they don't understand.

770
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,080
The word toys appears no fewer than 13 times on the front page of extremistraints.com.

771
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:36,440
I don't think you know what they don't want to scare people off but orgasms is work.

772
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,080
You know what I mean.

773
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,360
Hey are you sitting down for some sex work.

774
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:59,640
Extremistraints.com is an adult superstore you might remember them from donating the lube you've been using if you're a maximum fun member but now they're they've they're they're coming for all of your holes with things like the Zeus Deluxe digital power box.

775
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,800
I don't know what it does.

776
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,920
I don't think anyone does.

777
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,600
I think it is digital.

778
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,800
It's not like it's not a puzzle box that you solve and then pleasure demons come and tear your sack apart.

779
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,440
It looks like an off-brand Taiwanese Gameboy.

780
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,440
So I don't think it's that.

781
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,440
It does have optional penis bands if you okay I'm getting it.

782
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,040
Starting to understand how the simple machines interact.

783
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,240
There's a pulley involved.

784
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,760
You put your dick on a wedge.

785
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,840
So thank you to extremistraints.com if you go to the site and use the coupon code.

786
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,880
What is it?

787
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,600
What is it now?

788
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,640
This is what I was fucking afraid of.

789
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,600
It's not sexy Garfield.

790
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,280
Sexy Garfield's been compromised.

791
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,120
Sexy Garfield has been compromised.

792
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,680
Fanny time.

793
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,400
Fanny time.

794
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,200
Fanny time.

795
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,520
Fuck.

796
00:40:48,520 --> 00:41:02,520
Fuck and I did absolutely 100% someone tweeted with MBNBAM and the hashtag Fanny time and I absolutely blocked them from the member of the member of the meme account and my personal account.

797
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:02,760
Yeah.

798
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,280
That person is dead to me.

799
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,520
I called out like four or five people.

800
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:06,840
Yeah.

801
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,240
Fucking.

802
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,120
And one person literally said I just want to see if Griffin was paying attention.

803
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,920
We told you not to do that.

804
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,120
Oh actually jokes on him I definitely didn't see that one.

805
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,000
So fuck that guy.

806
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Seriously guys, that's the worst

807
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,280
Please hey. Hey guys. Can you do me a favor and

808
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Not do the opposite of this thing

809
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah, internet fart

810
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,040
It's the fucking it's the fucking internet equivalent of making armpit farts so stop it stop it cut it out

811
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,760

00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Here's another question

819
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,000
Hey brothers three

820
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,720
When I have a bunch of people over to drink at my house, and I wake up before them in the morning

821
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,560
What am I allowed to do can I clean do I have to stay as silent as possible?

822
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,200
That's from the hungover host in st. Paul so these parties that you haven't

823
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,920
Why aren't we invited?

824
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,880
I like this question by the way. I'm this is me all over. I like to wake up early

825
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,800
I don't care if I am hungover. Yeah, I'll power through yeah, you know you're actually if you're hungover

826
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
You're more likely to wake up early

827
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:49,600
um no you clean you clean you don't worry about staying silent because nothing is better than like fucking tearing shit up and getting

828
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,880
real raw and rowdy and

829
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,840
Then you wake up at the morning to a fucking sparkling lemon fresh house

830
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:01,720
And if you can be the person that facilitates that you're gonna own earn a lot of social capital among your friend

831
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,720
I would I think they're asking like do I need to stay quiet so I don't worry about waking up my drunk

832
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,960
No, no, no if they can't sleep through it, then they're not really hungover. It's a catch-22

833
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,120
They must not have been that tired in the first place

834
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:19,800
I feel like there's a certain amount of like unspoken social contract where it's like hey if you crash after we just have a wild

835
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,400
Party and trashes my house if you crash on my couch

836
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:30,160
You help clean up the next day doesn't it seem a little passive-aggressive though to awaken to the party host like oh, no

837
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
No stay comfortable

838
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,940
No running a dust buster over your dusty from cleaning up yourself mess

839
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,240
You don't want me to throw up on my dad, but no, please

840
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,700
Stay you look so cozy like a snug bug in a rug

841
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,760
The bigger tactical error that you've made here is if you have a party where everybody's drinking is that your house?

842
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,880
The only best thing you can do is you have to you have to clean up

843
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,120
While you're drunk because you will not it is like a it's like walking

844
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,880
You know walking when you're drunk is like teleporting you think to yourself

845
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm gonna go to this place, and then the next thought you have is hey. I'm at this place. That was amazing

846
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,200
That's what cleaning when you're drunk is like because you don't the time does not grate on you. You don't feel it

847
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,760
You're just like in manual. You know you're in you're in autopilot

848
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,440
Why is that coffee table in the front yard?

849
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,600
Shut shut up shut up. I cleaned it clean

850
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,720
This floor was dirty all over it and so I clean I there's more room now has anyone seen the cat

851
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,280
Oh, she cleaned it. That's shit. You tore the ceiling fan out of the ceiling yeah for a ceiling bocce ball

852
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:51,280
Cleaned it got in the way of ceiling bocce if you're if you're genuinely worried about this just put a put a pan of bacon on

853
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,340
You put a pan of bacon on nobody's gonna be upset about waking up

854
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,700
Everyone's gonna wake up like fucking Wayne Brady and that Folgers commercial like fucking doing little twirls down the hall

855
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,020
ready to roll

856
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,220
I'm still BAC one two one

857
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,060
But I don't fucking care. Yeah, hand me that poem all of let's get real

858
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,780
Let's go. Let's go mr.. Clean on this bitch

859
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,700
Hey, I barfed in the mop water is it it's probably cash, right?

860
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,900
It's probably not good to go anymore right should probably swap that out

861
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:29,440
Listen, I gotta go to the hospital and get a saline drip. I am NOT gonna come back from this on my own

862
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,780
Do you think fucking bacon the baking council?

863
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:39,340
We're like a day away from publishing that first commercial that was like the best part of waking up

864
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:45,580
He's bacon and then fucking Folgers heard they fucking spied on it. It was like we were gonna

865
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,340
Go with the second best thing cuz I mean that's where we fall in the hierarchy

866
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:54,740
But let's scoop him is there bacon flavored coffee no, but there yeah, I'm sorry. Yes. There is I'm sorry

867
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,600
There's big ironic ironic small business owners

868
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:04,100
There's at least one that was like fuck it put bacon in it. I think if someone made me Folgers

869
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:10,660
No as opposed to the being the best part waking up that would actually be the worst thing

870
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,700
They could do for me to me cuz then like I have to drink it

871
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,420
Yeah, I have to drink their Folgers and like you're a Brazilian shit

872
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:26,760
Right if your coffee comes in a tub bigger than your head you probably are not eating having that gourmet stuff

873
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,080
It's probably not the good stuff. I didn't know that's what you do

874
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,380
I didn't I didn't realize we've gotten so far above our raising Jesus Justin. It's not like instant

875
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,900
But you know I don't think that's what we're working with, but I you know Justin. I'm down here in the real America

876
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:46,660
Drinking my blue collar just hard-working American from your from your ivory tower in West, Virginia

877
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,660
You could you think you're above everyone

878
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,700
God do you guys even grind your own whole bean coffee? Don't you yeah absolutely?

879
00:46:53,700 --> 00:47:01,200
I know with a bird with the bird coffee grinder. I grind exactly what I need that morning, and I and I and I

880
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,820
Cook it that way you sound like a Frenchman. I

881
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,780
Do like a French roast. I knew it. That's my jam, too

882
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,820
Oh, but I get it from but I get it from HEB. Which is like fucking

883
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,540
Do you get whole bean or you get ground I?

884
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,140
oscillate I

885
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,140
Switch it sometimes

886
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,520
Getting pre-chewed pizza. Yeah, that's the same thing okay?

887
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:30,440
But whole bean coffee is weaker than pre-ground that doesn't make any sense. Well, okay. You know you have to grind it

888
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,900
This doesn't taste like anything

889
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:40,200
Sometimes I just eat spoonfuls of coffee just to wake up cuz I'm American what if you jerk off every morning and

890
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,700
Like before you do anything else

891
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,420
You think that becomes the best part of

892
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:52,500
The best part of waking up is beating it the best in a cup

893
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:01,660
The best part of waking up is folgers in your cup unless you jerk off every morning before you drink

894
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:07,460
You folgers it also is somebody making bacon because it could pretty much be number three

895
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,980
Hey brothers three what I have a bunch of people over to drink at my house

896
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,620
And I wake up before them in the morning. What am I allowed to do kind of masturbate or just a silent spa?

897
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,620
Can I masturbate or cook bacon?

898
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,540
You cook the bacon the crackle of the bacon's fat

899
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,820
Provides it provides a smoke screen an audio smoke screen for you to jerk behind

900
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,340
And then the jerking and forgetting that you're cooking the bacon provides a literal smoke screen

901
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,420
Because there's a grease fire in your house worth it though trust me

902
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:42,140
No one is going to be upset if you wake them up from their hangover sleep because of a grease fire. We gotta get out

903
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,460
Give me like 45 more seconds

904
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
You guys want yahoo I do

905
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:59,340
This yahoo is sending by Caleb Osteen. Thank you Caleb. It's by yahoo answers user Steve Jansen who asks

906
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,980
What song would you listen to on route to eliminate bin Laden?

907
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,620
Now I'm just being a little foolish granted

908
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:14,340
I'm sure those seals were way too busy to be listening to music having said that I had to ask after hearing about Obama

909
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,020
Coming out to the press dinner to Hulk Hogan's real American did that happen?

910
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,780
I don't remember that so what song would you kick bin Laden's blank blank blank to?

911
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:31,100
I'm just glad that this person acknowledges their whimsy beforehand if it's not

912
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,060
Christmas shoes

913
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,020
To get real you want to get the world stop turning

914
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,560
What are you even doing cuz you listen to Christmas shoes?

915
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,820
And you think why did his mom have to be so sick on Christmas?

916
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:49,680
And then you also then you make the leap to it was probably bin Laden's fault, and then it's a vengeance a Christmas shoes vengeance case

917
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:57,360
Because you put on your your Christmas shoes to put a boot in his ass mm-hmm. I would listen to the theme from night court

918
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,440
You would not see that coming

919
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,360
Yeah, it's got to be the theme to like growing pains or something like that. It's got to be

920
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,200
Well I need something to like remind me of what's so great about America

921
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:20,520
And there's nothing greater than the fact that Alan thick wrote a theme song for his own television show now

922
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:27,960
Yes, he is Canadian. I will give you that I will I will see that point to you. I think I would compose my own song

923
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,960
How would that go trap I think just I don't know because I would have to be inspired by the moment

924
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:41,280
But I'm saying as I take I assume a chopper of some kind sitting in a chopper with my best friends

925
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,120
on a mission from a god

926
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,720
My best friend is really a gun

927
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,520
He's always been there for me. It's jump by van halen a little gauche

928
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,820
I feel like if I if I was bumping that so loud through my maximum fun earbuds

929
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,960
That I got through the max fun drive and like my compatriots heard it

930
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,460
They would look at me like come on man have a little respect for the guy

931
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,440
I know I think the appropriate song is no diggity by Blackstreet

932
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,040
What song are you guys most embarrassed?

933
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
That gets you psyched up on

934
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,120
Unironically pumped by what that would be gold Trans Am by Kesha

935
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:32,220
And then ironically I said oh yeah completely unironically. I'm a huge Kesha fan. Does that get you like pumped though?

936
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,640
Yeah, if I can get it's the fucking jam

937
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,160
Okay

938
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:40,760
So that gets you and it's all about America like she references fucking like Lynyrd Skynyrd and shit in there like magic carpet ride

939
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,600
I really like

940
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,880
That Harlem Shake song except. I like everything before

941
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,200
That drop I like everything like the build-up is so great and the drop

942
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,560
I feel like kind of lets me down a little bit. I usually just stop those videos right there

943
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,360
I really don't get that I don't get it. I don't get it

944
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,860
It's more fun to stop it before it gets the drop and just pretend like it's a person only I can see

945
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,400
Yeah, and no one else in the room is aware of that person's presence. Sometimes I'll listen to the streak

946
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:23,560
While you're killing Osama bin Laden, yeah, that's like that's like my that's what gives me a murder boner if you're gonna listen

947
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,560
I mean if you're gonna listen to

948
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,680
What's that motherfucker's name? Ray Stevens if you're gonna listen to a Ray Stevens song about

949
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,960
While you're killing Osama bin Laden. Yeah, why would you not listen to Osama yo mama? I know it's the obvious

950
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,700
It's the obvious choice. I I don't know. I'll tell you what I wouldn't listen to is the soundtrack to Zero Dark Thirty snooze fest

951
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,100
Where's the fucking?

952
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,320
Where's the right? Where's the trit? You know what I mean?

953
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,880
You want like one and like even if it's just one tune

954
00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:01,200
like a suit song when they tried to tie for true shred as soon as Andy Dwyer puts two in his chest I

955
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:08,280
Want it to be like fucking got him for freedom and like that's the only part of that movie where something like that happens

956
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,480
Especially if it was just that just a musical sting

957
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:20,240
So motion as he fell to the floor like take that for 9-eleven you dick and then that's

958
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:28,200
Yeah, that's a cut to black don't and then it got nominated for best song. Don't look Ethel. They call him the street

959
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Tarzan

960
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,400
Selma got run over by a reindeer

961
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:49,840
You would have to change the ending of that movie for that song to work there cuz it's yeah, it's Christmas is when it happened

962
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,740
God, wouldn't that be the best Christmas present of all?

963
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,560
Said the world's greatest evil perpetrator got this take care of

964
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
What if they called that movie taking care of business

965
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,240
And he's like well TCB going back to Pawnee and

966
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,040
Then but they can't play taking care of business because the rights are too expensive

967
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,240
They belong to office man. They belong to office took care of business

968
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:25,920
You're the one the business man the second song on Ray Stevens a summer

969
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,600
Yo mama album is called hang up and drive. I bet that's fucking funny

970
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,160
Don't you think that that's probably a pretty funny song?

971
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,920
I just want to say how proud I am of Ray Stevens for really taking on the hard-hitting issues. Yeah, he's fighting. He's fighting

972
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,280
Irrelevance with every bone in his body. You can't ban my plastic bags

973
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,640
There's a plastic bag ban in Austin, I don't know maybe it hasn't reached you you fucking gas

974
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,840
guzzling

975
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,360
cold

I want to thank blues traveler for talking about how to go down on a woman on Twitter to us

989
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,880

996
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,080
I would also like to point out that Justin has more Twitter followers than blues traveler

997
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,440
Wow, just what that's Justin did write the mid 90s hit hook

00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,240
He did write run around. Oh, no, wait

999
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,520

1016
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,520

1017
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:10,560
They're the best. I don't Roderick is the Ray Stevens of our time. He is God. Don't look helpful. That's the truth. What about a
