1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Step on my applause.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy. Fuck you.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Getting started quick.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Like the Chilean miners emerging from their mysterious hole, we have returned to the great district of Columbia.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Great district you got here.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Maybe the best district in the whole country.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This district I know about.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The capital... end.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Do you all get peeved, do you get seriously teed-o when like people in Austin are like, it's the live music capital of the world?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Y'all should be like, you can't just say that. We're the capital capital.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, wait, are you the capital capital of the world?

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're the terrifying press conference capital of the world.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've never... I have yet to see a press conference come out of DC where I'm like, oh, great.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It never starts with, we did it!

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, so, we were in Brooklyn yesterday. Was anybody at the New York show yesterday?

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That was a lot of people.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We usually travel by plane whenever we do multi-city tours, but we took the Amtrak down from...

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A lot of Amtrak employees here.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To their credit, it was extremely chill.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It was fucking great.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I actually had a moment where I was like, are they gonna tell us to put our seatbelts on and our tray tables up?

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Once you get seats, of course, because the moment when you don't have seats is... when you're traveling with eight people is harrowing and terrible.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We need to talk about... this is technically a one-man intervention for the two of you.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because your train behavior, it left something to be desired.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Is there something specific you're referring to here?

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, the entire time we've been together, all of us and the family will be hanging out talking about real shit.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And then these two will just launch into a deep Poirot talk.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Just do a deep Poirot dive into the, I guess, mysteries. I'm not well-versed.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And when we were on the train, these two were so fucking sure a murder was gonna happen.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So the entire time, like, Travis got up to go to the dining cart and would come back with a coffee and Justin would bust out a little notebook and be like, 9.50 a.m., Travis went to coffee.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Travis did literally say to me when I went to the dining cart, when I got back, just so you know, 9.35 to 9.43, in case you need an alibi.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I guess you assumed each other was the killers?

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, because it's always someone they've mentioned. The book never ends with, it was that guy.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's a definition of a cozy mystery, Griffin.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's two I've been reading, it always happens on a train. The thing I'm most impressed by in Poirot books, everybody knows the minute things happen.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's true. Everybody's able to say, well, I was there at 9.42. I'm like, are you just checking constantly?

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
See, Travis, back then, in the olden times, clocks were like TVs.

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So that was the most fun thing you had to do, be like, oh, I've never had a 10.17 just like this before.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Can't wait to see what 10.18 has in store.

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Probably some sort of illness that will kill me.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Probably cholera. Hope I don't get murdered.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The reality of a train murder is that trains are so big that a murder could have happened like four cars in front of us, and we would never have known.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A train could have happened in the quiet car, and I'd be like, shh.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's the perfect crime. Hold on, let me write that down.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who did it? Shhh.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm going to sound like Eddie Vedder here, but can we get some more monitor, because the echo's a little rough. Thank you.

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thank you so much.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, should we start doing the shit?

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sure.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So we are going to do some questions and some yahoos and some stuff, and then towards the end of the show we'll take some audience questions, and I take it that everybody knows the rule for that.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No honor!

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you. And don't start lining up, we'll call on people.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll call on people. Yeah, yesterday the Brooklynites got very horny for it, and it was like a TED talk.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We didn't even measure the horniness in here. Are y'all horny for this one, or what?

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Horny meters off the charts! That's three boners! We've never gotten that far!

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:48,000
God knows that when I am horny, what I do is, yes! It's happening!

65
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The alternative is the entire audience, and please God, this is not a call and response, I'll leave this stage, but if the entire audience was like, ohhhh, let's do it.

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Or just silence. How horny are you?

67
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Justin, hit me with that first question.

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you for bringing me this podcast I've never listened to, and so basically it's just three brothers talking about how horny they are and what that sounds like?

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yo, no, this is an important distinction. We're not horny at all.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No, I could not be less horny. I'm a little horny. Two months ago, I worked a table for my library consortium at the county fair.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's that? That's some Justice League. Library consortium?

72
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The library consortium.

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The League of Books!

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I worked for the League of Books. I took a walk to get a lemonade, and a gentleman manning one of the carnival game booths said hello to me as I walked by.

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I said hello back.

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There's your first mistake.

77
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They're just trying to get your attention.

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And I said hello back, and then as I continued to walk away, he said, what kind of family you got?

79
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have polled a lot of people, and no one knows what this phrase means.

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is it a pickup line? Is it a conversation starter? Is it a code phrase for carnies?

81
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I deeply regret not asking the man himself for the moment. I may never know the answer. Any ideas? That's from Still Confused in Cataragas.

82
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You here?

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hi!

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait, what kind of family you got?

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hey, what kind of family you got?

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Can I ask one thing? How badly did I butcher Cataragas?

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hell yeah! What's up? No scope!

88
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What kind of family you got?

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I cannot think of a sentence that the meaning of it changes more depending on the tone of the delivery.

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's true, because there's like a youth pastor delivery.

91
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There's a youth pastor delivery, I mean the wording is criminal.

92
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But it could be just, what kind of family you got? And it's just like asking like, you know, are you married? You got kids?

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's I guess a succinct way of answering a bunch of questions all at once, but there's also a like...

94
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
How horny are you kind of way?

95
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What kind of family you got?

96
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Maybe you're playing, maybe you're playing some kind of like family card trading game?

97
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What kind of family you got?

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm playing some swamp energy on my son, Jeremy.

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry, my Jeremy's tapped this route.

100
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I tapped my Jeremy.

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Go uncle.

102
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have a blue-eyes white Jeremy.

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, that's all well and good, but what kind of family you got?

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What if the answer that that person's hoping for is like, bad, take me away.

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Take me to Des Moines with you when you go.

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay, let's look at this in the lens of a carnival professional.

107
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Give me a second.

108
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay.

109
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All right, go on.

110
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why do they need, what information do they need for carnival activities that could be answered?

111
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I mean, it's a grift setup.

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah, right.

113
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There are very few carnival games that I feel like are like, oh, I've got a fair shot at winning this one.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Everybody without an uncle only has to knock over two milk bottles.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Like, it doesn't make any sense.

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I guess it also doesn't make sense that like, am I, are you trying to figure out if it's a wealthy family?

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah.

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Or a very gullible family who loves SpongeBob SquarePants?

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What kind of family got stupid and rich enough to keep buying frogs to flip into those stupid late pads?

120
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's do it.

121
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Keep the frogs coming, my good man.

122
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I have a grandpa who's very proud and confident he can roll the bowling ball up the rails to make it stop in the divot just right.

123
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When that will not be the case.

124
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let me get him.

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let me get him right now.

126
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let me get him.

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Hold on, let me round him up for you.

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They all want to try to flip frogs in there.

129
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They all want to win a goldfish.

130
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
How about a Yahoo answer?

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Whoa.

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
How about this one from level 9000 Yadru Dru Dru Davenport.

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you, Drew.

134
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's from Yadru answers user Rhonda.

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ah, fuck.

136
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There's a banner ad for Destiny 2 at the top and it's just making me think about the fact that I'm here doing this instead of.

137
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Have you ever thought about the fact that the logo at the end of the Destiny is the fidget spinner?

138
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, yeah.

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
All the time.

140
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Anybody here by a show of hands had an actual moment where they're like, I know I got tickets to this thing, but.

141
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay.

142
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Thank you for your honesty.

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I had the moment too.

144
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Rhonda asks.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Help me prank my stepdad.

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I love my stepdad.

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He is so cool.

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Probably not.

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
At the most, a stepdad can be like kind of cool.

151
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Signed Rhonda's stepdad.

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I mean.

153
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I mean.

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But he claims he is, quote, the king of pranks.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I take it back.

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This is a very fucking cool stepdad.

157
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He claims he's the king of pranks.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And so me and my mom want to play a prank on him.

159
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We looked up a few things, but so far nothing seems good enough.

160
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I thought of doing something to his truck.

161
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Smiley face.

162
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's fucking.

163
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's a.

164
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's an escalation right there.

165
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I thought about lining the undercarriage of his truck with C4.

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Get it.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But we live on a farm and anything we can do outside might hurt our horses if they get in it.

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then this might get in the truck.

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's go.

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on.

171
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why today?

172
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Horses.

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why did the horses have to drive our C4 laden truck?

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why did they have to try the trap truck today?

175
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No.

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No.

177
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey, then I'm not proud of that.

178
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Anything you can do outside might hurt our horses if they get in it.

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And then there's the emoticon of like the colon slash.

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So it's like my killer horses.

181
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The only thing that makes I know you need to finish the question.

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But the only thing that makes sense to me is that this question asker is envisioning one of those like big holes with vines.

183
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Right.

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like that's a trap.

186
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, they're making a stepdad trap outside the porch.

187
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What?

188
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What trap are you setting that you're worried about hurting horses but not your step?

189
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, sure.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Stepdads are typically much more fragile than a horse.

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's not true.

192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Except on ABC's new comedy.

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
My stepdad's a horse.

194
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Right on after and before Young Sheldon.

195
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's all we got.

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's all we got folks.

197
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Young Sheldon and horse stepdads.

198
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We got 30 minutes of Sheldon and then 23 hours and 30 minutes of horse torture.

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let me finish the question.

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Any suggestions for awesome pranks I can do inside?

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Me and my mom.

202
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you.

203
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Big laughy face emoticon.

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Laugh on.

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Can I say my favorite part of this question?

206
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There's so much to love about this question.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How do you pick a favorite?

208
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
My favorite part of this question is but nothing's good enough.

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Nothing's good enough for my stepdad.

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The moments where they look at him like, oh that's mmm, not for the king of pranks.

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No.

212
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The problem, I would never call myself the king of pranks because that's painting a huge...

213
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You wouldn't?

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What?

215
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, it's painting a huge target under your back.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah.

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you say I'm the king of pranks, you're basically begging to get pranked.

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's how you end up in one of those YouTube videos where they like pretend to throw your

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
son off like a fucking ledge.

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hilarious.

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I'm at home like, what the fuck is wrong with...

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I made you think our kid died.

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What the fuck guys?

224
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
No!

225
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Rain it in.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
A pie in the face.

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A bucket of water on the door.

228
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Rain it in?

229
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Horses.

230
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You can't just say a horse.

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That was nothing.

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You had to say insert joke here.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Joke to be named later.

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Travis, that was a bad bit because you put those in horse mouths.

235
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Can you...

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How do you like them apples?

237
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No, no, no, no, no.

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oats snap.

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That was way worse than mine.

240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oats snap was better than how you like them apples because there's so many creatures that

241
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
enjoy an apple.

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
All right.

243
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Can we get back to the main question?

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What?

245
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not even doing them now.

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I love your unbridled enthusiasm.

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's pretty good though.

248
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's pretty good.

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I just got in the latest Gallup poll.

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This sucks.

251
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
When Travis does this, by the way, that's what he does to his baby.

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So he thinks all y'all's babies.

253
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay.

254
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I have an idea for a good prank that doesn't...

255
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's not going to hurt your horses.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Thank you.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Stepdad wakes up, throws off the sheets, what's wet in my bed?

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's a severed horse head like in Godfather.

259
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Wait, but Griffin, you said...

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But it's not one of your horses, so it's all...

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So everything's okay.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Everybody wins.

264
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Everybody wins.

265
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It wasn't...

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He'll freak out and then he'll look at the face of the horse and be like, oh, it's not

267
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
one of my horses.

268
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No harm, no foul.

269
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Good one, Rhonda.

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Good one, Rhonda.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You got me.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You got me good.

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Okay, it's time for another question.

274
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I was trying to...

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There's just so few pranks that won't kill a horse.

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

277
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
One time on April Fools, I did the bucket of water on the doorframe thing, but we didn't

278
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
have a bucket.

279
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And so I used a foot bath and I filled that motherfucker up.

280
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And then dad walked into the bathroom and it fell on him.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And it was probably a good 25 pounds of water.

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It didn't turn over, right?

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It didn't turn over.

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It just kind of...

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Pretty good prank though.

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We also...

287
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Got you, dad.

288
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
One of our pranks was we shut off the main power switch to our whole house.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So it turned off all the alarm clocks in our house.

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Got you.

291
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You got fired.

292
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
How about a question?

293
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I work in a small building that is part of a larger facility.

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There are usually only six to eight people that work in that building.

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Often, I'm the only one that uses the women's restroom.

296
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Every day, the custodian comes and cleans the restrooms.

297
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And every day, he replaces the partially used up roll of toilet paper on the holder in

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the women's room with a different partially used up roll.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know what happens in the men's room.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The answer, car stuff.

301
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've always got an engine block in there that I'm working on, tinkering.

302
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Just car stuff.

303
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I thought for a second you said car talk.

304
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Car talk.

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's where they recorded it.

306
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I know it's a different role because the pattern or texture of the paper is different each day.

307
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We're going to circle back.

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't think we've ever finished up a roll in the 10 years I've been in this building.

309
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The custodian rarely speaks, so I can't ask what is going on.

310
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Wait, wait, wait.

311
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Time out.

312
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Can you raise your hand real quick if you're here?

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Wait.

314
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Can you raise it?

315
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Stand up then.

316
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't quite see you.

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Are you way in the back?

318
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Wait, so are you over here?

319
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Thank you.

320
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Just a little bit of balcony.

321
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Are you standing up?

322
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, so you're right there.

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Come on.

325
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm giving you a look.

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Are you waiting for him to broach the subject?

327
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Let me explain my toilet weirdness.

328
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You can turn the house lights out now.

329
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Thank you.

330
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This is overwhelming.

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There's too many people.

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Is there more to the question?

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Custodian rarely speaks, so I can't ask what is going on.

334
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why is this happening?

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's from Perplexed Paper Partaker.

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's such a nice button to that question.

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It has nothing to do with the rest of the question.

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Why is it happening?

339
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Well, sometimes life finds a way.

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Sometimes when God closes a door, he introduces a bathroom mystery.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So here's the main thing I want to talk about.

342
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The first issue that I have with this question, besides the fact that you definitely can't talk to people that don't talk a lot, right?

343
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We're good on that.

344
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's actually the people you should talk to.

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They have the best stories, like why they're introducing bathroom mysteries into your life on a daily basis.

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The people that talk a lot give you everything.

347
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The people who don't talk?

348
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Justin is taking the mic out of his hand.

349
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I just came up with this saying still waters run deep when you think about that.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No, here's the problem I have with it.

351
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What are you doing?

352
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Where are you going?

353
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm just feeling the stage.

354
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay, so here's my issue.

355
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Stop, stop, stop.

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
This is not a big bit.

357
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I just wanted to stand up for it.

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay, so you say the toilet paper has different patterns.

359
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Act it out, act it out.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Every day.

361
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Thank you, Travis.

362
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It has different patterns every day.

363
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's not how toilet paper works.

364
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I've never maintained a big facility, but I don't think toilet paper exchange begins with, ah, yes, let's see.

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The 1978 Charmin.

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They made quintuple ply that year.

367
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I think also it comes in a big fucking pack.

368
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There's like 30 of them.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You work in a building.

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't understand.

371
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
This custodian is Robin Hood-ing it, stealing from the sit-go to give to the, your office.

372
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like the first day he showed up, they were like, well, that's everything.

373
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And, well, there's supposed to be a page in the back here about how to order more toilet paper.

374
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Well, you know what?

375
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

376
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And he didn't.

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
He just didn't.

378
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I think, okay, so first of all, you're the only person who uses this bathroom.

379
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
First of all, well done.

380
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's the dream.

381
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Never quit.

382
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You're the only human being who's used that bathroom in 10 years.

383
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's legally yours.

384
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's yours.

385
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You could definitely live there.

386
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Literal squatters rights.

387
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If you're the only person that uses that bathroom, wouldn't it be kind of weird if a person came in every day?

388
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And could look at how much toilet paper you had, you and you alone had used that day?

389
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Hmm. Rough day.

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh no.

391
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Like that.

392
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay.

393
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But think about this for a second.

394
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Really?

395
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If they were switching it out when the role was exhausted, they would have fucking a decade's worth of data about how much you shit.

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Fucking custodian Nate Silver just like, oh, went through one in four days. What's going on?

397
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yikes.

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Back off on the brunes.

399
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:21,000
My fucking toilet life is such garbo that it took me a second to think about what would be a normal amount of time to go through a whole roll of toilet paper.

400
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And when I say normal, I mean people normal.

401
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Not Griffin or me.

402
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How about another Yahoo?

403
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah.

404
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Okay, but can I say actually, please ask him and email us.

405
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Please just ask.

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If it's the one about him not wanting to know how much you use the potty, I will just be eternally delighted.

407
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What if he's so excited and he's just been building a conversation starter for 10 years like, they'll notice.

408
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They have to notice now.

409
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Certainly it's been 10 years they've noticed.

410
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He's been building like a TP fort.

411
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh, thank you for asking.

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Come in.

413
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Look at this stuff.

414
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Isn't it neat?

415
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Hold on.

416
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
No, that sucks.

417
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's my Pato Prato.

418
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It sucks that I have personified this custodian as a toilet paper collector.

419
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's no good.

420
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Actually, as a toilet mermaid is what you drive.

421
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's okay, Griffin, he'll never hear it because he doesn't talk much.

422
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
How about another Yahoo?

423
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, this one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

424
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Seth, you're here, right?

425
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
In that sort of zone, in that region.

427
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Thank you, Seth.

428
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You are killing it.

429
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Blurry301 who asks, so in the emoji-

430
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Wait, why did someone clap?

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Are you Blurry301?

432
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So, in the emoji movie, can other emojis have sex and have kids?

433
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Got to do this one.

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Y'all answer this.

435
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, they sure can.

436
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Because two meh emojis had a son and they probably fucked.

437
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Real quick, I just Googled the emoji movie Dreamworks just to make sure we weren't burning

438
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
the Trolls 2 bridge.

439
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It was just made by Steven's movies.

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,000
By that logic, Justin, every character in every animated movie was the result of sex.

441
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
No, please don't link them.

442
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Fucking Lightning McQueen, you seem like, oh yeah, driving real fast.

443
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Someone had to do it to make him, probably.

444
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
No, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

445
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Did you see Lightning McQueen's parents?

446
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I've never seen a car, but I assume no.

447
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Really, it's really good.

448
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Wait, does anybody know?

449
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
No, you don't see Lightning McQueen's parents.

450
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Wait, Travis, I'm trying to IMDB this.

451
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No, we heard a firm no.

452
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Somebody was very confident.

453
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No!

454
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So that's what I'm saying.

455
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
If you don't see their parents, they could just be a creation of God from mud and ribs.

456
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And then he breathed life into them.

457
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Car God.

458
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Lightning McQueen cannot have ribs.

459
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What?

460
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
This car cannot have ribs and bones.

461
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Griffin, hold on.

462
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Have you ever built a car?

463
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I have not.

464
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So for all you know.

465
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why are these movies so chicken shit?

466
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Show me the inside out emotions parents making love before I meet the characters.

467
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And there'd be a little horny emotion and they'd be like, yeah.

468
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
We have talked a lot about horniness.

469
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We're in the horny capital of America, baby.

470
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The Washington Monument is basically a boner.

471
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Finally, someone makes that observation.

472
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So here's the thing.

473
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You saw his parents and they were both men emojis.

474
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And then he was a man emoji also, which also makes you think that the emojis can die.

475
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Which seems weird too.

476
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because if they can fuck, they can die too.

477
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So what I'm saying is that we all try hard enough.

478
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We can kill the characters in the emoji movie apparently.

479
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because we know they're mortal because they fuck.

480
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
When Justin, when you do you think is emoji death when you use it?

481
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What do you mean?

482
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Like in the movie, is it like they're all afraid of getting tapped?

483
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
They're all afraid of.

484
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, that's sex.

485
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They're all afraid of being used.

486
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, they probably covered this in the film.

487
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Travis, I don't want to recount the plot of the emoji.

488
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
My question is when you were watching the emoji movie and there was Patrick Stewart and he was a little turd.

489
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And everybody else in the theater was delighted.

490
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Were you looking thinking that Patrick Stewart turd is going to die one day?

491
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That Patrick Stewart turd was the result of sex and is also going to die one day.

492
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
His son's in the movie and he's voiced by Patrick Stewart, which is sad also.

493
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Just because Patrick Stewart shouldn't be doing things like that.

494
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He knows better twice.

495
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He voices his own son?

496
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
No, I'm sorry.

497
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I phrased that poorly.

498
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That would be really cool, though.

499
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You're right.

500
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It would be a great movie.

501
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It would have been the one fine artistic choice they had made.

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, why would they need to give the, it's still the shit emoji.

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Why does it need a better voice?

504
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Like it should be the same voice.

505
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Wait, that would indicate that they are reproducing.

506
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Like if they don't have discrete genetic material.

507
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
All these characters are fucking Justin.

508
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We've covered it.

509
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
There's a movie called Storks, which I watched some of because it was on and Henry was watching it.

510
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And then I kind of watched it a little bit more.

511
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He walked in and Henry was like, check it out, dads.

512
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I finally figured it out.

513
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's birds or whatever.

514
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
In that one, they get letters.

515
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
They're like, I want a baby.

516
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And they put it in a machine and then a baby comes out.

517
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I am now recounting the plot of Storks.

518
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
My life is taking a strange turn.

519
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I saw that and I thought, bullshit.

520
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
There's some kids watching this and they're like, ha ha, you used to be a letter.

521
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And it's like, nuh uh.

522
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Their parents fucked.

523
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You need to learn about this stuff someday.

524
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It could be both.

525
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
This live show is taking a really fucking weird turn.

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay, but in the plot of Boss Baby.

527
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Be cool, everyone.

528
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Be cool, everybody.

529
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
They divide babies into babies that would be good at business in heaven.

530
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Sorry, it's in heaven.

531
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
They divide babies that would be good at business and babies that deserve families.

532
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
My applause, if you've seen this fucking movie, please cheer if I'm telling the truth.

533
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Thank you.

534
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
This is some fucked up The Giver shit.

535
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, babies that are good at business and babies that deserve families.

536
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Which on a certain level, I get it.

537
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because to be fair, people who are good at business, they don't deserve families.

538
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Do you ever see a baby doing business and also with a family

539
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and you just think, how do they do it?

540
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
They have it all.

541
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
They have it all.

542
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
God, we just talked about the emoji movie for 10 minutes.

543
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No.

544
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Boop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop.

545
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Whoa.

546
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's coming in hot.

547
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Hold on, there's a hot one coming in.

548
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's coming in hot direct to me where I took a screenshot.

549
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Hold on.

550
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Boop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop.

551
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Looking at Justin's pictures.

552
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No, you're looking at this picture.

553
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's a haunted doll watch.

554
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This has come in hot.

555
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Go back.

556
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
What?

557
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Sorry.

558
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You just want to enjoy it one more time.

559
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This is not good audio.

560
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So we'll just be quick about this part.

561
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
This is the haunted doll we're talking about today.

562
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It is Nativius.

563
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Okay.

564
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Nice non-haunted name to start out with.

565
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Nativius?

566
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Nativius.

567
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So this is from a paranormal investigation group that photographs private homes.

568
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Hopefully with consent.

569
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Come on in.

570
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Police.

571
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Photograph all my stuff.

572
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Stranger.

573
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Just let me know if anything's weird or whatever.

574
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So here's the Nativius story.

575
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Spiritual possession.

576
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Every Christmas I love going to church and hearing the Nativius story.

577
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Of the spooky baby Jesus.

578
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Woo!

579
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So Nativius' original whereabouts are a mystery to Carla.

580
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Now I've heard some pretty good opening lines to novels before.

581
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's a very good opener.

582
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
All she knows is that one day she came home from work and there in her fenced-in backyard was this doll.

583
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Well that sucks.

584
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Nice.

585
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No, cool.

586
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Free doll.

587
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Free ghost.

588
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Also I love that there could be no other explanation.

589
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah, that's it.

590
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah, somebody threw it over your fucking fence.

591
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I borrowed that one.

592
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Because it was haunted.

593
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
She was lying on the grass under the birdbath.

594
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Carla was baffled as to how this doll even got into her locked eight-foot tall fence.

595
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So suck an egg.

596
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Nobody can throw a doll eight feet.

597
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It was a bird.

598
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Totes.

599
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It was Aaron Rodgers.

600
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Green Bay Packers Quarter.

601
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I was the only one.

602
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I gotta get rid of this fucking doll.

603
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
She checked with all her neighbors but no one knew anything about the doll.

604
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Now fucking hold the phone.

605
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You're telling me that somewhere on earth someone got to have the delight of,

606
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Hello, my name is Carla.

607
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Did you drop this doll?

608
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I believe it has paranormal proximity.

609
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
She was really intrigued with this doll.

610
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
She wasn't a collector of such items, but if you're a collector of haunted items and you find another haunted item,

611
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I do not trust you very much.

612
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Who isn't a collector of them and sees a doll and goes, ghost doll?

613
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, cool ghost doll.

614
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I've never had experience with this before, but why wouldn't I assume?

615
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
She felt this strong pull of energy almost freezing her in place for a moment.

616
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Carla immediately knew this was something bigger than she had ever experienced.

617
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Justin, can I say my favorite word in that whole thing?

618
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Ejaculation.

619
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
No.

620
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Almost?

621
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Almost.

622
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Almost freezing her in place, but it didn't.

623
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But it didn't.

624
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But I could have sworn for a second, I almost could have been frozen.

625
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Freezing was on the table.

626
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It was an option I could have taken.

627
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Carla called her friends at night and told them what she found.

628
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Most of her friends laughed off the whole spooky doll thing.

629
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But Carla's one friend Mia said, I'll be over tomorrow and we'll try to speak with her.

630
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This is the fucking mumble core of haunted doll stories.

631
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I do like, and maybe this is just miswording, but Carla's one friend Mia.

632
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah, Carla's one friend Mia.

633
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
One real friend.

634
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
One real friend.

635
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If you can't like Carla at her worst, you don't deserve her when she calls you to say,

636
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
hey, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw a doll over my eight foot fence,

637
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
will you come check this shit out with me?

638
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I love this running theme of, can you imagine if you're one of her other friends who gets

639
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
the call like, hey, this is going to seem random, but I've got a haunted doll.

640
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What?

641
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I only hear from you when you have haunted dolls.

642
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You never ask about Jeffrey.

643
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So Carla heard a loud noise.

644
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
She found nothing out of place.

645
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's not a story.

646
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's a bad story, yes.

647
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's not a story really.

648
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I thought something happened, but it didn't anyway.

649
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I swear to God, the next evening Carla's friend Mia came over.

650
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This is the only haunted doll story I've ever read that had fucking time lapses.

651
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So anyway, nothing happened for a little bit.

652
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That has a B plot.

653
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And also Mia was going through some shit.

654
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And then Mia's boyfriend was like, the baby's not mine.

655
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Carla had already told her what happened last night.

656
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Mia was ready to question this doll.

657
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
She had to really psych herself up.

658
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
They set up an old, small VHS video recorder for reasons that are just beyond me.

659
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Because it's 1988.

660
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
They turned the lights off and lit a bunch of candles.

661
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
They sat at the kitchen table with the doll in the middle of the table.

662
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They began to ask all sorts of questions, but nothing was happening.

663
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I wish there was a period there and that was the end of the listing.

664
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So anyway, give me $40 for this.

665
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
All of a sudden, Mia jumped out of her chair and yelled, ouch.

666
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Mia pulled her shirt away from her shoulder.

667
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And there on her shoulder blade was three fresh scratch markings that made the skin red and raised.

668
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
All right, listen.

669
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We were all making a lot of jokes, but then this shit got real.

670
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Did she die?

671
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What if the next sentence was, and then my friend, my only friend Mia did die.

672
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Well, to be fair, this is all written in second person.

673
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And then Carla's friend Mia died.

674
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Hang in there. It's about to take a quick turn.

675
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We heard, okay, we started to watch the video the women had made.

676
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So this is like switched person now.

677
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
What the fuck is fourth person?

678
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It was two hours and 52 minutes long.

679
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Okay.

680
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Hold on.

681
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It was directed by Peter Jackson.

682
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

683
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're watching this video with your friends.

684
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
At what point in the two hours and 52 minutes where you're like, we should do something else.

685
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Can we please do anything else?

686
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Whose idea was this?

687
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Whose idea was this?

688
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So at some point in the video, a little over an hour, whoosh.

689
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You made it that far.

690
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oofa doofa.

691
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We heard a woman's voice.

692
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It was raspy with a touch of Southern accent in it.

693
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Nice.

694
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well, hey, y'all.

695
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Like the lady who used to narrate Great Chefs of the East.

696
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What?

697
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Did she say that?

698
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
What?

699
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
No, that was me editorializing.

700
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
When they asked her name to these voices or whatever, the word Navidius was spoken and

701
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the woman started using her name, Navidius, to ask questions and then they received more

702
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
responses.

703
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
We heard the year 1892 spoken when they asked what year she was born.

704
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
She would never give a year to the death, but she did use the word noose when asked

705
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
how she died.

706
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Damn.

707
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Can I just say, how do you say the name was Navidius and like late 1800s is where you

708
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
think Navidius came from.

709
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Navidius is absolutely, this is the end of the listing.

710
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
There's a lot more.

711
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm giving you the abridged.

712
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Fuck.

713
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Navidius is absolutely not a doll for the beginner.

714
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Although we do not feel as though Navidius is harmful, we do feel that she has negative

715
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
energy about her and this should be taken into serious consideration before bidding

716
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
on her doll stand not included.

717
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So that's your haunted doll watch.

718
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
How can you say?

719
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I got a Samsung 55 inch.

720
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm trying to upgrade, get the 4k television.

721
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Also, it scratched my friend real bad on the shoulder.

722
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No negative energy though.

723
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It scratched the fuck out of my friend, but do get this TV.

724
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's fucked up one way or the other because you're either saying it scratched my friend,

725
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
but we haven't got any proof or we haven't got any proof, but I think she's terrible.

726
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Like she hasn't done anything.

727
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's cool.

728
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's fine.

729
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Hi folks, Travis here.

730
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I sure hope you're enjoying this live show episode.

731
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
We had so much fun recording it.

732
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You may find yourself wondering why are we putting up the DC episode when we recorded

733
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
the New York show first?

734
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
We're saving that just for a little bit.

735
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It will go up.

736
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We didn't lose it.

737
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There were no problems with the audio or anything like that.

738
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
But you're going to get the DC show first.

739
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And if you came out to the shows or even if you weren't able to make it, just want to

740
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
say Brooklyn, DC and Boston were all so amazing.

741
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Thank you all so much for having us and coming out and supporting the show.

742
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Looking forward to all our future tours.

743
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But I do want to take a second here to tell you about some of our sponsors this week.

744
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
First, we're sponsored by my brother, my brother and me, favorite and friend, NatureBox.

745
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I took NatureBox with me both on my vacation and on my tour.

746
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I enjoyed those snacks wherever I went because right now NatureBox has over a hundred snacks

747
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
that taste good and are actually better for you.

748
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And they're not lying.

749
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
These snacks are delicious.

750
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
No matter what kind of snack you like, if you like salty, they got salty.

751
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
If you like sweet, they got sweet.

752
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And in fact, you can actually get additional things too for just a little bit of an extra

753
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
charge.

754
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I got some beef jerky, some meat protein bars that were really good.

755
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I just had these mini crispy snickerdoodles that were amazing.

756
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And of course, my favorite, the Asiago cheese crisps.

757
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000

We're also sponsored this week by Blue Apron, another personal favorite and show favorite

763
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
of ours.

764
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I use Blue Apron all the time.

765
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000

767

768
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Coming up are summer glazed vegetable and egg paninis with Calabrian chili mayonnaise

769
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and Caprese salad, soy glazed pork and rice cakes with bok choy and marinated green beans.

770

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
This message is for Darla and Stefan and it's from Dory Jo.

799
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Dear Darla and Stefan, happy anniversary.

800
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I couldn't think of a better way to appreciate you both than to have it said by our favorite

801
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
three wise men.

802
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Well, hopefully I'm the favorite because it's just me.

803
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Thank you for introducing me to this fountain of truth, also known as MBMB.

804
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Fountain of truth?

805
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That's really good.

806
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Very clever.

807
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Congratulations on four years of successfully married life.

808
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Here's to many more.

809
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I love you.

810
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Your favorite sister, Dory Jo.

811
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That's so sweet.

812
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Hey, congratulations to you Dory Jo on being a great sister.

813
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I also have another message here.

814
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
This is for Evan and it's from your middle sister Emma and your sweet baby brother Will.

815
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Happy birthday, Ev.

816
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
We love you so much.

817
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
We wanted the Mackle boys, well, once again, just me, to acknowledge your birthday.

818
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
After all, it's your fault.

819
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
We love them so much.

820
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Here's to 26 more years of being the world's best sister and the oldest member of the world's

821
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
second best threesome of siblings.

822
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So thank you everybody.

823
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We're going to get back into the show now.

824
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I hope you're enjoying it and I hope you continue to.

825
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Hi there.

826
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm comedian and movie buff Ricky Carmona and I'm excited to tell you about a new show

827
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm doing called Who Shot Ya?

828
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Join me, LA Weekly film critic April Wolf.

829
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm going to call Star Wars when it comes out the Clint Howard project.

830
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Film reviews editor for The Wrap, Alonzo Duraly.

831
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Everything Charlize Theron knows about killing somebody with a high heeled shoe she learned

832
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
from single white female.

833
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And our dope ass friends each week.

834
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I think we need to end this pernicious belief in our society that there is anything remotely

835
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
f***able about rich dudes who are emotionally unbearable.

836
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So if you're tired of wack opinions and you're looking for a smart, funny film discussion

837
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
show, check out Who Shot Ya, son.

838
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That's what we do.

839
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And you can find us at MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

840
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
What do you want to do?

841
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah, it's audience questions.

842
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Let's do some audience questions.

843
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Let's do some audience questions.

844
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Let's do a lot.

845
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
All right.

846
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We'll call.

847
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
House lights.

848
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We will call on some folks if we can get some house lights so we can see any of them.

849
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I see like four hands, but.

850
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
All right.

851
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Let's start on the right side.

852
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I see somebody holding a hat up.

853
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000

Do people ever just say like, surprise me?

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,380
Can I ask you a question that you'll probably have like a dope answer for?

922
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:14,380

called we're sold out of lumber I was thinking oh are you gonna answer I have

924
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,700
thought about this a lot I was thinking like what's the song roll them out put

932
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:23,340
second biggest movie rental night after that's a bummer guess it gets worse

933

940
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:19,100
where I thought which one of us sucks more I was judging her and I was wearing

941
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:25,180
like khakis at midnight and a tucked-in blue button-down like fuck me for real

00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:10,420
LA because literally every other building had a green like medical cross

997
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:16,380
on it and that green medical cross basically means yes sure because you

998
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,420
would walk in and you would literally go well sometimes I have trouble falling

999
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:25,740

give you a safety pop and then hook you up with the green stuff he said he

1006
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:02,540

1028
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,300

1030
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:28,840

1031
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:36,980
that every time yeah okay yeah he loves it okay so my question is do you guys

1032
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:44,580
have any tips on how we might do a long-distance meet the parents he would

1033
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:49,380
be meeting my mom this is the most nice they're not you're not meeting each

1034
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:58,420
other okay okay do you have you charted the exact geographic midpoint between

1035
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,820
the two if you make a hole with a gun perpendicular through the name of your

1036
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:09,620
town and the desktop globe where's the exit wound is it about okay make the

1037
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,260
calculation to find the exact meeting point because that's one option is you

1038
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,900
just drive to like the nearest rest stop yeah otherwise this is the like most

1039
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:23,300
high-stakes teleconference and it'll fail like oh yeah yeah have you met sky

01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:35,940
be meeting my mom okay great he has to come to your mom yeah yeah there is not

1042
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:42,380

1044
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:50,700
