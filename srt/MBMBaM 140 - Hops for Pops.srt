1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,280
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era,

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,120
and welcome to this very cash exploratory meeting of the Papal Council. Let's not make a big deal

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,920
out of it. It's a new era, you know what I mean? It's a Sunday brunch meeting. Put that magic

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,840
firewood away that makes the signal smoke come out. It's actually the same dust they used in

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,040
Are You Afraid of the Dark. Exactly. Put away your midnight society dust, pick up that mimosa,

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,280
and let's just freewheel and chat about it. I'm Justin McElroy. I'm the oldest brother and sort

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,880
of the senior member of this advisory council. Is that fair? And I'm Travis McElroy, your middlest

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,760
brother, and I just ordered us a round of Virgin Bloody Marys. Oh, that sounds great. I'm the baby

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:44,400
brother, Griffin McElroy, and let's get rolling with this Papal Smear. Yeah, I'm just gonna start.

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,920
I feel like we should just throw some names out there, spitball it, and sort of see where we're

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,600
at. Okay, let me just kick it off super cash meat. Okay. Let me just get that name out there.

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,120
Feel like it's kind of top of mind right now, and we're all sort of dancing around it. I figure,

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,680
let me just throw those bones right out there. Yeah, I appreciate. Just cut through the

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,280
through the chaff, through the hubbub. I think we can all agree there, Justin, because of the

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,080
massive amounts of skeletons in your closet, you are probably not a good choice. Yes,

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,080
literally and figuratively. Sorry, boys. I don't understand. What I'm saying is,

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,800
if you look at my closet, they're all reading Mad magazines and have licorice wrappers surrounding

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:41,200
them, okay? It's a weird closet. So, man, I'm bummed out already. Justin, I don't think that

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,440
you... I don't know that you have what it takes. Justin, advise me. I feel like we're whiteboarding

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,640
right now, and I feel like that name is kind of on the whiteboard. Okay. You try to wipe it off,

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,400
and it's like, who did this permanent mark on my whiteboard? I'll put it on there when a teacher

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
gets a really shitty answer from a student in the class, he doesn't want to embarrass him.

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:11,280
He's like, oh, yeah, sure, triangles. Okay, does anybody else have any favorite actors

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,120
from the 1930s? I'm going to vote Morgan Freeman. Okay, I like that. I feel like he's in a lot of

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,560
stuff. People trust him. He's got that powerful voice. Okay, Travis also bases all of his

30
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,520
religious philosophies around the movie Bruce Almighty and its follow-up sequel.

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm glad you said that, because my second choice is Jim Carrey. All right. He's not

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,240
working so much lately. He probably has some free time, and I think he would make a hilarious

33
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:51,280
rubber-faced pope. Okay. Is there a chance of a black pope this year? I feel like black pope,

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,400
black president... What about checks and balances? Has anybody stopped to think about checks and

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,960
balances? Why would there need to be a check or balance against the racial composition?

36
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm just saying checks and balances, because the only thing stopping the pope is the president.

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,560
Everyone knows that. If we have black pope and black president, I love that I'm in that era.

38
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,760
I'm loving that I'm in that period of history. You do have to wonder, who's looking out for the

39
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,280
white guy? Yeah, because that's what I'm always worried about, is that pretty soon the white man

40
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,200
is going to fall by the wayside. Yeah, what about the white man? Who's looking out for my wants,

41
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,200
my needs? Who's representing my beliefs? We'll have to establish a new Southern Baptist pope,

42
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,840
a new papacy cabinet altogether, but for the Southern Baptist Church, and I think the leader

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,960
of that would be Guy Fieri. Can we put any more irony in our voices so that people know that this

44
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,760
is not a real thing that we feel? No, I don't really care who the pope is. Yeah, me neither.

45
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,080
It was exciting when the pope died last time though. I'm kind of sad that we're not going to

46
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,360
get... Remember, I was on Pope Watch because I remember I was waiting for the pope to die,

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,840
and I was waiting on Terry Shiloh to die. Oh, no. So I was like, who's going to win?

48
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,880
And then they went at the same time, like at the end of Notebook. Yeah.

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,760
I haven't seen that one. Much like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams,

50
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,040
they went within moments of each other cursing the other one's name.

51
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah, which put her right out of the running. So this is our papal, sort of a papal advocacy show,

52
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,120
my brother, my brother, me. Let's get to some other questions, and maybe we can just circle

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,440
around back to this question when you guys have any other good suggestions. I kind of feel like

54
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,360
everybody keeps coming back around to me, but we'll have to see if that sticks by the end of the app.

55
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm a teacher in training, and in less than a year, I'll be

56
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,920
student teaching in a junior high or high school. Though I'm more than a quarter century old,

57
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,840
I've already been told by various students, friends, bartenders that I look 15.

58
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,000
Now my dentist is telling me that I have to get braces, which will only make things worse.

59
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,360
I need some tips on looking older, so my colleagues won't be asking me for a hall pass

60
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
on them all the way to the teacher's lounge, and my students won't be inviting me to come

61
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,560
play Skyrim with them after school. Can you advise? That's from belatedly brace-faced.

62
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Start smoking.

63
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,480
No, okay.

64
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
It makes you look cool and old.

65
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,000
That could stunt his growth, though.

66
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,160
Yeah, and nobody looks good when they're smoking and they have braces.

67
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,560
It can't smoke out.

68
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,680
What if you smoke in a pipe?

69
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:41,280
Can I ask you, so right now, just so I'm clear, it sounds pretty good, though.

70
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,400
Yeah, there's nothing bad about this situation you've just outlined,

71
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,160
because you could be the only human being in the universe to ever live out that thing that happens

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,120
in movies where they see the, it's the catch me if you can situation, where the kids pick on the

73
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,600
person they think is a kid, and then they walk to the front of the class and say,

74
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,600
what's up? I'm your teacher, Dr. Youngface. And then they feel so stymied. They feel so embarrassed,

75
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,440
and maybe he gives them a hard time.

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,600
You're also got to consider undercover work. That's really important.

77
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,040
See, you went catch me if you can. I went never been kissed.

78
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
I've never seen never been kissed, but I assume it's some deep undercover shit.

79
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah. Now, on the negative side, you will not be able to eat Tostitos.

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Tostitos, out of the question. Taffy, out of the question. I'm surprised that this is the first

81
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,440
braces related question that we've gotten, because I feel like I could really bust out some,

82
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,080
I lost so many brackets. I ate one once, because I got enthusiastic about some Taffy.

83
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,400
I broke a tooth last weekend. I was eating a protein bar, believe it was from Kashi.

84
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,520
I was eating it, and I literally had this thought,

85
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,040
I literally had this thought, what is in this? It tastes like teeth.

86
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah. And then it turned out that it was, in fact, I was eating my teeth, my tooth.

87
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,440
So instead of braces, you should get yourself dentures.

88
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Why do you have to get braces? Nobody has to get braces.

89
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,560
I had to. It was literally life. My teeth were growing into my fucking brain.

90
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,520
It was life threatening in my case. I did have to get braces.

91
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,160
My grill does not come correct, and I don't really care. I'm living with it.

92
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,600
But your grill doesn't look like a fucking sarlacc pit,

93
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,560
which is basically what I was working with in middle school.

94
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,680
I'm saying some people need it. I'm saying it's going to be rough for you vis-a-vis Skittles,

95
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,080
but I am saying that I think this 21 Jump Street opportunity,

96
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
if you let it slide by, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.

97
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll also say this, because I have lots of friends that look much younger than they are,

98
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,280
and right now that sucks, but when you're 60 and you look like you're 42,

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
it's going to be a blessing.

100
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
Because then you'll be able to hook up with all the 42 year olds you want.

101
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Any other advantages to being one of the students?

102
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,680
You could blow off class sometimes, by which I mean don't teach it,

103
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,560
just sit in a chair and wait for the real teacher to show up,

104
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,920
and then halfway through, oh my god, okay, okay.

105
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,280
So first day of class, you go in, you grab a chair, you don't address,

106
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,000
and then you're like, after a couple minutes, where is this teacher going, man?

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,240
It's like he had this whole class planned, and we had 50 minutes,

108
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,320
and we've already waited eight minutes, so even if he showed up now,

109
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
and one of the other students would be like, yeah, 42 minutes left,

110
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,120
and then you stand up and you're like, that's your first lesson.

111
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Welcome to high school subtraction.

112
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,880
Welcome to high school subtraction 101 with me, Professor Youngface.

113
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
You are all clearly remedial.

114
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
Welcome to remedial subtraction.

115
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,360
Listen, I got addition, damn, no problem.

116
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
Subtraction though, it's like, where are they going?

117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,960
And that's when you have like a captain by captain moment,

118
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,920
and say like, just add negative numbers, and they're like,

119
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
I understand subtraction, and then they can become cashier.

120
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,280
Oh man, do you think that new teachers, whenever like a new teacher

121
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,440
starts like their first day at his school,

122
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,880
they try to like break the world record for desk standing students?

123
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,960
Like, I bet I can do this shit.

124
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,200
I bet I can do this shit by third period.

125
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,840
These kids are gonna be on their desks swearing blood oaths to me.

126
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,240
They probably keep a pretty close eye on that sort of thing

127
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,520
in the administration now.

128
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Do you think that after that movie came out though,

129
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,520
that they had to start like purchasing desks based on their standability?

130
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,360
Because you don't want to have like shoddy, like unbalanced desks,

131
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,640
and it's like, oh, okay.

132
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,080
Oh fuck, Captain Mike, fuck.

133
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,960
I mean, he's just holding on to the ceiling fan spinning around.

134
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,440
That scene ended with one of the kids standing on his desk,

135
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
and the desk just falling to splinters.

136
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
It would be the best scene ever.

137
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,520
Oh, Captain, whoa.

138
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,840
I always thought, cuss of the janitor going,

139
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,720
I was going to tighten the seats tomorrow, damn it.

140
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,040
I always thought that movie, it's a great movie,

141
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
but it desperately needed more nut shots.

142
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,400
It's got Robin Williams in it.

143
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,680
I expect a certain level of nut shots from a Robin Williams film.

144
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
As one of the students like started to fall,

145
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
he grabbed the guy next to him and grabbed the guy next to him.

146
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,840
Pretty soon it just like dominoed around the room

147
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,080
until they were all in one big nut shot pile.

148
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,560
As Robin Williams just smacked his forehead and said,

149
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
let's get back to subtraction.

150
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,960
Patch Adams fucking ruined me for several reasons,

151
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,320
but it ruined my Robin Williams.

152
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,520
So did the movie.

153
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,600
It ruined my Robin Williams expectation gains,

154
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
because then you would have to go back to the movie

155
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Robin Williams expectation gains, because then you watch that,

156
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
you watch that, what dreams may come.

157
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
And it's like, I don't understand why these people aren't being,

158
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
you know, hitting the balls with a giant clown shoe.

159
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
I think that this person needs to also understand

160
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,800
that they have the possibility of being the student teacher

161
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
that somebody has a crush on in high school.

162
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,280
And I'm not saying that's something that you need to pursue,

163
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,600
but that's a very formative experience for them.

164
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
Some would say the most formative experience.

165
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
And I think that you could be that for somebody.

166
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
To serve with love.

167
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Mm-hmm.

168
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,400
Griffin, do you have a question for us?

169
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,640
Sure.

170
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,000
From the Yahoo Answers service.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,360
I have one pruned from the Yahoo Answers service

172
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,120
by Nick Robinson, curator, curer of this.

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,480
Thank you, Nick.

174
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rob, who asks,

175
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,520
how do I find out if Subway is paying my girlfriend

176
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,200
to advertise their products to me?

177
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,280
I think Subway might secretly be paying my girlfriend

178
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,720
to advertise their products to me

179
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
to try to get me to become a customer.

180
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,040
I need to find out if this is happening or how to stop it.

181
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,520
This is that new wave advertising I've been hearing about.

182
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,160
This is like, what's the level below gorilla?

183
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,040
That's what this is.

184
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,560
This is rough.

185
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,600
This is rough stuff.

186
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
It's rough on a few levels.

187
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
One, because this person obviously has some sort of...

188
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,400
Sure.

189
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,720
Ish.

190
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,680
But also-

191
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,640
Can't deal with that, though.

192
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,680
Well, okay.

193
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,200
You can't assume that, Griffin.

194
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,760
I can pretty say, I mean, the evidence,

195
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,200
it's, I guess it's all circumstantial, but-

196
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
They pay Jared to advertise.

197
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,280
Why wouldn't they pay his girlfriend?

198
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,800
Are you dating Jared?

199
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,560
They pay Michael Phelps to wave his giant arms and advertise it.

200
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,520
Why wouldn't they pay his girlfriend, Michael Phelps?

201
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,520
What is this woman doing that has turned Rob's suspicion

202
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,720
to high alert, is what I want to know.

203
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
What are those convos like?

204
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,520
Because if it's just like, they're driving down the street,

205
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,800
she's like, what should we get for lunch?

206
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
I vote for Subway.

207
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
And she does that every day.

208
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
Maybe she just really, really likes Subway

209
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,240
and their large selection of cheap, large, and delicious sandwiches.

210
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,680
Or maybe it's like when he gets into a fight with his parents

211
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
and he's just like, I never get my own way.

212
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,160
And she says, do you know where you can have everything your own way?

213
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,280
At Subway.

214
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,440
They'll make sandwiches just for you, John.

215
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,640
$5 footlongs, hashtag February.

216
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,560
Did you just fucking say hashtag?

217
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,400
Are you a sandwich robot?

218
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,680
I certainly am not.

219
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,000
But let me tell you more about the delicious toppings.

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
Robots couldn't make sandwiches

221
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
like the Subway artists at Subway make sandwiches.

222
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,960
It takes an artist's touch and finesse

223
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,560
to put together a sandwich like this.

224
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
And $5 for 12 inches?

225
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,400
Can't beat that, hashtag Jared value.

226
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,040
Listen, honey, I understand that Subway's great.

227
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Could you wait till we're done having sex

228
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
to tell me about their sandwiches, please?

229
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
I love the way you're having sex with me.

230
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
It reminds me of speaking of footlongs.

231
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
I love the way you're having sex with me.

232
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
If you want to feel satisfied, check out the latest deals at Subway.

233
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
$5 for a footlong, you won't leave empty either.

234
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,640
Speaking of double meat, let's...

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Sorry about your sister.

236
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,480
Sorry about your sister.

237
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,640
Hey, what's your favorite bread type?

238
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,880
Mine's Parmesan rosemary Italian.

239
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,000
This is the worst eulogy I've ever heard.

240
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,880
I maybe just start asking how she likes certain sandwich components.

241
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,200
Like do you just keep taking her to Quiznos?

242
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
See if smoke pours out of her ears.

243
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,280
Do you like, how do you, do you like bacon?

244
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,520
Yeah, but I don't like it crispy.

245
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,880
I like it kind of floppy and stacked on a bunch of other bacon.

246
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
I read a report in Le Mans.

247
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,240
That said that bacon is way better when it's floppy and gross

248
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
and it's been touched by several people before you eat it.

249
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,960
Do you like your meat to be like pre-portioned

250
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,120
into those little cardboard bowls?

251
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes, please.

252
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,280
When you make her chicken for dinner, does she turn her nose about and say,

253
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,160
when did you cook this?

254
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,440
Just now?

255
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
What am I supposed to do with this?

256
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
Two wax paper sheets and then kind of smack it onto the bed.

257
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,760
Like it's been misbehaving.

258
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,640
Thank you.

259
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,600
This is great pizza,

260
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,760
but could you put another slice of pizza on top of it

261
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,480
and then just dunk it in water to make it really wet?

262
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,880
Thank you.

263
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,320
I have not had so many pizzas out it's like.

264
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,200
I would like some oil and vinegar on my salad,

265
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,920
but could you look at me disdainfully when I ask for it, please?

266
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,560
Thank you.

267
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
Maybe, but maybe it's deep.

268
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,480
Maybe it goes deeper.

269
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
Maybe she's getting paychecks.

270
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,000
Maybe she has a source of income that he does not understand.

271
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,520
Maybe it's an inscrutable Subway advertising paycheck.

272
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,880
Maybe she's on the street team.

273
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,320
Maybe she disappears.

274
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,760
Now street team I believe.

275
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

276
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,680
Street team I'd buy.

277
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,720
I also want to say, listen, believe me, in this world,

278
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
you would be amazed at the different job opportunities that exist.

279
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,760
Do you know that when you listen to the radio

280
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,480
and people call in to like answer their crazy questions

281
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
about the fight they had with their boyfriend

282
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,880
or the time that they caught their sister doing something,

283
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,600
those are all like paid people to do that.

284
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,480
That's not real.

285
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,760
That's not true, Travis.

286
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,560
It is true.

287
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,960
My friend Kelly was paid to be one of those people.

288
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,720
That's a real thing.

289
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,440
Not every time, but sometimes just to kind of get the ball rolling

290
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,040
and to get people to start answering.

291
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,240
You only have to make one friend on Twitter

292
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,760
that turns out to be a robot designed to sell you Subway sandwiches

293
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,320
to then have that veil of suspicion built between you and your every loved one.

294
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,840
Yes.

295
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,640
So what I'm saying is maybe, maybe, maybe there is a company,

296
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
not necessarily Subway specific.

297
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
We kind of, they cover a bunch of different organizations,

298
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
a bunch of different businesses,

299
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,080
and they hire actors and actresses to pose as people's loved ones

300
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
to try to convince them to use the products from that location.

301
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,120
It's not crazy.

302
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,080
It could happen.

303
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm just saying that that's not crazy.

304
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
I want to be there when this campaign, when the Subway campaign ends

305
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,200
because marketing dollars are finite.

306
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,120
You'll have to get them one day when you say,

307
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,720
so where do you want to go?

308
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,880
Subway?

309
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,520
What?

310
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,000
No, actually, fuck Subway.

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I want to go to Texas Steakhouse.

312
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,280
I mean, but what if she is on the longest con with this gentleman?

313
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,600
This Subway shuts down and she's like, listen, Mark, I had a great time,

314
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,840
but we've come to the end of our-

315
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,040
Just ended a divorce.

316
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,360
Yeah.

317
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
It's, listen, you were great.

318
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
You were a great consumer.

319
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,720
Lots of, like a surprising amount of millions of dollars

320
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
you were giving to Subway every year.

321
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
You've also lost a ton of weight just eating Subway every day.

322
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,160
In a weird sort of way, I almost sort of developed feelings for you,

323
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
but not a lot of feelings.

324
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:32,800
And I do want to contact-

325
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,960
We shared a lot of topping preferences.

326
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,560
We liked the same kind of bread.

327
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,280
Let's just, why don't we start over, you know?

328
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,680
Why don't we go get, oh, no, okay, no.

329
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,760
Let's go to Penn Station.

330
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,160
Let's go to Penn Station.

331
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,680
No, maybe that'll be our new thing.

332
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,440
Come on, I'll get you a Pibb extra.

333
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,160
My friend and I just finished our first adventure in home brewing.

334
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,680
The beer turned out great, but here's a problem.

335
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,080
We don't have any idea what to call it.

336
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,040
We could really use some of that McElroy wisdom

337
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,960
to pick out a great name for our brew.

338
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,360
The beer is an Irish stout with notes of dark chocolate.

339
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
If it helps, we could send you a few bottles to try it out.

340
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,560
This is from Brew Wilder in Treetown.

341
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,440
Travis, did you just put this question in here

342
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
so that we can maybe get some free beers?

343
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
Did you think they would just send free beers to PO Box 54,

344
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,760
honey, to West Virginia, 25706?

345
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,260
Perhaps.

346
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
I also want to point out to Brew Wilder

347
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,080
that it is easier for us to name the beer

348
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
if you send the beer first.

349
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,720
It's a lot harder for us to name it

350
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,520
and then be held by you sending it to us afterwards.

351
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,040
I just came up with a name for the beer

352
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,960
that Travis tried to make that one time

353
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
when we lived together in Batavia, Ohio,

354
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
which was bottled in plastic bottles,

355
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
and then I had two sips of,

356
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
and the name of that beer is bubbly soy sauce

357
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,480
because that's what it was.

358
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
I might have no idea what I did wrong,

359
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
but it did not turn out well.

360
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
What we did wrong was that we used tap water

361
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
and we did it in a crock pot

362
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
that I used to make ramen earlier that day,

363
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,640
and then we put it in plastic bottles

364
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
in our refrigerator for about four days.

365
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,160
So what we did, there were a few steps there

366
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,600
where we goofed and slipped,

367
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
maybe a little, maybe a tad.

368
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
Man, that was fucking grody.

369
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,560
Man, that was the worst.

370
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,280
It was grody.

371
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,560
It's the first beer I've ever had

372
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,240
that I could not give away.

373
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
I took it to like three different parties

374
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,520
and I was like,

375
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
and I brought this beer if anyone wants it,

376
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
and they took a look at the unlabeled

377
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,760
brown plastic bottles with the white screw on caps

378
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
that looked like I just dumped out some mug root beer

379
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
and refilled it, and they were like,

380
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,320
nah, we're good.

381
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,840
Couldn't give it away.

382
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,800
Not crazy about that.

383
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,560
I will dip my sushi in it though,

384
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,040
because that seems just perfect.

385
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,840
Because that seems just perfect.

386
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,080
This is a, why do you need a name?

387
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
You know, why do you need branding?

388
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,280
It's just beer.

389
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,880
You just drink it.

390
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,040
You could make it to market to TV shows

391
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,800
that don't want to worry about branding issues

392
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,320
and just call it beer.

393
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,760
Just call it beer.

394
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,040
I see what you're saying.

395
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,920
I see what you're saying.

396
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,840
So like on the real world,

397
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
they cover up the labels with duct tape.

398
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,840
With this, you could just say

399
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
a bottle of refreshing liquid.

400
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,400
You could even be...

401
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,040
Yes.

402
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,280
Yeah.

403
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,760
Do you think the person who has to cover up

404
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,160
the beer labels with duct tape on the real world

405
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,680
describes themselves as being

406
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
in the entertainment industry?

407
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
Oh God, yes.

408
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,520
I'm like-

409
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,640
He works marketing in the entertainment.

410
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
He's the same guy that duct tapes over the emblems

411
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,600
on people's hats on MTV Cribs.

412
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,480
Hold on there.

413
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,120
Okay.

414
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,880
Hold on there, Buckaroo.

415
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
Let me just get that shampoo.

416
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,520
Gotcha.

417
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:39,840
Gotcha.

418
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
Okay, duct taped.

419
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,360
Yeah, I'm in-

420
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,440
I will be in my trailer full of tape.

421
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,760
I am in reverse marketing is what I'm into.

422
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,360
I stunt brands is what I do.

423
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,920
Two years ago, I was dating a girl

424
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,160
that turned out to be paid by Subway

425
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,000
and after having my heart broken,

426
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,680
I swore it off all brand day.

427
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
It seems a strange crusade, I know.

428
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
I do have a long-term plan

429
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
to murder Jared Fogle in three months.

430
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
So I do have that going for me.

431
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,720
That's sort of my whole...

432
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,360
Sort of pretty much my whole motif right now.

433
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,080
Do you think Jared...

434
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,480
Do you think when she broke up with him,

435
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
Jared was like waving outside?

436
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,840
Come on, babe.

437
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,560
In his Subway Jeep?

438
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,720
No, it's on a Subway motorcycle, obviously.

439
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,280
Come on, babe.

440
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,600
Obviously.

441
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,040
With his stupid Garden State sidecar.

442
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,760
He's wearing a helmet made of day-old bread.

443
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,320
Great, now I'm hungry.

444
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,640
Yeah.

445
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,520
I know.

446
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
So, names for beer.

447
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,600
Names for beer.

448
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
I think you need to do anything

449
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,800
where you take like the word brew or suds or anything

450
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,080
and place it into the title of something else that you enjoy.

451
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,800
What about this?

452
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,520
Slam drunk.

453
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,360
Ooh, I like it.

454
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
How's that?

455
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,920
That's kind of sporty.

456
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,720
What about suds buds?

457
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,680
Bud suds.

458
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
So suds buds is obviously the name of your company

459
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,080
and then bud suds because it's beer

460
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,840
and maybe you sprinkle a little bit of weed in it.

461
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,800
A lot of people have been trying to find a way

462
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,240
to corner this new booming legal marijuana market.

463
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,440
I think sprinkle some flakes of your beer into the weed

464
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
and then that can be your whole thing.

465
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,240
Yeah, it's weird.

466
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
What about rehydrated beer

467
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,080
and you tell people that it came in a powder form

468
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
and then you rehydrate it?

469
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,000
Because that seems convenient and kind of futuristic.

470
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,560
What about pre-popsicles?

471
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,680
Couldn't that be any fluid though?

472
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,320
Not beer, it doesn't freeze.

473
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,680
Got it.

474
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:51,520
What about suds buds?

475
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,160
Dad fuel.

476
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Dad fuel is a great name for a beer.

477
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,420
Epic.

478
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,640
Dad fuel.

479
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,440
Dad fuel.

480
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,200
When my daddy comes home from work

481
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
and he's running on fumes.

482
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
He gases up with some dad fuel

483
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,680
and then he's ready to hang out with us.

484
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,840
You'll be ready to dad for two to three hours

485
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,240
after just one dad fuel.

486
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,760
Pop it open, rip it off, bounce them on your knees.

487
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,280
Now consult your physician before you try dad fuel

488
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,240
and if your dadergy lasts longer than four hours.

489
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,160
Yeah, just keep popping more dad fuel.

490
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
My fucking kids went to bed

491
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,840
and I really want to play with them more.

492
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,160
This is damn it, all this dad fuel.

493
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,040
We are skipping school tomorrow and doing it.

494
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,760
Dad fuel.

495
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm in dad fuel rehab right now.

496
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,680
I need you kids to keep your distance.

497
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,440
I've been ordered not to play with my children

498
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
for 50 days.

499
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,200
Please respect, please respect this.

500
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,000
Please.

501
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,360
Please respect this journey.

502
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,400
Dad accidentally put some unleaded dad fuel in the system

503
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
so dad's gonna need to sleep in a little bit today.

504
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,680
Can you guys get yourselves to school?

505
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,160
Thanks.

506
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,560
Let's fucking top off our dad fuel tanks

507
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:26,960
and drive on down to the money zone.

508
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
Hey Trav, who's this first message for?

509
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,520
It's for Ian Mullian.

510
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,320
Or Mullin.

511
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
Or Dovrum.

512
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,680
If he is French, it is Moulin.

513
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,480
If he is Chinese, it is Mulan.

514
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,040
It's from his younger brother.

515
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,360
It does not appear to be named here.

516
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,200
It's secret Moulin.

517
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,520
Secret Moulin, his younger brother.

518
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:58,400
Happy birthday, Ian, on February 8th from your favorite brother.

519
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,920
Thank you for always being awesome

520
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,000
and introducing me to Mim Bam, Mamba if you prefer.

521
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,160
I was hoping the bros could wish you a happy birthday.

522
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,920
Be fitting of a king.

523
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,800
Happy birthday, Moulin.

524
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Oh my gosh, Lindsay.

525
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,680
Excuse me?

526
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,560
What did he say?

527
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,280
Sorry?

528
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,760
So happy birthday, King Ian.

529
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,160
Do you wanna have sex?

530
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,920
I'm your sister.

531
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,880
This is Game of Thrones.

532
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,120
Okay, cool, thank you.

533
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,280
All right, winter's coming and so is your next birthday.

534
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,400
So catch it.

535
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160
Trav, we got another message.

536
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,080
Is this the one for Lindsay Peters?

537
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
It is the one for Lindsay Peters.

538
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

539
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,000
Do you have some other context for me?

540
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,280
I do have more information.

541
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,000
Would you like it?

542
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah, you know, as much as I was

543
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,560
just wanting to like read these words back and forth,

544
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,960
I thought maybe we could try to make like a conversation.

545
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,760
Well, this message is from Daniel, Liz, Logan, and Ryan.

546
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,680
And it says here both day and night,

547
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,840
which either means they know two Ryans,

548
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,320
one named Ryan Day and one named Ryan Night,

549
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,280
which is cool where there's one Ryan

550
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,040
and he behaves differently during the day and during the night.

551
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,320
Or there's like Lady Hawk, there's a Ryan

552
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,600
where every day at dusk he goes home

553
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
and then the next Ryan comes in for his shift.

554
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,680
I don't know what that-

555
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:25,920
Guys-

556
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
There's literally no explanation.

557
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
It's not the craziest thing.

558
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,520
How are you guys celebrating Ryan Day?

559
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm just looking forward to, you know me.

560
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm just looking forward to Ryan Night, man.

561
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,240
Living for the Ryan Night.

562
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,760
Anyway, we should make this message

563
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,920
about the person who the message is for.

564
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,720
Yeah, okay.

565
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,320
So Lindsay, congratulations on your new gig.

566
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,160
All your misandrist friends here at MLMRMDAM

567
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,600
are really proud.

568
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,440
She'll be making an honest living

569
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,320
so she can fund her hedgehog and Greyhound habits.

570
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,280
You know, I hate delivering these coded messages.

571
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,000
Does she really have hedgehogs?

572
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,040
I don't, is that an in-joke?

573
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,240
Did you just say the activation-

574
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
Or is it like a sex thing?

575
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,280
Did you just say the activation phrase

576
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,320
that's gonna send her after our American president and Pope?

577
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,600
I was trying to decode what MLMRMDAM means

578
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,200
and I think it is my lover, my roommate, my dad and me

579
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,800
which makes me all kinds of uncomfortable.

580
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,400
So have a happy, uncomfortable new job, Lindsay Peters.

581
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,240
Do you think that that's an activation phrase

582
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,280
that turns it from a robot into an android

583
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,320
that's capable of love?

584
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,720
That's exactly what just happened.

585
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,040
Got one more thing we want to tell you about.

586
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,000
Super exciting, not a person, more of an entity.

587
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
You want to go to, it's a show called

588
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
The Chapter Titles Were So Good.

589
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
It's a weekly podcast discussing

590
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
the magical world of Harry Potter one chapter at a time.

591
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,040
They balance keen literary insight

592
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
with a reverent off-the-wall humor

593
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,440
maintaining a wisdom to goof ratio

594
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,560
that listeners of MBMBAM might enjoy.

595
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,080
And we keep it nice and pithy at around 20 minutes per week.

596
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
We've just started the fourth book in the series.

597
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,800
So now is the time to join.

598
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,960
Man, how long you guys have been doing this show?

599
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,840
There's like a lot of chapters there.

600
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,720
You've already gotten through.

601
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
I also like that they acknowledge

602
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,040
that the first three books are bad

603
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,600
and then it gets really good on the fourth book.

604
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,680
More like the opposite of what you said

605
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,880
because the first three are all about childlike fantasy.

606
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,680
Oh shit, and I forgot Prisoner of Azkaban was number three.

607
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,400
Now I take it back.

608
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,680
Number three is when it starts to get good.

609
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,280
What's the one where I stop being about childlike fantasy

610
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,440
and all about like war and death?

611
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,960
It's like, we get enough of that in real life.

612
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,840
Just give me my Hufflepuff.

613
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

614
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,920
And I'm looking forward to listening

615
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,560
to these kids read chapter titles.

616
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,640
Are you drinking dad fuel right now?

617
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,680
I just want these other podcasts to stay out the game.

618
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:01,920
Yeah.

619
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
Listen, it's 2013.

620
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,920
There's not a lot of money, resources, or ears

621
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,000
just lying around, you know?

622
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,720
Hey, check this out.

623
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,600
The Boy Who Lived.

624
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,240
There's one.

625
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,160
That's chapter one, book one.

626
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,000
We just took that from you.

627
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,480
Took that.

628
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,520
That's ours now.

629
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,560
These nuts.

630
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,000
Harry and Hagrid reach an agreement.

631
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,960
Harry and Hagrid reach an agreement.

632
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,200
The worst wand.

633
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,720
Defense against the fart arts.

634
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,040
And not dark farts?

635
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,400
What happened to you?

636
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,760
What the fuck, Johnson?

637
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,120
It's doing dad fuel.

638
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,960
I have no kids here that I could dad.

639
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,680
I'm just building up in my limbic system.

640
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,480
My body's shutting down piecemeal.

641
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,200
You need to vent.

642
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
You need to open your exhaust.

643
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I went and opened my dad vents.

644
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,120
Yeah.

645
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,400
He's busted a fan belt.

646
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,360
So be sure to check out the chapter titles are so good.com

647
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
or search chapter titles in iTunes.

648
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,200
And they will show up there and you can listen to it and enjoy it.

649
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
And if you, speaking of enjoyment,

650
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,920
guess who bought another 12 weeks of advertising with my brother, my brother.

651
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,720
Lock it in for three goddamn, through May, through May.

652
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,800
May, you are going to be hearing us talk about what?

653
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,480
Extreme restraints.com.

654
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,600
Your home for fucking and sucking and living and learning.

655
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,240
And trucking.

656
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,120
You know what's funny?

657
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,880
There was a time, like two years ago,

658
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,880
when Justin saying that sentence would have made me so uncomfortable.

659
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,920
Not anymore.

660
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,280
No barriers anymore.

661
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,000
I can't sleep without listening to episodes

662
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,480
where we talk about trucking and fucking and sucking.

663
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,840
And ducking, duck tales.

664
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,560
And shucking.

665
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,360
And shucking.

666
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,360
You want to get to this adult super store right now

667
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,920
and get some herbal penis pills, Justin.

668
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,120
This is more of a reminder to myself when I listen to this.

669
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,000
Siri, I just wrote it on the back of my hand in Sharpie.

670
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,920
Siri set calendar reminder.

671
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,080
Herb max stamina.

672
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,200
Special pills reminder.

673
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Send that to my personal account.

674
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,160
Thank you.

675
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
And pick up another nine pack of dad fuel.

676
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,660
Cool.

677
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,320
Why do they only sell it in nine packs?

678
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,800
I have no idea.

679
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,160
It's so inconvenient.

680
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,660
I know.

681
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,320
They do have max size male enhancement formula.

682
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
So that's more of a cream.

683
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,400
Look for max fun male enhancement formula.

684
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,600
I've always said in order to make sure that you really maximize it

685
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
and blow it up down there,

686
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,200
you got to go both internal with some sort of pill

687
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,440
and then you need a topical ointment.

688
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,760
Oh, definitely.

689
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,440
It's just going to stretch the inside.

690
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
It's going to stretch the inside.

691
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,200
You're going to get stretch marks.

692
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,640
It's going to look like a zebra's neck.

693
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,960
This is a site you can go to.

694
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,640
Extremerestraints.com.

695
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
It's going to be super private.

696
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,320
It will be discreetly shipped to you in a box shaped like a dick.

697
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
Is there like a second option?

698
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,800
Because everyone talks about the discreetness.

699
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,680
What if I want all my neighbors to know what's up?

700
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah.

701
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,200
Is there like an option where it arrives and the guy knocks on my door and says,

702
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,000
hey, your special extra large condoms are here.

703
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
Hello?

704
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,360
Are you here?

705
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,880
I want them to know.

706
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,380
Yeah.

707
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,920
They just bring you a giant crate like in a Christmas story.

708
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,560
Only instead of saying fragile, it says like pussies.

709
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,600
Just so people know.

710
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,960
Let there be no doubt about it.

711
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,240
If you head over and use the coupon code midlist at extremerestraints.com,

712
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,240
you're going to save 20%, which is like one fifth of a dildo.

713
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,680
Would you say that the website itself is discreet?

714
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,280
Or is this the kind of thing that maybe you do on a small screened computer

715
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,920
if your significant other is around?

716
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,960
A little column A, a little column B.

717
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,600
Maybe your significant other is into it.

718
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,280
Maybe they don't know they're into it yet.

719
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,160
Do they have like a secret skin that you can apply to the website

720
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,040
to make it look like the Oprah television channel website?

721
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,540
Yeah.

722
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,160
And then there's like a picture of like the upcoming book of the month book,

723
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,360
but the text of it is like secret dicks.

724
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:13,940
Yeah.

725
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,080
Just like what you said is there.

726
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,320
And there's a boss button.

727
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,360
So if your boss comes by and just click that, it looks like charts and stuff.

728
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,040
But the chart is like how your boner will go when you put this cream on it.

729
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,720
And it's just a line going upwards.

730
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,080
So get over there.

731
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,960
It's a time to boner X, Y access.

732
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,240
So get over there.

733
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,120
ExtremeSaints.com.

734
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,760
Hi, Charlie.

735
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,520
How much time will you spend fucking?

736
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,120
But it's just one big blue circle.

737
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,520
And the circle just says yes.

738
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,660
All time.

739
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,320
I'm new to the whole dating scene.

740
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,440
Most of my previous boyfriends were dudes who orbited around my friend circle

741
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,840
and conversation flowed easily.

742
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,480
However, once the friend ratio of X's in my group started creeping towards a 40% mark,

743
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
I figured it's probably time I started branching out.

744
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Problem is I don't know how to converse with the person I've just met in a way that's not awkward.

745
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,360
Once I start trying to think of something to ask, panic sets in and I draw a total blank.

746
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,640
It's the getting to know you questions that I struggle with the most.

747
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,160
I don't know what's appropriate to ask.

748
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,920
It might be considered prying.

749
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,760
If you guys have any ideas past the obvious what do you do type thing, I'd love to hear it.

750
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
That's from Gmail.

751
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,920
I like this question.

752
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,200
I like this question because it presupposes everything we've been chatting about,

753
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,720
which is the best thing to do is to ask them questions, get interested in them,

754
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,320
and don't be afraid to like start the conversation out about them.

755
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,360
That's great.

756
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,760
I think it's a very fair point because I think there are certain questions that seem like prying.

757
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:51,600
But I actually get, I have problems with this when it's a person that I sort of know a little bit

758
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,880
and I'm seeing them because like I'm always worried that I'm going to ask like,

759
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,760
how's your dad?

760
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,960
And you know, he's in jail again or something, you know,

761
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,120
and I'll step into a landmine that I didn't mean to.

762
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Because you were so busy having an uncomfortable conversation

763
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,080
that you weren't looking down at the minefield you were walking through.

764
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,880
Right, exactly.

765
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,520
I wonder, do you think now's really the time, Justin?

766
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,400
Can we focus?

767
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
No, I'm just wondering, you know, how's your family?

768
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,120
They're all dead.

769
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh, no.

770
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,560
Kaboom.

771
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,060
Kaboom.

772
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,360
This is like, I really do think that like having those kinds of conversations

773
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,520
and getting to know somebody, like having those getting to know you conversations,

774
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,160
it's a skill that you really do need to practice

775
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,520
because it is different from having a conversation with just some rando

776
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,200
if you're like on a date or whatever.

777
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,600
I think that's why, I think that's sort of the reason that online dating is successful

778
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,080
because it's like practice.

779
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,040
It's like you can practice having these relationships

780
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,040
and it's the most low stress scenario ever because if it fucks up, it's like, well,

781
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,880
you know, there's so many people on the internet, you know, just look at Twitter.

782
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,200
I'm like sitting here trying to think of a question

783
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,480
that doesn't just make you sound like just a complete boner.

784
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:00,960
Well, don't-

785
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
It's like, well, the question was like, what I thought it's like,

786
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,800
so, seen any good movies lately? And it's like, I think it's about the sincerity

787
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
with which you ask it. And if you ask it like I just did, you sound like an asshole.

788
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,400
But there's nothing, there's nothing sincere, there's nothing sincere about like,

789
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,640
so tell me about yourself. Like, what? Like, what?

790
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,800
I really, really like sour jelly bellies. Like, what the fuck do you want from me?

791
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
Like, what do you want to know? That's not your, that's not yours to know.

792
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,600
I think if you come at a date from the angle of an interrogation,

793
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,240
like, you're just going to weird them and yourself out. Like, just talk to them.

794
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,080
I think that's the issue. That's why I have such problems with meeting people in bars,

795
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:46,800
because there's no context. If you're like at a movie screening, or you're like in a book club,

796
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,200
or you're anywhere else, like you have things to talk about. But if you're at a bar,

797
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,360
all you can say is, what are you drinking? And do you come to this bar often? Like,

798
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,680
so do you like really loud house music? Or, oh, you don't? I mean, either.

799
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,560
Have you tried Dad Fuel's Pale Ale? Oh, it's so good. They've used lots of hops.

800
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,320
Hops for pops is what they call it. You could ask him the questions that

801
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,120
James Lipton uses. Just go through those. Cycle through those.

802
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,720
They would love that. Hey, so what's your favorite word? Oh,

803
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,120
I'm Travis. Nice to meet you. What sound do you love?

804
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
Boxers or briefs? I've never watched inside the acting studio.

805
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
When you get to heaven- Dad Fuel or Dad Fuel? Trick question.

806
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,920
I'm in marketing for Dad Fuel. To which side do you dress?

807
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,360
Now I'm uncomfortable. Shoes or bow ties?

808
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
I think that'd be great. Just set yourself up a set of flashcards that was all like,

809
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,520
or questions that didn't have anything to do with one another. Flamingos or bathtubs?

810
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh, very interesting. Witches or sandwiches?

811
00:38:52,560 --> 00:39:00,640
And I do mean here witches that mainly practice their machinations in sand.

812
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,960
Do you know what is really usually very successful is if you are at a bar or something and you're

813
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,640
meeting somebody, just walk up to the person and then point to the person next to them and be like,

814
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,120
this guy, right? I'm Griffin, by the way. Maybe offer him a Tums, because most of the

815
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,800
time you could probably use one. I've got Yucky Tummy.

816
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,400
I've got Yucky Tummy. Do you have Yucky Tummy? Pop one of these. I'm Griffin, by the way.

817
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,240
This is going great. I think if you-

818
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,920
I really feel like we've made a tummy connection. When you introduce yourself to somebody,

819
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,480
if you say I'm and then your name, and then by the way, that's probably the worst five-

820
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,440
I love it because it implies that you've just had a really long, in-depth conversation and

821
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,640
failed to mention your name. But if you're like, hello, I'm Griffin, by the way.

822
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,520
But that's- I played that- when I was in this person's shoes, just out of a relationship in

823
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,800
college and had never really dated before, and would just be talking to some strange

824
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,600
person I just met at a bar, and then we'd talk for 10 minutes about some shitty movie that we

825
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,720
just saw, and then it's like, oh, I'm Griffin, by the way. I should have afforded you that

826
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,800
information 10 minutes ago, maybe. Whoops. Movies do this all the time, though.

827
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,320
Movies do this with a delayed title card, so you'll be watching Jake Sully run through

828
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,440
the jungle for 10 minutes, and then after 10 minutes, it's like, oh, I'm Avatar, by the way.

829
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,520
That's the movie I am.

830
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,800
Maybe you should play it like that and be like, I'm Griffin, by the way. Directed by Griffin.

831
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,080
Coming soon, and then leave the room.

832
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,360
That was just a teaser, and then you come back and you say,

833
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,680
it's time for the release date, by which I mean sex.

834
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,760
Okay, next time you're talking to someone of the opposite sex and trying to pick them up,

835
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,520
stop them after two minutes and 30 seconds and say, sorry, baby, this is just a trailer.

836
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,880
Unless you're ready for the red band trailer, and then you get your dick back.

837
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,920
In which case, I will meet you in the alley.

838
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,720
I'm going to box office smash your pussy apart.

839
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,240
Did I do good?

840
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,480
I wanted to play along. You guys are playing like a fun game together, and I wanted to get in on it,

841
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,720
but I didn't know. That was one of those conversations I could only sidestep into,

842
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,360
and then say box office smash that pussy apart. I'm Griffin.

843
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:22,000
You're welcome, guys. Great guys and so inclined girls. There's a great line you can use

844
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,160
next time you're writing in a movie.

845
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,200
It's the worst. Just get engaged as quick as you can, man.

846
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,720
Nobody knows what they're doing up there. Griffin, how about a Yahoo question?

847
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,800
Yeah, I'll give you one. Man, I got like six. I got six really good ones.

848
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,300
Okay.

849
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,560
This one may not be able to start much of a conversation. I just love it so much.

850
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,320
I just sent it by Ben Hockenberry. Thanks, Ben. It's by Yahoo. It's his user.

851
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,640
She's that one who asks, how do people on Jeopardy know the answers?

852
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,440
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

853
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,040
I don't know where that question is going to go, but I do just like-

854
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,160
I just like that it exists.

855
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,720
I like the picture of this gentleman watching Jeopardy and pulling his hair out, screaming.

856
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,120
What kind of freak? How do they know this?

857
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,200
This is amazing.

858
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
Oh, my God. They have super powers.

859
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:23,200
this is amazing oh my god they have superpowers um let's try this one this yahoo answer is

860
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,800
sent in by christopher cook thank you christopher it's by yahoo answers user sean dault who

861
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,760
asks is it weird to carry a list at the grocery store i was a giant eagle and about to go

862
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,400
into the store i had my car pulled aside and stepped to the side to get my list out of

863
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,360
my pocket it took about 30 seconds for me to reach the list in my pocket there's this

864
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,640
one lady standing behind me and awkwardly staring at me strange so i said to her go

865
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,160
ahead you don't just have to stand there and wait for me she gave me a disgusted look and

866
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,820
said rudely whatever the way she was looking at me was beyond weird and treated me like

867
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,940
i was dumb or had severe obsessive compulsive disorder for having a grocery store list of

868
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,320
what to buy uh is it weird uh and obsessive to carry a huge grocery list with you blah

869
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,120
blah blah blah blah so the deeper level here is this young man was masturbating in the

870
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:12,240
giant i was masturbating through my pocket at giant eagle is that okay i know they allow

871
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,440
that at piggly wiggly in fact they encourage it the jiggly piggly wiggly but a giant eagle

872
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,760
is that not cool no are we i want to say something about giant eagle real quick okay

873
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:32,360
is the world not unfriendly enough to time travelers yeah that we have a giant building

874
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,660
with the words giant eagle written on the side like what else are you gonna think is

875
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,960
stored there yeah you're gonna think there's a giant eagle in there right yeah well there

876
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,020
isn't that what you would think people of the future do not journey into that building

877
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,840
have you it contains a bow to pray the likes of which have never been seen this is where

878
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,080
we we've we've imprisoned him here and put a giant sign remind ourselves that this is

879
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,520
indeed where we left the giant eagle what do you want to call a grocery store how about

880
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,640
eagle no fuck that fuck that noise how about this giant eagle what about fucking what about

881
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:18,080
fucking big bear we had a grocery store called big bear oh oh big bear huh nice try guys

882
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,880
i got something bigger than a big bear a giant eagle oh god they just opened enormous raptor

883
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,920
across the street do you want to go to little cat fuck you of course i don't want to go

884
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:37,280
to little cat damn you and your mom and pop tiny animal store i'm going to enormous seal

885
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:44,680
give me where's my list do you guys use lists i can't i can't i can't do you know why because

886
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:51,040
i don't like my grocery shopping experience to a take six hours and b be like the final

887
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,760
round in the carmen san diego uh game show like if i have a list that just ensures that

888
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,800
like i'm gonna go oh okay pasta well that's in that's in lane six but then oh shit pasta

889
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,360
sauce that's all the way over in lane one i just go through in a serpentine pattern

890
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,680
and clear the shelves like i'm in supermarket suite the problem with that is the problem

891
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,400
with that is is that in this world if you arrive at a supermarket at the same time as

892
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,480
someone else who is also serpentining through the store and you arrive like three seconds

893
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,440
after them you are guaranteed to look like the creepiest supermarket stalker ever because

894
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,760
you're just like slowly winding behind them like oh you're getting ramen i'm gonna get

895
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,720
ramen too turning right here that's funny oh yeah me too me too oh you get marshmallow

896
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,480
fluff huh i haven't had a fluffer nutter in forever maybe that's how you do your small

897
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,720
talk pick up lines it's everything they pick up oatmeal huh it's good for the constitution

898
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:50,440
cool i love i have to have a list uh i like to do a little planning so i have some idea

899
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,920
of what i'm gonna make uh but but i i always i always go the list i don't know how you

900
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,360
guys know it's funny to me because you need just what you said like i i think lists are

901
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,200
for people that can plan meals and i can't do that so i'll just like wind through the

902
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,240
store and get whatever i want and then i'll get home and pull out the things that i want

903
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,160
and be like what the fuck am i gonna make with pickles and peanut butter and oh jesus

904
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:19,640
what was i thinking you say meal planning like i don't need a list to when i see spaghetti

905
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,740
go yes spaghetti that is desirable to me or will be sometime within the next week week

906
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:32,680
and a half yes i don't need a list do i like spaghetti help me list list says i like spaghetti

907
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:38,480
so i'm gonna go ahead and pick this up but do i need grains i just don't know if you're

908
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,280
gonna make a meal with like more than two components then it gets a little trickier

909
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,960
what if i want to make swordfish piccata like i'm not gonna walk past the capers be like

910
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,240
oh fuck looking good capers get in here oh briny and in a jar perfect that's just what

911
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:01,040
i want get in here capers you and me are going on a caper but that's it but i feel like a

912
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,600
shitty bat like a mean bouncer when i walk by the fruit by the foots and i'm like sorry

913
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,480
fruit by the foots not on the list we already got too many fruit by the foots in this bar

914
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,240
i'm suggesting you a plan that keeps you from buying fruit by the foot like i yeah i do

915
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:21,200
need that structure i guess well then i need a list of mr money bags mr mr vip am i to

916
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,520
say no to the chocolate covered gingerbread cookies yeah i need i need a list a do not

917
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:34,840
buy list that my doctor made for me it's like you need to stop buying so much salted caramels

918
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,280
that is why um i i do not allow myself to go to the store by myself anymore without

919
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,000
teresa yeah because the gentle shame that she puts upon me when because when we walk

920
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,080
in our local aldi because all these awesome the first like 30 feet is all bags of chips

921
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,000
and i will just without thinking about it crap like eight bags of chips yeah and the

922
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,240
gentle shaming that tree sit and that's like every week the gentle shaming that trisa will

923
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,120
lay down on me and be like oh cheese puffs huh oh and burritos i feel like i feel oh

924
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,080
oh and you're getting the wavy chips oh and the regular chips i feel like uh i feel like

925
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,080
i've talked about this before but rachel and i when we go grocery shopping she starts

926
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,960
on one end of the store with a cart and i start on the other end of the store with a

927
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,440
cart and then we meet in the middle and once we meet in the middle we go we go check out

928
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:24,360
have i talked about this before this this amazing 12 minute long grocery shopping maneuver

929
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,680
the only how do you do that without a list i and how do you do that without not meeting

930
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,720
in the middle and her going why did you get 18 boxes of cookies well it's because i'm

931
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,360
well i'm a grown-ass man um but also because i man can eat cookies i mostly just buy the

932
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,720
same things every time i shop which is uh unfortunate because she starts in produce

933
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,680
and i start on the far far end of the store where they put the bad foods um so without

934
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:56,440
fail every time i start my journey the first two things i put in my cart at the heb grocery

935
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,960
store is toilet paper and low-fat ice cream sandwiches so somebody who sees me at the

936
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,400
beginning of my odyssey is like this man has very specific plans for the evening and that

937
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,800
is to party on some skinny cow ice cream sandwiches and then poop and wipe butts you have to be

938
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,520
so careful when you're buying toilet paper i have a bad habit of like i'll go to ride

939
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,840
aid because i need toilet paper and then i'll get like one other thing and i always feel

940
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:34,200
like the subtle message i'm sending is this makes me poop i went to wall greens yesterday

941
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:40,040
to buy batteries and uh was reminded that it was discount valentine's day candy time

942
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:46,240
oh shit and so like i couldn't stop myself i bought three boxes like heart-shaped boxes

943
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,520
of chocolates to be shared with me and my fiance and then i realized that when i walked

944
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,180
up the counter i was buying a pack of batteries and some like outdated valentine's day candy

945
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:00,600
and i just couldn't i couldn't even think about what message i was sending to this poor

946
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:07,120
man that was ringing me out except for wow this is a sad guy poor guy but then i ate

947
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,880
all of that chocolate in one day so who's the sad guy now what's great about my maneuver

948
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,960
is sometimes we don't meet each other in the middle and you make to the other side of the

949
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,560
store it's like well double chili this week i guess guess it's double chili week fuck

950
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,760
perfect and ice cream sandwiches always melt by the time you get to the cashier so you

951
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,960
guys just get cans of chili sometimes yeah yeah that'd be dope i wish i could have a

952
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,640
can of chili do it it's healthy chili you get a thing like a block of obd you melt them

953
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,440
together you have some delicious chip dip well i decided i was thinking like wolf's

954
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,160
turkey chili it's like you know it's like 280 calories but that's like your whole meal

ernesto shanta sasha um brett eagleston uh kevin grant um katie cisneros uh here jay

979
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:40,720
stanek here's a weird thing i noticed uh this week if you search have you guys noticed so

980
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,320
soon you can taste it yes yeah you have noticed this that's like a spam it's like a spam bot

981
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:53,880
right there's a spam bot that tweets so soon you can taste it period period mbnbam and

982
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,440
if you search for that specific phrase there's like 30 spam bots that have used that specific

983
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,780
phrase which i find that very endearing because i think it's just like a thing that they say

984
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:09,560
so that they're so that they're like their shitty accounts don't get caught for being

985
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:17,640
spam bots so like our show is like a heuristic for seeming like you're a human being oh so

986
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,160
this is like the new turing test right right anybody who talks about like no robot knows

987
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,760
what our fucking podcast is we're not that we're not that but in a way i feel famous

988
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,440
a little bit because like before like they'd be like man i sure do like justin bieber and

989
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,980
that would be like the metric for for humanity oh also i think we missed this because we

990
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:44,560
were gone last week mysteriously um but they announced the max fun con lineup it's oh yeah

991
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:50,880
it's sick oh it is you know if you haven't seen it check it out we're up in it yeah we're
