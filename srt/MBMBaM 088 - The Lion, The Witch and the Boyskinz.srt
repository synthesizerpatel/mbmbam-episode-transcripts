1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:50,960
Hello, this is My Brother, My Brother, and Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,200
This week we are protesting SOPA and PIPA, which are two beats of legislation

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:10,800
that, if passed, could kill the internet forever. Just dead as it could be.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,960
So this week, in protest of SOPA and PIPA, we have removed, we've blacked out,

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,400
if you will, the comedy from this week's episode.

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,720
Let me give you guys an example of what we're talking about.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
Guys, why are we protesting the Spanish word for soup?

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,520
See, that joke wasn't very funny.

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,520
And that's the kind of joke, non-joke, you're going to expect this week.

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
It's public domain jokes.

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,120
It's a public domain freeware joke.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,760
This is the one I came up with.

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,520
Okay. I don't know what the big deal is. Without SOPA, how am I supposed to wash up?

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,400
See, that's a very open source, free share, share to play,

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,960
microtransaction joke that we are expecting to populate the entirety of this SOPA special edition.

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,920
We can also use jokes that have entered the public domain

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,320
simply by their sheer age being over and including 75 years old.

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,600
So Griffin, if I were to say to you, why did the chicken cross SOPA?

23
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
I don't know, Justin, why?

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
Betty Grable!

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,120
That is an example of an old joke that I can use this week.

26
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,240
Okay. I'm getting this just in. SOPA was apparently defeated this week.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
We did it.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,160
We did it.

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,640
You're welcome.

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
I'm really proud of everybody.

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,160
It's a proud share moment here on My Brother and My Brother and Me.

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm your oldest brother and oldest, well, oldest victor, if you will.

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,300
Victor.

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,640
McElroy.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm your middle-est brother and champion, Travis McElroy.

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,240
I am Griffin McElroy, the flag bearer of the army, the internet army.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,720
Anonymous.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,680
Internet army.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,480
I am anonymous.

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm sorry that it had to come out like this, but I am him.

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,760
I am Deadmau5.

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,080
Okay.

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
And I'm Spuds McKenzie.

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,800
Let's go fight the internet.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
I am Killroy, 75 years old.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,880
Let's get them.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,800
My girlfriend and I were planning to go on a double date last night

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,720
with a couple of our friends who live five minutes away.

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,480
Me and the lady hang around the apartment doing for an hour without hearing from them

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,800
until we get a call at 1040 saying we should just meet at the restaurant to save time.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,640
The nearby restaurant closes at 11.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
My girlfriend and I were uncomfortable being party to the under the wire dining habits,

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,800
so we politely told them we'd have to decline.

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,080
I feel bad for bailing on our plans, but I'd feel just as bad being complicit in their plan

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,800
to show up at a sit-down restaurant 10 minutes before closing.

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,720
Did we do the right thing?

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,960
And that's from Nonplussed in North Carolina.

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,800
Of course you did the right thing.

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,960
Yeah, for a number of people.

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
For a number of reasons.

61
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,960
First off, you shouldn't eat anything after like eight o'clock or else it just goes that's

62
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,440
you just convert it straight into sleep and energy, which is to say fat on your loins.

63
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,760
That's that's carb heavy too.

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Yeah, tortillas, sopas, pipas.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Sopa pipas.

66
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Sopa pipas.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
Can I get another order of sopa pipas, please?

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,640
Just the cold gazpacho sopa.

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,920
And secondly, who the hell are these friends?

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
They're calling you at 10 40 p.m.

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,160
Be like, hey, let's go grab some dinner.

72
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,920
That's not dinner.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,800
That's fourth meal.

74
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
They want you to go get fourth meal.

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,960
Wait, was this Mexican restaurant Taco Bell?

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,520
The finest sit down Mexican restaurant in town.

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,880
Me and Tracy, we're going to go to get fourth meal at Taco Bell,

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,160
then take in a late showing of the crazy homeless guy running around the library.

79
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,480
Are you in for this evening of glad?

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
Dinner and theater?

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,120
I'll be there.

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,480
And theater?

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
Couples night out.

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,160
The homeless man stops running at 12 30 and we should get there right around 12 15.

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,760
So everything should work out just great.

86
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,520
From working in at least two restaurants that I can remember right now,

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
there is nothing worse than like you've already you started your clean up and like closing duties.

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
And, you know, you're just finishing out your last tables and somebody rolls up with like a party of people.

89
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,560
I'm like, hey, you guys aren't closed yet.

90
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,760
Are you like, well, no, they might not spit in your food, but you're going to get a lot of fuck you in that food.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,600
And it's going to affect the flavor.

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,400
I believe it was Carla in season five of Top Chef who made her way into the final three

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
contestants by putting love into her food.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This would be the opposite of that, where it would be pure unbridled spite.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They take some love out of the food.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,400
This tastes dry to me and I think advice like for future reference.

98
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I think the problem is not setting a specific time beforehand and waiting for them to call you.

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Especially these sounds like the type of people that do not adhere to normal people.

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
Do not adhere to normal person schedules.

101
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
Any fourth meal at 1040 p.m.

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,600
So maybe the next time you're going to make plans with them, nail down like a realistic time to go eat dinner or just stop making doing.

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Maybe they're not plans friends.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
Oh, yeah, they can be they can be friends.

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Just not like double date friends.

106
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,400
We've all been like that.

107
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Oh, they can be like run into at a party friends or like invite over it like you invite them to all your social events.

108
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,000
Just don't make them the only thing in the social event because they're going to show up an hour and a half late and they're going to.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, I forgot to bring beer.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll get you next time.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They won't get you next time.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
There is no next time.

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,700
They'll bail.

114
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,200
Those people would rather move than show up on time.

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,900
Yeah, you can't build your world around them.

116
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,200
Hey, dear McElroy's.

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm in high school and there's this certain kid who's a total bully.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,600
He and his group gang up and beat down anyone they so well, please.

119
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,100
Both myself and many of my friends have reported him in his group, but he never gets any punishment.

120
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Would it be okay for me to get a bunch of my friends to teach him a lesson or would I simply be escalating the conflict heroic high school?

121
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,500
Oh, no, would it be okay?

122
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,200
Absolutely not.

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah, it's not okay like you.

124
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,500
Yes, you will be escalating because that's the definition of the thing.

125
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
Yeah, that's the definition of escalate.

126
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,600
Do you know how bullies get to be bullies?

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,900
They have mean dads that beat them up and will beat other kids up.

128
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,400
Is that what you want?

129
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,900
You want to escalate your problem from bully to mean dad?

130
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,800
And also look at this for the future.

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:09,900
If you and a bunch of your friends jump him, he's not going to go, you know, I see your point now and I've decided he's going to wait till the next time you're alone and him and a bunch of his friends are going to jump you.

132
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,100
Yeah, you've got to stride right up to him.

133
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,800
You got to tap on the shoulder and say, excuse me, sir, and then deck him and then change schools.

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,200
You leave her alone, Biff.

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:32,100
I'm your son from the future and you've been beating me up and I travel back in time to tell you don't do that.

136
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
But every time I try to tell you before you beat me up.

137
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,100
It's awkward.

138
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Maybe you should befriend him.

139
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
This is they see here.

140
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
We're getting closer to actionable advice now.

141
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,600
You gotta I think all three of us can speak to this.

142
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
You gotta lean into it.

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
You gotta you gotta write that wave.

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
You gotta write that write that wave to graduation day.

145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
And I swear to you, you'll get through.

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Are you wait?

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,900
Are you encouraging him to like demand beating?

148
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,500
Oh, no.

149
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,600
Just eat it when they come.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Just take them.

151
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Have it.

152
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,300
Just grow from it.

153
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,600
Dive at the floor.

154
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,100
Let his let his punishment become the fertilizer for your maturity tree.

155
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:24,300
You know, you don't want to end up like bright eyes and only get beat up enough to have enough material for two to three solo independent singer songwriter albums.

156
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,600
You need to be beat up enough that you can have a career of it.

157
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,100
You want a Connor Ober's level of getting beat up in high school.

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, that's that's where we're headed.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,700
Look at that.

160
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
We want to make you a star.

161
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,100
Let's use Ben Gibbard.

162
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
That's a way better example.

163
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,700
Probably got the shit knocked out of his face every day.

164
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,500
And then what happened?

165
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
He released a bunch of great albums married Zooey Deschanel.

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,200
That one didn't work out so well, but but everything was a beat her up now about that.

167
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,000
You left all your goddamn sweaters lying around again bed.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm tired of cleaning or you could do what I did when I got picked on and I hit him with a trombone case.

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,800
So you're talking about you're talking about weaponized school supplies.

170
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,500
Yeah.

171
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Well, I think that the idea of like getting a group of people together not cool, but like yeah challenging him to an honorable duel trombone cases at dawn.

172
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,300
Yeah, then you don't think one-on-one fight might solve this.

173
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,300
No, I don't think that two guys hitting each other with a trombone.

174
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,300
That sounds like a mating call for bullies to come in like a bigger bully to come see that fight.

175
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,600
And that's not bullying.

176
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,100
I'll show you both you bullying.

177
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh, you need to find a bigger bully to bully your bully.

178
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense.

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,600
Hey, why don't you?

180
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Hey guys, why don't you hire Owen Wilson to come and protect you and your friends?

181
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,800
It worked on an episode of Doug.

182
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,300
Why don't you get your secret agent dad to come protect you like a Klogen dagger?

183
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:03,200
Why don't you call Rick Moranis and help you win the big triathlon sports triathlon?

184
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Why don't you get the former fat guy for the fat kids camp to come over and teach you how to be good at volleyball?

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,900
I don't even know how this helped with the bullying anymore.

186
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:21,500
Why don't you go and with a bunch of your friends and Christopher Lloyd open up your own summer camp because you hate going to piano camp so much.

187
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,200
And then on the last day at camp you have to put together a parents day.

188
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,400
Did you just pull out camp nowhere?

189
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,900
I might have pulled that out of my quiver, yes.

190
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:38,900
You and your friends just learn how to change into cars and then back into robots and then fight the bad robots because you're transformers.

191
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,400
And by this point you've graduated.

192
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
So yeah, by now you've graduated.

193
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,700
Oh man.

194
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,900
I'm sorry that we're not more helpful.

195
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,200
I don't think any of that helps.

196
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,600
If we knew how to deal with bullies, we wouldn't be in this situation.

197
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,900
High school sucks dick.

198
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,700
Which I mean our lives.

199
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,900
High school sucks more than anything but then it's over and it's awesome.

200
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,400
Yeah, it'll get better.

201
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,900
The bully will get tired of it eventually.

202
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,400
He's gonna get worn out from punching you.

203
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,200
He's gonna get winded.

204
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,600
That's the real victory.

205
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,400
And then you curl up into a ball and you cry.

206
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,700
You cry so hard.

207
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,600
I do want to make this clear though.

208
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Don't get a big group of people to fight that guy because then you're a bully.

209
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,300
You're like a gang bully.

210
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,500
Yeah, you are a gang.

211
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
You're a gangster at that point and that's a rhyme.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,200
That's how people start gangs to protect themselves from bullies.

213
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Just wait it out and stay hidden in the shadows.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Guys, this Yahoo answer was sent in by Chuck Jones.

215
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Thanks Chuck Jones.

216
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,800
It's so good.

217
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:53,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gary who asks, thongs for men in parentheses bully skins?

218
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,400
Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew where the website boy skins is gone.

219
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,000
I wanted to buy a thong form there, but saw they no longer wear up.

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,300
I also wanted to buy my son one since he saw mine and wanted to try it.

221
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,800
No, I'm not a pedo.

222
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,100
He's 15 and can speak for himself.

223
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,500
Thanks.

224
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,100
Does anyone know where I can buy adult and youth boy thongs?

225
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,700
Thanks.

226
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:23,400
Boy skins, if you couldn't tell from my pronunciation, does have a Z up on it.

227
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,100
Is there a Y?

228
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,400
No Y.

229
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
There is a Y.

230
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,900
At the end of boy, but not men skins, not mid skin.

231
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,300
It would have been better if it was boi skins, but I was not so lucky.

233
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,800
Trademark ever living.

234
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Where did boy skins go?

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've been cruising over to that website, not for any other reason than it was a good way

236
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,200
to check my bandwidth speeds because there are some high-res images.

237
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,900
I mean, to put it to put it mildly, the phrase doesn't even do it justice.

238
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,800
Hey, dad.

239
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Hey, Papa.

240
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,100
I cannot help but notice that stylish man thong.

241
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,900
Is there a place where I, a 15 year old lad, could purchase one of those man thongs?

242
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
Boy skins, you say?

243
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
Well, let's check it out right now.

244
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,200
What a disappointment.

245
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Now I'll have to go bully all those kids at school.

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,700
Come here.

247
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,500
I'm mad at you.

248
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,000
My pants are so loose.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,900
If only he had the support he craved.

250
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,500
I actually, I haven't been on the boy skin site in a while.

251
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,400
I wasn't aware it disappeared.

252
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,800
I had it in my RSS feed.

253
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,400
I had subscribed to their updates and I wasn't getting them anymore.

254
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
The newsletter stopped coming.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,400
It really should have, that really should have been a telltale sign.

256
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,600
Can we not get a groupon on this?

257
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,800
You can get a groupon, but everybody has to share the same thong.

258
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,600
So it becomes very, there's some hygiene issues.

259
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
Yeah, right.

260
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,200
There's nothing worse than waiting for your friend in a Mexican restaurant to get your thong for the day.

261
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,900
Why is, why is this a thing?

262
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,800
Everyone in the answers is saying go to Kmart and Walmart.

263
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,600
As if that's, how do they, how is that, do they have those there?

264
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,200
I know from personal experience that Walmart does not have sock garters.

265
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
So I really doubt they have man thongs.

266
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,700
Can we call them boy skins from now on and also can we call our podcast boy skins from now on?

267
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:36,300
Hey, in the effort to actually give this person a helpful answer, I just googled boy skins and boy do I regret it.

268
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,100
I shouldn't have done that.

269
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,800
And if there are any government agents now monitoring my like DSL usage, I'm sorry.

270
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,900
Very sorry, I didn't mean to do it.

271
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,000
Is boy skins, I don't see a website called boy skins.

272
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,200
I see a lot of usernames named boy skins and a Yahoo, a YouTube channel called boy skins.

273
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
So I'm thinking that this person's trying to start some branding.

274
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,800
Oh, all these accounts are closed.

275
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm trying to Nancy Drew this shit, but.

276
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Boy skins just fell off the face, well, fell off the butt of the internet, let's be honest.

277
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,500
About a, nope, fuck.

278
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,400
No, you can't find boy skins anywhere.

279
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,300
There's a, there's a blog spot called boy skin.

280
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,100
Oh no, don't just go to boy skin at blog spot.

281
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,800
Oh, it's dicks all over dicks for miles.

282
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,400
How could this happen?

283
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:37,700
Well, you know, in 20 years on an episode of storage wars, they'll open up a storage container and find this box after box label boy skins.

284
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,300
And they'd be looking at going, you know, the most kids are worth, that's like a thousand dollars a box right there.

285
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm seeing like $6,000 in thongs.

286
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Is that a Hummel boy skin?

287
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,400
I can tell that looks like a Hummel boy skin.

288
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,900
I was hoping that they were going to find the boy skin website because I was curious how you were going to conceptualize that for me.

289
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,200
Is that the domain name boy skins?

290
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:07,000
There's a, underneath, underneath this, what appears to be an elderly woman sewing table folded up in the shelves here.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,300
There seems to be a website called boy skins.

292
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,100
It's called boy skins.

293
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,300
It's a little, it's become corporeal.

294
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,500
It looks hungry.

295
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:24,900
It seems now this looks like a regular cupboard, but when you open it and go inside, you exit on the other side into boy skins, the website.

296
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,100
Have a look around its directories and indexes.

297
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,400
You're going to like what you see.

298
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
You're going to be horrified at the way you look.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,300
I guarantee it.

300
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,500
So, Mr. Tumnus, you look fantastic.

301
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,300
Very smelt.

302
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,900
How did you get the tiny holes over your furry legs, Mr.

303
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,500
Tumnus?

304
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,100
God, that is really doing some, it is shaping you very attractively.

305
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:54,000
That is the most vivid mental picture I think we've ever created on this show.

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I can't, I can't.

307
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,700
It's like, I can't get it out.

308
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,300
And if you could see in my head, the look Mr.

309
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,800
Tumnus is giving me is troubling.

310
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,900
I'm angry.

311
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,400
It's not like a seductive look.

312
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,700
He's angry that I'm there.

313
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm forming this sentence with my mouth and speaking it with the power from my brain,

314
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,800
but I'm only dedicating about 1% of my brain to that task because the other 99% is dreaming

315
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,900
up this visage and I can't.

316
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,400
I've been meaning to correct you children.

317
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,500
It's pronounced ass land.

318
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Oh, Jesus.

319
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh God, why is everyone in Narnia in my head and wearing thongs?

320
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,000
It's Father Christmas.

321
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,700
Truly, I've brought you gifts.

322
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,300
Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.

323
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,800
I've brought you gifts to help defend the kingdom.

324
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,700
They're all boy skins.

325
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
A sword?

326
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,600
No, a sword sheath of a sort.

327
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,400
Do you like Turkish delights?

328
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,100
No, but I love some boy skins.

329
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,200
Those are delightful enough.

330
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,600
Let me just write down the lion, the witch, and the boy skins right now.

331
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,600
You know what you never find on storage wars?

332
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,700
They never just open it up and it's just a bunch of wolverines.

333
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,200
They open it up and they're just swarmed with like badgers.

334
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you think they would still bet on it?

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,400
There's money in wolverines.

336
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Their teeth.

337
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Their teeth are very precious.

338
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Is anybody being mauled by a wolverine?

339
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Yep.

340
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Nope.

341
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Christ.

342
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,500
Has there ever been an episode where they open up and there's just like a dead person

343
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
in there?

344
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
That's a nice watch.

345
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Look at his belt.

346
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
That's a nice belt.

347
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,200
Dave found some bones once and sold them for like 15 grand.

348
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
No joke.

349
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Good work, Dave.

350
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,000
At one point, oh I remember that episode because at one point Dave commented that there was

351
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
a hand and then he said, and this is an even bigger hand so it's got to be worth more.

352
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,800
And the lady's like, oh that's a foot.

353
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh man, Dave, you're so fucking stupid.

354
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
How'd you get so big?

355
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
You stupid bitch.

356
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
You stupid idiot.

357
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
So recently.

358
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,440
Anyone got some bones I can have?

359
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,200
Can I have anyone's bones please?

360
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
They're very expensive.

361
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Yep.

362
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Bones.

363
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Bones.

364
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:39,020
So recently, it's come to my attention that a girl I liked thought I was kind of creepy.

365
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:45,200
She still likes me as a friend, but my awkward attempts at courtship just creeped her off.

366
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,040
How do I stop being creepy?

367
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,880
That's from the Chicago Creep Show.

368
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,520
I don't know if that's a typo or not, but I'm really enamored with the phrase creeped

369
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
her off.

370
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Creeped her off.

371
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Creep me clean off.

372
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Listen, I'm creeped off.

373
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,640
I got to be honest with you, I'm creeped off right now.

374
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
Do you know what I think creepiness is?

375
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,280
I think there's a lot of people that are creepy out there, and I see them, and I experience

376
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,440
them, and I experience they're creepy.

377
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,280
I think that it is mostly, no joke, like a lack of confidence.

378
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,200
I think if you're not confident in yourself, that's the creepiest, that's like a straight

379
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
like rocket carted creepy town.

380
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,560
Well, yeah, but you got to watch out because that's like a, you can go over the edge and

381
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,040
then you're into like sleazy.

382
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Yeah.

383
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah, but there's also, but yeah, I think Griffin's right.

384
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,640
I think a lot of creepiness comes from second guessing yourself, where people think of you

385
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,300
as like a creepier or perhaps a weird beard.

386
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:51,440
It's because you're constantly evaluating the situation, your response to it in a way

387
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,320
that people don't feel a connection.

388
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,440
If you connect with people, they're never going to feel like you're a creepster unless

389
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,360
you're like way deep down to the core creepy, creepy cored out.

390
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,720
I think that people are so afraid that they're incapable of making that connection though,

391
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,600
that they go the whole like the mentality of, oh, this is awkward, isn't it?

392
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Like yeah.

393
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,080
Or you do like even worse, like you pass notes and like you just kind of stare at them from

394
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,280
a distance and wave because you're too afraid to just like talk to them.

395
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,680
Like your ineptitude in this region isn't, it's not charming, it is creepy.

396
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,240
It's how you creep people off and you should stop doing that.

397
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
That's how they get creeped off.

398
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,120
Yeah, I think it's just like anything else, right?

399
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,200
Get interested in other people because if you can do that, you're going to be a lot

400
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
less absorbed with how you're coming off in a given situation.

401
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
I think that's where that self-awareness, and that's something that a lot of people

402
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,000
struggle with, even if they aren't necessarily creepy, that sort of being obsessed with your

403
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
self-awareness and your inner critic can make you seem off-putting to people.

404
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,040
Just be careful about putting people on a pedestal and just realize that everybody is

405
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,180
equal and if there's a connection there, you're only going to find it by like talking to them

406
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:13,080
and approaching them and getting to know them, not from a distance.

407
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,440
Also be aware of, some of that creepiness can come from if you get kind of obsessed

408
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,880
with a girl or a boy and spend a little too much time just showing up at their next class

409
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,040
and that kind of thing.

410
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:38,040
It's scarier to face the possibility of just being straight out, shot down.

411
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,720
You walk up and say, hey, I think we should get coffee sometime and they're like, no,

412
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,440
that's scary and so sometimes it's easier to just try to incrementally get to know them

413
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,280
and that's what's creepy.

414
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,880
That's a great point, Trevor.

415
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,440
A lot of that can come from this erosion style of seduction where you're just going to wear

416
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:06,220
the person down through virtue of exposure or time and it's rarely ever effective.

417
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:12,440
What you usually end up doing is wearing down your own charm because it gets a little exasperating

418
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,400
where the person's probably thinking after the second time, who is this person?

419
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,680
They haven't even really introduced themselves to me yet and then pretty soon they're looking

420
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,560
at you as creepy.

421
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,480
I think that this is like anything else, as far as self-improvement is concerned, you're

422
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,440
not going to wake up tomorrow and not be creepy anymore.

423
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,680
All of a sudden you'll wake up one day and realize that you're not creepy anymore.

424
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,900
You won't even be thinking about it by that point, but this isn't like, I have decided

425
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
to no longer be creepy.

426
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
How do you dig out of it then, Trav?

427
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,280
How do you get out of the creepy hole?

428
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,040
I think it's just by making the decision today, like I'm going to be more straightforward,

429
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:03,040
I'm going to be more confident and then don't hold yourself to that standard from day one,

430
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
you know what I mean?

431
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Because that will make you more self-critical.

432
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:15,200
And hey, don't be afraid to change the direction of your affections.

433
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,820
This person thinks you're creepy, it could also just be that they don't know what the

434
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,000
hell they're talking about and you're not a good relationship match for them.

435
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,160
The chemistry is not there.

436
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,520
Don't beat your head against a rock.

437
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,460
If you're not feeling the connection, you're cool too.

438
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,080
And I think creepy is one of those words that can be like a really scary buzzword because

439
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,080
all of a sudden you feel like, oh my God, I've done the exact wrong thing.

440
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,680
It's not like, I don't like him or he's uninteresting.

441
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:50,600
Creepy is like this, oh no, I've ruined it, I'm a terrible person.

442
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,160
Also don't send people pictures of you hugging a body pillow that you photoshopped their

443
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,920
face onto.

444
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
It seems like a great move.

445
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,000
Don't send gift baskets to people's parents to try and get them to like you, to get their

446
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
kids to like you.

447
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,440
To Janet and Richard, congratulations on your 33rd anniversary.

448
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm so very proud of you.

449
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,120
Your daughter is beautiful.

450
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,320
Can I have her in exchange for this basket I need?

451
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:29,280
And hey, barring everything else, you can always pay them.

452
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,560
The only way you can do that, like to say like, no, hold on, creepy bail?

453
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,760
No, it's like a transition.

454
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,040
But like you're paying them to not think you're creepy?

455
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Let me out.

456
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Have you ever seen Can't Buy Me Love?

457
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,320
Let me out of the creepy jail in your mind.

458
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
I want out.

459
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Here's a hundo.

460
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Here's a hundo.

461
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Is this bail?

462
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,880
Is this creepy bail that I'm paying?

463
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,240
And of course, how else can you get your creepy bail together than with a trip to the Money

464
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,120
Zone?

465
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:10,800
You know who's never creepy?

466
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Who?

467
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
John Cusack.

468
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Elite Q Studios.

469
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
No, John Cusack.

470
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,000
No, John Cusack is freely, if there's a guy outside your window with a boombox above his

471
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,760
head, he better look like John Cusack, because he is a humba.

472
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,920
And he better look like 1980s John Cusack.

473
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,160
Yeah, oh yeah, not today's John Cusack, because today's John Cusack is Alan Rickman.

474
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,600
Elite Q Studios is a little group that tries to make cool stuff.

475
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,080
They got web comics, the main one's called Aloof.

476
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,640
They have a podcast about cool freeware games.

477
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:47,680
There's videos, there's articles, there's games, and there's other stuff sometimes.

478
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,400
If you're in the mood for any one of those, and the last one's so general that you cannot

479
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
actually deny that you're in the mood for it.

480
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,880
You're in the mood for any things in the universe ever in the fullness of time.

481
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:11,920
Open your mind to the expanse of infinity and visit eliteqstudios.net, that's O-L-E-E-T-K-U-S-T-U-D-I-O-S.net.

482
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:23,600
You added an extra S on there, O-L-E-E-T-K-U-S-T-U-D-I-O-S.net.

483
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,120
That's great, because now I don't have to do a jingle for them.

484
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Good.

485
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,960
I got another message here for, this is for my man, Chris Flummer.

486
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,480
Most people call him Flum, I call, I stick with Flummer, and his gamer tag is Flumdinger,

487
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
maybe?

488
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,240
The person who sent this to us, Melissa, his girlfriend, is not apparently sure what the

489
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:56,080
Flummerino's gamer tag is, but she thinks, hey Flumminstein, what's your gamer tag?

490
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,280
It could also be Flumdinger, but that makes a lot less sense.

491
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:06,800
It's actually, his gamer tag is all one word, Flummer, starring Robin Williams.

492
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,160
She wants him to know that she loves him, to have a happy B-day.

493
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,960
He doesn't really like to celebrate his B-day, doesn't like anyone to give him a gift, because

494
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,960
he doesn't want to be able to make a big deal, but now's the time to let that pass, because

495
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,560
your girlfriend Melissa's gotten you this beautiful gift.

496
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:34,080
She thinks that she wanted to pay us to tell you that you are Flum-believable, and we hope

497
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,560
you have the very best birthday ever.

498
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,520
Am I actually doing a jingle?

499
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:53,520
So speaking of EliteKuStudios.net, here's a song from my man Griffin.

500
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,280
I think I've done something on capo 5 before, let me drop it down to capo 3 and just like

501
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:07,480
see where the progression takes me.

502
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:15,000
If you want to watch some videos or read some articles or play some games or eat a sandwich

503
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:23,480
or see the face of your newborn baby before it's bored, and if you like planes and cars

504
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,840
and skies and rocket ships and planets and cans and glasses, both the kind that you wear

505
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:39,400
on your face and the kind that you drink out of, if you like speakers and mice, if you

506
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:48,240
like wallets and watches, if you like iron and calcium, if you like all of the things

507
00:30:48,240 --> 00:31:06,000
on the planet, you got to go to EliteKuStudios.org.net, god damn it, I'm definitely going to cut a

508
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,080
verse out of that.

509
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,520
The one thing you can't find at EliteKuStudios.net is the hilarious stylings, the maximum fun

510
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,280
galaxy of stars.

511
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:50,880
Here's one of them a-shinin' now.

512
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,080
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Keenan Williams.

513
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Thank you Keenan.

514
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user InterestingNews who asks, how many farts per day is normal

515
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
amount?

516
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Go on.

517
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:17,800
First off, let me apologize because there's a chance that we were, we made it onto the

518
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:24,120
AV clubs podcast roundup for the first time and one of their action items was that, maybe

519
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,080
not so much fart humor in it.

520
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,600
So Griffin's response.

521
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,840
I'm just going to peel it all, peel all of our fart humor off like a Band-Aid.

522
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Three.

523
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,780
I mean, is this five and a half?

524
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,600
Is this person looking for metric weight of farts?

525
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,640
Yeah, is it like duration or amount?

526
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Because what if you had just like one fart, but it was really, really, really long?

527
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,600
Is that worse or better than 10 tiny ones?

528
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,680
I change my mind about this question.

529
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,720
I don't think it's advisable.

530
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
What's the matter, Justin?

531
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Are you ashamed of your body?

532
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
In closing, four.

533
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,120
Are you ashamed of the body God gave you and the sounds it makes?

534
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,280
Jesus gave you that body.

535
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
It's all natch.

536
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Don't worry.

537
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Jesus gave you farts.

538
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Yeah.

539
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,480
I have to get the devil out.

540
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,680
Farts are an eternal source of comedy as old as history itself.

541
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Oh, yes.

542
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
One.

543
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,160
It's like the Don Rickles of, well, it's just like Don Rickles.

544
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,240
Have you ever seen that painting where God's reaching towards Adam?

545
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Yeah.

546
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,720
He's saying, pull my finger.

547
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
No, Travis.

548
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
What?

549
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
No?

550
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:40,360
Travis just warped through time to be a dorm poster from the seventh century.

551
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,520
See that, sopa?

552
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:49,080
Can we come up- We're not only going to infringe on copyrights, we're going to travel through

553
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,080
time to do it.

554
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,280
Sorry, Orin Hatch.

555
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,400
Suck my dick.

556
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,880
Can we come up with another word for farts?

557
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Because we're going to be saying it a bunch during this question.

558
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Pilates.

559
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Tutoroobs.

560
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,000
I was thinking of something more innocuous.

561
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Flumdingers.

562
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,840
Can we call them- Stinky bumblers.

563
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Can we call them butt songs?

564
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,000
I think Nickelback will sue us for trademark infringement.

565
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,160
You guys don't like bumpy stumblers, huh?

566
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,000
I'll come up with something.

567
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,840
How about broken flutes?

568
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,720
Somebody in the comments wrote, the government's recommended amount is nine farts per day,

569
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:45,280
and that doesn't include any long ones that continued over from the prior day, which is,

570
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,360
let it be known, the first funny thing that I've ever seen on Yahoo Answers.

571
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,560
First intentionally funny thing I've ever seen.

572
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,760
Their source was www.fart.gov, which I did click to investigate, and it's nothing.

573
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,960
It's not a real website, so they got me pretty good there.

574
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,080
I do wish that whenever you clicked that hyperlink, though, it took you to a website that wrote

575
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:18,560
down the names of the people that had tried to access the website.

576
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,880
Or if it was like that cave with the genie in it, and you go into the cave and the genie

577
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,120
leaves, and he's like, I got you.

578
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,520
Only one person has to stay in the cave at all times, and you're here until the next

579
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
person comes in.

580
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
So you have to trick the next person.

581
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,120
It's like the ring.

582
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Is that a thing?

583
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
The ring?

584
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
That's how the ring is.

585
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Yeah.

586
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
Okay.

587
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
So fart.gov.

588
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Someone please set me free.

589
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Please go to fart.gov.

590
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Please.

591
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I need it.

592
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,920
And then sign the petition to turn that into a cabinet post.

593
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
Can we register fart.gov?

594
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,760
You have to be in the gov.

595
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,360
I'm sure that by saying it, that it's already happened somewhere.

596
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Let me check again.

597
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Okay.

598
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
Nope.

599
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Still 404-ed.

600
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Zero.

601
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Guess what?

602
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,360
If you fart, you're a fucking freak, you're nasty.

603
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,240
Nobody should do that.

604
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
That's sin.

605
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
That's sin.

606
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
That's sin slipping out.

607
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,680
It's that sin that you made.

608
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,040
That's why it smells that way, because the brimstone from hell.

609
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,560
So Griffin, your number is zero.

610
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,440
Zero farts per day is the normal amount.

611
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:33,020
I think that if you have four, then you're probably okay.

612
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,440
I think if you have five, then you probably are epileptic.

613
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
I think what's important is not- Wait.

614
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,420
I think if you have six, then you have some form of hepatitis.

615
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,160
This is a new sort of medicine.

616
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
It's a new medicine.

617
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,440
It's like criniology.

618
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,880
I don't need to cut your hand open to see if you have carpal tunnel syndrome.

619
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,360
I just need to know if you fart 11 times a day, because that's your body trying to tell

620
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,240
me on this- That you're pregnant.

621
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Yeah.

622
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,040
You have carpal tunnel and also you're pregnant.

623
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Congratulations.

624
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,200
If you fart 11 times, you have carpal tunnel.

625
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,480
You fart 12 times, then you have lupus.

626
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,840
If you fart 13 times, then someone in Asia loves you very, very much.

627
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,720
If you fart 14 times, you're going to live in a mansion.

628
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,440
If you fart 15 times, you're going to live in a shack.

629
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,520
You're going to marry Bobby Schmidt.

630
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,760
This is the way you tell it.

631
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,680
This is how you tell your future from now on.

632
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,800
I think with all this, I think this is a new field that should be registered at fart.gov.

633
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Yeah.

634
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
A list.

635
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
16 times?

636
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
That's a bad omen.

637
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,200
That's a bad moon rising.

638
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,240
Bad fart.

639
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,680
But 17 times is a good omen, so if you get to 16 and it's like 11.45 PM, start pushing.

640
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,480
Nobody- And the bad omen may end up that you pooped

641
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
your pants.

642
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,080
Maybe what the bad omen was trying to tell you.

643
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,040
By the way, thanks again, the AV Club, for putting us in the podcast roundup, and thanks

644
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,860
for your subtle commentary about how many fart jokes we have.

645
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,400
We turned it around to a big come at me, bro, of fart jokes, apparently.

646
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm sorry we didn't take your advice more seriously.

647
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,960
There's no diagnosis for 18 farts, because nobody on the planet has ever farted 18 times

648
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,720
in one day before.

649
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,640
They just skip right over to 19.

650
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,720
That's why Adele called her album that, because she was so proud.

651
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
She called it 18 farts?

652
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
She called it 19.

653
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,960
Her album was called 19 because of the farts.

654
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,760
I'm not sure about that.

655
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,200
I read about that in Crag.

656
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,480
I'm not sure if it's accurate.

657
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,320
The Starbucks cashier who sold me the album explained that to me, about the farts.

658
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
The thing about the farts.

659
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,400
Yeah, this album's named after how many farts she did.

660
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,920
She did this many farts this year.

661
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
In one day.

662
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
She might have been a goof enough.

663
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:11,800
It was way, way, way more than the normal amount, according to the government.

664
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,760
That song about chasing pavements is about farts.

665
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Think about it.

666
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
We're getting fired of the rain.

667
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Get it?

668
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Think about it.

669
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,600
Hey, I'm a straight, red-blooded American male who, in May, is serving as best man at

670
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,960
my gay best friend's wedding.

671
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,880
Ceremony itself is very traditional, but I'm stumped when it comes to the bachelor

672
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
party.

673
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,140
The attendee mix is going to be about 50-50 straight gay with a few lesbians thrown in

674
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,680
for color.

675
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,160
How do I throw my pal a rainbow-colored bachelor party?

676
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,840
Please note that my friend, by his own admission, is a terrible gay, and he's expressed support

677
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,000
on the one occasion, a desire to have an Asian lady stripper at his party getting down in

678
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Durham.

679
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Wow.

680
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Wowzers.

681
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I feel like the bulk of it's already planned.

682
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
This is a lot.

683
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Asian lady stripper.

684
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,280
I mean, this is a real tough one.

685
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,640
We don't get many toughies like this.

686
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,400
Ultimately, the easy answer, which is to say the not funny answer, is you give him what

687
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,340
he wants, and I guess an Asian lady stripper.

688
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,340
I guess that's what you do.

689
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,340
This is my answer.

690
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,880
The fun answer.

691
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,760
What can't you do at a gay bachelor party?

692
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
This is not a-

693
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Oh my god, you're right.

694
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,320
There's going to be a 50-50 split with some lesbians thrown in for color.

695
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,720
I'm imagining a Caligulin miasma of genital delights.

696
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,200
Just a bacchanal.

697
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Just a-

698
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Yeah.

699
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
What do you want?

700
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,860
Because it's everywhere.

701
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,420
The fucking sky's the limit as far as fucking goes.

702
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,680
Earthly delights.

703
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Put it anywhere.

704
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Happy bachelor party.

705
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,840
Sorry, Dave couldn't marry you.

706
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,040
He died last night.

707
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,160
He OD'd on hedonism.

708
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,640
Now he's a weird sexaholic, and he can only love a gay dead midget's watcher.

709
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:03,160
He was drinking wine out of a lady's hair, and he goes crazy.

710
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,680
He set a pet rock on fire and jerted up a guy named Dave's anus, and now that's the

711
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,680
only way he can finish.

712
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,240
He cut himself on all the harps.

713
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Lacerated himself.

714
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,080
Oh, man.

715
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,240
You know, he-

716
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,640
I think if you get the right Asian lady stripper, then everybody will enjoy it, because you

717
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,840
gotta have one that's high on theater, and is just fun.

718
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,640
You know, like not as much focused on the seduction as they are on the pageantry.

719
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,680
If you get that kind of Asian lady stripper, and maybe a little whimsy, maybe some whimsy

720
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,540
thrown in.

721
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,920
You could just go the traditional route, and just rent out a cabin by a lake, and just

722
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,600
go there with all of his friends with a few beers, and have a classy time, and then everyone

723
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,480
just pops a bunch of ecstasy, and then pees on a beached whale.

724
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,800
See where it goes.

725
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,080
Just see what happens.

726
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,800
I feel like we're- I think this is gonna be a pretty good party, or the last party,

727
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,120
either which way you've done your job.

728
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,120
We all got butthole tattoos!

729
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
And also, he's in prison.

730
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Sorry.

731
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Sorry.

732
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
Sorry.

733
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Hangover three.

734
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,280
It's okay, though, because this butthole tattoo looks like a shark, so no one's gonna get

735
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
near him.

736
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:26,480
Are we done?

737
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,480
Maybe a cake?

738
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
I don't know.

739
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,760
Maybe a tasteful cake?

740
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Some balloons?

741
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Hey!

742
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Welcome to Cake Boss!

743
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,400
This week on Cake Boss, we're making a big cake shaped like a butthole for a gay guy's

744
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,080
bachelor party with an Asian lady stripper gonna pop out of it!

745
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,840
We're making a cake- I hope you're just thinking about it.

746
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,400
This cake looks like a dick going into a cake shaped like a vagina going into a cake shaped

747
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
like another vagina!

748
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Cake Boss!

749
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Cake Boss!

750
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,320
Stay tuned for the littlest chocolatiers, by which I mean they're inside the cake!

751
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
What the fuck?

752
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
What the fuck?

753
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm making eight dicks today!

754
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Cake Boss!

755
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,320
This isn't even for a party!

756
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,560
This isn't even being filmed right now!

757
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,440
This butthole cake's for Cake Boss!

758
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Cake Boss!

759
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
This cake's for-

760
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
What the fuck?

761
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
What the fuck?

762
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,440
What the fuck?

763
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
What the fuck?

764
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
What the fuck?

765
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
What the fuck?

766
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
What the fuck?

767
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
What the fuck?

768
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:40,120
This cake's for- Fucking Cake Boss!

769
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:47,280
This cake's made of sand and also I'm a ghost!

770
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,280
Cake Boss!

771
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,280
Cake Boss!

772
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Cake Ghost!

773
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh Christ!

774
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Cake Boss!

775
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Oh!

776
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,240
I mean you gotta earn the title somehow!

777
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
You gotta dethrone-

778
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,440
So I guess I'm a Cake Boss themed bachelor party.

779
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,200
I guess in closing, that's the only way you can dethrone him, you gotta up his game!

780
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
Gotta beat him in his own game!

781
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,240
You gotta out Cake Boss the Cake Boss!

782
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
Out Cake Boss the Cake-

783
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,800
What was the question?

784
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,940
Hey, so thanks for listening to our stupid show, my brother, my brother and me.

785
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,900
We really appreciate you sticking with us through thick and thin.

786
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,200
That is assuming that you didn't turn it off like ten minutes ago when we were talking

787
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
about farts.

788
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,740
Not that anybody could blame you.

789
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:35,820
You gotta make it through the swamp of farts to get to those good, good Cake Boss goops.

790
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:42,940
Thank you to everybody who tweeted about the show this week with the NBNBM hashtag.

791
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:51,720
Thank you to Good Writer, that's with a R-I-G-H-T-E-R, thanks to Crystal Whalen for tweeting about

792
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:58,020
the show, The Jake of Ink, thanks to Botherer, make sure you check out his show, Rumdoings

793
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,460
or his site Rock, Paper, Shotgun.

794
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,680
He's always been super supportive of us and we certainly appreciate it.

795
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:12,760
Jinxville, The Triscuit, our buddy, Tristan the Marine, Mason Your Face, everybody.

796
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:20,180
If I may, I would like to ask you, our listeners, our friends, for a favor.

797
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,940
The theater that I work for is competing in a contest to win us a new set of lights, which

798
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,060
we desperately need, and so we would really appreciate your support.

799
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,820
I'm gonna put a link on Twitter after the show goes up, and there's also gonna be a

800
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:41,980
link on the MaximumFun.org webpage, and probably also on Facebook too, so if you could go and

801
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,540
vote for our lighting video.

802
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,320
It's also a really funny video, and I'd really appreciate it.

803
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
I wanna thank-

804
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Well then we're-

805
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
So, sorry, go ahead.

806
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
No, let's all do that.

807
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,820
I was just gonna say everybody do that.

808
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,820
Everybody do that.

809
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,820
You have my permission.

810
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,060
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Longwinners for the use of the theme song to our podcast,

811
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,280
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

812
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,940
It's so fucking good, and you should buy the album, and then all their albums.

813
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,860
Yeah, someone else just bought it.

814
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,940
And again, just now.

815
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,460
People are buying it all the time.

816
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
That one was John Roderick.

817
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,460
He bought it himself.

818
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,460
Oh, no, there's another guy.

819
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,460
Okay.

820
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,460
Named also John Roderick.

821
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
You wanna close it?

822
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,460
Yeah.

823
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,740
Do you get our email address?

824
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:33,500
It's nbnbm at MaximumFun.org, and also check out Bullseye, it used to be called The Sound

825
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
of Young America.

826
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
We're on it sometimes.

827
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,700
It's also at MaximumFun.org, and PRI, and a bunch of other places.

828
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,940
Oh, and start podcasting yourself, just hit their 200th episode, so make sure you check

829
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,940
that if you haven't already.

830
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,940
Yeah, congratulations to those guys.

831
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,940
We're approaching our 100th, aren't we?

832
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,940
Yeah.

833
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,940
Yeah, we're...

834
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,940
And then we'll stop forever.

835
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,940
Bye, everyone.

836
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,940
That was a good one.

837
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:57,940
This final Yahoo was sent in by Keenan Williams also.

838
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,220
Quickly becoming a gold status contributor.
