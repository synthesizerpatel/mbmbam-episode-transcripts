1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,160
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,320
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,720
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:05,440
Um, McElroy. A little bit of lag. You did get me on that. You got me on that one.

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,400
Ah, thanks.

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,440
You did get me on that one. So I wanted to start,

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
you know, I hate to do it, but I gotta start a little political.

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
Aw, man. Again, Justin?

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
Did you say buh-litical?

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,160
And then to eat some bas-ketty.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,320
Time for ball-o-ticks.

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,480
Thanks. So I did a tweet.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,840
There's your first mistake.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,560
I did a tweet, um, cause I wanted, cause a question, I had like a hypothetical question,

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,960
and I needed answers, right? And so I put this hypothetical out to the internet,

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:47,040
and it received, before voting closed, 34,913 replies.

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,360
Oh wow.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,120
And I want to dig into this, and it got so much of a response, I wanted to dig into this question

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,600
with you guys, and really talk through some of the data, if that's okay.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,520
Did you get ratioed, as the teens say?

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
I don't think so. I don't think it's a ratio.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,400
Teens are fucking wild about fractions, I guess, and I'm just stoked.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,960
People are always talking about like, it's just phones, phones, phones, phones,

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,040
but they're out here talking about ratios and Pythagoras.

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
I thought it was radio like patio.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,160
Okay.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,720
All right.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
So here's the tweet.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,480
Okay.

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,200
That's the tweet.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
Here's the tweet.

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,600
I got a new hypothetical that's going to sweep the nation,

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,000
and add some sparkle to your next Zoom happy hour.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
And here's it, and I want to pose it to you, my brothers.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,960
If you could, consequence free,

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
spank Donald J. Trump, right on his behind, on national TV,

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,400
would you do it, please think, before answering.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
If you're about to start talking, I know you haven't thought about it.

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,680
No, I have, bare ass, question mark.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,720
Bare ass, bare hand, skin to skin, contact is so important.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
This is data.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:06,560
I can't, I can't shift the parameters of the question for you.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
This is the question that is put before you.

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,440
You do not have more information than this.

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
Any God-fearing American trap, I think, is thinking about bare ass, bare hand.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
I don't think there's anybody who thought about spanking this gentleman with his pants on,

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,080
not for the stuff he's accomplished.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
No, sir, you do deserve a bare ass spanking.

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,840
You know what, let me say this.

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,960
I'll, you know what, I will, I will, since we're outside the,

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,640
let me give you this data.

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:32,960
Okay.

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,240
With that, with that data, okay, before we drill down onto your personal responses,

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,280
with that data, the internet said,

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,480
44% of internet respondents said, okay.

60
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
Oh.

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,800
56% of internet respondents said, no, thanks.

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,040
So that's where, that data, that's the data.

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
And I don't know if people thought about it enough,

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,920
because a lot of people were like,

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,400
I think I'd catch some sort of slime disease from his butt.

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,040
It's like, that's all very funny, but I'm trying to, I'm trying to do research,

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,400
and that's probably not gonna happen.

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Is it funny?

69
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
Is it funny?

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,080
It's not that long ago that this gentleman did have the corona.

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
And if I said gentleman, I meant scoundrel.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Here's what I will say.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,920
I got a big old flat hand.

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,560
Oh God.

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,240
And I believe I could deliver a spanking as such

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,600
that it would go beyond embarrassing if I really put my full torque into it.

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,920
Right.

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,080
Into potentially damaging.

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
Okay, you can't, this is important,

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,720
because if the spank damages the body of the man that is the president of the country,

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,680
then we are getting into some, let's call it, questionable legal territory.

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
Okay, now hold on, Justin.

83
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,760
I, you didn't give further details.

84
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,240
So I was assuming in this scenario, this is a purely consensual thing

85
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
where Donald J. Trump-

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,920
It's not consensual.

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,960
Then I wouldn't do it.

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
There just won't be repercussions.

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
Then it, then I, okay.

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,840
Then there's not going to be repercussions.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,600
Listen, he's not gonna-

92
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
No, you asked the question and now you're not listening to me, sir.

93
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

94
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
I did not, I did not.

95
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,640
The energy is just so bad.

96
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,800
This is still my time, sir, if I may.

97
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,080
I have to assume he is in some kind of stocks scenario.

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,280
And this has like been his preordained punishment.

99
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
And someone said, do you wanna like go to prison or get a spanking?

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,920
And he was like, oh, of course the spanking.

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,800
And here I come with my big old, like two by nine of a hand or whatever.

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,640
Gonna fucking panini that ass.

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,680
Yeah, and I come in there and he's like, I wish I had picked jail.

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
This is what I'm saying is I think I could deliver-

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,640
Cause my butt's a manhole cover now.

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes, I think I could flatten him in such a way to make his butt concave.

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,160
Fucking Everlong over here just smashed my ass out of the galaxy.

108
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,600
I think that it would seem like a better alternative for him

109
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,040
than whatever other punishment.

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,240
But then here I come in and shatter his coccyx.

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:22,240
But I don't think, I don't wanna do it if it is the only repercussion

112
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,560
that he gets for his, again, many, many bad accomplishments.

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
Because that feels like letting him off lightly.

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,760
And I also don't know if that is gonna be the punishment,

115
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,640
if I should be the one to do it.

116
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,640
I can think of many more people who have been more severely affected

117
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,160
by his administration than myself.

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
And so I would, if given the opportunity,

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
I would almost certainly hand it down to somebody more deserving.

120
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Well, okay, you don't have that opportunity.

121
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,520
You literally just have the president bent over and everyone,

122
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,560
and like the nation is watching, the cameras are on.

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,960
The secret service is like, we don't enjoy him.

124
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,600
We'll give you one.

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,440
They turn away for like a little bit.

126
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Right, exactly.

127
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,480
Blind eye, no repercussions.

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,640
And like, here's what I would like to say

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,800
that I don't think he does see it coming.

130
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
I think he bent over to pick up a dime.

131
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
And his pants fell down?

132
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,840
And his pants fell down and there's his butt?

133
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
See, I never, this is what's interesting.

134
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,800
Author intent, I never anticipated bare ass.

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,600
Well then no, see, if it's not bare ass, Justin, it's not embarrassing.

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,040
Now I'm just a weirdo who ran up and spanked someone.

137
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,640
That's such a wild thing to say,

138
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,000
because the nation would have the visual of him getting spanked.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,440
But if it's his bare bottom, it's like he's a big baby

140
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
and I'm spanking his big baby bottom.

141
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
But if he's betrousered,

142
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
then it doesn't have the same visual effect, Justin.

143
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,360
Are we talking about hitting the president?

144
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,280
No, that's why it has to be a spanking.

145
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,920
And it can't be throughout his injurious spanking.

146
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,320
The spank is a fucking hit, dog.

147
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,400
The three of us hold the same opinions vis-a-vis spanking

148
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,120
as being a pretty heinous thing and it is hitting.

149
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,760
So we are talking about doing a hit on the president.

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,600
There are two categories of spanking.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,520
There is consensual spanking,

152
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,560
betwixt partners who enjoy spanking one another or multiples.

153
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
And then there is injurious spanking,

154
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
where you are striking another human being

155
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,360
with the flat of your open hand.

156
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,200
Now, which one is it that we're talking about here, Justin?

157
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Sensual spanking or injurious spanking?

158
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,280
I did say, now, if I could drill in on the language of the question,

159
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,200
if you could consequence-free,

160
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
I feel like injury would be a consequence.

161
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
Not to me.

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
I didn't say that.

163
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
Didn't say that.

164
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,320
Didn't say consequence-free to you.

165
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
It's a consequence-free period to you and the spanky

166
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
who is the president of the United States of America,

167
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,960
our 45th Donald J. Trump.

168
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,640
Justin, that's absolutely bullshit.

169
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
That's wild, yeah.

170
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,800
Because now I am having a neutral impact.

171
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,520
It means I am so lightly touching his bottom

172
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,560
that he might derive neither pain nor pleasure.

173
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
Or in fact, it sounds like lasting effect of any kind.

174
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
There's a causal sort of relationship

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,240
between Travis's huge, huge ape hand swinging low

176
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
like a big golf driver into our American president's butt.

177
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,200
And he will feel it.

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,160
If not, then it's like Travis is a ghost.

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,480
Unless Justin is describing an Adam Sandler-esque scenario

180
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,960
in which he went down to pick up some kind of diamond

181
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,080
and I'm standing behind him pretending to smack that ass.

182
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
No.

183
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
It's more humiliating than that.

184
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,680
Then he's gonna feel it.

185
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
He's gonna feel it.

186
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
I didn't say he wouldn't feel it.

187
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,280
I said he wouldn't be injured.

188
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,200
There wouldn't be a permanent butt injury.

189
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,840
Because if I say, would you like to injure the president?

190
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,440
Everybody on earth would say absolutely.

191
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
I would love that.

192
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,080
But that's not what I'm talking about.

193
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm talking about giving the president a big old spank

194
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
right on his bottom as hard as you can, as hard as I can.

195
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
You just said the words as hard as I can.

196
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,520
It's gonna be bad for Travis to do it.

197
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,800
I did just want to say real quick

198
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
that I did mention ghosts, but ghosts are famously

199
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,080
against spanking because they just don't stand

200
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,920
for corporeal punishment.

201
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,640
Would you?

202
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,360
Wait, stop.

203
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,160
Oh, boy.

204
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,200
Oh, boy.

205
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
Yes, I do think so, Griffin.

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,720
I think, what are you guys making this data?

207
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,440
56% of respondents would pass on the opportunity

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
to spank the president.

209
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,640
I will say, until I landed on, I want to hurt him

210
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
with my strike.

211
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,160
Then my first thought was, I do not want to be

212
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
in the same room a lot of that energy, yes.

213
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,860
Yeah.

214
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
Yeah, I don't want to touch his bad butt.

215
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm thinking it's not, I'm not gonna body shame anybody,

216
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,360
but it's not high on the list for me.

217
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,160
You know what I mean?

218
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,080
I actually also took a poll on Twitter on the 18th.

219
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,680
I asked, irony aside, where are we at on The Greatest Showman?

220
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,760
The Greatest Showman, and I got 11,000 responses.

221
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,260
Okay.

222
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,080
Do you guys want to guess, like, yay or nay,

223
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
what the percentages were?

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
It's got to be, I'm gonna say 70% yay,

225
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,840
because America still has a heart.

226
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,240
They have, or the globe, I guess, in this case,

227
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,800
has a heart.

228
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
They got a pulse.

229
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,480
They're loving it.

230
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,280
What about you, Griff?

231
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah, I haven't seen the film because it seems so bad.

232
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
It was almost completely split down the middle.

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,640
52% yes, 48% no.

234
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,280
Incorrect.

235
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,600
So more people enjoy, unironically, The Greatest Showman

236
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,840
than want to strike the president's bottom.

237
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,760
Yeah, I got a Twitter poll out there, and it says,

238
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,640
bye guys, I'm off to see Deadpool 2 in theaters

239
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,200
because it has been so long since I did a tweet.

240
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,280
So if anyone ever asks you what is a perfectly average neutral movie,

241
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,320
it's The Greatest Showman.

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
It almost perfectly cancels out.

243
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
Half the people do not like it.

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
Half the people like it.

245
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
Greatest Showman, right down the middle.

246
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,680
That actually was the tagline of Greatest Showman,

247
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,560
right down the middle.

248
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,000
That wasn't really germane to my intro.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think you just wanted to change the subject.

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,480
I did.

251
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,600
I was sick of talking about either attacking the American president.

252
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
Can I just get a yay or nay real quick?

253
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,360
Given the opportunity, the consequence-free,

254
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
with the American people watching,

255
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,280
is that in the text of the tweet, Justin,

256
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,240
the American people watching?

257
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
It's on national TV.

258
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
But America has the right to tune in.

259
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
This is a huge opportunity then,

260
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
because I'll get on there and whatever,

261
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,920
spank his ass or his bad ass or whatever.

262
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,520
And then when I'm doing it, I could be like,

263
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,200
and here's the link to my mixtape.

264
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,320
And I can say it out loud.

265
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,120
Yeah, check out my sound file.

266
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
My brother, my brother and me,

267
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
go check it at McElroyFamily.com.

268
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
Check out my shows.

269
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
Should be good for our iTunes reviews.

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
Should be a good journey we'd go on as a result of that.

271
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,600
Negative three stars.

272
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,720
I'm not gonna listen to this.

273
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,200
Dr. Skinhead 420XX says it shows snowflake garbage.

274
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
Justin, I kind of feel like I already did smack Donald Trump's ass

275
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,440
because I voted for Joe Biden early,

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
which I recommend everybody do.

277
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
I mean, you can do that.

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,480
But there's only one spank, you know what I mean?

279
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
You only have one spank opportunity.

280
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
I was trying to take whatever this has been

281
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,320
and spin it in some kind of thing.

282
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
Vote for Joe Biden early.

283
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,280
It's gonna be fucking crazy on voting day.

284
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
Get your shit in now.

285
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,840
Go in now.

286
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,520
Vote for Joe Biden.

287
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,720
Don't hit people.

288
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Spanking doesn't help raise children.

289
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
But if I had the opportunity, yes, Justin,

290
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,080
I would smack that ass.

291
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,140
Okay.

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,880
I would give just Gordon Bynes tight little keister a go.

293
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
That's in no way German.

294
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,800
That would be a smack, but that would be a spank of pleasure.

295
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
Yeah, no, that's just like a little good game, bud.

296
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
Good going, bud.

297
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
Way to get elected president, bud.

298
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,080
Good going, bud.

299
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Let's tighten up those policies just a bit, bud.

300
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
Let me nudge them.

301
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,520
You don't need to do the fracking if you think about it.

302
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,880
There's room to improve, bud.

303
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
I'm gonna tap your left butt cheek, Joe.

304
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,080
That tight left butt.

305
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,440
You follow that tap.

306
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,520
Just to let you know that that's the direction.

307
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,960
You should maybe angle it towards it, Joey.

308
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,680
Hey, maybe a single spanker healthcare.

309
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,800
I mean, yeah, that's right, Justin.

310
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,440
Yeah.

311
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,760
Yeah.

312
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,400
Okay.

313
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,000
So this is a advice show that runs a little bit political.

314
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
Well, we are not gonna have an episode next week,

315
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
the week of the election.

316
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,080
So we got to get all that shit out of our system now.

317
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,560
There you go.

318
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
Go vote for Joe Biden.

319
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,720
And if you care about anything, and you can.

320
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
Like, obviously, if you're in England, you don't need it.

321
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,520
So, I mean, I get it.

322
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,320
So.

323
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,120
Oh, man, we could have talked about Borat.

324
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,920
Fuck.

325
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,160
Fuck.

326
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,240
Yeah, that sucks.

327
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,400
Because Borat's like, it's funny.

328
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,800
It's funny how Borat, by making him relevant again,

329
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,960
made him irrelevant to us.

330
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,600
Yeah, he does.

331
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,160
But making Borat relevant is now irrelevant

332
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,200
from a comedy perspective.

333
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,480
Justin, can you give us a 21 my wife salute?

334
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,520
Just to see that phrase off your soundboard.

335
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,320
Yeah.

336
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,800
Just play that.

337
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,200
My wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife, my wife.

338
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,000
It's not 21.

339
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,760
That's six.

340
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,320
That's six.

341
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,640
We'll do 15 more throughout the show, I'm sure.

342
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,280
Okay.

343
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm gonna miss it.

344
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
It's just not funny no more.

345
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
It's not funny anymore.

346
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,120
Yeah.

347
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
It's not funny anymore.

348
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
God, I hope they don't reboot Frasier.

349
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,400
Please don't take that away from us.

350
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,280
Please.

351
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,600
Like, I know we've said AP4 and we would get there day one

352
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,040
in theaters, but please don't.

353
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,840
Please, Mike, don't get AP4 in theaters.

354
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,560
Please, bud.

355
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,360
This is an advice show.

356
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,440
And now it's time to answer a question.

357
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
The office I work at is having a Halloween party

358
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,160
with a costume contest.

359
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,880
Nice.

360
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,760
Prizes for said contest are first place gets a month's paid rent.

361
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,000
What?

362
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
Second place gets a paid vacation anywhere

363
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
in the continental United States.

364
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,400
What the fuck?

365
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,840
Third place is you're fired.

366
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,760
Weirdly, every place after third place is just no prize.

367
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,080
But if you get, for whatever reason, second runner up,

368
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,760
hit the fucking bricks, dude.

369
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
Now, I don't mean to brag, but I've had some luck

370
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,760
with costume contests in the past

371
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,520
and I have confidence that I could win.

372
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,040
However, I do not live in a place that charges rent

373
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,640
and I'd really love a vacation.

374
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,760
Oh, my God.

375
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,680
Brothers, what costume should I wear

376
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,240
to guarantee second place?

377
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,680
That's from haphazardlyhappyhalloween in Houston.

378
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,960
This is an amazing, amazing, amazing question.

379
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,200
That's really so friggin' difficult.

380
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,760
This feels like a fucking Taskmaster challenge.

381
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,080
Yeah.

382
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
Yeah, because there's a worry here

383
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
that if you underplay it too much,

384
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,080
you don't play second, right?

385
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,680
Like, yeah.

386
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah.

387
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,560
Okay, here's where my gut is at.

388
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,000
If there's somebody in the office

389
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,160
who is going to do something very intricate

390
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,680
and very technical, but maybe not the most creative thing,

391
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
but they would feel guilty not giving them first place,

392
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,640
then you need to clock in just below that.

393
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,240
So maybe you do a really funny, clever costume,

394
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
but not one that is necessarily

395
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
technically artistically proficient.

396
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
I was thinking the same thing,

397
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,480
but here's the trick with that, Griffin,

398
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,520
is if the joke ends up landing too well,

399
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
now you're a crowd favorite

400
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,840
and it's like, well, it's not as good technically,

401
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
but it's bringing the most joy to everybody.

402
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,560
I think we know who the winner is.

403
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,680
Well, then you flip it, right?

404
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,640
Then you do the other one.

405
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
You just gotta know your office

406
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
and know are they gonna reward creativity

407
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
or are they gonna reward the fact

408
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
that you dressed up like fucking Kim Bone again

409
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,760
for the fourth year in a row?

410
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,600
Man, I hope they know it.

411
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,800
You could go as the fly on Pence's hair, right?

412
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,300
Funny!

413
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,320
Funny!

414
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
I'll see, but right there,

415
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,200
that reaction from you guys

416
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
trumps Jerry's photorealistic Transformers outfit.

417
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,120
Okay, all right, here's what I got for you.

419
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,360
Okay.

420
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,880
Okay, you need to create

421
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,600
an incredibly accurate, detailed costume.

422
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,160
Okay.

423
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,040
I'm gonna choose for this example, Captain Jack Sparrow.

424
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,600
So you do the perfect Captain Jack Sparrow look, right?

425
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,680
And then you go into the office the night before

426
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
and you sleep in the bathroom.

427
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,920
Okay.

428
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,680
Okay, when people come in,

429
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,800
they're gonna change into their costume in the bathroom, right?

430
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
And I need you to keep an eye on...

431
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,480
Them in the bathroom, Justin?

432
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,040
What?

433
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,800
Them in the bathroom, is that what you're saying?

434
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,840
Keep an eye on people coming and going from the bathroom.

435
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,400
Okay.

436
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
When you see the person who has the best costume,

437
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,840
it won't be as richly detailed

438
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,480
as your Captain Jack Sparrow costume, of course.

439
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
That's important.

440
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,520
They can't naturally beat you.

441
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,200
But then you can start to remove items from your costume

442
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,520
to get you so right.

443
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,560
So like, maybe you just are gonna remove

444
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,240
a few of the beads from your hair.

445
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,360
You know, maybe you're gonna get the red band...

446
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
You'll leave the tricorner,

447
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,600
but you won't have that distinctive red bandana

448
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,880
under the tricorner.

449
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,680
You see what I'm saying?

450
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,040
Yes.

451
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,720
Your eyeliner.

452
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,600
Get rid of the eyeliner.

453
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,400
No, please don't.

454
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,600
You can't lose the eyeliner or I'll just be a pirate, Justin.

455
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,480
It's just a bad office.

456
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,320
I mean, like, if you have to lose the eyeliner,

457
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,760
it's a bad office that you work in.

458
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
And you should probably, honestly,

459
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,600
your real answer is you need to find a new job.

460
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

461
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,960
If no one can beat...

462
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
If you have to take off the eyeliner,

463
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,960
like, what are they bringing to this?

464
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,440
You know?

465
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
Like, what are they even doing?

466
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,800
Now, what you could also do

467
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,360
is the day before the party,

468
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,280
start talking about what a rough time Jerry's having.

469
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,240
Yes, yes.

470
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,280
Like, just spread around.

471
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,040
Jerry's having a hard time.

472
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,440
You know, he just hasn't been clicking for Jerry lately.

473
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,920
And then when the contest comes,

474
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,640
just keep, like, pointing at Jerry

475
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
and nodding to everybody, right?

476
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,560
Yeah.

477
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Or even better, if you win.

478
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,120
Yes.

479
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
Then you're just like, no.

480
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,720
Yes.

481
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,160
I'll take second.

482
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,600
Jerry needs this.

483
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,880
Look at that very funny...

484
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
Look at Jerry's funny Kim Bone costume.

485
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
He's got the red sweater.

486
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,960
You know what kind of year he's having?

487
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
Let's hear it for our first responders.

488
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,560
Jerry, what?

489
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,760
Wait, what did you say?

490
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,800
Let's hear it for our frontline workers.

491
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Jerry's not...

492
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,360
This is a fucking Staples.

493
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,240
No, Jerry.

494
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,520
Yeah, what are you talking about?

495
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
Jerry unloads the truck.

496
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,360
Yeah, but I think we all know that of everyone on Earth,

497
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,600
this year has been hardest on Jerry.

498
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
Now, I'm gonna challenge your suggestion

499
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,800
that Staples employees are not essential workers.

500
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,160
But now more than ever, we're working out of the home

501
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,000
and we need mice.

502
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,520
We need floor mats.

503
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
We need post-it notes.

504
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
I don't even know what toner does,

505
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,040
but I don't wanna work without it.

506
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I wanna say thank you to our Staples employees.

507
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,480
Office, Max, Office Depot, fuck off.

508
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm going to Staples.

509
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:43,840
That's right.

510
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,280
Now, sorry.

511
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,560
I liked that Staples started with one product

512
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,320
and expanded from there.

513
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:50,800
It's bold.

514
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm just saying that

515
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,200
because we don't have a Staples in Huntington.

516
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,040
Oh, you poor bastards.

517
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,560
I know, I know.

518
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm still team, hashtag RadioShack.

519
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,720
Yeah, we're coming back.

520
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,520
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

521
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,960
There's a RadioShack next to the Long John Silver's

522
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,840
on 5th Avenue.

523
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,400
You guys know?

524
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,640
What?

525
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
Down there, Huntington East.

526
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,320
Yes.

527
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
Right near the Magic Walk.

528
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
I bought some exotic batteries from there once.

529
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, now both the Long John Silver's

530
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,440
and the RadioShack close

531
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,000
and it's just two abandoned fossils

532
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
right next to each other.

533
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,000
It's really a sad.

534
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
You think they're gonna combine,

535
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,080
lift each other up.

536
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,760
That's what I was gonna say is,

537
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,640
do you think they could have,

538
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,160
if they had just made it work,

539
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,200
like, please.

540
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
See, if Long John Silver's

541
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
had had any fucking foresight,

542
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,760
they would have been like,

543
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
listen, man, I know you're going through a hard time,

544
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
you can crash at our building,

545
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,000
just go to the back

546
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,960
and there's a little RadioShack.

547
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,600
Come on down to Long Radio John Shack

548
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
and we are gonna treat you to batteries and cod.

549
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,640
Deep fried batteries, six for $4.

550
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,840
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

551
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,920
Griffin, you know fish at Long John Silver's

552
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
is not of any discernible species.

553
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
Yeah, come get this chopped,

554
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
reconstituted fish product

555
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
and get some free loose wires.

556
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,240
No, no, I forgot that.

557
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,920
This is gonna feel like a Munch Squad,

558
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
but Long John Silver's, I've noticed,

559
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
has been trying,

560
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,800
I drive past their sign,

561
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,520
the one on Route 60

562
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,720
when I'm going to the liquor store,

563
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,800
and they've been trying increasingly

564
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,200
like highfalutin

565
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
seafood meals.

566
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,440
And the funny thing about it is

567
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,680
the more they aspire,

568
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,400
the more repellent it is.

569
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,680
Like the harder they go,

570
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
the less appetizing it is.

571
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,280
Like when they're like,

572
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,480
we got a lobster roll now.

573
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
Like I don't think you actually do.

574
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
I don't think I will be doing that

575
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
with you right now.

576
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
This is the worst part.

577
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,640
On this show,

578
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
every time we talk about

579
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,040
any kind of fast food,

580
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,840
I want it so bad now.

581
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,680
I would crush some Long John Silver's.

582
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,120
Y'all are acting above your raise

583
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,560
and fucking Long John Silver's

584
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,640
used to be a special fucking treat

585
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,160
for us on our way to church.

586
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,080
Most of the time we get the Taco Bell,

587
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,600
but then like, you know,

588
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,560
when we did good,

589
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,840
Grey's on our report card,

590
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
we take it to Long John Silver's,

591
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,840
get some free crispy stripums.

592
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,480
Sometimes mom would let me,

593
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
once I discovered that I could order

594
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,440
a side of Crunchies,

595
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
she would do it

596
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
and then be disgusted with me,

597
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,200
which I used to love.

598
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
Justin, you say Crunchies.

599
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,000
Do you mean the little bits and bobs

600
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,760
of batter that just floated around

601
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,040
in the oil for a long time?

602
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,840
Batter bobs.

603
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
Batter bobs, Crunchies.

604
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,560
I mean, whatever you call them,

605
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
you can order a side of them.

606
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,520
They don't give a fuck.

607
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,200
Come on down to Long Radio, John Shaq.

608
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,680
We got batter bobs and batteries.

609
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,280
Do you guys want a Yahoo, please?

610
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,600
Yeah, I'd love that.

611
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
Sent by Graham Roebuck, thank you.

612
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,040
It's a Yahoo user who is anonymous

613
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,320
because they're afraid of me.

614
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,240
But I'm going to call them.

615
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,480
Davis asks,

616
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,400
I feel like I use that fucking name a lot, huh?

617
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,040
If humans had beaks instead of noses,

618
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
would we still kiss?

619
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,640
Okay, so kissing is weird, right?

620
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,600
If you think about it.

621
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,320
Are you saying that or is Davis saying that?

622
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Davis is saying that.

623
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,560
I would never say that.

624
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
You know I love to kiss.

625
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,520
Yes, I do.

626
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
But we do it and we like it.

627
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
But would we, even if we had beaks,

628
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,040
how would we kiss then?

629
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
Why don't birds kiss?

630
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,840
How do you fucking know they don't, Davis?

631
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,160
Yeah.

632
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,240
Maybe they're just not into PDAs.

633
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
Maybe birds wait until they're at home in private

634
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,800
to do the bird smooching.

635
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,440
And they make up for lost time if you know

636
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,960
while I'm playing.

637
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Yeah, maybe birds just don't like foreplay.

638
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
Maybe just like across the board,

639
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,600
all birds are like, listen, if we're smooching,

640
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,720
we could be boning.

641
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,600
Yeah.

642
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,480
We have hollow bones and we only live for like six days

643
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,960
or whatever.

644
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,920
Travis doesn't know.

645
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,040
Wow, they don't live as long as we do.

646
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,760
Certainly not.

647
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,320
Yeah, so six days is a pretty good estimate,

648
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,160
I think, of their age.

649
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,800
My point is that we as human beings could live upwards

650
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
of, I believe, 112 years.

651
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,480
That's what I'm aiming for.

652
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,160
And so we look at every other animal's habits

653
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,320
through that lens and we're like, why aren't they?

654
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,640
Blah, blah, blah.

655
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,040
And it's like, well, you know, that bird is like,

656
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,560
I don't have time for kissing.

657
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,080
Are you kidding me?

658
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,920
I got 10 years, dude.

659
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,640
That's possible.

660
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,760
So there's a thing in this question

661
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,680
I didn't notice until just now.

662
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,960
I didn't notice until just now.

663
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,880
And this is the question.

664
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,240
If humans had beaks instead of noses, would we still kiss?

665
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Does this presuppose that we would still have our mouths?

666
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,760
But then instead of our nose, we would have a beak there?

667
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,680
So we'd have a sort of mouth stack?

668
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,360
I simply can't believe that that's true, Griffin,

669
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,280
because that crosses into a level of horror

670
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,920
that I believe goes beyond like logistically,

671
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,600
like, could we still kiss?

672
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,840
But then again, it does say, would we still kiss?

673
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,040
Okay, but yes, listen, this is Halloween, baby.

674
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,440
Ooh, you could do a kiss with both your mouths

675
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,360
at the same time, or there would probably be people

676
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,880
who would want to flip it upside down,

677
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,120
do a little mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth,

678
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,960
sort of 69 situation, person on bird on person on bird.

679
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
It's just called 11s at that point.

680
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,000
It's they do 11s with the bird mouths.

681
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,960
I feel like that would be bad

682
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,360
because your bird mouth would have to eat worms.

683
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,080
Well, let me put it this way, Griffin.

684
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,920
Let me add another layer to this question.

685
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,280
What if you replaced human beings noses with beaks,

686
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,920
but beaks that they were not in control of,

687
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,120
would you still kiss?

688
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,280
Oh, so like I would go in and be like,

689
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,240
do you, Griffin, you may now kiss the bride.

690
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:44,560
Like I had no control over, please, this is my special day.

691
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Please calm down, beak nose.

692
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,880
But then that's wild because the whole audience

693
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,560
for my rad wedding would just be like,

694
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,960
you wouldn't go, you'd be able to go anywhere.

695
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,640
Well, okay, you can also fly.

696
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,320
Ooh.

697
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,160
This is, no, you can't fly.

698
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,840
Well, there has to be some benefit.

699
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,200
That's what this, you can't say-

700
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
No more stinky smells.

701
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
Yeah, but no more pleasant smells either, Griffin.

702
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,880
You heard what I said about 69 with the bird mouths, right?

703
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,680
Yeah, that's very good.

704
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,440
That was very good.

705
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,400
I think you might've missed that.

706
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,760
And you could access grubs and stuff hidden inside of bark.

707
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,280
I would appreciate that.

708
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,320
Then let's just, let's return to the pleasant,

709
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,920
less problematic waters of just one big bird mouth.

710
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,360
You're a fucking, you're falco.

711
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,320
You got a Baldwin, you got an Alec Baldwin from Beetlejuice.

712
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,920
No, no, no, no, no.

713
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,600
No, no, what?

714
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,640
When I'm talking about a beak,

715
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,480
you're imagining like a fucking crocodile maw

716
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
that's like a foot and a half long.

717
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,560
No, I'm-

718
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,400
You're at like Zubeli Zoo territory.

719
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah, that's no good.

720
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,920
Oh, like a cute, we're talking like a chickadee's beak

721
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,320
and not like a pelican or something.

722
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,840
Yeah, right, what you just said.

723
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
Do you think we would still be like into kissing?

724
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,560
I don't think so.

725
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,240
I think we like the sort of pliability of mouth.

726
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,400
Oh, I mean, yes.

727
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,600
But I think that you couldn't make this decision

728
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,960
for everyone all at once.

729
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,400
Because I think that there will be people

730
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
who would be way into like,

731
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,600
I can open my mouth and kiss you like three times as deep now.

732
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,840
It's like a handshake at this point.

733
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,600
We're getting in there so deep.

734
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
But I don't think that's gonna be the goal

735
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,160
when you do your beak kisses.

736
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,720
When you see birds doing that to each other, Travis,

737
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,040
that's probably a sort of regurgitation situation.

738
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,080
Well, I mean, then that seems like two benefits, Griffin.

739
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
I wouldn't want that, I don't think.

740
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,680
Hey, could I take you out for dinner?

741
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,640
I just met you.

742
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,520
I just, yeah.

743
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,400
It's hard for me to get past the fact

744
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
that I don't wanna kiss a big bird.

745
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,480
You don't wanna kiss a big bird?

746
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm thinking about that with my human brain,

747
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,400
which is attached to my fleshy mouth, right?

748
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,880
Yeah, now assume big bird has grown up and gotten a job.

749
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,520
Perhaps big bird works, let's see.

750
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,920
Give me the name of someplace someone would work.

751
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,320
Griffin.

752
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,320
No, I'm not gonna take a part in any of this.

753
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,680
You don't want big bird to get a job?

754
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,840
You want big bird to be unemployed in this economy?

755
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Big bird would be sweet as a big bird,

756
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,960
got to be a pilot.

757
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,640
And then air traffic control would be like,

758
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,800
oh, big bird, go ahead and bring it in at that.

759
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,560
And he's like, you don't tell me what to do.

760
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm a lord of the skies.

761
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
You're gonna tell me how to fly?

762
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,000
Shut up.

763
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,560
Then he'd turn the radio off and just do his own thing.

764
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,160
Okay, so big bird has just gotten back from a turnaround trip,

765
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,400
flew from Cincinnati to LA and then back.

766
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,600
No, baby, he's, no, no, no, no, no, baby.

767
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,840
He's out across the Atlantic.

768
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
He's doing the big, the big bird needs the big bird.

769
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,040
You know what I'm saying?

770
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,520
What I'm saying is he came right back cause he missed me, right?

771
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,600
And he didn't say he could have had two days over there in Paris

772
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,440
and said he was like, I gotta get home to Travis.

773
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,160
He comes home and he leans in for a kiss.

774
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,360
What am I gonna do?

775
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,560
Not smooch that beak?

776
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,120
Yeah, he came home from Paris, Griffin.

777
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,240
Griffin came home from, he could have stayed in Paris for 48 hours.

778
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,280
He had earned it.

779
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,320
He had flown there.

780
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,600
He took the jump seat back.

781
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
You know how uncomfortable that is.

782
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,080
Wait, is this, is this pre or during COVID?

783
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,240
This is after COVID is done.

784
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,280
Okay, so we've actually gotten through all that.

785
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,440
I'd kiss anything that moves if COVID was over.

786
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,080
I don't care.

787
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,960
I'll kiss anything.

788
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,200
The year is, the month is April 2021.

789
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,240
Oh, that's nice.

790
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,720
COVID is over officially and Big Bird has returned from Paris.

791
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,600
And what's that?

792
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,640
He brought me a baguette and because of the quick turnaround,

793
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,400
it's still a little warm.

794
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
And he leans, oh, oh.

795
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,400
And it's one of those like ham and butter sandwiches

796
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
that are so fucking good.

797
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
And he, quote Monsieur.

798
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
And no, I think it's just Jamon.

799
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,920
And he leans in to give me a smooch.

800
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,240
What am I gonna do, Griffin?

801
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,400
Kick him out, turn him away?

802
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,280
Got a smooch, Big Bird.

803
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,120
Am I smooching Big Bird?

804
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,920
You don't need to, but if Falco Lombardi from Star Fox

805
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,280
came around, I don't know, I don't know.

806
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,440
I have one option to get us out of this.

807
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,000
And that is for me to say it's time to go to Money Zone.

808
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
No, get on my back.

809
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,960
Come on, we're getting out of here, guys.

810
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:27,280
On the wings of love.

811
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,360
I have incredible vision.

812
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,480
And so I'm the only one on this show you can trust

813
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,160
to read this ad copy and tell you that Warby Parker

814
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,680
is a great way to get glasses.

815
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,640
Take it from me.

816
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,680
Warby Parker is offering boutique quality eyewear

817
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,520
at a revolutionary price point.

818
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,800
They've got eyeglasses, sunglasses, contact lenses,

819
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,840
and eye exams.

820
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,320
Warby Parker is committed to providing exceptional vision

821
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
care online and in stores.

822
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,680
Justin, I wear glasses.

823
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,360
Oh, no.

824
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
I didn't know.

825
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,120
I'm sorry, Travis.

826
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,880
God, how embarrassing that is for me.

827
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,280
It's okay, Justin, because I can read this copy too,

828
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,160
because it's not okay.

829
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,040
You're still my brother.

830
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,360
But I'm wearing Warby Parker glasses right now

831
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,560
so I could see I did the home try-on program.

832
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,200
I don't know if anyone has ever noticed this about me ever,

833
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,640
but I have a large head.

834
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,080
And so I ordered the glasses through the home try-on program

835
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,600
to make sure that they physically fit around

836
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,960
the girth of my skull.

837
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,800
And several of them did, and I was very excited about this.

838
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,040
So I bought the ones that did.

839
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,520
You know what they say about have a big head?

840
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,480
Hard to find hats.

841
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,500
Nope.

842
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,760
Okay.

843
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,400
The other thing.

844
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,160
Wide ears.

845
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,080
Wide ears.

846
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,480
Yeah, you keep acting like you don't know.

847
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,520
My big dick.

848
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,480
Well, thanks for the ad revenue, Warby Parker.

854
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,480
Now it doesn't say this is a limited time thing,

855
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
but considering the content of this ad,

856
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,040
I bet that link's gonna go dead pretty quick.

857
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,320
So go ahead and head on over to warbyparker.com slash my brother

858
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,240
and show them that that is the kind of thing

859
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,400
that gets a response from our people.

860
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
Real quick, let's talk about Honey.

861
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,800
Honey is the rad little doodad that you get on your computer.

862
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,200
And then whenever you're shopping, it looks for promo codes.

863
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,680
And if it finds one for whatever it is that you're buying,

864
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,280
it'll put it in there right away.

865
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,680
And it's automatic and it saves you money.

866
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,160
And real quick, and real quick, just real quick.

867
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
Yeah, I got a big dick.

868
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,560
And see, I feel like it would be unfair if we did one for Warby Parker

869
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,320
and we did not do one for Honey.

870
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
There's not much else to add because that's how simple Honey is.

871
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
It's a little browser extension that looks for promo codes for you.

872
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,960
And I use it and I've saved money on like music software

873
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,720
and like tons of cache.

874
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
It just saves you money. It's fantastic.

875
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,880
I got a replacement plate for my router table from Craig.

876
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,960
Had to get a new one that fit my Triton router.

877
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,280
Because I did one with pre-drilled holes and I made my own,

878
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,120
but I thought it'd be a little bit better fit

879
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,240
if I got one that was custom for the router.

880
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,160
And I managed to save a little cash using Honey.

881
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760
Yeah, so that's all it is.

882
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,560
It's free.

885
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,520
Hi, are you someone who thinks that when one door closes,

886
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,560
another one opens?

887
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,800
Someone who always sees the light at the end of the tunnel.

888
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,560
If you answered yes to one or both of these questions, good for you.

889
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,920
We are not those people.

890
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
Nope, I'm Annabelle Gurwitch and I'm a,

891
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,800
you know that other door opening, it probably leads to a broom closet kind of person.

892
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,680
And I'm Laura House. When I see a light at the end of a tunnel,

893
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,320
I assume it's a train headed right toward me.

894
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,760
Laura and I have created a brand new podcast for people like us.

895
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,440
It's called Tiny Victories.

896
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,960
We're sharing personal tiny victories or things we've read or seen that inspire resilience.

897
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,920
So if you're looking for a tiny reason to get out of bed each week,

898
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,840
subscribe to Tiny Victories.

899
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Available on Maximum Fun or wherever you get your podcasts.

900
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,720
Let's get tiny.

901
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,200
Munch Squad.

902
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,880
It's a podcast within a podcast profile.

903
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,120
Latest, greatest in brand eating.

904
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,560
There is nothing that you can say in this segment that's going to top

905
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,640
you ordering the fried fish leavens that you used to order a box of.

906
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,360
That's true.

907
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
I do want to say a couple things.

908
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,640
I, like our friend Lynn, ordered the ghost pepper donut that we talked about last time.

909
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,520
Oh, how was that?

910
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,560
It was not bad.

911
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,120
How was the spice?

912
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Not as spicy as you want, but it's a little bit of a spice.

913
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,080
It gets you on the back end.

914
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,360
You're like, whoa, hello.

915
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,040
Now, did you eat the whole thing?

916
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,000
Yes, I ate the whole thing.

917
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,120
Because Lynn appeared to take one bite and then bag it.

918
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,760
If you want to watch Living Legend, Lynn, my old Miranda,

919
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,400
eat a ghost pepper donut, it's on our YouTube channel.

920
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,600
His mouth is more valuable than Justin's mouth.

921
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,160
That is true.

922
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,880
God knows that.

923
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,920
Fair and dangerous.

924
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,320
This is a bagel notice.

925
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,440
Just a bagel alert.

926
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,040
Einstein Brothers Bagels introduces a new, this is really, can I say it's like,

927
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,200
it's going to be really fun.

928
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,680
You know what I mean?

929
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,440
Because we could all use something a little bit fun.

930
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,080
Of course.

931
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,560
Yeah.

932
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,640
Okay, so Einstein Brothers Bagels introduces you to new party bagels.

933
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,360
Oh.

934
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,720
Arriving at select locations nationwide November 12th.

935
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,640
Ready to show your sweet tooth a good time.

936
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,440
Wait, can we guess?

937
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,200
I don't want to guess.

938
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,200
I want to start the party.

939
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,080
No, it's just party bagels.

940
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,960
Is it frosted?

941
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,240
I'll just tell you, it's party bagels.

942
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,800
All Einstein Brothers Bagels wants to do is have some fun.

943
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
Just like everyone else this year.

944
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,440
Yeah, fucking even, even, it is like obligatory.

945
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,720
You cannot announce a new fast food item without saying like,

946
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,440
because of COVID, we're just trying to have some fun, okay?

947
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,560
So yes, we're acknowledging the ongoing pandemic in our press release about party bagels.

948
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,400
The new party bagels are shaking things up.

949
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,160
Raising the roof of the bagel case, if you will.

950
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,720
Oh boy.

951
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,360
With the promise of a sweet indulgence that will bring a smile to faces young and old.

952
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,680
I'm having fucking fun already.

953
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,120
I know, it's already really fun.

954
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,600
Einstein Brothers Bagels had developed two flavors

955
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,240
that will make your taste buds sing sweet praises.

956
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,640
Oh?

957
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
To who?

958
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,400
Jesus?

959
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,120
To Christ?

960
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,280
There's churro, which starts with a donut.

961
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
You're fucking, okay.

962
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,280
You just drop that in a fucking chemical bath or what's up?

963
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,240
No, it's a donut and they smear it in the middle with sweet cream cheese,

964
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,840
buttercream frosting and coat it on top with cinnamon sugar.

965
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,040
It will take you back to roller coasters and carnival games.

966
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,560
And then there's-

967
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,720
I would love to be in the R&D meeting for Einstein Brothers where they're like,

968
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,480
yeah, but it's just a donut.

969
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,440
It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

970
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,240
But get this, we call it a bagel.

972
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
It's not a donut, it's a party bagel.

973
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,040
Oh, that's good, that's good.

974
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

975
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,200
They'll never know.

976
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,280
We better not call it a donut in the press release.

977
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,160
Oh yeah, that'd be a big fuck up.

978
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,120
Yeah, chocolate birthday cake starts with a donut

979
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,800
and smeared in the middle with chocolate buttercream frosting,

980
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,120
glazed with chocolate frosting and topped with confetti sprinkles.

981
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,800
If it isn't your birthday, it will feel like it is.

982
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,880
So yeah, that's right, friend.

983
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,160
Now you can have the visceral thrill of spending your birthday at Einstein Brothers bagels.

984
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,320
Or even better, at your house in lockdown, eating a donut by yourself.

985
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,920
This is a quote from Chad Thompson, head of culinary innovations at Einstein Brothers bagels,

986
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,960
which in this case is selling donuts, is the culinary innovation here.

987
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,960
We wanted to bring a bit of fun to the breakfast table.

988
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,800
Party bagels are a sweet treat done the Einstein Brothers bagel way

989
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,600
that the whole family will love.

990
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,680
It's guys, it's donuts.

991
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,040
I don't know, it's just-

992
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,320
I don't know, it just feels like if your company's gonna be called fucking Einstein in it,

993
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,000
the name of it, when you do things, when you make brand choices,

994
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,120
they gotta be smart in some way.

995
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,960
Fucking Einstein would never look at a bagel and be like, what is this?

996
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,080
Some sort of party donut?

997
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,160
I got it backwards, but you get the point?

998
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:12,960
I mean, it does, okay, it does imply that up till now, every other bagel has been-

999
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,320
A fucking work bagel.

1000
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,440
Has been work bagels.

1001
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,680
Has been business bagels.

1002
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,240
Business, it's been business.

1003
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,120
Or I guess it would be business donuts?

1004
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,360
Yeah.

1005
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,640
Business donuts.

1006
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,600
Business donuts, right.

1007
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
Business donuts, party bagels.

1008
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,040
Yes.

1009
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:37,760
I heard you were discussing donuts.

1010
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,240
Oh boy.

1011
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,360
Cool, he's back.

1012
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,000
Hey.

1013
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
Hello, I have such a pleasure to be invited back.

1014
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,000
It's me, Count Donut.

1015
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,360
Count Donut, I'm not really plugged into social anymore,

1016
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,880
so I don't really know how our fans felt about your sort of occupation of the last episode.

1017
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,640
The only thing they could discuss was that Justin's compression settings

1018
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,400
were wrong on his soundboard.

1019
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,520
Okay, well-

1020
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,400
But that should be-

1021
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,640
What does it sound like with a Transylvanian accent when you say non-plus?

1022
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:14,080
I think everybody loved me and I'm here not with donut news,

1023
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,880
although you have summoned me by discussing donuts.

1024
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,520
Sorry, it's actually your Count Party Bagel now.

1025
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:19,760
Yeah.

1026
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,640
Count Party Bagel is here to tell you about new innovation from Heinz.

1027
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:26,880
Okay.

1028
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,120
From ketchup-dipped fries as vampire fangs,

1029
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,800
to hot dog fingers dripping in ketchup.

1030
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,480
For years, fans have used Heinz ketchup to add deliciously convincing blood

1031
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
to their Halloween celebrations.

1032
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,880
I'm salivating already.

1033
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,000
It's ketchup though.

1034
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,720
Yeah, has anyone done either of those things?

1035
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,640
Now, ahead of what is sure to be a different kind of Halloween celebration,

1036
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,080
the brand is debuting a Heinz tomato blood ketchup.

1037
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,640
What?

1038
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,200
To contribute to the spooky fun.

1039
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,680
Wait, huh?

1040
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm gonna be sick.

1041
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,200
Fans have had to navigate a lot this year and Halloween is no exception.

1042
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,040
Said Shirley Hayden, the brand manager for Heinz ketchup,

1043
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:27,360
making the obligatory reference to COVID-19 in the context of Heinz tomato blood.

1044
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,360
Does that sentence end with,

1045
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,600
and we're just gonna throw this fucking thing on top of the pile.

1046
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,840
Hey, you've already dealt with so many other things.

1047
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,280
What's one more thing?

1048
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,920
Bloodchip.

1049
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,320
I hope that for many, many reasons that the pandemic doesn't go on for a long time

1050
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,040
because it would reach a point where in these press releases,

1051
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,200
like the second paragraph would just start with, you know, so here we are.

1052
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,760
Travis, as soon as we lick this thing,

1053
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,160
do you know that we're gonna have a good two years at the minimum of just like,

1054
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,960
we're back, our doors are open, family, community.

1055
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,120
Finally, you can lick the counters again.

1056
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,680
Lick the counters, baby, it's Hardee's.

1057
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,400
Like nonstop.

1058
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,160
Now you eat the hamburgers from our hands.

1059
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,200
Thank you, first responders, frontline workers.

1060
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,360
Come buy a fucking Chevy.

1061
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,200
With Heinz tomato blood ketchup,

1062
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,840
we wanted to give families a fun way to go big with their spooky celebrations,

1063
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,560
even if they look a little different in 2020.

1064
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,000
Hey, Shirley, fuck you.

1065
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,640
Seriously, that's two in one quote.

1066
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,040
Wicked it, things are bad.

1067
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,200
What were you saying about ketchup?

1068
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,720
Thanks for the reminder though about the ongoing pandemic.

1069
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,200
The limited edition bottles are filled with the delicious thick and rich Heinz ketchup

1070
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,520
fans know and love in a spooky Halloween themed bottle

1071
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,600
that even vampires within the guilty as charged.

1072
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,280
All right, just to clarify from that sentence,

1073
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,440
you just said it's just regular ketchup in the bottle,

1074
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,640
but this is a different label.

1075
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:22,400
Yes, Travis, the Heinz ketchup company is distracting you from 200,000 plus Americans

1076
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,560
dead of COVID by putting a different sticker on the ketchup.

1077
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,320
This should fix it, right?

1078
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,040
Okay.

1079
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,360
I mean, my spirits are lifted.

1080
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,480
My spirits are lifted for the last minute and a half.

1081
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,520
It's sort of occupied a majority of my brain space,

1082
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,440
so I guess I do have Heinz to think about that.

1083
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,240
Can't wait to sink your teeth in the Heinz tomato blood ketchup

1084
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,400
from now until October 31st at 11 59 p.m. CDT.

1085
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,080
It's fun that they have to specify the time zone

1086
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,400
as if you're waiting until within the last two hours of the promotion.

1087
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,840
Good to get in there.

1088
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,440
They're giving away 570 bottles of Heinz tomato ketchup

1089
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,400
to those who participate in a TikTok hashtag challenge

1090
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,120
launching Friday, October 23rd.

1091
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,920
I guarantee you that the original amount was 57

1092
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,200
and they thought that's not enough.

1093
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,400
That's not enough bottles.

1094
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,040
Enough and now 570.

1095
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,760
That will fix the ongoing national malaise.

1096
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,840
Count party donut.

1097
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,920
I got to tell you, great news.

1098
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,120
Party, I believe party bagel.

1099
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,960
Sorry, see in my mind the Einstein brothers have succeeded

1100
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
in making these two foods completely interchangeable.

1101
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,840
But if this doesn't do it for you, Count Party Bagel,

1102
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,440
you can get the Ed Sheeran one that looks like his arm

1103
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,840
and then you can just chomp right into that

1104
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,080
imagining that you are draining the viscera

1105
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,720
from beloved singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.

1106
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,120
This promotion started on October 23rd.

1107
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,440
Can I ask our TikTok correspondent Travis McElroy

1108
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
to check for Heinz Halloween hashtag videos?

1109
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
I've already seen it, Count.

1110
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,240
It's been on everything and I can honestly say

1111
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,320
none of them have had anything to do

1112
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,640
with condiments of any sort.

1113
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,560
People are just slapping that shit

1114
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,640
on their twerking videos or whatever.

1115
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,520
Are they twerking on a bottle of ketchup?

1116
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,680
A bottle of ketchup? No, that's the thing.

1117
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,200
Maybe there's a bottle present just off screen,

1118
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,480
but I have been scanning every inch of those twerking videos

1119
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,560
looking for ketchup and I've seen nothing.

1120
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,320
Well, there's a...

1121
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,920
There's a sticker, by the way.

1122
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,840
I wanted to quickly describe it.

1123
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,800
It says Heinz Tomato Blood on it.

1124
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,360
That's it.

1125
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:49,680
Okay.

1126
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,640
Does that help your family celebrate Halloween no more?

1127
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,440
It doesn't hurt.

1128
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,600
Does that turn things around for you?

1129
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,080
Sure.

1130
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,840
At the bottom of the press release,

1131
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,200
I just wanted to mention one more thing

1132
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,280
before I disappear into the night.

1133
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,240
Heinz can confirm that only the juiciest, ripest tomatoes

1134
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,480
were harmed in the making of delicious Heinz Tomato Blood ketchup.

1135
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,560
Gross, why is that the line that took it too far for me?

1136
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,680
That's fucking perverts.

1137
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,600
I think they are trying to...

1138
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,960
That's an asterisk.

1139
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,720
I think they're trying to clarify

1140
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,360
that the product contains no blood.

1141
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,080
Oh.

1142
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,480
That's good that they cleared that up.

1143
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,000
It's good that...

1144
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,680
Anyway, I have to go, fellas.

1145
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,400
Let me know if I am needed again

1146
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,920
to help distract you from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

1147
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,760
I'll miss you, Count.

1148
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,800
I'll miss him too.

1149
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,640
What?

1150
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,440
Get out of...

1151
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,000
Just go.

1152
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,640
Well, are you sure?

1153
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,600
Because I could stick around.

1154
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,640
No, you need to go.

1155
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,920
The sun's coming up.

1156
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,120
The sun's coming up.

1157
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,960
That's okay.

1158
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,880
I just glisten in the light.

1159
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,440
No, but it's a high UV index.

1160
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,920
Goodbye.

1161
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,400
Is that cricket?

1162
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,000
It's a terrible, terrible bat.

1163
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,400
He makes the worst bat noises when he...

1164
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,760
Yeah, it's really unpleasant.

1165
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,160
I was doing something else,

1166
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,280
and then I heard the bats after he left.

1167
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,080
Yeah, yeah.

1168
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,040
No, I was sitting in the chair opposite,

1169
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,560
just staring at him.

1170
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,240
Yeah, he's under his throat.

1171
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,520
Do you want to yahoo a real quick one?

1172
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,360
Well, I want Justin to do this next question.

1173
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,200
It's not the kind of question we normally do,

1174
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,440
and I think we can knock it out pretty quick.

1175
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:27,840
Okay.

1176
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,160
At what point does an aquarium become a zoo?

1177
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,000
The aquarium near me has three sloths,

1178
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,080
which I never thought was weird

1179
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,960
until I was talking to a friend about it,

1180
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,240
and she thought it was super weird

1181
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,960
that there were land animals and birds at the aquarium.

1182
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,640
How many land animals is too many land animals for an aquarium?

1183
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
At what point does it become a zoo?

1184
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,120
Or is there a midpoint where it is this aquarium?

1185
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,720
That's from Elizabeth from Maryland.

1186
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,360
Well, the only thing I have to go on for this one

1187
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,800
is the Austin Aquarium,

1188
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,800
which I think I've talked about on this

1189
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,240
or other shows before.

1190
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,080
It is a blighted sort of hell zone.

1191
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,040
It's the worst building.

1192
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,120
It's an old sort of TJ Maxx

1193
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,520
that they crammed a bunch of sick old turtles inside,

1194
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
and then they started to put kiddie pools

1195
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,040
full of fish that they bought at Petland in there too,

1196
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,080
and then they threw in about a trillion parrots,

1197
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,240
and then for good measure, they were like,

1198
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,240
let's get some lemurs in there, baby,

1199
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,280
and put them in the lobby

1200
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,440
so it greets people in our fish zoo,

1201
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,680
but then people come in and little girls

1202
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,360
stick their hand in, does get bit,

1203
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,600
and then the parents are like, we're suing you,

1204
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,920
and they were like, the lemur was not vaccinated,

1205
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,800
and then the parents were like,

1206
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,120
we're wicked suing you a lot now.

1207
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,720
I think that you can, I think aquariums should have fish,

1208
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,200
and zoos get everything else.

1209
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,080
Yeah, just let them, yeah, just let them keep everything else.

1210
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,880
Unless.

1211
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,520
No, there's so many kinds of fish.

1212
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,840
Unless, unless.

1213
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,840
The sloths and the birds are always swimming around.

1214
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,920
That's cute, that's cute.

1215
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,280
Yeah, you don't give them no land.

1216
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,880
That's cute, I do like that, but wait,

1217
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
you never let them get out of the water?

1218
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,440
You never let them get out of the water?

1219
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,720
Because the turnaround rate on those sloths, Travis,

1220
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,720
is going to, the overhead, your sloth money,

1221
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,440
is your sloth budget's gonna really break the bank,

1222
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,400
I'm worried.

1223
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,080
You give them a rock,

1224
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,120
but slowly it gets hotter and hotter while they stand on it.

1225
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,520
I see, so now it's a saw trap.

1226
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,080
Now, this isn't even funny,

1227
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,840
because this is horrible animal abuse,

1228
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,680
what I'm describing.

1229
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,560
It's horrible, it's horrible, it's terrible.

1230
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,320
I think there's so many different kinds of things

1231
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,000
that live in the water, right?

1232
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,840
Yeah.

1233
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,560
More than we know about.

1234
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,040
Join me as we journey through the blue planet.

1235
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,400
It's not, it's part of our planet.

1236
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,160
The ocean's not a different planet.

1237
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,280
It is, it's a different planet

1238
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,320
where the fish and the mermen live.

1239
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,880
I hate that when David Attenborough's like,

1240
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,240
there's another world below the surface of,

1241
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
there's not, David.

1242
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,280
That's our water.

1243
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,960
I'm sorry, Justin, was that your impression of me,

1244
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,040
David Attenborough?

1245
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,400
Because it sounded like my impression of Dracula.

1246
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,680
I'm saying the pivot from having Dracula here,

1247
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,480
Donut Dracula, sorry, Party Bagel Dracula,

1248
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,480
here in my office to having David Attenborough in the office

1249
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,600
was a bit of a, it was a bit of a swing.

1250
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,520
While I'm here, do you have any questions about fish?

1251
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,480
Have you ever been to-

1252
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,320
Yeah, I'll bite.

1253
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,240
No, Griffin, shut up.

1254
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,720
This is a huge opportunity for me.

1255
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,040
Yes, I'm quite the git.

1256
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,320
I mean, I was gonna ask him a question.

1257
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,160
Oh, go for it.

1258
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah, sorry, I thought you were dismissing me.

1259
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,480
No, David, have you ever been

1260
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,800
to the Austin Aquarium, David?

1261
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,760
It's quite great.

1262
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,840
Yes, I own the Austin Aquarium

1263
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,560
and I didn't know how to appreciate

1264
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,320
the slander you were talking about.

1265
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,520
Can I do feedback?

1266
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,640
Do you do feedback?

1267
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,920
I didn't see a feedback box.

1268
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,760
Maybe I could do it here.

1269
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,240
Okay, I saw a turtle trying to climb over a rock,

1270
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,160
but it flipped upside down.

1271
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,200
Yes, that's part of the show.

1272
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,400
But no one did anything about it.

1273
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,160
That turtle has to learn self-reliance.

1274
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,560
Hey, David, can I bother you

1275
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,120
about the Austin Aquarium for a second?

1276
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,360
Yes, of course.

1277
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,920
Don't you think it's kind of confusing

1278
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,720
to have a young woman dressed as a mermaid

1279
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,960
doing face paint there in a place

1280
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,640
that is about the undersea life?

1281
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,480
Don't you think that's kind of confusing?

1282
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,200
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you said dressed as.

1283
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,120
I have to disagree with you there.

1284
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,000
She is an actual mermaid.

1285
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,240
Okay, but what about the one

1286
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,760
that I did see doing face paint

1287
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,160
that was dressed up as Anna from Frozen?

1288
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,080
Mm-hmm, that is, all of that is set underwater.

1289
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,920
It's not, Dave.

1290
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,240
Frozen is an underwater movie.

1291
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,960
Dave, it's not.

1292
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,800
No.

1293
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,640
It's above Frozen.

1294
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,880
Which one am I thinking of?

1295
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,920
Little Mermaid is the only one

1296
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,720
that springs to mind immediately, Mr. M.

1297
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,440
Okay, I think that.

1298
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,960
I love that one with the crab.

1299
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,200
Why didn't you like vaccinate the lemur though, bud?

1300
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,400
I tried and the lemur said he didn't want it

1301
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,760
and then he said, I'd like to move it, move it,

1302
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,240
which I really appreciate.

1303
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,240
I'll give, I'll let you bye-bye on that one.

1304
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,400
I would forget too if I saw the lemur doing a cool dance.

1305
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,520
Okay, now I have to go.

1306
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,640
I'll mount up on my dragon and away we go.

1307
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,480
Ah!

1308
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,480
Ah!

1309
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,240
Sorry, David, if you could come back to Earth

1310
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,760
for one second, that last sound there.

1311
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,200
What was that?

1312
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,040
Was that the sound of your dragon

1313
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,400
or the sound of you communicating with your dragon

1314
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,600
in the dragon top?

1315
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,120
Well, don't be a fucking idiot, Justin.

1316
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,320
Of course, it was me speaking to my dragon.

1317
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,560
He speaks to me telepathically.

1318
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,360
And you speak to him through the dragon top.

1319
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,600
It's a one-way telepathic link.

1320
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,680
Read a book.

1321
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,360
Arrah!

1322
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,040
Oh, boy.

1323
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,960
Sorry, that sound sounded so much different

1324
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,160
from your other command.

1325
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,000
Well, he said a different word, Justin.

1326
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,960
That was me saying, can you believe this fucking guy?

1327
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,960
And he telepathed back, yeah, a real jag.

1328
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,520
That's one of the judge your dragons have encountered.

1329
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,560
Honestly, he barely knows me.

1330
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,480
No, Justin, he says he went to fifth grade with you.

1331
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,000
Are you still here or are you flying on a dragon?

1332
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,880
You keep calling us back with your inane questions.

1333
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,640
Now I'm going to ride this dragon into space.

1334
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,560
Arroo!

1335
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,680
Oh, damn it, he did say he found all the Earth animals.

1336
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,720
So he's going to look for other ones.

1337
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,720
Oh, man, he's going to die up there

1338
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,320
as soon as he gets out of where the air is.

1339
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,320
That last sound translated to,

1340
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,640
if I've picked up a little bit of dragon tongue,

1341
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,200
I think that last sound translated to,

1342
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,760
we're going all the way to space, baby.

1343
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,320
That's right, Papa David don't need no more oxygen.

1344
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,960
I'm good.

1345
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,800
I miss them.

1346
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,040
I miss them too, and I miss our listeners

1347
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,000
who sadly have to depart from us

1348
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,600
now that we've completed this episode of My Brother,

1349
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,280
My Brother and Me.

1350
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,400
We've had just a hoot.

1351
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,880
We hope you're hanging in there.

1352
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,480
I hope you're feeding all your worries and cares

1353
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,040
to the anxiety alligator who will chomp them up

1354
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,120
and swallow them down and whisk them away

1355
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,840
so you don't have to stress about them anymore

1356
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,840
and just try to hang in there, pals, and go vote.

1357
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,320
Yes, please.

1358
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,160
God, go vote for Joe Biden.

1359
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,000
Jesus Christ.

1360
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,840
Vote Joe Biden.

1361
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,680
Especially, I hear y'all in Texas are trying to,

1362
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,400
trying to pull off a sneaky little job.

1363
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,920
Oh, we're doing a sneaky little job.

1364
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,320
Don't tell them.

1365
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,160
Only tell folks who are down with it,

1366
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,160
with Joe and his tight fanny.

1367
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,200
Just get out there and punch in the thing

1368
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,640
for Joe's tight fanny,

1369
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,480
and let's ride this baby to Blue Town

1370
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,000
and fucking embarrass the spanker, the spanky.

1371
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,960
It's gonna be, I can't wait for November 3rd

1372
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,360
when y'all are like, number one, Texas has turned blue.

1373
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,400
Number two, there is a basement at the Alamo.

1374
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,400
We are so sorry that we were not truthful about that.

1375
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,160
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1376
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,200
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1377
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,400
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1378
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,520
Great tracks and tunes on that one.

1379
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,840
Lots of premium cuts on that one.

1380
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,080
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1381
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,440
I just wanna tell you about two great McElroy podcasts

1382
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,560
that maybe you're not listening to.

1383
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,480
First, there's one that my wife, Teresa, and I are doing

1384
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,760
where we are talking about the new season

1385
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,480
of Great British Bake Off.

1386
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,960
It's called Bake On.

1387
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,520
Find it on your podcatchers,

1388
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,160
and we also put it up on our YouTube channel.

1389
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,400
And also, Besties, which Griffin and Justin do

1390
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,200
with Russ Frushtick and Chris Plant.

1391
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,400
This week they talked about spooky games,

1392
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,000
which I thoroughly enjoyed.

1393
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,560
But you guys didn't talk about the one

1394
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,120
with the sanity meter that I believe was on Dreamcast?

1395
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,600
It was GameCube, it was Eternal Darkness,

1396
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,160
and I did talk about it.

1397
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,560
What?

1398
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,040
Thank you for listening.

1399
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,720
I do listen, it's my favorite podcast.

1400
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,840
One of my favorites, I mean, I enjoy several.

1401
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,680
