1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. So today is the 5th of July when we're recording

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:05,200
this, and the question on everybody's mind is, what is- it's a 5th of July tradition.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,640
What is the most beautiful firework that you saw yesterday?

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
I love sitting around a circle with you boys and talking about all the great fireworks we saw,

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,400
talking about our favorite ones. It's a favorite family tradition of mine, too.

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
Yeah, every year. Every year. And honestly, probably the audience is sick of hearing about it,

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,840
because every 5th of July episode for the last eight years, we've done this.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,120
Yeah, so I got my list, my list, like I do every year. I got it in my Excel spreadsheet,

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:38,960
and I saw 10 sparkly white ones, I saw three big blue ones, I saw- they didn't have any purple

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,480
ones this year, because I guess they have to mix the blue and the red powder, and it's kind of

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,280
wasteful, but I did see- did I just say the red ones? I saw like 14 red ones, and yeah,

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,560
it was a good show. They had like a whole red period going, and then they did one

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Spongebob one. Whoa. Yeah, they did eight. Griffin, did you see any of those where it

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,960
kind of spreads out and you think, oh, that's done, but then little fireworks fire off from

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,120
the ends of the one that just spread out, and it's like two fireworks in one?

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,720
The double. The double, I saw only one of those, because again, times are pretty tight,

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
but then of course at the very end of the show, I have here in my notes, it says they really just

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
busted in a nut up there, and just really went wild. I tried to count them all, I was like,

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,160
there's a red, there's a white sparkle, there's a blue, ah damn! And then, you know,

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,320
my pastor got upset because I cussed right in front of him.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,920
How many did you guys see yesterday? Mine is eight.

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
Fireworks.

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
How many fireworks did you see? I don't want it to be a kind of a braggy thing,

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
but I saw eight fireworks yesterday.

31
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,280
Well, you know, here's the weird thing, Justin. I only saw one, but it was the most sustained

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,880
firework I had ever seen. It was one firework that lasted for an hour.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,400
Whoa.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,440
Yeah, and you would think like, oh, a firework that just kept exploding for an hour,

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,560
but actually it was like, it exploded, and then the image kind of walked around,

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,960
and like, talked to people, and just kind of-

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
Did it head talk?

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,120
Yeah, it was, I honestly don't know how they did it, but it was just like an hour of sustain-

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,600
And it had like, personality, and could like, answer questions, and like-

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,880
So it sent questions from the audience, because a lot of fireworks are too fucking stuck up.

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,040
No, this is really a firework of the people, and like, by the end of it-

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
The people's firework.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah, we were like, oh, okay, that's a firework I could have a beer with. You know what I mean?

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,320
It was great.

45
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,080
I had a similar one with the Sponge Wobble, and I saw, where I saw it from the front,

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,240
and it was him, you know, waving high, but apparently, I heard some reports from folks

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,760
in the neighboring neighborhood, that when you looked at that firework from the back side,

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
his butt was hanging out as a prank, I guess?

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,600
Oh, okay.

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Yeah, so the fireworks people got sued by the city for $100, and I'm worried about them.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,800
But yeah, Juice, I'm glad you asked. I saw about 32 fireworks at the show,

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,280
and then I still wanted more fireworks, and so I came home, and I sat down in my thinking chair,

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,800
just sort of my imagination station, and I closed my eyes and pushed up on my eyeballs.

54
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,920
You know how you can do that? You push up on your eyeballs,

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,600
and then I made like more fireworks, like what I saw there in the darkness.

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
You ever do that? It's fun, and you can make pretend that it's-

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,840
I did that one time too hard and pushed my eyeball back into my brain for a little bit.

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that's where all the best fireworks are.

59
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
But don't do it at home, we should say pretty clearly, don't do it.

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,800
Kids.

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,560
You can make pretend that there's a little fireworks guy in there shooting off his own stuff.

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
Did I tell you guys about my favorite fireworks I saw last year?

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,360
What was your favorite one last year?

64
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
It was a big Calvin, and he was peeing,

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,960
and they had positioned it so he was right above a Ford truck dealership.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
Oh, that's awesome.

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,960
And it was great because it looked like he was peeing on the Ford truck dealership,

68
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
and his piss set it on fire, and the whole thing burned down.

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
Oh, badass.

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
Yeah, it was amazing, dude.

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,040
But it was heavily insured, so like-

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,040
In fact, I think they might have even done it themselves.

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,760
It might have been arson, now that I'm thinking about it.

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,760
It might have been firework-related arson.

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
I need to go talk to some people.

76
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,960
Can I ask a question?

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
Uh-huh.

78
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,040
Why does Bill Watterson hate the Ford brand as much as he does?

79
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,520
Well, it did him wrong, done him dirty.

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,400
He bought it back.

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,360
He's a Chevy man.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,000
I guess so.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
But he didn't used to be.

84
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,320
He used to be a Ford man.

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
He bought a Ford truck, and he got it home,

86
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
and he looked in the back, and it was full of snakes.

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120
People always say Bill Watterson's in hiding,

88
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
but for me, it's like, if I was making as much fucking coin

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,240
as this dude must be of Calvin peeing stickers-

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,720
Living it.

91
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,280
Yeah, I wouldn't be working either.

92
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
I'd be cashing the checks and thinking of like,

93
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,120
call my assistant, like, I got a new one.

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,960
Think about this.

95
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,240
Sure.

96
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,640
You ready?

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Instagram.

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
It's just Instagram with Calvin peeing on it.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,880
He's like, anyway, talk to you in the next quarter.

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,920
Here's the thing, Justin.

101
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,240
Everyone thinks that Bill Watterson is just like a recluse

102
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
and in hiding, but actually, it's just that his Ford truck

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
is so unreliable, he can't drive it into town.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,040
And he's like, fuck, I wish I could go cash these checks.

105
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't get to the bank because my Ford truck won't start.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Fuck this truck.

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,320
Bill Watterson today, tragically found buried in checks.

108
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,560
There's so many.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
Because it's unreliable.

110
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,480
If only I could get into town.

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,840
God, I need to express my hatred of Ford in some way.

112
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
He can't even buy a new car.

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Can't deposit?

114
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:45,840
Yeah.

115
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,040
Yeah, his Ford truck won't start, so he can't get to the place

116
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
where you buy a new one.

117
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,520
So the only way he can communicate the displeasure he has

118
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
about the car that he's been saddled with is by making more

119
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
of these hilarious stickers.

120
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,360
And you know what?

121
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,800
Every day he's just on his knees praying that someone will come

122
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,960
and pick him up and take him to the bank so he can deposit.

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,760
He just gets down in front of the cross and he prays that he

124
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,560
can go deposit his checks so he can buy a Chevy or a Dodge.

125
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
I know what you're thinking.

126
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,600
Can't he just write a note that says, please come rescue me?

127
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,120
The answer is his publisher only wants Calvin stickers.

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
So that's the only way he can communicate.

129
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
There was one time where he tried to draw like Calvin peeing

130
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,760
on a note that said, please come rescue me.

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,840
But the publisher saw right through that.

132
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah.

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
Do you hear the story about how Charles Schultz who loves

134
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,080
Coca-Cola so much did one of Charlie Brown taking a dump

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,320
on the Pepsi logo and then he took a really hard look at it

136
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,640
and he was like, I can't let anybody know about this.

137
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,320
He threw it in the garbage, but I found it.

138
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,400
So if you're wondering why Griffin has a signed

139
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,920
plaque of the Smithsonian thanking him for his generosity.

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,320
Gosh.

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,120
And it's right next to that Charles Schultz piece.

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,280
I just gotta, I begs the question, is there a brand

143
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,720
you two boys hate so much that you want to put a sticker

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,600
of a child using the bathroom on your car?

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,040
Because I got some brands I'm not a big fan of

146
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,280
and I'm hard pressed to think of one.

147
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,640
I think it'd be really fun.

148
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,080
And I don't know one off the top of my head,

149
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,880
but to find like a brand of like toilets and use that brand

150
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
because then it's like, well, does he hate it

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,480
or is he endorsing it?

152
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,720
That's fucked up if it's just him using a toilet

153
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
on your truck, right?

154
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,240
That's no good.

155
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,280
Yeah, that would be messed up if the brand that you chose

156
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,960
was American Standard because then it's Calvin peeing

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,480
or you're going to erase some eyebrows,

158
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
I think with this bad boy, because you're going to get

159
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,440
Calvin peeing on the words American Standard.

160
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,840
And I think a lot of people are going to have some issues

161
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,080
with that they like to discuss with you in private.

162
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,400
At this point, is that logo so recognizable

163
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,360
that you could have Calvin peeing on Calvin peeing

164
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
on Calvin peeing and like just kind of a circle

165
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
of them peeing on each other and then you're like, wait,

166
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,400
does he hate the brand of Calvin peeing?

167
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,960
It's about the futility of anger.

168
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,520
It's about the futility of like vindictiveness

169
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,360
because we're all peeing on somebody

170
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
and we're all getting peed on by somebody.

171
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
So that's great, Trav.

172
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,520
Yeah, it's pee all the way down if you think about it.

173
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,200
Sure, it's all piss.

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
It's all piss.

175
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,400
I don't want to, I mean, the only company,

176
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't think I'm mad enough at any company.

177
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,680
AOL I was very mad at, but that's just a husk, right?

178
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
That's not anything to get worked up about anymore.

179
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,240
I would do Bush's beans because it's like, tell us already.

180
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
Griffin, that dog just died this week.

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,600
What?

182
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
I didn't want to use the podcast.

183
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
I didn't want to tell you this on the podcast,

185
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680
but the Bush baked bean dog died this week.

186
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
That stinks.

187
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,600
That's not a good energy to bring to the show, Justin.

188
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,240
But you know what?

189
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,840
I think the thing he would want most

190
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,520
is for people to keep talking about him.

191
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:11,760
You're right.

192
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
You're helping to keep his legacy going.

193
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,440
Let's celebrate his life here and get to our first question.

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,800
Do you think, like, right before,

195
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,560
like, as his soul was going into its great eternal ward,

196
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
he was just like, a bit of mayonnaise.

197
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,240
He just, like, slipped away.

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
He yelled it back across the rainbow bridge

199
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
and flipped a bird to the mean Bush's man.

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
God, I hate that guy.

201
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
Can we do a question, though,

202
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
instead of talking about a dog that passed away?

203
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,440
I do want to talk about the Bush's baked bean man, though.

204
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,200
I will say this, and then I'm going to let him off the hook.

205
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
If you watch these commercials lately,

206
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,720
this dude has gone through a transformation in recent years.

207
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
And I just saw an ad, and I barely recognized this cat.

208
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,160
You guys know what the Bush's baked beans man looks like, correct?

209
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,160
We're all agreed on this.

210
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
Okay, I'm going to send you his new look.

211
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,760
And if you're at home, just, like, Google image Bush's baked bean man

212
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,840
and you're going to find this pic.

213
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,920
This is what this cat looks like now.

214
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,440
We've got shaved head, full salt and pepper beard.

215
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
He looks awesome.

216
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,980
He does.

217
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,960
Cool jeans.

218
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,240
He looks radical.

219
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,600
And I think that he, like, got so tired of the only people talk about

220
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,040
is, like, asking about beans.

221
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,520
He just want to get his look extremely on point.

222
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,480
He looks fucking great.

223
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
He's got that good bean living right there.

224
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,640
He's got a beard that I think even Travis would be like, nice beard.

225
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
That's a great beard.

226
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,880
Is this a beard that I want to see eat baked beans all the time?

227
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,440
Not really.

228
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
No, that's the opposite.

229
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
He's not getting high in his own supply.

230
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,600
Justin, are you kidding me?

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,520
Fucking kidding me?

232
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,400
You think he just sits in his office tearing into his own beans?

233
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,480
Getting jacked on beans again?

234
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
No, he's got to get the product out there.

235
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm just saying he used to dress like, uh, uh, he, like,

236
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
The real fire fucking dweeb.

237
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
I wanted to pay him some every time he came on TV.

238
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,520
Yeah, like a dweeb.

239
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,920
He looks dope as hell.

240
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,960
That's all I wanted to say.

241
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,680
We spent a long time now talking about a dog who passed away

242
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,760
and then a picture of an attractive man who used to look like a real dinkus.

243
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,080
So is there any other sort of radio poison that we want to do

244
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,920
instead of the shower?

245
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,400
I understand.

246
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,960
Do a question.

247
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,560
Yeah, that's fine.

248
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,920
He looks good.

249
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,400
He looks good.

250
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,960
I don't regret it.

251
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,280
He looks good.

252
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,960
Oh, you're going to bring it back up again?

253
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,160
Yeah, it feels a little bit like they're trying to give Bush's baked beans

254
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,800
sort of a hipster handmade feel.

255
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,280
But this may just be this dude's style.

256
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
I don't know.

257
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,560
I don't know.

258
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
Get at me if you're a listener.

259
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,840
Bush's baked beans, man.

260
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,880
I want to look cool with the people waiting online

261
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,560
while I'm riding on a roller coaster.

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,720
Any tips for how to seem cool or not scared after I get on the ride?

263
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,920
That's pretty.

264
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,720
That's from Zach.

265
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,520
I think that if you can talk about as the ride is pulling out of the station

266
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,800
about how your dad built the ride

267
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
and so you know all the twists and turns that are coming up

268
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,480
and the ride's twists and turns and corkscrews and spins

269
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
are just second nature to you.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
I grew up on this ride.

271
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,040
This ride, you know, molded me from the clay

272
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,320
and I won't be scared by it.

273
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
If I scream, it'll be because I just want everybody else to get hyped up.

274
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
Because I love my dad so much.

275
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,640
Because I love my dad very much

276
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,400
and I want people to know how much I love his work.

277
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,000
My handprints are in the base of the column

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
on the world's tallest loop that I'm not scared of.

279
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,080
Not scared of it.

280
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,160
Maybe like when the attendant comes by to like do the lap bar and belt

281
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,600
you just say, no thank you.

282
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,960
No.

283
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,640
And really like double down on that.

284
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
They will make you.

285
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,720
And then when they try to make you say, what, what?

286
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,280
And like make a big sink and then get off the ride and leave

287
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
and like I have never had to deal with this.

288
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Yeah, they always let me ride without being scared.

289
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,960
Wow that guy is so cool and unafraid

290
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,640
he didn't even need the lap bar

291
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,200
and then when they tried to make him he was so opposed to safety.

292
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,920
He left something like this maybe

293
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,000
but you put your three-year-old son on your lap

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,080
and you say like, he's a lap kid whatever.

295
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,880
We don't even know.

296
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,920
This is for children.

297
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,960
This is a baby ride.

298
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,120
My son, I love my beautiful son

299
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,960
and that's how unafraid I am of this ride.

300
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,480
This is a baby coaster.

301
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,400
This is a baby coaster for kids.

302
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,280
Could you, as you're pulling out, pull out

303
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,560
and you can do this no matter like what your like situation is

304
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,240
riding solo, going with a duo, a squad, whatever.

305
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,440
Pull out an engagement ring in a little box

306
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
and then right as the ride starts moving

307
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
kind of lose your balance and kind of fumble with it

308
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,120
and throw it back into the crowd as it pulls away

309
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,880
and be like no and that's not gonna make you seem brave or cool

310
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
but it is gonna distract them so much

311
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,840
that they're not really gonna be thinking

312
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,200
about how brave and cool you are.

313
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,680
What about if you, as the ride is pulling out

314
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,720
you whip a crossword puzzle out of your back pocket

315
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
and then you put on sunglasses

316
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,560
and then from a speaker that you have built into your heart

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,680
two millionaires riding dirty.

318
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
Oh that's good.

319
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
And it's kind of a combo.

320
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
It's a look, I mean it's an aesthetic.

321
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,760
Light a cigarette for the ride.

322
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
When the ride's about to start you pull out your laptop

323
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,080
and you ask the attendant what the Wi-Fi password is

324
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,760
because you need to work on your screenplay.

325
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,920
Yeah that's very good.

326
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,400
Pull a big hot bag of spaghetti from your jacket

327
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,640
and dump it into a plate that you have in your back

328
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,120
just on your back taped there like a gun and die hard

329
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,520
and you pull that out and you drop the spaghetti

330
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,120
and you look in the crowd with your cigarette

331
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
and your sunglasses and your crossword puzzle

332
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
and you say anybody got a fork as it pulls off.

333
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,560
Yeah pretty good.

334
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,280
I do like that.

335
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,160
Maybe pull out like a pillow and a blankie

336
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
and just like stretch out in the seat for a nap

337
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,080
and you're like ah this is where I feel most safe.

338
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,200
Just have a soldering iron and that you're warming up

339
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,680
and it's like I just have some light soldering to do

340
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
so I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone

341
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,080
because that's how unafraid I am of this ride.

342
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,640
Pull out a clipboard and like a pen

343
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,960
and on the clipboard at the top of the piece of paper

344
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,360
you have like printed out like a roller coaster checklist

345
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,400
and you're just like let's see let's see how this does

346
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,760
and everyone's like oh he must be

347
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,840
some kind of roller coaster inspector.

348
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,880
That's good oh yeah it could be like a

349
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
it could also be a list of all the roller coasters

350
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,520
in the country and you're very afraid of them of course

351
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,760
but you've checked off all but this one

352
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,120
and you show it to everybody proud.

353
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,520
This is the last one and I'll have ridden every roller coaster

354
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,040
across these great United States.

355
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,760
And you don't even have to ride them

356
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,600
because what are they how are they going to check that?

357
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
It's uncheckable that's a very good lie to start telling

358
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,120
like I've ridden every roller coaster in America.

359
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
Because if anybody tries to push you on it

360
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,080
it's like tell me about this roller coaster.

361
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,320
Well there was a part where we started to go up a hill

362
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,080
and then we kind of sat there for like half a second

363
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,440
we thought what's going to happen now

364
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,840
and then we went down the hill and they're like checks out.

365
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
Or more simply just like I don't

366
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,120
I can't remember individual coasters.

367
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,480
I've ridden every coaster in America.

368
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,960
They all to it's my great burden

369
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,720
that I can only enjoy roller coasters holistically.

370
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,840
I'm cursed I can never stop walking this land.

371
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,720
I have to.

372
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,400
My soul can never rest.

373
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Do you think if you're the if you're a person

374
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
who's ridden every roller coaster in America

375
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,920
and you see a news story about like new roller coaster

376
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,160
opens up you think there's a party it's like ah fuck.

377
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,040
No.

378
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,760
Oh great.

379
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,440
I want to go to Duluth.

380
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,480
Fantastic.

381
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,200
Cool weekend.

382
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
I just retired.

383
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,520
Please no.

384
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,720
Every time we name a town or city of any size

385
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,040
we get lots of tweets from people who are psyched

386
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,840
that we mentioned them.

387
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,080
Although sometimes we say it in a tone of voice.

388
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,360
Justin just said Duluth

389
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,280
as if a bee had just flown into the room

390
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
and he was like ah Duluth I have to deal with this.

391
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,000
Like Duluth is probably really good.

392
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,120
Well that's the problem Griffin.

393
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
What he was saying was Duluth is too intense

394
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,600
and like I don't know that I'm in the mood

395
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
to be able to handle all that excitement and joy.

396
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,560
Sure.

397
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,080
Well I picked it I picked it

398
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,520
because Duluth has the adventure zone canal park.

399
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,320
Oh that's fine.

400
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
I want to drag them a little bit.

401
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,960
How about a yahoo?

402
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,560
Stop stealing our shit Duluth.

403
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,040
All right.

404
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,600
Fuck we got you're in our sights now Duluth.

405
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,480
You're on notice.

406
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
This one was sent in by Nick.

407
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,080
Thank you.

408
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
It's yahoo answers user.

409
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
They're anonymous but I'll call them Duluth asks.

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,200
When I'm sitting on the toilet my testicles

411
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,040
sometimes sometimes my penis hit the water.

412
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,280
Is there any way to adjust the toilet's water level?

413
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,800
If we could do this in a way that doesn't get too crass

414
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,640
too blue I don't even know if that's possible

415
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,320
but this person's got a problem they're they're touching

416
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,520
and in they're doing in the I believe in the UK

417
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,200
they call this having a hog splash

418
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
and I want to be able to tell them something.

419
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,000
Now it's possible they're having a hog splash

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,320
because they got you know 10 pounds of hog in a five pound bag.

421
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,520
It could also be that the water in their toilet

422
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
fills the bowl up all the way.

423
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,040
Do you know what I mean?

424
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
Yeah that's the problem.

425
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,640
All the way to the top of the bowl just a full

426
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
which is bad environmentally speaking.

427
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,680
I for sure.

428
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,120
I do I like very much that this person's like first

429
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,880
is like lower the water level where I think

430
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,040
I would probably be over complicated at first

431
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,320
and try to like design some kind of like sling or hammock

432
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,480
that like would still leave room for my business.

433
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah take care of my business.

434
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,480
But also cradle my my package in such a way

435
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
that just kept everything dry.

436
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,680
Why?

437
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,160
My brother Travis wants to poop with his pants on

438
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
and I think that we all.

439
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,720
Hold on that is not what I said.

440
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
We all understand hey we all understand the dream Trav

441
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,160
we'd all love to poop with our pants on every day.

442
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
Listen if I could get that measurement right

443
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,800
if I could figure like the right ratio out

444
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,320
I'm not saying I wouldn't.

445
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,400
Sure yeah Trav in similar vein an anonymous user here

446
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,520
did not best answer.

447
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,920
Actually nobody got any points on this one

448
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,320
just a lot of stinkers but an anonymous user said

449
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,120
booster seat I got sick of wet dick.

450
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,200
Booster seat booster seat's cool.

451
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,400
Um is it can you adjust the toilet's water level?

452
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,920
I don't know that much about plumbing

453
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,200
but I think it's sort of a one size fits.

454
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,480
It has the right amount.

455
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
I mean it has the proper amount that it stops filling

456
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
when the the I mean bulb goes floats up

457
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
and stops the water flow.

458
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,000
The easy answer.

459
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,920
It's got the right amount it's calibrated.

460
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,720
Yeah fuck it up.

461
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,400
The last thing I wanted to you know how hard it is

462
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
to fix the toilet?

463
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,040
It's not hard but for the purposes of this

464
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,560
let's pretend it's hard to fix the toilet.

465
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,320
You think you know how hard it is to fix the toilet?

466
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
No you're gonna go break one intentionally?

467
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,360
No thank you.

468
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,520
I'm having a weird my brother my brother and me scenario

469
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,560
in which I actually know how to answer this

470
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
but it's not funny?

471
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,520
Get a smaller tank?

472
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
No you fill up a two liter bottle full of water

473
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
you seal it up you stick it in the back there

474
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,120
and that acts as a displacer for water

475
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
so not as much water fills up in the-

476
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,920
Incorrect.

477
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,640
It would displace the water in the tank.

478
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,800
So you wouldn't need to fill as much water in the tank

479
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,600
to fill the tank?

480
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Okay let me ask you this Travis.

481
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't okay in case you missed it

482
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
because Griffin edited it out.

483
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,200
Travis just gave a 30 minute dissertation

484
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,320
on why this would work and I disagreed with him

485
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
on the premise that if I thought it would be funny

486
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
and then it wasn't so that's why you didn't hear it

487
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
but I don't think that you want to start

488
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
I understand that you think that displacing the water

489
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,000
in the toilet tank would help fix this problem

490
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
maybe it would maybe it wouldn't.

491
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
Do you really want to get into like the inner-

492
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
at some point someone made a decision

493
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
that this is how much water it needs

494
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,400
to do the things that it does

495
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
and I don't want to be in a position

496
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,360
where I'm playing judge jury and executioner

497
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,040
on water levels in my potty

498
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,880
I need it to have all the water at once.

499
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,160
You know I just feel like

500
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,280
like maybe we all just need bidets.

501
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
I don't mind getting a little water on my business

502
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,920
on my own terms.

503
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,920
If we could all just never talk about our genitalia again.

504
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,960
That would be so good for me.

505
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,800
I don't know what I was thinking including this one.

506
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,040
It's just I think maybe I just wanted to say hog splash.

507
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,080
I have a problem now that summer has begun.

508
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
I frequently ride my bike up and down my street

509
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,040
during the good weather for some class exercise.

510
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,160
What?

511
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,840
What? However, since-

512
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,720
Wait, hold on.

513
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:38,960
What?

514
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
What is class exercise?

515
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,040
Maybe it means like classy extra-

516
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
class exercise.

517
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,400
Classic?

518
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,320
Classic exercise?

519
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,440
Some classic good old-fashioned exercise.

520
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,320
Okay, whatever.

521
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,080
However, since it's nice and warm

522
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,440
an ice cream truck frequently visits my street too.

523
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
I've found that both of us

524
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,560
me and the ice cream truck man

525
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,160
travel in the same direction.

526
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,400
When this happens I turn around and head home

527
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,280
cutting my workout session a bit shorter than I'd like.

528
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
I would try to pass the truck

529
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,640
but I don't have a stamina

530
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,040
to maintain more than five to seven miles per hour

531
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,400
for my entire street.

532
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,240
Approximately 3.5 miles.

533
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,040
What should I do in the circumstance when we meet again?

534
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,840
That's from Gmail.

535
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,640
Please don't ask us to do long division

536
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
when we're trying to do our comedy show, please.

537
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,800
I cannot even like map this question out in my noggin.

538
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
The problem is that this ice cream truck

539
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
goes approximately the same speed

540
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,960
actually maybe a little bit slower than the bike.

541
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,400
So when you meet up with them

542
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
it's one of those awkward situations

543
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,800
where you can't get around them

544
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,680
they can't get around you

545
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,880
and now you're just like best friends

546
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,760
with the ice cream truck

547
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,920
which doesn't seem that bad to me.

548
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,080
Like maybe what you do is you just roll with it

549
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,400
and you get them to lower the window.

550
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,280
You do maybe a Grey Poupon joke to break the ice.

551
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,880
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,120
And then you find out sort of what they're all about

553
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,640
and now all of a sudden you gotta...

554
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Ice cream truck drivers need friends too.

555
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,600
You think that they don't

556
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,720
because they have the coolest job on the block

557
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,680
but like yeah dude, fuck yeah.

558
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,720
Especially if you could finally discover for me.

559
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
Let's really, I feel like you just got it and loved it

560
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,440
but you didn't.

561
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
You had the coolest job on the block, ice cream?

562
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,720
What do you mean?

563
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,240
There's someone on my block that has a snow code truck

564
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,480
and it's always in the driveway

565
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,160
and it's been a hundred fucking degrees

566
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,080
and every time I see it I get so mad.

567
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,280
Like get out there, do your job.

568
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,760
What are ice cream trucks doing in like February?

569
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,000
Are they like getting on like big like cross transatlantic

570
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
like ocean liners and going to where it's still hot?

571
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,920
Are they like migrating?

572
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,520
This week on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

573
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,360
Thrill is the oldest brother explaining to Miller brother

574
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
about seasonal businesses.

575
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
It's audio poison says.

576
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,960
What's the ice cream truck driver doing the rest of the time?

577
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm selling hot chocolate.

578
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,440
Yeah, true.

579
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
Are you just, it sounds like-

580
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,240
That's a good price.

581
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,040
Cherry kick.

582
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,200
A hot chocolate truck.

583
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Yeah, and in the spring he sells lukewarm apples.

584
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,080
In the fall it's all leaves.

585
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,840
Pretty ones that he found.

586
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,360
Not a lot of business.

587
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
That's not a good time for business

588
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,040
because people can like pick them up anywhere.

589
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,320
They can get anywhere but he put them in a Ziploc bag.

590
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,920
Get your pine cones.

591
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,520
Don't walk around all day collecting your own pine cones.

592
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
I'll give you a bushel full for $5.

593
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,840
God damn, I wish it was hot.

594
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,380
Fuck.

595
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
Global warming can't come soon enough.

596
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,840
Give it to me.

597
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,960
Okay, first off, let's talk about a hot chocolate truck

598
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
because Travis brought it up

599
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,840
and now we have to live here for a second.

600
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
It would be hard to drive around on icy streets, Justin.

601
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,760
Yes, drive around icy streets with a boiling hot liquid.

602
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,920
Standing in lines is another one

603
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,000
that you don't necessarily want to be doing

604
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,760
in that sort of temperature.

605
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,640
You don't want to stay in line.

606
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
But the good news is there will be no demand

607
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,480
so you could probably roll up whatever.

608
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,120
Why?

609
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,800
Why wouldn't you're outside playing?

610
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh, I'm getting a little far.

611
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,400
Oh, hey, it's the hot chocolate truck.

612
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,040
You know what I mean?

613
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,760
Like I think you would do a lot of business.

614
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,400
I'll tell you this,

615
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,760
if it was an open sort of dumpster that they were hauling

616
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,640
that was just chock-a-block full of this hot brown stuff

617
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
and then the smell was wafting through

618
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,960
and just there was a thick marshmallow layer floating on top

619
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
and you got that in the air too,

620
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,680
I would do anything to, man, you just couldn't.

621
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,080
It would be a sort of speed situation though

622
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,760
where you just couldn't brake

623
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,840
or else the cab would be destroyed.

624
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,160
Drenched in that beautiful brown goo.

625
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,680
Hey, listen, that's a good option for you actually.

626
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,120
If this truck was having to stop more for local kids,

627
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,280
you could blow their doors.

628
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,360
Could you put some flyers around the neighborhood?

629
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,560
Don't put any like logos on it

630
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,040
because big ice cream will come for you.

631
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,560
Just like a flyer that says like,

632
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,640
yum, ice cream coming soon.

633
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,800
And you know what I love about that, Justin?

634
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,320
What you love about the first third of it?

635
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,600
I don't know, go ahead and tell me.

636
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,880
I'll tell you in a second.

637
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,320
I didn't have an outro.

638
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,520
Thank you for saving me.

639
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
It's mutually beneficial.

640
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,760
Like this isn't a cruel prank you're playing

641
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,120
on the ice cream truck man.

642
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,360
The ice cream truck man is going to do more business.

643
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,080
Do more business.

644
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, right?

645
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
We need more answers like this

646
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
where it's not like, oh, you're going to like fart

647
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,240
in their face and run away.

648
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,760
That it's like, here's this,

649
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,000
how do you fix your problem and their problem?

650
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,480
Because if they are maintaining a speed

651
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,560
of five to seven miles per hour,

652
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,280
they are not selling their ice cream.

653
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,760
That's right.

654
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,520
Yeah.

655
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
I don't know much about ice cream trucks.

656
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,240
They're wasting gasoline.

657
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,000
It ain't a business on the go.

658
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,920
They ain't chucking it like the paper boy.

659
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
Listen, you guys help me write,

660
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
I want to hear your flyers for ice cream.

661
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,960
And remember, no brand names, no logos.

662
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,240
We're not going to jail for this.

663
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,560
We're just trying to gin up some interest

664
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,600
in an ice cream truck that's coming through soon.

665
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,640
So what would your,

666
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
what would your flyer for ice cream say?

667
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,160
Love hot chocolate trucks, but miss them in the summer.

668
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,640
Good news.

669
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,880
Yes.

670
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,200
It's a great thing because you get a lot of cross promotion

671
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,440
for your summer and winter business.

672
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,160
Yeah, yeah.

673
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
It's just the pine cones.

674
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,440
I don't know how you gin up interest in those

675
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,040
in the pine cone business.

676
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,000
My flyer would be very, I mean, sex sells.

677
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,560
So I'm talking about a hot bod like Ryan Phillippe

678
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,400
holding the cone of, it would be soft serve,

679
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,920
which would be probably false advertising

680
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,760
because they probably don't have that in the truck,

681
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,440
but you know, dripping, dripping down the nucks

682
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,640
and just as like creamy and then an arrow

683
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,960
to where the truck is at any given time.

684
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
I don't know how that technology works, but.

685
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,960
Yeah, in a print, in a paper, I don't know how you.

686
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,840
Yeah, I tell you what I do,

687
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,680
I'd be a lot more effective than a flyers.

688
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,680
I'd probably write lyrics to the ice cream truck song

689
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,040
that plays and just be positive.

690
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,680
I think most of them do, do your ears hang low,

691
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,480
but I would write sort of ice cream themed lyrics.

692
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,040
Like, do you want ice cream?

693
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,320
It's a creamy, creamy treat.

694
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,600
It's so creamy soft.

695
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
It's so creamy sweet.

696
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,240
We got it's a caduzis.

697
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,280
We got push pops to come get your ice cream.

698
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,520
Don't go to school.

699
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
Okay, well, all right.

700
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,960
Come and get your ice cream.

701
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,920
Eat it with your friends.

702
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,800
When you eat ice cream, the cream never ends.

703
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Come and get all the ice cream that we have in our truck.

704
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,720
You are gonna love it now.

705
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
You're gonna love this truck.

706
00:29:59,600 --> 00:29:59,920
Okay.

707
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,760
Okay, just kind of rhymes with truck.

708
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,040
Come and buy all the ice cream.

709
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,480
It's a dollar if you want it.

710
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,760
What are you doing?

711
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,640
What are you doing?

712
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,200
What?

713
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
He was like, he was remixing.

714
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,000
He was being, you know, like hype man.

715
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,680
Trying to like hype it and remix it.

716
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,760
Oh yeah, you can beatbox alongside the truck too.

717
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,240
This song.

718
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,520
Oh, that's what the, yeah, bicyclist person.

719
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,840
You're gonna be this ice cream truck's hype man.

720
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,480
Yeah, you could also sing.

721
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
It's really fun to make up ice cream lyrics.

722
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,600
Have you guys ever tried to make up ice cream lyrics?

723
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:29,920
No.

724
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,640
To do your years hang low?

725
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,280
Juice, you want to try make up ice cream lyrics?

726
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,960
Yeah, I'd love to do that.

727
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:46,640
Do an ice cream song to do your years hang low.

728
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,920
Do you want sun cream?

729
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,720
You said dreamy, screamy cream.

730
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,880
And the chocolate flavor or vanilla bean or pistachio is good, but not as good as brown.

731
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,960
Brown?

732
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,120
That classic ice cream flavor, brown?

733
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,760
Do you want ice cream before you even ask?

734
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,320
Yes, they do have brown and it takes you to task.

735
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,520
It's a tastiest flavor.

736
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,240
It's a color.

737
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,040
It is too.

738
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,880
And come get your brown stuff.

739
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,920
Come on, doodle doo.

740
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
Do you have brown?

741
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,120
Sorry, we're all sold out.

742
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,640
No.

743
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,840
It's the only one we mentioned by name in the ice cream song.

744
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:33,440
Let's get the money down.

745
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:41,440
I want to tell y'all about Stitch Fix because hot damn, I have got some nice shirts.

746
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,640
I've got some real nice clothing from the Stitch Fix, a lot of my wardrobe now.

747
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,360
I got, I'll tell you what, I didn't, I never really prioritize fashion in the summertime.

748
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,720
It was more of a fall, winter, early spring thing for me.

749
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,000
You know, I like a long pant and like a nice button down, you know, flannel or sweater,

750
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
but I didn't really do it in the summertime.

751
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,200
Stitch Fix has fixed my shit right up because they've given me the short sleeve shirts and

752
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,720
really nice shorts and just good looks all year round.

753
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,160
Just because a sense of style can be elusive for some doesn't mean it's impossible to attain.

754
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,920
You can discover the style you never knew you had with a little help from Stitch Fix.

755
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,160
You just answer some questions about your style and you're like,

756
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,200
you just answer some questions about your sizes, your favorite styles and budget,

757
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,200
and your personal stylist will hand select five brand new clothing items just for you.

758
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,360
I'm on like a, like a four box streak of keeping everything.

759
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,600
Yeah, me too.

760
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,440
They have got my shit like dialed in.

761
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,560
But if you don't like something-

762
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,160
Can I tell you another thing that I really love about Stitch Fix is because of that personal

763
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,600
stylist thing, there's a consistency to it, not just in quality, but like I just went to

764
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,120
Louisville this past weekend and hung out with some friends and I got complimented on my outfit

765
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,720
and I realized the shoes, the pants, the shirt and the jacket I was wearing were from four

766
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,920
different Stitch Fix boxes and they all just work together so well.

767
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,200
But if you ever get something you're not feeling, you can send it back and shipping is free both

768
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,960
ways and you only pay for what you keep.

769
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,800
You get your fix whenever you want or you can sign up to receive scheduled shipments.

770
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,000
So hurry to stitchfix.com slash my brother to get started now.

773
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,520
I also want to tell you about Audible.

774
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,200
I am an audiobook fan.

775
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,520
No lie, no joke, no exaggeration.

776
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,040
I prefer them to books, to reading.

777
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,160
And let me tell you why.

778
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,680
In this day and age, I find it hard to find time, especially like with BB and with driving

779
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,080
around and you know, just living my life, hard to find time to like, I'm going to sit

780
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,320
down and find time to read.

781
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,560
But I can put on a book while I'm driving, I can put on a book while I'm working and

782
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,960
listen to it while I'm typing away, working on stuff.

783
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,680
And not only that, there's something I really love about listening to authors read their

784
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,760
own books, especially when it comes to like memoirs and like that kind of thing.

785
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,320
And Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet will let you fill your summer

786
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,760
with more stories like here's, I will tell you, I was on a Sarah Val kick.

787
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:20,000
I highly recommend Wordy Shipmates and Strange Fishes and Lafayette and the Somewhat United

788
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,320
States.

789
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,000
If you enjoy like the characters from Hamilton, you will enjoy Lafayette and the Somewhat

790
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,720
United States.

791
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,240
And plus, Sarah Val reads the book mostly herself, but also like the quotes and stuff

792
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,480
are the parts, you might say, is done by like other performers.

793
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,400
So like John Hodgman makes some appearances in there.

794
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
John Slattery makes some appearances in there.

795
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,360
It's really great.

796
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,360
Speaking of John Hodgman, Vacationland is a really good audiobook.

797
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,880
Do you guys have any that you are thoroughly enjoying?

798
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:04,240
I listened to Room to Dream, the new David Lynch memoir, which he wrote with a traditional

799
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,600
memoirist, I guess.

800
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,240
And then he writes like the response to the traditional memoir chapter.

801
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,600
And so it's like you get you hear a professional memoir person say, talk about the first years

802
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,000
of David Lynch's life as a young boy.

803
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,840
And then you hear about David Lynch tells you a long story about when he hit a dead

804
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,920
cow with a pitchfork and hit himself in the head because it bounced right off for about

805
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,720
30 minutes.

806
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
So it's fantastic.

807
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:42,400
So go to audible.com slash my brother or text my brother to 500-500 to get started.

808
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,080
Amazon Prime members can get Audible for just $4.95 a month for the first three months.

809
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,480
That's like getting three months for the price of one.

810
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,040
And after that, it's only $14.95 a month.

811
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,600
Now, this offer ends July 31st, 2018.

00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,640

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
Go check it out.

816
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,280
Well, we got some some Jumbotrons here as well.

817
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,720
This first one is taken credit for, F-O-R, is a new to the scene YouTube channel where

818
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,800
four friends play video games, really dive deep into what can be considered a playable

819
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,960
game if you care for comedy and quality content.

820
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
They've got it all.

821
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,360
That's all of it.

822
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:27,840
That's all.

823
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,560
I enjoy that.

824
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,480
That's really great.

825
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
If you like a lot.

826
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,560
Oh, no, they don't say a lot.

827
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,440
So if you like comedy and quality content, and they can't guarantee a lot of it, then

828
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,160
you're great.

829
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,680
They have all of it, though.

830
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,880
Where is that credit for?

831
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,520
Where is that credit for it's just search YouTube for taking credit for all one word

832
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,040
and you can catch it.

833
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
It's also on Facebook and Instagram.

834
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
I don't know why Justin didn't.

835
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,160
Justin's beefing with with the book.

836
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,520
I'm not trying to like focus them down where this I feel like this is going to help them

837
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,160
the most.

838
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,280
I listen.

839
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,800
You're right.

840
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,160
They did say that in the ad, and I guess I should include that as well that it's on it.

841
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,400
They're on Instagram and Facebook taking credit for all one word.

842
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,800
Go follow and subscribe.

843
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,080
Here's a another Jumbotron.

844
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,480
This one's for Beth Curtin, and it's from Nicholas Bale, who says, Hello, lover.

845
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,880
Since our no, it's good.

846
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,480
Since our first date in a board game.

847
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,240
Yeah, since our first date in a board game cafe, bonding over the antics of the McRoy

848
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,800
bros.

849
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,640
You've been an amazing part of my life for over a year now and have never failed to make

850
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,360
me smile.

851
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,440
You're an incredible lady and I love you.

852
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,080
Here are some many more days spent playing video games and watching silly YouTube videos.

853
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:45,440
So this is a nice sweet message and Charlie Bit My Finger is a great YouTube video.

854
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,480
I don't know if y'all are looking for recommendations, but Charlie Bit My Finger is great.

855
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,920
There's a kid and he gets bit and I guess he's from like a different country because

856
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,120
his voice is different from mine.

857
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,960
And there's also History of Dance.

858
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,080
Have you seen the one with the cat and it's acting really weird?

859
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,360
Like a cat doesn't normally act.

860
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,640
No, no, I've never seen that.

861
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,520
It's really good.

862
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,400
I think if you just like search cat in the YouTube search, you'll find it.

863
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,640
Sure.

864
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,760
So he's like, Charlie.

865
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,000
Have you seen Charlie Bit My Cat?

866
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,880
He does a whole series of Charlie Bit My blank and it's like, Charlie bit my textbook.

867
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,000
Charlie bit my sandwich.

868
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,960
That one's not that good.

869
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,520
That's just a kid eating a sandwich.

870
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,120
They actually have a live stream now where both the kids are 30 and they just bite each

871
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,240
other for two hours every day while playing Minecraft.

872
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
Still sound like that though, just like Charlie.

873
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Charlie.

874
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,840
Charlie bit my style.

875
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,440
Kind of a Christopher Walken, like Charlie bit me.

876
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,480
That's Christopher Walken.

877
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,600
They did one where Charlie bit my bite and that was really weird and I didn't care for

878
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:51,840
it.

879
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,480
He tried to bite but he countered it with a counter bite.

880
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,480
It's a great injustice that Charlie Bit My Finger has so many views and I can't believe

881
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,800
you've done this, it only has like a million.

882
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,440
True.

883
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,400
It's just not fair.

884
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,040
He's from somewhere else too.

885
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
We got one more Jumbotron though.

886
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,840
Is that my turn?

887
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,040
It is, okay.

888
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,520
This is for current Jessica from past Jessica.

889
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,360
Hey Jessica, I know you're worried about a lot right now but it's going to be okay.

890
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,040
Everything always turns out all right in the end if you just wait long enough.

891
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,720
Just keep waiting and in the meantime, don't stop vibing and keeping it tight.

892
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
Also, work on your thesis.

893
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,160
That's great.

894
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,960
Everyone should always be vibing it, keeping it tight and just getting ready for that thesis

895
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,080
because you may not think you'll need it right now, it'll creep up on you.

896
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,120
Oh, you'll wake up in the middle of the night, your thesis ain't done due tomorrow, you're

897
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,200
going to have a real Bart's nightmare on your hands.

898
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:55,040
Maximum Fun's new sci-fi comedy podcast Bubble is coming to San Diego Comic Con on July 21st.

899
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,840
At 1pm, Bubble cast members Travis McElroy, Cristela Alonzo, Eliza Skinner, Allison Becker,

900
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,320
Mike Mitchell, Jordan Morris and Danielle Radford will be signing autographs.

901
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,200

902
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,160
Then at 5pm, the cast will participate in a panel moderated by Jesse Thorn, held at

903
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,400

904
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:29,200
For more information, visit MaximumFun.org slash SDCC.

905
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,880
So we have an exciting treat right now.

906
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,800
If you didn't listen to our Margaritaville premiere debacle, was that fair?

907
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,280
Calamity.

908
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,880
Calamity, yeah.

909
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,560
Yeah, we had an embarrassing moment with Mary Lou Henner, a beloved stage and screen actress

910
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,080
Mary Lou Henner, an author.

911
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,000
We'll recount the incident in full detail during our discussion with you.

912
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,600
That's a great thing to do, actually, if you have an embarrassing moment with somebody

913
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,680
is to recount it in full detail.

914
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
We don't need to do that because Mary Lou Henner has a perfect memory.

915
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,440
But she was nice enough to come talk to us about that experience and give advice on your

916
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,320
questions and so much more.

917
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,600
So without further ado, here's our discussion with a special guestpert, Mary Lou Henner.

918
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,960
Folks, our very special guestpert for this episode is star of stage and screen.

919
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,920
American icon, Mary Lou Henner.

920
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,480
Mary Lou Henner, welcome to my brother, my brother and me.

921
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,080
I love you guys so much.

922
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,920
Well, first of all, I love family and, you know, you're just so funny.

923
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,280
I just love your humor.

924
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,400
And I was saying to you before we started that my son, who's 22, just graduated from

925
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,920
Northwestern, his friends, they all listen to you guys.

926
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,040
And it has definitely helped my street cred with his gang.

927
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,320
So thank you for that.

928
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:55,760
Mary Lou, your first exposure to our wild, fun humor sensibilities was on the Margaritaville

929
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,920
red carpet, sorry, blue carpet, which I asked you what your favorite sea creature was.

930
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,360
You said Ursula, a perfectly acceptable response.

931
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,560
And then I screamed in your face for no apparent reason other than I was very, very nervous.

932
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,720
As if you were a football game that just was very excited that his team had just gotten

933
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,400
a big touchdown or something.

934
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,040
Well, thank you.

935
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,440
Thank you.

936
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,000
I felt like, oh, was that a funny response?

937
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,160
I was being very serious.

938
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,640
One question.

939
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,480
What do you think the scariest sea creature is?

940
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,280
Ursula from Little Mermaid.

941
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,480
Yes, that's a good answer.

942
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,360
Yes, thank you.

943
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,160
Thank you, Ms. Henner.

944
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,640
You crushed it.

945
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,040
What I think you were seeing there was Justin, like a teapot, releasing some of his pressure

946
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,440
of like being very nervous and you giving a very good answer.

947
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,760
And so for Justin, it was just this moment of like steam escaping, like, yes.

948
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,880
Well, I endeared you to me forever.

949
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,640
The day we'd had, Al Roker screamed at us.

950
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,400
The 60 Minutes guy screamed at us, just yelled at our face.

951
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,440
It was a very difficult, challenging day for everybody.

952
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,320
Well, come on.

953
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,400
You know, red carpets are crazy.

954
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,320
I mean, everybody's screaming at everybody.

955
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,200
And you never know if you're in somebody else's shot or, you know,

956
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,480
tape recorder or whatever, microphone.

957
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,280
And so what happens is you feel like, oh, I just said that answer.

958
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,920
Did they hear it?

959
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,640
Did they record it?

960
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,400
Did they, you know, is that why they're calling me over?

961
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,560
And nobody asked me about sea creatures, though.

962
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,160
So you guys were original.

963
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,640
So nice.

964
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,360
Wait, no, hold on.

965
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,560
Wait, nobody else?

966
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:22,880
No.

967
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,800
Nobody else asked you about sea creatures?

968
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,840
No, they weren't clever.

969
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,560
They ask the same stupid questions all the time.

970
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,600
So you guys have to come to Getting the Band Back Together opening night,

971
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:31,760
though.

972
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,120
It's August 13th.

973
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,400
We have to arrange that.

974
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,600
You have to do that.

975
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,640
Now that you've seen what we can do, like, you've got to have us.

976
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,360
Oh, my god.

977
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,840
Now you've seen our raw talent on the red carpet.

978
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,120
And the show is very much like, you know, about you guys.

979
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,760
So, yeah.

980
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,440
The show's about, OK.

981
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,880
Whoa, you wrote a show about us?

982
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,680
You didn't even know.

983
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,200
That's how fast I absorbed your, you know, sensibility.

984
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,560
You brought up your show.

985
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,320
Can you tell us about it real quick before we get into helping you?

986
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,800
Sure, sure, sure.

987
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,120
Yeah, we open August 13th at the Belasco Theater.

988
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,480
It's called Getting the Band Back Together.

989
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,120
It's about a guy who gets fired from Wall Street.

990
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,720
He had this high school band.

991
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,800
They won the battle of the bands in high school.

992
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,720
He took off for, you know, Wall Street.

993
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,480
He now has to come back, live with his mom.

994
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,440
That's the part I'm playing.

995
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,880
And she's an ex-rocker, hung out with Aerosmith and a bunch of other bands.

996
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,120
So she's excited to have him home.

997
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,880
They have to do another battle of the bands to beat the guy again that they beat last time.

998
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,400
So they have to get the band together.

999
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,480
One of the guys is a dermatologist.

1000
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,200
One's a teacher.

1001
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,840
One's a cop.

1002
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,800
One has passed away.

1003
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,160
So they've got this 16-year-old phenom.

1004
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,000
And, you know, so it's a battle.

1005
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,200
It's really fun.

1006
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,600
I thought you were going to say, so they've got a ghost.

1007
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,760
When you said one passed away, I thought, and then there's a ghost

1008
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,520
bringing up the back of the band.

1009
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,000
No, no, they have a young guy who's ridiculous.

1010
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,480
I hope he's got a long contract because they're going to, you know, he's a phenom.

1011
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,120
He is.

1012
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:02,720
And the lead singer of the band is, if you guys remember, Keith Stone from the Keystone ads.

1013
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,680
I was so excited to see him back in the biz.

1014
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,160
And also-

1015
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,760
Oh, he's A Rock of Ages.

1016
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,960
He was in A Rock of Ages.

1017
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,240
Oh, he was in A Rock of Ages.

1018
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,360
I didn't realize that.

1019
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,320
He's so good.

1020
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,600
Mitch Jarvis.

1021
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,400
He's amazing.

1022
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,520
He's just amazing.

1023
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,840
We should hop into the questions before we do it.

1024
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,040
Did you get some good ones?

1025
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,240
Did you get some good questions?

1026
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,640
We did.

1027
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,280
Thank you to our listeners who sent some good ones in.

1028
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,840
In the interest of full disclosure, we should mention we have spoken on the phone before also,

1029
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:34,640
and it took all of about four minutes before you had us talking about our actual sex lives.

1030
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,080
So I'm kind of buckled up, strapped in, ready for whatever, for wherever this goes.

1031
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,560
Okay, so we asked people for questions about memory and posing for a great photo

1032
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,960
because these are the things that we are completely wholly ignorant of.

1033
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,280
So we have a wide array of questions.

1034
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,240
I'm going to get into the first one.

1035
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,800
I have a really good memory, particularly for names and faces,

1036
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,720
which often leads to people saying,

1037
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,720
Hi, I'm so-and-so, nice to meet you.

1038
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,360
And me responded, I know, we've met before.

1039
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,680
And then recounting in detail our last meeting.

1040
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,680
People are always taken aback by how much I remember and I feel like such a jerk.

1041
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,920
Do you have any advice on how to handle this better?

1042
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,920
Is there anything I could say in response that'll make the situation less awkward?

1043
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,840
Oh, that's from weirding people out in Washington, D.C.

1044
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,560
We use handles here on the show so people don't have to reveal their shame.

1045
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,360
They really are.

1046
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:27,680
Okay.

1047
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,040
Well, first of all, maybe you should be tested by the people who do all the testing

1048
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,600
about highly superior autobiographical memory

1049
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,120
because it sounds like you're somebody who really has an incredible memory.

1050
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,240
Because, you know, here's the thing.

1051
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,920
Most people don't remember anything.

1052
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,640
They remember eight to 11 events within any given year,

1053
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,520
which is really kind of sad when you think about how many days there are in a year and a leap year.

1054
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,840
That feels like so many events to me.

1055
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,800
I can't remember eight to 11 events a year.

1056
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,480
Mary Lou, I really live in the moment.

1057
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,120
You know what I mean?

1058
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:55,760
That's it.

1059
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,880
I mean, you hope you're living in the moment, but you can still record.

1060
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,400
It can still be recorded.

1061
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,360
We've just gotten really lazy about recording.

1062
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,960
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

1063
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm so lazy.

1064
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,840
Well, this is what I think.

1065
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,680
First of all, you should celebrate the fact that you remember.

1066
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,800
And I think it's your tone.

1067
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,920
If you're very like me, me, me, me, me, me about the person like,

1068
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,400
oh, you know, Europe, can we can we swear on this?

1069
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,520
So if you're like, fuck you, I remember you.

1070
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,640
You don't remember me.

1071
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,680
That's not good.

1072
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,440
You know, what you should probably do is you should probably just be like,

1073
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,560
oh, no, remember this and and try to prompt their memory.

1074
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,840
Because here's the thing.

1075
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,960
Everything anybody's been through is on their emotional hard drive,

1076
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,360
and they would will remember with a little prompting.

1077
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,040
So what you have to do is prompt them and sort of do a little memory,

1078
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,360
you know, trip together.

1079
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,080
You know what I mean?

1080
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,000
It's like really fun when you get somebody going with their memory

1081
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,720
rather than taking like a superior position.

1082
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,320
So let me get this straight, Mary Lou.

1083
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,360
You say we take the person, we look in the person's eyes,

1084
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,800
we take their hand and we say, I know you think I'm a stranger to you,

1085
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,040
but I'm going to take you on a memory journey with me.

1086
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,280
Get in the back seat.

1087
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,800
We're going together.

1088
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Philadelphia, 1987.

1089
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,840
Do you smell these?

1090
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,040
These are French fries.

1091
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,480
What is this to remind you of?

1092
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,920
Right. Or you just, you know, you kind of have fun with them and stuff.

1093
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,600
I love doing this.

1094
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,080
People always, until I was on 60 Minutes talking about having an unusual memory,

1095
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,120
people always thought like, man, I must be really special to her.

1096
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,120
You know, but everybody's special to everybody.

1097
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,880
We just don't always remember that.

1098
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,960
So I think you should celebrate it.

1099
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,240
Get them involved in the remembering and don't pick up on their, you know,

1100
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,600
don't insult them.

1101
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,320
And then you won't pick up like you're being insulted.

1102
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,040
Do you know what I mean?

1103
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,120
Yeah, don't don't insult them as a pretty good general rule for other stuff, too.

1104
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,520
I've I found you mentioned getting tested for the like super autobiographical memory.

1105
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,320
And I was curious, is there a sort of Hogwarts like procedure where if you find out that you

1106
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,560
do possess this superpower, you get to go to like a special academy and hang out with other

1107
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,640
like super memorable people?

1108
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,760
Well, there aren't that many.

1109
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,200
There aren't that many people who have it.

1110
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,640
And we've only gotten a few of us have only gotten together once.

1111
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,840
But it's funny you say Hogwarts because you remember every second of that meeting, the

1112
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,080
most remembered meeting ever.

1113
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,800
Yeah, it's fun.

1114
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:25,440
You know, if you if it's something you're born with, you sort of celebrate it anyway.

1115
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,520
But it's not like you go to Hogwarts.

1116
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,200
It's just that they do wire you put you through an MRI and take 300 measurements of your brain.

1117
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,880
And they also put you they see how the neural pathways fire up.

1118
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,840
And it's pretty crazy.

1119
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,480
You feel and then when you see the MRIs, they're pretty nuts.

1120
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,040
That's actually what the sorting hat is doing.

1121
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,480
It is actually it is actually giving you an MRI.

1122
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:46,640
Yeah.

1123
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,400
I have a question for you.

1124
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:48,720
Sure.

1125
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,200
And if you can't answer this, I understand.

1126
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,800
But once your memory thing became public and came to light, how often have you been approached

1127
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,000
by intelligence organizations trying to recruit you as a spy?

1128
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,120
Oh, that happened.

1129
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,200
Have you done any spying for America?

1130
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,440
No, I wish I wish I wish somebody would like that part of my brain.

1131
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,360
But you know, they have me memorizing lines instead and singing.

1132
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,560
You definitely you definitely couldn't tell us even if you were.

1133
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah, that's definitely the answer you would give even if you were.

1134
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,480
Yeah.

1135
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,440
Here's another question.

1136
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,760
Okay.

1137
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,280
They say, Hello, I just had to get my photo taken for the author's jacket flap on my first

1138
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,240
published book.

1139
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,560
I never get I never get my photo taken.

1140
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,960
Any advice on how you look so great in your pics?

1141
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,400
And that's from LCO.

1142
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,800
Okay, here's my theory on taking your picture.

1143
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,040
Do it a lot so that you're not freaked out when you only see it once.

1144
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,600
There are times when the lighting is bad, you're it's the wrong camera angle.

1145
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,600
You don't you know, you hate the photographer, the photographer shoots late.

1146
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,760
So you're coming down from an expression.

1147
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,120
I mean, probably the best advice I ever got about taking a picture was from Burt Reynolds,

1148
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,120
who told us all the first day of Evening Shade that we all took pictures together.

1149
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,000
He said, when you take a photograph, you look into the camera lens, and you feel like you

1150
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,840
want to fuck the photographer.

1151
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:13,040
And because if you know, because if you do, or I guess he's there were little kids.

1152
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,760
So he said, you want to, you know, you love the photographer.

1153
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,760
If you want to hug the photographer, I bet he still said fuck.

1154
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,640
But it's like your eyes soften, you look like, you know, your your face is relaxed,

1155
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,280
you feel like you're playing to the camera.

1156
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,480
So it really is important every time you look at the photographer and you feel like I want

1157
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,320
to how often do you get your photo taken?

1158
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:44,320
Oh, like how many times a day should we do probably yesterday, at least 5060 times?

1159
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,120
Wow, oh my god, I'm so far behind.

1160
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,720
You know what you have to do, you have to do it a lot.

1161
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,840
And here's the thing.

1162
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,480
Think of like the middle of the photograph as something that you turn into.

1163
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,880
So if you're on the outside, let's say you're on the right side of the frame, the camera,

1164
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,400
you know, this the cameras pointing at you and your it and your right hand is, you know,

1165
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,440
you're on the far right of that photograph camera left, but no, yeah, camera left, but

1166
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,680
you know, okay, I'm holding my camera up.

1167
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,000
You got it.

1168
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,640
You got it.

1169
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,200
All right.

1170
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,920
Always tilt your body sort of toward the center, because that's going to be better than if you

1171
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,720
turn away.

1172
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,160
I learned that from going on The Tonight Show and things like that.

1173
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,400
You always cross the leg toward the host because that's the center.

1174
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,640
You know, so I'm posing in Skype, is it sort of like this and kind of across arms?

1175
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,400
First of all, you're by yourself.

1176
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,840
So it's a little different.

1177
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,600
But and also you should face the light.

1178
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,520
I don't know how to get another person here.

1179
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,560
I got my cat.

1180
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,200
Okay, I see.

1181
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,160
I see what you're doing.

1182
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,400
Okay.

1183
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:42,800
Yeah.

1184
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,040
Okay.

1185
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,960
So let's say, yeah, what you do is you you sort of move toward the center.

1186
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,000
You angle your body toward the center, I guess, for me.

1187
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,800
But you can't see my biceps that I'm flexing there.

1188
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,960
If I turn, I lose the biceps.

1189
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,720
No, no, no, put your body but put your biceps like square off your biceps to the camera.

1190
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,320
But put your tilt your body.

1191
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,040
No, you do the exact opposite.

1192
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,560
I'm covering my face very low.

1193
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,000
This is good radio.

1194
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,400
I will say I feel very much like the listeners right now.

1195
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,480
I'm getting a wonderful audio experience.

1196
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,200
Here's my advice.

1197
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,640
Stop using filters because you're going to be so fooled by them.

1198
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,120
What you have to do is you have to just find the right kind of light and experiment with

1199
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:24,640
what your better side is, your better lighting is because and try to stay on the inside of

1200
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,000
the picture rather than the outside.

1201
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,280
The people further out are always going to look distorted.

1202
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,040
Just a follow up vis a vis looking like you want to fuck the photographer.

1203
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,120
For this specific example of getting your photo taken for a book sleeve or book cover,

1204
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,000
is that going to be troubling to the people who purchase the book and open it up and say,

1205
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,280
let's learn about the author.

1206
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,360
Wow, they really look like they want to have sex with me, the person who's reading their

1207
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,320
book because that carries over to every other person who sees the photo.

1208
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,120
Yes, doesn't everybody want to feel like they're wanted?

1209
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:55,840
Of course.

1210
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,400
I mean, you know, you don't have to use the foul language, but you want somebody who's

1211
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,320
inviting to you and someone who looks like they like you and someone who feels like they're

1212
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,840
comfortable and their eyes are soft.

1213
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,720
Come on.

1214
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,680
You're going to start looking at all photographs and saying, did that person feel comfortable

1215
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,960
with the photographer?

1216
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,080
Are they sending something to the camera?

1217
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,320
All right.

1218
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,360
You know how there's this thing on Twitter right now called BDE?

1219
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:19,760
Do you know?

1220
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,240
Yes.

1221
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:20,800
OK.

1222
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,320
Let's get into it.

1223
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,800
I'm completely ignorant of it, Mary Lunar.

1224
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,760
What is BDE?

1225
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,440
This bugs me.

1226
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:29,600
All right.

1227
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,320
Let me just tell you.

1228
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,200
So there's this whole thing about people who have, you know, big dick energy and they're

1229
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
talking about, oh, but women can have it, too.

1230
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,440
All right.

1231
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,280
First of all, why don't we call it something else?

1232
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,680
So for years in my family, because I have two brothers, I grew up with two brothers,

1233
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,520
three sisters, we have always called it PF.

1234
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,120
It's PF.

1235
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,440
That's what we call it because it can be male or female.

1236
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,160
PF.

1237
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:57,360
PF measures the sexual quotient of somebody and it doesn't matter what they look like.

1238
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,200
It doesn't matter what their age is.

1239
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,400
It doesn't matter anything.

1240
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,920
It's like what radiates from them that makes you feel like, wow, that person really has

1241
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,400
it.

1242
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,480
And you can talk about it in a movie sense like, oh, those two had no PF together or

1243
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,120
a restaurant.

1244
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,520
Wow, that restaurant devoid of PF or wow, there was so much PF in that room.

1245
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:15,760
OK.

1246
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,160
And what PF stands for, not BDE.

1247
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,800
Yes, please.

1248
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,760
Oh, oh.

1249
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,720
Can you guess?

1250
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,200
I won't.

1251
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,320
I shan't.

1252
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:22,960
I shan't.

1253
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,440
Can I say things on this show?

1254
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,680
Say all things are permitted.

1255
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,400
So I'll tell you the F is for factor.

1256
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:30,960
Popcorn.

1257
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,480
I think I need to know what it is.

1258
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,760
Was it popcorn?

1259
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,720
Was it popcorn?

1260
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:34,960
No.

1261
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,960
It's penis factor or pussy factor.

1262
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,520
OK.

1263
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:37,760
Yeah.

1264
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,400
And now you have to never say it again.

1265
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:41,840
OK.

1266
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,200
Or pumpkin factor.

1267
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,600
Because I get a latte at Starbucks sometimes and I'm going to think, I wish this had some

1268
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,720
PF in it.

1269
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,120
And that's just the pumpkin factor that they add.

1270
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,160
What about just pubic, just pubic factor.

1271
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,280
Pubic factor.

1272
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,320
That would apply to everyone.

1273
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,520
Well, it's not as attractive a word as the other two, I think.

1274
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,920
No, listen, it's definitely not.

1275
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,160
Yeah.

1276
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,760
Well, to certain people, I bet, like Burt Reynolds, I bet would be a huge, for whatever

1277
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,720
reason, it just resonates with me that he would find that very cool.

1278
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,440
He knows about PF.

1279
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:13,920
He knows about PF.

1280
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,640
Listen, there's kids around, so I'm going to say pubic factor.

1281
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,000
I have another question about memory here.

1282
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,320
OK.

1283
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,280
And this is, I would love the answer to this one if you have it.

1284
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,600
How do you stop remembering the most embarrassing moments of your life?

1285
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,080
That's from lasting middle school memories from Los Angeles.

1286
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,480
OK.

1287
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,400
We got a lot of questions to this effect.

1288
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,800
OK.

1289
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,040
Here.

1290
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,160
Here's the thing.

1291
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,400
Memory is tied to adrenaline.

1292
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,800
So you always remember the highs and the lows.

1293
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,480
You always remember the good, great things that happened to you, whether like the birth

1294
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:46,480
of a baby or a marriage or the first kiss or a hot date or an award or promotion, things

1295
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:46,960
like that.

1296
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,320
And you're also going to remember all those low things, a bad breakup, anything bad that

1297
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:57,200
happens to you, being embarrassed, whatever, a death in the family, all the bad stuff,

1298
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,160
all the good stuff.

1299
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,600
It's when you really develop your autobiographical memory, you get to bring back all of those

1300
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,760
middle of the road memories that aren't really super tied to adrenaline.

1301
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:14,320
So that's why it's so good to develop that other part of you, the middle stuff, your

1302
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,920
autobiographical memory.

1303
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,520
And so here's the thing.

1304
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,120
You're going to remember those things, but what you have to do is don't back away from

1305
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,680
them.

1306
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,240
You know, it's like if the more you see a scary movie, the more you understand, like,

1307
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,800
OK, I know right around the corner this is going to happen.

1308
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,040
And the less scary it becomes, people like back off from those memories and they don't

1309
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,000
want to look at them.

1310
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,760
But ignoring them is like saying, hey, I'm reading this book.

1311
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,400
Something bad happens to somebody in Chapter 10, so I'm not going to read Chapter 10.

1312
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,240
It really informs the rest of the book.

1313
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,680
Did you have to work on your memory, Mary Lou, or did you just realize like, whoa, I

1314
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,520
remember a lot more than most people?

1315
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,320
Well, at six years old, I used to fall asleep saying, OK, what did I do a year ago in kindergarten?

1316
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,800
What did I do when I was in my little brother Lauren's age?

1317
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,440
You know, and I just it was so easy for me that I just kind of had fun with it and would

1318
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,880
do time travel.

1319
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,280
And I still kind of do that with my life.

1320
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,040
You know, if I'm having trouble falling asleep, I'll go through, you know, where was I in

1321
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,040
my second marriage?

1322
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,160
I'm in my third marriage.

1323
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,800
Where was I in my second marriage on this very same day?

1324
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,440
You know, or what was I doing when I was exactly to the day as old as my son or, you know,

1325
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,240
either of my sons?

1326
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,680
So, yeah, it was something that I had fun with.

1327
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,040
It wasn't like I had to work on it.

1328
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,080
Wait, if memory is tied to adrenaline, Mary Lou Henner, are you just like jacked on adrenaline

1329
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,040
24-7?

1330
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,800
Like, anytime we see you, is that the deal?

1331
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,880
Are you just like pumping out?

1332
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,960
Are you like skydiving constantly?

1333
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,520
Sort of a Jason Statham crank scenario where you're just constantly stoked.

1334
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,040
I, you know, maybe.

1335
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,880
When I was a little girl, my mother took me to the doctor's and say, her clothes keep

1336
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,920
breaking at the seams.

1337
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,640
What's going on?

1338
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,640
And he said, she just has a lot of energy.

1339
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,000
Her energy fields.

1340
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,440
She just, you know, breaks up clothes.

1341
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,200
Her BDE is just off the charts.

1342
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:55,700
Yeah, right.

1343
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,920
I have a question here.

1344
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,760
Let's wrap up with this one.

1345
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:09,440
Andrew asked, and this may be not great, but Andrew asked, what happened on April 25th,

1346
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,240
1983?

1347
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,920
Why is he asking about that date?

1348
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,280
That must be when he was born.

1349
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,400
That must be when he was born.

1350
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,000
Yes, that's what I think.

1351
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,680
Yeah, yeah, probably.

1352
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,800
Okay, first of all, it was a Monday, April 25th, 1983, right?

1353
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,840
Yeah, it was a Monday.

1354
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:30,480
And I was shooting the movie, The Man Who Loved Women in Los Angeles.

1355
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,960
Taxi had just ended and I was doing my first project with Burt Reynolds.

1356
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,400
His name came up again.

1357
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,280
It was directed by Blake Edwards and I played one of a group of women that was involved

1358
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,000
with him in the film.

1359
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,560
So that must be his birthday.

1360
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,760
Must be a special day.

1361
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,800
How about this one also?

1362
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,480
Because that one was a shorty.

1363
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,600
Juice, you have the question list up, right?

1364
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:54,800
Yes, I do.

1365
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,200
It was a Monday.

1366
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,080
Holy crap.

1367
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,680
Oh, no, you can't stump me.

1368
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,120
I was on a radio show and they were trying to give tickets away.

1369
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,840
And after 22 calls, you know, try to stump me.

1370
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,240
I'd say, just give away the damn tickets.

1371
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,440
My friends are going to be married and want me to officiate.

1372
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,720
Do you have advice for remembering a ceremony?

1373
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,400
That's for memorizing minister.

1374
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,080
So that's like a little harder, like groups of work, like a big chunk of text, which I

1375
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,720
guess is not unlike, you know, a monologue or a soliloquy or whatever.

1376
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,880
Well, first of all, write it from the heart and write it in bullet points first so that

1377
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,800
you remember the really important points.

1378
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,920
And then when you write it all out, you'll have the connective tissue.

1379
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,480
And also one of the easiest ways to remember anything is to like concentrate on the verbs

1380
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,720
because the verbs really tell the story.

1381
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,520
And so if you, you know, like lines or anything like that, it was always easy for me, but

1382
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,280
I always gave this advice to other people.

1383
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,120
Write it out in your handwriting.

1384
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,800
Danny DeVito did this all the time.

1385
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,880
You'd find his Louis lines like all over the set, not because he needed to look at them,

1386
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,800
but because he would write them out and they would become part of him.

1387
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,560
He always felt like having them, you know, putting them through his body and using his

1388
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,200
handwriting, they would become part of him.

1389
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,960
So write it out in your own handwriting.

1390
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,440
Don't just put it on, you know, if you really want to remember and concentrate mainly on

1391
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,240
the verbs.

1392
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,520
But maybe you should really give them my three theories of marriage.

1393
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,240
You want to hear them?

1394
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:16,720
Okay.

1395
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:16,960
Okay.

1396
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,000
Yes, obviously.

1397
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,600
These are my three theories of marriage.

1398
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,560
The first one is marriage is like making waffles.

1399
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,240
You throw the first one out.

1400
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,800
Okay.

1401
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,280
That's bad.

1402
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,960
Okay.

1403
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,680
All three of us here are on our first marriages.

1404
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,160
Go on.

1405
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,360
Then you have something to look forward to.

1406
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:31,840
Okay.

1407
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:45,280
Number two is marriage is finding that special, certain someone you just know you'd love to

1408
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,600
aggravate the rest of your life because it's a little like, you know what I mean?

1409
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,760
It's like you like spar with that person when you have a really good marriage.

1410
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,480
And then the third theory of marriage, Saint-Exupéry wrote it, but I added something to it.

1411
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,080
You know, the guy who wrote The Little Prince.

1412
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,600
So this is what he wrote.

1413
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:07,040
You'll have a happy marriage when you realize marriage isn't two people gazing longingly

1414
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,560
into each other's eyes, but rather looking out over the mountain in the same direction

1415
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,520
with their hands on each other's genitals.

1416
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,480
That's the part I added.

1417
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,160
Okay, I'm going to guess.

1418
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:18,800
Yeah, okay.

1419
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,360
I did guess that.

1420
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,120
It's got to be vision and heat.

1421
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,680
Vision and heat.

1422
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:29,920
Mary Lou Henner is getting the band back together, which opens August 13th at the

1423
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,840
Velasque. We start previewing, though, July 19th, and there are great ticket sales and

1424
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,240
everything else.

1425
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,480
You know, tickets are not only on sale, but they have like great deals going on for

1426
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,520
previews, especially.

1427
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,440
And get in the bandbacktogether.com.

1428
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,000
You can see that.

1429
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,880
There's great music videos and clips and you should hear of the show.

1430
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,240
All the clips that I've seen have been very fun, and I hope I get to see it very soon.

1431
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,480
But Mary Lou Henner, thank you for joining us.

1432
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,400
We appreciate you being on the show.

1433
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,600
This was super fun.

1434
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,240
Thanks, Mary Lou.

1435
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,120
Bye, bye, you guys.

1436
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,840
Thank you, bye.

1437
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,960
Bye.

1438
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,400
Well, folks, that's going to do it for us.

1439
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,400
Thank you again to Mary Lou Henner, our friend and-

1440
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,640
An amazing person.

1441
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,040
An all-around amazing person.

1442
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,160
Go see her show, Get in the Band Back Together.

1443
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,320
Opens August 13th, I believe, but you can get tickets now.

1444
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:22,400
And you should, because it has a great cast and a great-

1445
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,240
You can see music videos and stuff on the website, and I'm sure Mary Lou Henner is

1446
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:26,720
great in it.

1447
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,200
We haven't seen it, but I'm sure she is.

1448
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,720
I want to tell real quick.

1449
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,560
So the graphic novel is coming out in like a week, I think.

1450
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,040
Oh my god.

1451
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:37,600
Fuck me.

1452
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,800
Everybody likes it.

1453
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,880
Theadventurezonecomic.com.

1454
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,160
If you haven't pre-ordered it, you can pre-order it now.

1455
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,840
I wouldn't wait too much longer.

1456
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,640
So get that.

1457
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,360
And we're doing a book tour.

1458
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:57,760
So first, let me say, the Cincinnati show is, I believe, July 18th, and that's the one,

1459
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,840
I think, where we can still use some more people to come check that out.

1460
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,920
It's a fun way of putting it.

1461
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,160
Yeah.

1462
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,560
I like thinking about it like we're waiting for volunteers.

1463
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,200
And it's like, we still need to interview more people in that one.

1464
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:17,040
So if you want to come, the cost of the ticket also includes a book, a copy of the book.

1465
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,680
Specifically our book, not just some general book.

1466
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,520
And we're going to have some surprise guests at the show to help us with the reading.

1467
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,880
So it's going to be super fun.

1468
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,920
It'll be like a Q&A reading style discussion.

1469
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,280
Not like our traditional sort of live shows for The Adventure Zone, but mostly focused on the book.

1470
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,320
And you can get tickets for that at mcroyshows.com slash tours also.

1471
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:43,280
So we are doing one of the book tour stops is at San Diego Comic Con.

1472
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,040
And the venue that we got, you know, because it's Comic Con and we didn't have a ton of options,

1473
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:54,480
unfortunately, the venue we got to be able to get as many people in as possible as standing room only,

1474
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,880
which is admittedly a bummer.

1475
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:03,280
But what we've done is we've set apart, it's in kind of three sections, three different levels.

1476
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,400
The bottom level, the ground level that's closest to the stage is going to be designated as like a sitting area.

1477
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,640
So people can sit on the ground if they so choose.

1478
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,120
If that would be more comfortable for them.

1479
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,120
So if you want to bring like something soft to sit on, do.

1480
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,520
But remember that it's first come first serve.

1481
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,080
So we can't guarantee that everyone's going to be able to sit there.

1482
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,080
But we wanted to have at least some room.

1483
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,000
We would also say like, if you're totally cool standing, then don't worry about it.

1484
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,840
Take one of the other two sections and leave room for people that need to sit.

1485
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:41,600
And we know that it's not ideal, but we really wanted to be able to get as many people in at San Diego as possible.

1486
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,960
So this is where we're at.

1487
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,120
So if you got tickets, it'll be nice.

1488
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,240
Yeah, it'll be intimate.

1489
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,160
It'll be like a fucking December's concert.

1490
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,960
You'll be like sitting there on the floor just like, how, how like kinky.

1491
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,240
And also there is ADA seating.

1492
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,960
So if, if you need, if you need that, that's also first come first serve,

1493
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,720
but you can call ahead to the venue to make sure and like work with them and make sure that there's room for you.

1494
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,160
So that is also available.

1495
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,280
We realized we are narrow casting pretty hard right now.

1496
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,080
But this is the first time we've kind of run into this situation.

1497
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,000
So we're trying to get the, get the word out.

1498
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,360
Yeah, we just want to make sure everybody has the best time that they can.

1499
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,640
We're trying to look out for you and thank you for coming to the show.

1500
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,400
I should also say that we really appreciate it.

1501
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,280
It's going to be super fun.

1502
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,360
The San Diego show, all of them are going to be fun.

1503
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,120
I'm really, really excited about it.

1504
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:34,240
Oh, and also along those same lines, we're also doing a bunch of different like book signing events at local places,

1505
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,520
like here around Cincinnati, around Huntington, around Austin.

1506
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,640
Carrie is doing one up in New York.

1507
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,240
You can find those two on macroshows.com slash tours.

1508
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:44,720
Yeah.

1509
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,120
Also, we are doing some live shows with Bim Bam.

1510
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,760
Tickets are still available in Orlando and Atlanta.

1511
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,080
That's all at macroshows.com slash tours.

1512
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:58,560
And Travis doing a bunch of con appearances also at SDCC and Gen Con and Dragon Con, a bunch of places.

1513
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,800
I'll post all the schedule for that all on macroshows.com too.

1514
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,240
And also we got a merch store if you've never been to it or haven't been to it lately.

1515
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,040
We're updating it.

1516
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:11,760
We got a monthly pin that we're sort of rotating in and out.

1517
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,400
The one for July.

1518
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,520
What is the one for July?

1519
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,800
The cool baby pin.

1520
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,480
It's the cool baby pin.

1521
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,440
Very cute.

1522
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,560
It's very cool.

1523
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,760
