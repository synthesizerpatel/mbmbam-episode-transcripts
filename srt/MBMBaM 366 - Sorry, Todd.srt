1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,120
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,600
And I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, as told by Forbes Magazine

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,480
for Business, Griffin McElroy. Woof, woof, everybody. The dog days are somewhere here.

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,680
Bork, bork, bork. Dogs everywhere. As Florence and the Machine said,

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,480
the dog days are here. Of summer, it's a hot one, like seven inches from the midday sun.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,600
Dogtown is here. We are the mayors of Dogtown. What you're listening to right now is something

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,120
akin to comedy scatting. Just saying different words and phrases to see if

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,120
a joke emerges from the rubble. This is just loose spaghetti flung around.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,280
Don't interrupt the fucking flow. Meow, these cool cats are here for the dog days of summer.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Keep going, keep going, keep going. These show pops are cool summer buddies.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,160
Let's try some standards. Ghosts are in summer. Horses are in summer. I love riding my horse.

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,680
It gets so sweaty in the summertime. Spooky Halloween's coming up. Ghost summer is ending.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
Halloween's just around the corner. Okay, that's fine. Let's ramp this.

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, Halloween's just around the corner. I can't wait for a ghoulish time as I wait

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,320
for summer to die. Hey, everyone. Join my brother, my brother,

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:16,400
and me as we stand around the wheezing corporeal form of summer and watch as it's final breaths.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,760
And then when it dies, it'll be a ghost. So there's one. And the dog days are

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,760
here of summer. Long days, long nights. Just can't wait for this season to finally perish in my arms.

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Do you guys, are you guys summer people? Do you feel-

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,760
No, God. Fuck no. Fuck you. Fuck you, Justin. Come on, fuck you, Justin. Why do you think I'm so excited for the dog days?

26
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,760
I start to get a little bit panicky towards the end of summer. Like, have I, did I get out on the lake enough?

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Did I make enough of this summertime season? Did I, before, you know, fall comes and,

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,760
I don't know, did I make enough of this summer? Well, now you got me stressing, because I got the boat, you know.

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,760
And after the last max fun drive, got me the boat. And I haven't taken that baby out on the river once this sum-sum.

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,760
And I'm wondering if it's time or, it's tough to, you know, it's tough to raise the sail during the dog days.

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Because summer might end while I'm out there, and I can't be fucking on my boat in the fall, I'll get arrested.

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Now you guys have got me worried, because I also have the boat, as you know, the Travis 2.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah. And I'm, I'm worried because I'm just worried that this summer, and really this year,

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,760
I haven't spent enough time on the boat before at the end of the year, I have to kill this form and enter my 2018 body.

35
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,760
It's tough. And the 2017 model didn't spend enough time out on Travis 2.

36
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,760
And the boat's not gonna recognize your new body. It's tough. It's so tough.

37
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,760
The genetic imprint is completely different. That's what the scientists are working on.

38
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,760
And I hear, I hear my boat crying in the garage. I hear, I hear my boat, the boat from Jaws is what I named it.

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,760
It's crying in the garage, because I'm just not taking it out. And it knows it's the dog days.

40
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Yeah, and it's like you always say, you know, a boat in the garage is sad,

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,760
because that's not where boats are supposed to be. They're supposed to be on the water?

42
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Or a marina.

43
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,760
You guys have gotten me worried now, because my, I'm looking at my boat through the window.

44
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Oh fuck.

45
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,760
My fully armed battleship, the Orion. And I wonder, have I gotten out on the water and defended this great country

46
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:40,760
in my one-man, non-government armada slash militia to, I'm sort of an independent operator.

47
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,760
I mean, the kaiju are coming, Justin, and you haven't done enough.

48
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Right, I haven't even transformed into Orion's bipedal form all summer.

49
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,760
So have I done enough this summer to defend our coast against the incoming kaiju?

50
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Justin's looking at his extra-national sort of outer heaven situation

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,760
and wondering if he's not gotten out on the Ohio River enough to fight off the attackers.

52
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Right, I look at the geodesic Hoverdome and I think, have I used my hyper-powerful telescopes

53
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,760
to monitor the shores in case of kaiju enough? And I don't know that I have.

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
I did some grilling, of course.

55
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Yeah, on the boat?

56
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Yes. Well, it has a built-in radiation-powered grill that is very fast.

57
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,760
That's a problem, is that the radioactive fission core of my metal gear gets so hot.

58
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
And during the dog days...

59
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Who wants to be in there?

60
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Who wants to even convert their battleship into a battle zeppelin?

61
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Get, what, closer to the sun?

62
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Now I'm five inches from the midday sun and it's even hotter here.

63
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Might as well be walking on the sun.

64
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Another great one.

65
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Now I gotta say, that's the one good thing about these dog days is the soundtrack is so good

66
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,760
because you got smooth and you got walking on the sun and that's it.

67
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Break off the dial, you don't need it anymore.

68
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Also, I think there's some Sheryl Crow in there.

69
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,760
You gotta round it out with some Sheryl.

70
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
We're on a first name basis.

71
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,760
If you have been struggling in the same ways that we're describing, do not fear,

72
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,760
because this is, despite all external signs, an advice podcast.

73
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,760
So we're gonna take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

74
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Oh, I thought you were gonna say, despite all evidence to the contrary, this is a comedy podcast.

75
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Now Travis, don't nag me.

76
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
I gotta do this show.

77
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Real quick, I hate to break the flow, but this is a Yahoo sent in by Morgan Davey from Yahoo Answers user Ragdoll

78
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,760
who says, obscene reference in the first line of smooth by Carlos Santana?

79
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Man, it's a hot one, like seven inches from the midday sun.

80
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Is this a tongue-in-cheek reference to a seven inch erection?

81
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Actually, it says election.

82
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
What do you think?

83
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Okay, I wanna, let's really analyze that for a moment.

84
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Like, if that was the case, someone would have looked at both Carlos and, oh no, it's escaping me,

85
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,760
don't say Rob, Carlos and Rob, and said, what do you mean by that?

86
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Like, you know, how you put your penis close to the sun.

87
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Well, no, the song is about an attractive person who Rob or Carlos,

88
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,760
speaking through Rob as a vessel, as we all do from time to time,

89
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,760
is about, sees an attractive woman and, you know, sings a song about how she's so smooth.

90
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,760
And so, maybe she's like the midday sun, and just seeing this person has made Rob Thomas bring a boner.

91
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,760
I think it, it probably more likely, it is definitely about an erection,

92
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,760
but I think it was more likely Rob Thomas is like, or Carlos says to Rob,

93
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,760
hey Rob, my man, we're just gonna freestyle this first intro, and I was thinking we'd kinda do an Icarus thing.

94
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Do you know the story of Icarus exactly verbatim?

95
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,760
And Rob Thomas is like, yeah, I know, I remember that one.

96
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,760
It's about the guy who got his penis too close to the sun.

97
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Here we go.

98
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,760
He said, wait, hold on, well, music's already rolling.

99
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
No, we're already playing it.

100
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Just keep playing it, Carlos.

101
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I know this song.

102
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I know the story.

103
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Now, son, this is gonna sound pretty wild, but I've built these wings out of wax and feathers,

104
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,760
because I think I can fucking fly, and I can finally achieve my life's goal to fuck the sun.

105
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Now, dad.

106
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Well, well, pops.

107
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Pops, there's some issues there, I think.

108
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Well, what most people don't know is the song is actually about how Rob Thomas did fuck the sun,

109
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,760
and it melted away all the fighting features of his penis and made his penis completely smooth,

110
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,760
just like a featureless cylinder.

111
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Give me your featureless cylinder.

112
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Let's forget about it.

113
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Please forget about this.

114
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Oh, man.

115
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,760
My perfectly smooth penis.

116
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:16,760
The Rob Thomas does seem like the kind of guy who's like, I've had monumental recording success.

117
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I've got many platinum records.

118
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I created Veronica Mars.

119
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I created Veronica Mars.

120
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,760
There's nothing left for me to achieve, except I do think I'm gonna fuck the sun just one time.

121
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I mean, everybody in Smash Mouth is like, don't do it.

122
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
I've been there.

123
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,760
It seems like a good idea, Rob, but trust me, you'll end up with a featureless penis like me.

124
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I think every man, when he reaches a certain level of success, is like, nothing left to do but fuck the sun.

125
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Why do you think Elon Musk is trying to get those spaceships going up so high?

126
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
That's why Bezos was working out so hard.

127
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Bezos just wants to get up there and be like, I'm gonna wrestle the sun.

128
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Sorry, stop the podcast.

129
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Did you say Bezos?

130
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Yeah, that's what I like to call him.

131
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,760
I remember when Jeff Bezos was an alien that taught me about manners.

132
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Oh, man.

133
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Jeff Bezbos.

134
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Jeff Bezbos was an alien that taught me about manners.

135
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Jesus, what a deep cut.

136
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
How about we do this first question?

137
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Yeah, thank you.

138
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Yes, thank you.

139
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,760
A couple weeks ago, a somewhat large package was delivered to my house.

140
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Oh, I get it.

141
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I get it now.

142
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
I should have gone farther.

143
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
The address was correct, but the name was not.

144
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,760
I wrote return to sender on it and left it out on my porch for the mailman to take back.

145
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,760
I've also tried looking up the recipient on Facebook to try to contact them but have had no luck.

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,760
It's been days now and the mailman refused to take it back.

147
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,760
How much longer do I need to wait until I can open the package?

148
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Because the not knowing what's inside is killing me.

149
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
That's from unintentional mail thief.

150
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Okay, two things.

151
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,760
One, that's a federal crime.

152
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
So the answer is never, I guess.

153
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Can you open it because it's a federal crime.

154
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
So you shouldn't do that.

155
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
That's a dumb.

156
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Hey, that's a dumb crime.

157
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
That's a dumb law.

158
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Okay.

159
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,760
It seems like if I get my hands on your mail by hook or by crook, I should be able to open it.

160
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Possession being nine tenths of the law.

161
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Well, if it goes to your house and it's addressed to your house and has been there for a while and you can't get in touch with the other person, I think it's your belonging at a certain point.

162
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Griffin, you are killing me because Justin started with bullet points.

163
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
He said one and you didn't let him say two.

164
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,760
And now I feel incomplete and I have to know what Justin's key was going to be.

165
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Justin, what's number two?

166
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Hit me.

167
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,760
The two is I always thought they would take it back.

168
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm kind of sticking out.

169
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Yeah, I'm a little wild.

170
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I kind of always had that in my back pocket knowing that like if I did get a package that was not for me, I could just write return to sender on it and it would go away.

171
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
But I guess not.

172
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
I didn't realize the mail was a yours now scenario.

173
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Yeah, like you have to do it.

174
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
That's the way you create new mail.

175
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,760
People is like, well, you have to go deliver it and then you can never stop.

176
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,760
It seems like maybe you could take it to the mail place.

177
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
That seems like a huge chore.

178
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,760
They have just like airlifted onto you.

179
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
That seems very unfair.

180
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
And if it and if at the mail place.

181
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Also, some people call it a post office.

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,760
If they're like, we can't do anything with that.

183
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
You can just leave.

184
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
I call it bubblegum's mail company.

185
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
I don't know what you guys.

186
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
You go to bubblegum's mail company.

187
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,760
You take the big box up there like, oh, we can't do anything with that.

188
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
You just literally just very slowly back away.

189
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
And then it is somebody else's box.

190
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Here's the problem.

191
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Here's why you can't open it.

192
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Because I have seen like intrigue mystery movies before and you're going to open this and that's how you find out like that you have a clone or that you are now wrapped up in the middle of like a political scandal.

193
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Or that you have, you know, 24 hours to solve your own murder.

194
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Something like that.

195
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
That's what happens in these movies.

196
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Or you're going to open it up and it's just going to be like some like spoiled steak of the month club.

197
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
So like one way or another, don't open it.

198
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Can I tell you all a story that is 100% absolutely true that I've never talked about on this podcast?

199
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Yes.

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,760
This happened to me while we were living at this house and we got a big box delivered like a huge truck came and dropped it off on a pallet.

201
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
And so it's just like taking up our entire like entryway outside.

202
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,760
And I signed for it because I was like, whoa, what did Nintendo send me this time?

203
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
It's a bunch of Yoshis in here.

204
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,760
But then I looked at the name on it and it wasn't my name nor was it a person's name.

205
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,760
It was just the name of some like business I had never heard of.

206
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:50,760
So to try to get to the bottom of it, I Googled the name of the business and it turned out what this package was supposed to be going to.

207
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Again, the address was my address.

208
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,760
So I guess that somebody who used to live in my house now works at this place.

209
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,760
The business was for a local like Ninja Warrior training gymnasium.

210
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Whoa.

211
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Yes.

212
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,760
And so it's sort of like a gym factory, but like they saw the shit and were like, we got to get some salmon ladders up in here.

213
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:21,760
And so this was a difficult day for me for so many reasons, because like I'm a I'm an I'm, you know, I was an Eagle Scout.

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
That's not true.

215
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
And so, like, I made sure I needed to get this back in the proper hands.

216
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:38,760
But at the same time, if there is a salmon ladder in there that I could use to sort of hone my body, hone my craft to take on that big course and impress all my fellow Ninja Warrior friends.

217
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Oh, I wanted to just know that.

218
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Are you kidding?

219
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
What sort of Ninja Warrior training?

220
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Is there a fucking fourteen and a half foot curved wall in there?

221
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Tell me what it is.

222
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,760
So I just called the business and somebody came and got it and they gave me free lessons for my whole life.

223
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,760
And that's right. You're going to see me on NBC this fall climbing Mount Midoriyama.

224
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Just like, this is because I was honest.

225
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
I'm powered by truth.

226
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
They're going to hit that buzzer and the hosts are going to be like, good job, Griffin.

227
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,760
You're so honest. And I'll be like, I know I wanted to steal it so bad, but I didn't.

228
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
They're American Ninja Warrior.

229
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,760
If we could take a brief pivot, I think we've helped this male person enough to talk about American Ninja Warrior.

230
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I haven't explicitly watched every episode of this season.

231
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,760
I am following it and I don't know why, but it's just on and I'm just like, here we go.

232
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Time to see what Kevin Bull's up to.

233
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
You're kind of undercutting my point, but I'm going to go ahead and make it anyway.

234
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I have never intentionally watched American Ninja Warrior.

235
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:46,760
The only context is when I have a group of people of desperate interests and sometimes you just want something on TV,

236
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,760
while people are like chatting just in the background to sort of like chill on.

237
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,760
And it seems like I end up on American Ninja Warrior a lot.

238
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,760
It seems like that's the only context in which I watch American Ninja Warrior.

239
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
There's like a bunch of people together. It's like, hey, this is on.

240
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,760
This is very widely accessible.

241
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,760
It's a category of TV that I also put, I think Mythbusters is one we've talked about before.

242
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Fixer Upper, I also put Fixer Upper on there.

243
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Okay, okay.

244
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,760
I mean, most HDTV shows is just like, yeah, let's just tune in.

245
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,760
If I could follow up on that, Justin, I also love the phenomenon that happens where you just put that on in the background while like 10 people talk about whatever.

246
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:37,760
And over time, you can track as people's interest does eventually go to American Ninja Warrior and suddenly it's a party about watching American Ninja Warrior.

247
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
That wasn't your intention, of course.

248
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
No.

249
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,760
But now you're having an American Ninja Warrior watch party.

250
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,760
But my wife recently revealed to me after some such incident.

251
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Can I admit something to you?

252
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I said, of course, dear, of course.

253
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
I hate American Ninja Warrior.

254
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Oh, no.

255
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
I was like, wait, what?

256
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,760
And then like my world of TV shows, like background TV, got like smaller.

257
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Now that's out of – because I know my wife is in pain watching American Ninja Warrior.

258
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
And you know what?

259
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,760
When I pressed her for details, because it doesn't make any sense, she said to me, it's dumb.

260
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,760
I mean, it's just so cruel at sea.

261
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
I mean, she just said it's dumb.

262
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
She said it's a dumb thing.

263
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I think it's a great show about the triumph of the human spirit.

264
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,760
And we hit a point where like we were watching it because it was just like on TV and we had cable and needed to justify the expense of cable.

265
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
And so we watched it.

266
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,760
And then we just had a day where we were watching it and we realized that we weren't just watching it because it was on cable.

267
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
We had actually looked it up on demand on Hulu.

268
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
We had sought out American Ninja Warrior and invited it cordially into our home.

269
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
And we were like, whoa, who are we?

270
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
What are we doing?

271
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
What are we doing?

272
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
How about Yahoo?

273
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Yeah, please.

274
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
This is a series.

275
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
This is a short story.

276
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,760
A few people sent in parts of the story, but Stella Heyman was the only one who sent in all the parts of it.

277
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Thank you, Stella.

278
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
It's a three-parter.

279
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
And all of them were asked by Yahoo Answers user Estelle.

280
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
And try to follow the plot, if you will.

281
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
First one.

282
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Yesterday, a dog along the canal tried attacking a swan on land.

283
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
And the swan attacked it and the dog backed off.

284
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Why did it back off?

285
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Number two, do you think a small dog could kill an adult swan?

286
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Number three, could a chihuahua kill an adult swan?

287
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Are these all the same user?

288
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
All the same user, in order.

289
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,760
These three questions, fleshing out the story with more and more details.

290
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
What is the gap?

291
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
What is the time gap?

292
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Not long.

293
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,760
I mean, Yahoo, of course, doesn't provide information quite that granular.

294
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Just enough time to build an evidence dungeon wall linking chihuahuas and swans

295
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,760
and any news reports about dogs attacking swans.

296
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
But no small dogs, and specifically, no chihuahuas.

297
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:07,760
It seems like this person probably was being threatened or harassed by a swan.

298
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,760
They looked around at their resources and the only sort of defense they had

299
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,760
was the chihuahua they owned.

300
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,760
And it seemed like maybe this was at crises of confidence during the training phase,

301
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
where it's like, you know what?

302
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I'm spending so much time teaching him how to do backflips and bite on command.

303
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Is this worth it?

304
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Is this a good application of my minutes?

305
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,760
You know, I bet if that scene played out where the chihuahua started to mess with the swan

306
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
and then the swan scared the chihuahua away,

307
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,760
I bet if a wolf was watching that, he would just be like, fuck.

308
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Really? This is where we've come now? How dare you?

309
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Because here's the thing.

310
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,760
A swan should not be able to win in a fight over a canine on land.

311
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Swan is air superiority.

312
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,760
But on land, walking around on land?

313
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Come on, right?

314
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Well, I say that, but a swan won in a fight against me at Kings Island one time.

315
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Well, Griffith, you don't have land, air, or water superiority.

316
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Only needs a warrior.

317
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
I should also point out, I didn't know we were fighting.

318
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I was a young child, and I saw a beautiful swan, or maybe a goose, but they're really the same,

319
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,760
and walked over to it, and I guess I was like, I saw that long and elegant and frankly sexy neck,

320
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,760
and I was like, I'd love to just pet that.

321
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,760
And then suddenly it became...

322
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
The fight started without your...

323
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,760
It wasn't a fight until it was, and then all of a sudden it wasn't won again,

324
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,760
because I did just sort of run as fast as I possibly could away from the offending bird.

325
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Okay.

326
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,760
I actually think in that circumstance, and I'm going to broaden the definition of winning here,

327
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,760
to say if you escaped a creature that can fly, you won. You won that.

328
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Oh, okay.

329
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,760
I didn't feel like it, because it bit my fingers very, very hard, and it ruined my whole day,

330
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,760
and I went on the Tomb Raider ride, and I was still just very shaken.

331
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
After a swan bites you, it dies.

332
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Oh.

333
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
It'll die shortly after.

334
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Well, yeah, it did fill me with its one charge of venom from its sacks.

335
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
And Griffin, did you have to go with Avlack?

336
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Oh, that's fun.

337
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
And I know that's a duck. Don't at me.

338
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:28,760
How angry, as a bee, do you have to be to be like, actually, you know what, I thought about it.

339
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Carmine, Vicky, fuck this guy.

340
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm going to, no, don't do it.

341
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Reg, no, no, no.

342
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Come on, Reg.

343
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Fuck this guy.

344
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
He won't let me near his Pepsi.

345
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
He's being a real fuckhead.

346
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm going to get him.

347
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I'm going to get him.

348
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Actually, you know what?

349
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Fuck this guy.

350
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm going to do it.

351
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
This has been so cool hanging out with you guys.

352
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
I'm going to do it.

353
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Fuck him.

354
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,760
When are bees going to realize that they die and we don't?

355
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Well, some of them.

356
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
That's what happened.

357
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,760
One person who was allergic to bees got stung by a bee, and the other bees watched that person die,

358
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
and they're like, well, this is a one-in-one transition.

359
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Yeah, we lose one of ours, but they lose one of theirs, too.

360
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,760
They saw the propaganda film My Girl, and they're like, whoa, we're fucking dope.

361
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Here's what I'll say about geese and swan and ducks and the whole, if they got bills, then they're in it for kills.

362
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Here's what I got to say about this entire genus of birds.

363
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
I think they're always going to win.

364
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,760
It's because they're always – for them, it's always a fight.

365
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:38,760
A chihuahua approaches a goose or swan or duck or gosling, and they think, I'm curious about this thing.

366
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Let's get close to inspect it, and then they get honked, and then they've lost the fight.

367
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
You know what I mean?

368
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Sure.

369
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,760
The swan and goose and duck and goslings, they're all just constantly ready to attack,

370
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,760
and so they will get that first strike, and that first strike is always – it catches you.

371
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
That was me at Kings Island.

372
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
What?

373
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,760
No, certainly not, and then the fight was done because the psychological damage was so tremendous.

374
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,760
If you were walking through a park that had a pond or some kind of water feature,

375
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:20,760
and you saw just a flock of geese or swans or whatever just hanging out on the shore near the water,

376
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,760
and they're sitting amongst them completely peacefully, all sitting in harmony.

377
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,760
It's just a chihuahua just hanging out.

378
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
How fucking freaked out would you be?

379
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Yeah, that's a good point.

380
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,760
I would be very confused by that moment of like, how did that chihuahua get in good with those geese?

381
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Why are they chill?

382
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
What does that – what's he know that I don't?

383
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
How about another question?

384
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Sure.

385
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,760
This one is – has a beginning like this.

386
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,760
I have a friend who uses entirely too many hashtags on social media.

387
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Oof.

388
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,760
At a minimum, she uses about 15, but I've counted upwards of 30 on many occasions.

389
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,760
I understand their purpose as a marketing tool, but this is a personal account,

390
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,760
and the hashtags she uses are not keywords people are searching.

391
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Previous hashtags include hashtag ideas, hashtag Saturday, hashtag door, and hashtag woo.

392
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,760
How do I tell my friend enough is enough?

393
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
That probably is supposed to be my –

394
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
But I like it better that way.

395
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Not a leprechaun thing.

396
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Or do I need to just accept that my lot in life is to be bombarded with 27 hashtags every time she posts on Instagram?

397
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
Please advise.

398
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:40,760
And that's from a hostage in hashtag hell.

399
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,760
I don't think you can say these are not hashtags people are searching,

400
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,760
because this is the beautiful thing about these wonderful little inventions

401
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,760
is that they're always forming these just powerful just rainbow connections

402
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,760
of somebody who's like, look at this new hashtag door I've got.

403
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,760
And then they say, I wonder who else has doors on hashtag Saturday.

404
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,760
And then they see, oh, man, there's someone in hashtag hell or wherever they live

405
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,760
who's also installing a new door this Saturday, hashtag woo.

406
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Oh, that's there too.

407
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
That's so exciting.

408
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,760
It's all about SEO, and I don't know what that stands for, but I do know it's all about that.

409
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
It doesn't stand for anything, Travis.

410
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,760
It's CO, and it's sort of just sort of a concept.

411
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
It's some industry jargon for sure.

412
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Hashtag thank you for explaining that, Griffin.

413
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
All one word.

414
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Jesus, this bit actually grosses me out in a major way.

415
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,760
I feel like fucking Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake right now.

416
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
They're hugely popular.

417
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
If I could have just a tenth of their success, I'd be extremely thrilled.

418
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Let me just say this, folks.

419
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,760
It's 2017, and if I could give you some advice about social media, one, quit it.

420
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Everybody just get off.

421
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Just quit.

422
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Everybody quit it.

423
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Secondly, though, I will say this.

424
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I think that the thing about social media that everyone should keep in mind all the time

425
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,760
is that it should be 100% a completely opt-in experience, no penalties, no questions.

426
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,760
It's just if you want this, it's here.

427
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,760
If you don't want it, I do not care.

428
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,760
And you should start, like if this person's social media brand bothers you, fucking bail on it.

429
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Bounce.

430
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
Don't ask me about it.

431
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Fucking bounce.

432
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
And if they notice the count's going down, maybe they could do a little market research

433
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
to see where things went wrong.

434
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,760
But it's not up to you to be like, let me curtail you.

435
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
No.

436
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Just bounce.

437
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
You don't owe anybody anything.

438
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
And she's like, why did you bounce?

439
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
I'm like, that's not your problem.

440
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
You can't ask that either.

441
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,760
You quit without asking, and nobody can ask why anybody bounced or anything.

442
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,760
I probably mute more people on Twitter than I follow, because I say, I care about you.

443
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I'm following you.

444
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
I'm here for you.

445
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
But I can't mute more people than I follow.

446
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
But you know what I'm saying.

447
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
I mute a lot of people I follow.

448
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
I follow and be like, I like you as a person.

449
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,760
And then I mute them and say, I don't like your brand.

450
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
I don't like your-

451
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
You're great.

452
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Your thoughts are shitty.

453
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
And I hate them.

454
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I would say literally 25% of the people that I follow, I instantly mute.

455
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,760
I get a quick taste of their thing.

456
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,760
And I'm like, I want to be seen following you, but I don't want to see your brand.

457
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
I don't want to experience you.

458
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,760
I don't want to experience your brand, but I want to say, I just fucking love it in concept.

459
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:35,760
And this is just sort of a vote for you as a person, but your brand is whack and I'm actually out.

460
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
And here's the thing.

461
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
You'll never know I'm out.

462
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
So everybody wins.

463
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:49,760
You keep on being whack and I will keep on getting the sort of like the drift effect of following you, but not actually experiencing-

464
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,760
I want to say, Justin, I would actually love that from the reverse side.

465
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:02,760
If my follow count kept going up, but the same number of people commented and responded to my shit, that would be the ideal.

466
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Look how many followers I have, but I can tweet like, just has a good ice cream without having people just flood my inbox with shit.

467
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,760
There's a lot of people that follow me that I hope follow this same procedure.

468
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,760
I tweeted this week about Titus from Kimmy Schmidt.

469
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,760
I tweeted about how he would be a good person to play taco in a movie or TV show.

470
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,760
That's not like happening, but I thought it would be funny if Titus Burgess was taco in a movie or TV show.

471
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,760
And then he tweeted back when he was like, I don't know what taco is, but I'm going to look into it.

472
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
And then he followed me.

473
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:46,760
And my first thought was, man, I hope he fucking mutes me because I don't have a feed curtail like that is curated in such a way.

474
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Like Hodgman and Elizabeth Gilbert both follow me on Twitter.

475
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Fuck, I hope I'm muted.

476
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,760
I don't need them to be like, hear my fucking near automata reports.

477
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I don't need President Barack Hussein Obama.

478
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,760
I don't need him seeing me shove Nintendo toys in my gob.

479
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I've been rewatching Smallville, very much enjoying Michael Rosenbaum's performances Lex.

480
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,760
And I tweeted about how much I've been enjoying Michael Rosenbaum's performances Lex.

481
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
And he followed me and I thought, oh, no.

482
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Now he's going to see every time I tweet about enjoying his performances Lex, which has been a lot lately, like 10 or 12 times a day.

483
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
He does a great job.

484
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,760
But now he's going to know how much I enjoy his performances Lex.

485
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
That's really weird, Travis.

486
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
I didn't see those tweet.

487
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
Oh, oh, never.

488
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Never mind.

489
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Oh, I see.

490
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Griffin.

491
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I'd love to get a hold on.

492
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Did you mute me?

493
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Oh, I'd love to get a fun campaign going.

494
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:54,760
A little social media campaign going where if Justin McElroy follows you, just tweet at him and just be like, hey, just checking in.

495
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Please confirm receipt of message over.

496
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Please do that.

497
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,760
If Justin McElroy follows you, just hit him up with a like, hey, just want to make sure.

498
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Over.

499
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Every once in a while, I'll like search my name for some reason and maybe do it on like a different account or a platform where I haven't muted people.

500
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,760
And I'll see a tweet to me from somebody of like, I thought they died.

501
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Like, no, they didn't die, Justin.

502
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
You muted them three years ago.

503
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,760
So you killed them individually, but still aren't bored with them as a human being.

504
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
You just can't get on board with their social brand.

505
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Boy, this whole bit has been pretty insufferable.

506
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Should we go to the money zone?

507
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
There's some good stuff in there.

508
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Yeah.

509
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
I think we just said brand a lot.

510
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Yeah, we said brand far too much.

511
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:51,760
So let's talk about brands in the money zone.

512
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Hey, I want to tell everybody about Casper because we're supported in part by Casper for this episode.

513
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,760
They're an online retailer, premium obsessively engineered mattresses you can get for a fraction of the price.

514
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,760
I think we all have Casper's at this point.

515
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Ours is in the nursery guest room area.

516
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,760
We used to sleep on it all the time.

517
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I'll be frank, kind of the baby sleeps in there now.

518
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:22,760
And we I mean, I wouldn't even I get up to pee a lot at night and I'm not going to run the risk of waking up my my child after fighting tooth and nail for his slumbers.

519
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
But it's a good mattress.

520
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
It's very, very, very comfortable.

521
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
And they have a risk free trial and return policy.

522
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
You can try sleeping on a Casper for 100 days with free delivery to the US and Canada.

523
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
And they got painless returns if you don't like it.

524
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:41,760
All the mattresses are made in America, feature supportive memory foam for a sleep surface that's got just the right sink, just the right bounce.

525
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,760
And my bit man listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase if you go to Casper.com slash my brother and use the promo code my brother.

526
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
All one word at checkout.

527
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Terms and conditions apply.

528
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,760
I want to tell you about Blue Apron.

529
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
I love that play.

530
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,760
It's it's a meal subscription service that we are all big fans of.

531
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
I use it all the time.

532
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
It has fed me and my family many a time.

533
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Here's the best thing about it.

534
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
You don't have to know how to cook to use it.

535
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I'd be amazed if anybody listening to this or really any podcast hasn't already heard about Blue Apron.

536
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,760
But just in case you haven't, they send to your house a box filled with everything you need.

537
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Mine is like salt and pepper and olive oil.

538
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,760
But like everything else you need to make the dish.

539
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Instructions easy to follow, broken down step by step.

540
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Here's what you do.

541
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,760
And if you do these things, you will have a great meal.

542
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,760
It's affordable for less than $10 per person per meal.

543
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,760
You get a seasonal recipe, the pre-proportioned ingredient, all that stuff.

544
00:32:48,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Outcoming meals include sauteed shrimp and green beans with globe tomatoes, spinach and orzo pasta, miso butter, salmon and lo mein noodles with cucumber and charmed tomatoes, whole grain pasta and summer vegetables with heirloom tomato caprese salad.

545
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
That's it.

546
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
They don't just send you regular ass tomatoes.

547
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
They got globe tomatoes, charred tomatoes and heirloom tomatoes.

548
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Like these sounds like World of Warcraft loot.

549
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
These tomatoes.

550
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Yeah, I fucking love it.

551
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Hashtag tomatoes, hashtag delicious, hashtag meals, hashtag cook, hashtag blue, hashtag the, hashtag pre-proportioned.

552
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:33,760
So you can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals free with free shipping by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

553
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
That's a great deal.

554
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,760
That's three meals free with free shipping by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

555
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Or the most easier to remember, blapron.com.

556
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Blapron.com.

557
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Blapron.com.

558
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Oh my God, Justin.

559
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Hashtag blapron.

560
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Blapron.com is an old one that's been in effect for a while.

561
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Is it?

562
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Yeah.

563
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Okay, again.

564
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
You can use blapron.com.

565
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Blapron.

566
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
A better way to cook.

567
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Griffin.

568
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Yeah.

569
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Tell me about Moon 2.

570
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Yeah, I'm going to tell you all about Moon 2.

571
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Moon 2 is an electronic art pop band and they got a new album out that you can give a listen to at moon2.bandcamp.com.

572
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Now that is moon, spelled the way like the celestial body, dash ii.

573
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,760
So moon-ii.bandcamp.com.

574
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Moon 2 is an electronic art pop band who recently released their debut album, Lily Nobody.

575
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,760
It's got burning synths and swirling backgrounds and songs about love, copycats, and dysphoria too.

576
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,760
It's a beautiful, this is a quote.

577
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
And sometimes folks do this in this industry.

578
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,760
If you're looking for a pull quote for a thing, something you're going to put out on the album cover.

579
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Sometimes you send it to the people that you want to say it and you're just like, how's this spin you?

580
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
And it spins me just right.

581
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
I'll go ahead and put my brand on this one.

582
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,760
It's a beautiful, haunted doll of an album.

583
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
That's in McElroy.

584
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,760
That's moon-ii.bandcamp.com.

585
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Go check it out.

586
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Is Bandcamp the one that's shutting?

587
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
No, SoundCloud is the one that's going to shut down soon.

588
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Fuck, that makes me so sad.

589
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
I don't want to think about that.

590
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,760
I'm going to go listen to the good jams at moon-ii.bandcamp.com.

591
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,760
I want to read this next message so very badly.

592
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
All right, go.

593
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,760
This message is for Sam and maybe Brian, and it's from Brian.

594
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,760
And the message says, Sam, hopefully we're still dating by the time the brothers read this message.

595
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
I love you.

596
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Probably even more now than when I first wrote this.

597
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,760
If we're married by then, congratulations from past Brian.

598
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,760
Note to Brian, if Sam dumped you, hang in there, brother. I love you.

599
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,760
So this started covering all of the bases.

600
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
How long ago did you write this, Brian?

601
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Another note to Brian.

602
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,760
If you were killed in a terrible passion and are now a Spectre, I'm coming for all of you.

603
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Boo.

604
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
One additional note to Brian.

605
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,760
If you got drafted into a secret government agency, you can continue to see your loved ones,

606
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,760
but it will have to be from afar because their memories of you have been erased.

607
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,760
They have been men in black just sort of flashed out of there.

608
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Yeah.

609
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Are you sad and confused about world politics?

610
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Worried about the upcoming inevitable nuclear war?

611
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Or maybe a rat is living in your house.

612
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
There's a rat living in my house.

613
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
How do you get rid of a rat from a house?

614
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Why not immerse yourself in a completely fictional imagined podcast for the beef and dairy industries?

615
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
It works for me.

616
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,760
The Beef and Dairy Network podcast is the number one podcast for those involved

617
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,760
or just interested in the production of beef animals and dairy herds.

618
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Don't worry, it's funnier than it sounds.

619
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Find us at beefanddairynetwork.com or maximumfun.org

620
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
or wherever you get your podcasts from.

621
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Oh, God, there's the rat. Oh, God.

622
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,760
How about a Yahoo?

623
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Yes.

624
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,760
God, I got some fucking good ones. I have three very good ones.

625
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Yeah, how about this one?

626
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
This Yahoo was sent in by Seth Carlson.

627
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Thank you, Seth Carlson, for your good, good work.

628
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
It's from Yahoo Answers User.

629
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Great.

630
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Dirk, who has 0% best answers, try harder, Dirk.

631
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Dirk asks, how many of my own mozzarella sticks

632
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,760
do you think I can bring into Applebee's before they get suspicious?

633
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I really, really like riblets and motz sticks.

634
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Motz? Oh, mozzarella sticks.

635
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
But they are way too expensive.

636
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Tell me about it. In this economy?

637
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
I was figuring I can warm them up beforehand

638
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,760
and just sneak them in in my shirt pocket and maybe back pocket.

639
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Only one. Got to have my wallet, you know.

640
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,760
But I think they might... Hey, shh.

641
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,760
But I think they might notice if I start eating them.

642
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Can I be arrested?

643
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
This is... I...

644
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Shh, shh, shh.

645
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Listen, I want to...

646
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

647
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I know what you want me to do, and that's play with you.

648
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Play with me in my playhouse.

649
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,760
This question is not from a human being.

650
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Play with me in the space.

651
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Yo, look at all my toys, my wonderful toys and games.

652
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Let me tell you why this isn't real.

653
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,760
If you think about all the pocket opportunities,

654
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
the opportunities that you have throughout your clothing,

655
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,760
shirt pocket and back pants pocket are the least mozzarella stick friendly.

656
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,760
I've got so many toys and games in my space. Play with me.

657
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Carry a satchel.

658
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Think how many mod sticks you can get in a satchel,

659
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
then order your own plate of mod sticks.

660
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,760
It is going to take some investment upfront for this grift.

661
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,760
As any good grift does, you're going to have to spend a little to make a lot.

662
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

663
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Yahoo Answers user Jim says,

664
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Dirk the troll at it again.

665
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Get out of my... We're getting out of my...

666
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Dirk, you've been uninvited from my game space.

667
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
I'd take your toys and games and leave.

668
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,760
I don't want to play with you anymore.

669
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
I'm closing the message.

670
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Seth Carlson, keep your head on a swivel, okay?

671
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Because there's grifters everywhere.

672
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,760
You just lost your nickname, Seth.

673
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,760
I was going to call you Seth Carl Dab and you've lost it.

674
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Here's a Yahoo from Travis Washable.

675
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Great name. Thank you, Travis.

676
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
It's from Yahoo Answers user Jess.

677
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Who has 5% best answers?

678
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,760
How do you eat tacos in class without getting yelled at?

679
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Okay.

680
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Play with me?

681
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Are you guys going to play with me in this one?

682
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
This one might be real.

683
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Yeah.

684
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,760
I do think that this is among the worst foods you could eat in class.

685
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Because one, stinky if you're doing it right and you know what I mean.

686
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Secondly...

687
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
I don't know what you... Stinky?

688
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Just like the zesty...

689
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
A lot of sense.

690
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
I will say if it's a zesty...

691
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Zesty ground beef is like...

692
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
That is potent.

693
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,760
It definitely is an overwhelming flavor.

694
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
If you have some powerful cilantro in there, sometimes that...

695
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
And some people don't...

696
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Can't jam on cilantro.

697
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
Stinky is not the word I would use though.

698
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Aromatic.

699
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Once again, Griffin.

700
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Justin started some bullet points.

701
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
You have to let him get to the second bullet point or my brain's going to melt.

702
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Give it.

703
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
My brain's going to melt.

704
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
My bullet points were...

705
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
What was I talking about?

706
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,760
You said the reasons tacos were wrong to eat in class.

707
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
One, stinky.

708
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Two, go.

709
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Two, messy.

710
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
So obvious.

711
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Oh yeah.

712
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
You're going to get some grease dribble, no question.

713
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
But moreover...

714
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
That's what your Trapper Keeper is for, by the way.

715
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,760
No one's ever finished a taco and been like, well, it's on my stomach.

716
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Ever.

717
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,760
It's almost always 25% just like on the paper.

718
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
And you could make it into a cone and then put the end of the cone in your mouth.

719
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
And taco cone the way...

720
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

721
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
I just came up with a great idea.

722
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Yeah.

723
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
We'll come back to that.

724
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Yeah.

725
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Super quick.

726
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Taco cone.

727
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Start wrapping hard shell tacos in square flour tortillas.

728
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,760
So when the taco leavings fall there, you don't have a mess.

729
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
You have another taco.

730
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
A second one.

731
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Yeah.

732
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
That's good shit.

733
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Yeah.

734
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
It's really good.

735
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
So...

736
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Yeah.

737
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,760
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Are we assuming hard shell taco, by the way?

739
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Because soft taco would be really good.

740
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
No.

741
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
I'm going to roll that out.

742
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Yeah.

743
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
It's got to be.

744
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,640
I get made fun of a lot because I live in Texas and I say the word shell when referring

745
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,440
to a tortilla.

746
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,440
And I think it might be a soda or pop thing or maybe just like a McElroy.

747
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,520
I don't know if this is a wider thing that people say, like a wider sort of use case,

748
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,580
but nobody calls them shells except for me sometimes.

749
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,000
And I've tried to work it out in my system, but...

750
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,320
Hashtag shell truth.

751
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Jesus God.

752
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Thank you, Jesus.

753
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,600
I want to play with everybody in this space, but I got to read this response from Todd.

754
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:45,960
Todd, Jesus, Todd has 33,319 answers on this platform.

755
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,160
Damn, this is a smart guy, huh?

756
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Yeah.

757
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
He knows everything.

758
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Well, if Todd...

759
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Okay.

760
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,360
You're trying to make me believe in Todd, but if Todd's real, how's he get to all those

761
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,840
answers in one night?

762
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,280
You know what I mean?

763
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
I'm sorry.

764
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
I got to math this out.

765
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,040
He's been a member since November 6th, 2009.

766
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,680
Okay.

767
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,200
So here in a couple months, that will have been eight years.

768
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
That's 96 months.

769
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Two, nine, two, zero, and then 33,319.

770
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:28,380
I listened to that podcast, you told me to shh, shh, shh.

771
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,340
Don't do this to me right now.

772
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,120
For about 30 seconds, they just did math.

773
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,120
That's 11.4 answers every day, Todd.

774
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
Damn, Todd.

775
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Todd, damn.

776
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,760
He's like, are you a professional Yahoo's answerer?

777
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,920
Hey, Todd, damn.

778
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,480
I don't learn 11 things a day.

779
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,200
I can't keep up that rate of learning.

780
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,280
I don't know how he's spouting this stuff off.

781
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Okay, Todd, though, Todd.

782
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
My Todd says- We can only get six an episode.

783
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,560
Yeah, I know.

784
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Wow.

785
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,000
Todd says, make sure you do it in home ec.

786
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,920
In normal class, you simply can't.

787
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,480
Tacos have a strong aroma usually.

788
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Damn, Todd.

789
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,040
That's actually pretty good.

790
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,280
That's actually a pretty good answer, Todd.

791
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Damn.

792
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,280
Damn, Todd.

793
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,600
Todd, the fucking info wizard.

794
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,280
Are they all heaters?

795
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,800
Is Todd bringing this kind of fire every single time he steps up to the plate 11 times a day?

796
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Careful.

797
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,800
You might fall into a Todd hole.

798
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800
Be careful.

799
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
You might fall into this Todd hole.

800
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
No, Griffin.

801
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,680
I'm free diving into the Todd.

802
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,120
Where's the egg in an egg roll?

803
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,840
There are eggs in the wrapper dough.

804
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,320
Damn, Todd.

805
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Todd.

806
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Damn.

807
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:45,800
A baguette, brie pate, and a bottle of champagne under the Eiffel Tower or a shepherd's pie,

808
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,760
pint of Guinness on the banks of the River Thames.

809
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,200
Leave the brie and pate out and it sounds great.

810
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
So a little humor.

811
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
Oh, Todd.

812
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,000
He's bringing, but also culture.

813
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,480
It's humor, but also culture.

814
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
I love that.

815
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,800
Which handed ice hockey stick should I use if I'm ambidextrous?

816
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,880
Pick the arm that has the most forearm strength to hold the back of the stick.

817
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,200
What doesn't Todd know about?

818
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,080
Food, hockey, get Todd a Mr. Wizard style show.

819
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,440
Two treats.

820
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,960
What are your favorite TV shows?

821
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,760
NCIS, Bob's Burgers, Modern Family, Beat Bobby Flay, Chopped Iron Chef.

822
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,320
I watch History Channel and others, but no specific favorite shows.

823
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Damn.

824
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,800
Todd, he's a man of culture.

825
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Todd.

826
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
Wow.

827
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
What does-

828
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Todd, damn it.

829
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
Okay.

830
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,240
I'm feeling so into Todd right now, I feel like we're just one away from...

831
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,000
So what are some of your guys' favorite races of people?

832
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,560
Oh no, Todd, no.

833
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,920
So eating tacos in class.

834
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,320
If there's old timey desks where you lift up the top to stow your belongings underneath,

835
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,840
that my friend is a taco privacy curtain that you can use to sort of keep yourself away

836
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,440
from the prying eyes of teach.

837
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,600
Now you gotta watch your flanks, because you could have jealous students.

838
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,400
I'm sorry, I'm not anybody to yuck anybody's yum or put anybody on blast, but if I see

839
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:17,280
one of my fellow pups chowing down on some tacos in class, the jealousy will be so powerful

840
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:24,160
as such that I will shout and scream like I was in fucking Invasion of the Body Snatchers,

841
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,280
just like my mouth held open while a ghastly whale comes out of my mouth as I point at

842
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,920
him with a crooked finger, until the teach comes and takes the tacos away.

843
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,000
Because if I can't have them, can't nobody have them.

844
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,800
Can the teach legally confiscate the tacos?

845
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,280
I don't know, and I know in a public school system for sure, I don't know if once I get

846
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,880
to a college level, like I'm an adult, like you can't just steal my tacos.

847
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,240
You don't own this room, I do as a taxpayer.

848
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,720
Well not only that, but if you confiscate tacos, you only got two options, like you're

849
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:01,760
not gonna pull your desk drawer open at the end of the year and return his tacos to him.

850
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,160
Did you bring the Ziploc bag I instructed you to?

851
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,600
Okay, open up, I have your taco swap.

852
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,880
You had a good year Bill, enjoy these tacos, you've earned them.

853
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,000
Mr. Pilsen, after we investigated the taco situation, obviously you're fired, that's

854
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,760
not up for debate.

855
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,920
Should I clean out my desk?

856
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,560
No, you absolutely should not clean out your desk, we burned your desk.

857
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,680
You please, never teach again.

858
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,320
My taco savings.

859
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,280
Now what am I supposed to retire with?

860
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,320
This is what you do, you take the taco for the student break and then you're like, alright

861
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,360
everybody you know what this means, taco auction, let's go.

862
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,360
The highest bidder gets to eat this taco.

863
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,200
Oh man.

864
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,720
What's with the consistent use of those green desk lamps, Todd says, they're like in every

865
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,880
movie and TV show, does it have to do with camera lighting?

866
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:01,720
So there's a little bit of like, you know, he knows a lot of stuff but he's still poking

867
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,480
around this world of ours, scraping up answers.

868
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
I love it.

869
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,720
And you know the second somebody responds to that, he's gonna find another thread where

870
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,720
he could just be like, actually, it's camera lighting, I know all about it.

871
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
Todd.

872
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,720
Todd.

873
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,720
Todd.

874
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,240
Any ideas from Todd?

875
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,960
Man, what a treasure, I'm glad he's out there like, actually putting some wisdom into this

876
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,360
world unlike ourselves, he should be doing this podcast instead of us really.

877
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,360
Let's get Todd up on it.

878
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,480
Todd if you're listening, get at us.

879
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,240
I was raised in a household in which the air conditioning was a special privilege only

880
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:46,120
switched on during very hot days, never at night, all days and never set below 78 degrees.

881
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:55,720
This saves money and is more eco-friendly, yeah, I know, I currently live with four roommates

882
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,360
who insist on blasting the AC at 72 all day and all night, hell yeah, I live for that

883
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
shit.

884
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,880
I'm freezing my ass off and also paying an exorbitant share of our electric bill.

885
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,560
But I convinced my roomies to give the refrigeration a rest.

886
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,240
That's from Chile and California, I don't know, speaking just for like the Huntington

887
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,240
McElroy household, you kind of know the fucking place.

888
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,720
Yeah, Justin keeps his like the fucking snow fox exhibit at a local zoo, like his shit

889
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,720
is frigid.

890
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:30,960
I've been watching Smallville, spoilers, Fortress of Solitude, and it looks so fucking

891
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,800
chilly in there, I look at that and I'm like, yeah, that sounds nice.

892
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,000
I want to live in that.

893
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,560
You share a fucking hotel room with Justin, you wake up like fucking Jack Torrance at

894
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,680
the end of The Shining, like it's a real situation.

895
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:54,200
Now I will say, you're supposed to keep nursery temperatures for a baby like between 68 and

896
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:00,520
72, which for a non-baby who isn't wearing a big fun sleep snuggie, it's a little on

897
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,520
the cold side.

898
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,000
It's a little bit on the chilly side.

899
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,480
I keep it at 68 at night because that's the temperature I like to sleep at, and I sleep

900
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,480
in the nude.

901
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,880
So what do you want from me?

902
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,160
I can't do more.

903
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,280
Oh, I have an answer for that.

904
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,720
What I want from you is to not know what you said just then.

905
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,600
I want you to go back in time and not tell me.

906
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,440
Let's rewind to the bit where we talk about having machete and home intruders.

907
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,120
It is pre-established canon, my bim bam canon, that I sleep in the nude.

908
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,280
This isn't a surprise.

909
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,440
I've revealed this on the program before.

910
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,840
I block it out every time, so it is a surprise each time you say it, and now I'm going to

911
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,800
have to go through intensive work to shut that out, close that door in my mind one more

912
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
time.

913
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,200
I've got this cool hook that I can get up in my brain that I just find the data.

914
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,200
Like a little recall?

915
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,200
Just pull it out your nose?

916
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,160
Yeah, it's tough.

917
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
Here's the thing, though.

918
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Here's what I like about it.

919
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:05,320
Is in these fucking dog days, I can wear long ass sweatpants and a hoodie and like all my

920
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,020
comfy jam jams, all my wintertime buddies, my off-court winter buddies.

921
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,020
So that's nice.

922
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,840
I mean, you should celebrate that.

923
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,480
The exorbitant share about the electric bill, I don't know what to tell you because those

924
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,120
dog days sure, oof, because my electric bill is barking during these dog days.

925
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,320
The answer is easy.

926
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,500
The answer is easy, and I'll tell you why it's easy, because you got an even number

927
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,840
between the two numbers, 78, 62, set it at 75.

928
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,080
It becomes a problem if the difference was an odd number because then you're going to

929
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,160
fight over that degree.

930
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,520
So you're saying, let's agree to meet me in the middle.

931
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,480
But they live with four roommates who all want 72.

932
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,800
So you're going to get 73 at best.

933
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,960
73 seems like that would be a great.

934
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,000
Why don't you start at 73 and just be like, how does everybody feel about this?

935
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,400
Like boiling a frog.

936
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,960
What?

937
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Like boiling a frog, you start how to boil frog, you start with cold water and then slowly

938
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,960
increase the heat.

939
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,080
You got to slowly boil your roommates.

940
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,800
Why do you want to do that to a frog?

941
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
Why would you do that to a frog?

942
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,800
You don't.

943
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
It's a saying.

944
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
It's a saying of like-

945
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,800
It's a fucking horrible saying.

946
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Yeah.

947
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
You having any other cool animal tortures, Trev?

948
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,800
No, I'm-

949
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
It's just like-

950
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,160
I'm not, I'm not endorsing it.

951
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,800
Just like punching a cow.

952
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,800
Why would you punch a-

953
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,560
More than one way to skin a cat.

954
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Get the fuck out.

955
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,560
Oh, God.

956
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,800
God almighty.

957
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,800
I didn't make it up.

958
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,800
You don't want to skin cats.

959
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
But if you do-

960
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
You do apparently.

961
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
You love it.

962
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,800
Travis, you're saying it's your favorite shit.

963
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,800
There's just different ways.

964
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,360
No, there's just different ways to do it.

965
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,600
There's 27 ways to skin a cat.

966
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,560
Cats are, cats are nature's cousins.

967
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,560
Cats.

968
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
Okay.

969
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,560
Cats are nature's cats.

970
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,560
Cats are nature's cats.

971
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,560
Why would you want to skin them?

972
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
Don't touch them.

973
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,240
Travis, don't ever touch my cat again.

974
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
I don't want to see-

975
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Burned in the hand, two in the bush.

976
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,460
Is that better?

977
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,880
Why are you throwing birds into a bush at each other?

978
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,160
Like angry birds, you fucking animal.

979
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,240
Kill a bird, two birds with one stone.

980
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
Why would you do that?

981
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
Why?

982
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
Why are you throwing rocks at birds, you fucking wild dog?

983
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Just let it fly.

984
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,240
Let it fly away.

985
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,100
We are very violent towards animals in our sayings.

986
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,840
And I'm only now just realizing that.

987
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,840
Seems that way.

988
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,840
Yeah.

989
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
Oh, no.

990
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Seems that way.

991
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
Why are we skinning cats?

992
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
Why are we doing rocks at birds?

993
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
Why are we getting cats and boiling frogs and-

994
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,840
Hey, save a horse, ride a cowboy.

995
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,440
That one's good for animals.

996
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,680
That's a nice one.

997
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
That's my favorite-

998
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,160
Let the cat out of the bag?

999
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,160
Yeah.

1000
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,520
Yeah, you should, probably.

1001
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,000
That's my favorite proverb from Proverbs is save a horse, ride a cowboy, Proverbs 1010.

1002
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,680
For every horse you save, you save two of your own, as I've always said, you know?

1003
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,320
Save your neighbor's horse, get two horses in return.

1004
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,320
There's an elephant in the room.

1005
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,320
We'll let him out, goshdarnit.

1006
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,320
Yeah.

1007
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,320
Let him out of the room.

1008
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,280
Elephants don't believe, unless it's an elephant room where the scale is such that the elephant

1009
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,520
doesn't feel restricted in any way, and it's an outdoor room because that's what elephants

1010
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
prefer.

1011
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,000
The sad thing about that is you can let him out of the room, but he's always gonna remember

1012
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
when he was in the room.

1013
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Oh, yeah.

1014
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That's a real shame.

1015
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
He's never gonna let that go.

1016
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,440
Hey, a stitch in time strangles a giraffe.

1017
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,440
I hate these.

1018
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,440
I hate these idioms.

1019
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,640
I think Benjamin Franklin was a big, weird pervert, maybe.

1020
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,840
No, he was.

1021
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,800
He was a bloodthirsty killer.

1022
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,800
Okay.

1023
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Mm-hmm.

1024
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,160
But he created bifocals so he could look at twice as many dead animals.

1025
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,160
Did you know that?

1026
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,160
Jeez, bitch.

1027
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
Yeah, that's true.

1028
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,840
That's why he started the post office, so he could mail dead animals to himself.

1029
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,000
He had that beard.

1030
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,040
He got that electricity key, and he was like, I can't wait to touch this up against a moose

1031
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,800
or something and see if I can make it explode a new way.

1032
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,120
He tied a key to a kite and the other end of the key to a chinchilla that he had, and

1033
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,760
it's like, ugh, weird.

1034
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,720
What a bad man.

1035
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,720
Yeah.

1036
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,440
We never talk about that aspect, but Ben Franklin is the fucking worst.

1037
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,600
Where's Todd when we needed to hear about that?

1038
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Yeah, Todd.

1039
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,040
Where was Todd when we needed to hear about what?

1040
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,120
Well, Justin, do you see the footprints in the sand and there's only one set?

1041
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,120
Yeah.

1042
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,440
That's when Todd carried you.

1043
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
Through-

1044
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,440
Well, through what?

1045
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,440
I don't know that that applies.

1046
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,440
Well, he picked you up.

1047
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,600
He carried you over the information about Benjamin Franklin you needed to know.

1048
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,400
Oh, like Jesus does with evolution.

1049
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,400
Yeah, like-

1050
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, come with me.

1051
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Whoa, you don't-

1052
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Look over there.

1053
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,400
You don't need to-

1054
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,280
Let me just go ahead and carry you past this.

1055
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,160
You don't need to deal with any of this.

1056
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,160
Let's-

1057
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
Folks, that's going to do it for us-

1058
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,120
End the show.

1059
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,880
That's the end of the show this week.

1060
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:38,120
We hope you've had fun and enjoyed yourself, and we, let's see, we're doing some shows

1061
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,120
out on the road.

1062
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,280
If you go to mcelroyshows.com forward slash tours, you can see the shows we got lined

1063
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,280
up.

1064
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,960
Some things are sold out, but we've still got some seats in Atlanta and Nashville and

1065
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,640
maybe a few in Brooklyn for this September.

1066
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,040
Has Milwaukee woken the fuck up yet?

1067
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,040
No.

1068
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,040
Milwaukee's still snoozing.

1069
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,760
Chicago, you're almost sold out.

1070
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Minneapolis, I think, is-

1071
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,160
No, Chicago is sold out, so we don't have that one anymore.

1072
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,160
Jesus Christ.

1073
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,160
Are you kidding me?

1074
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,240
Yeah, that Chicago theater is actually a very big theater, so I think that's kind of wild.

1075
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,200
But Minneapolis and Milwaukee, we still got some tickets for you, especially Milwaukee.

1076
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,200
Come on.

1077
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,200
Milwaukee?

1078
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,080
Come on, get some friends together to come see this show.

1079
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,560
I'm on November 19th, I get it, but-

1080
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,000
A little bit of a plug.

1081
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,040
Well, let's see, a couple things.

1082
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,920
One, my wife, Teresa, and I are going to be on the JoCo Cruise this year, the Jonathan

1083
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,240
Colton Cruise, coming in February 2018.

1084
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:45,160
They just announced us, so you can go to JoCoCruise, J-O-C-O Cruise dot com, and book your cab

1085
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,200
and stuff now, and come hang out with us on a cruise ship, along with a lot of awesome

1086
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:56,520
cool people like Pat Rothfuss, Gene Gray, Iron Mike Eagle, Sean Hodgman, Amy Mann, and

1087
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,560
a whole bunch of others.

1088
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:04,640
Also, I'm going to be on the JV Club podcast with Janet Varney this week that comes out

1089
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,640
on Thursday.

1090
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,640
Oh, great.

1091
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,160
I mean, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1092
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,200
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1093
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,880
It's a really, really great song and a really great record, and I don't know, go get it

1094
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,040
and go get all the other Long Winters albums, because they're fucking fantastic.

1095
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,820
Oh, I have one more little plug.

1096
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:26,500
My wife and I do a media rewatch podcast called The Kind Rewind.

1097
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,000
We just started watching Firefly, so if you would like to hear us talk about Firefly,

1098
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,920
or if you've never watched it before and want to watch along with us, we put out the first

1099
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,920
Firefly episode where we just watched the pilot and talked about, that's a really good

1100
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
pilot.

1101
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,800
So go check that out.

1102
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,320
We have other shows also at McElroyShows.com, and you can check out all the shows on the

1103
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,760
Maximum Fun Network at MaximumFun.org, because there's a lot of really great stuff there.

1104
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,420
How about that final?

1105
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,420
Bring us home.

1106
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,440
Here's that final from Jason Roundtree.

1107
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
Thank you, Jason.

1108
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,480
A couple other folks sent this in, too.

1109
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,480
Thank you all.

1110
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
It's from Yahoo!

1111
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,480
And it's usurred.

1112
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
Oh, no.

1113
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,480
Oh, no.

1114
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,480
Oh, God, no.

1115
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Is it Todd?

1116
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,480
It's Dirk.

1117
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
Oh.

1118
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,480
Oh, God.

1119
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,480
Dirk is the evil Todd.

1120
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,000
I got to do it, because I don't know.

1121
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,840
I'm sorry you have to read it, but I'm not going to laugh at it.

1122
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
This will be our first song.

1123
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,840
Nobody laugh.

1124
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,120
Nobody laugh at it.

1125
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,120
Do I have to form the meat into the shape of a steak, or does it do that on its own

1126
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,120
in the pan?

1127
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,120
I'm crying.

1128
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
He caught me.

1129
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,120
He caught me.

1130
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
He caught me.

1131
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,120
My name is Justin McElroy.

1132
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

1133
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,120
I'm sorry, Todd.

1134
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,120
Damn it.

1135
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1136
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Sorry, Todd.

1137
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,120
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

1138
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,120
Kiss your death square on the lips.

1139
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:54,800
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

Together, we host a podcast called Still Buffering, where we answer questions like, why should

1148
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,240
I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

1149
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,240
How do I be fleet?

1150
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,600
Is it okay to break up with someone using emojis?

1151
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,200
And sometimes we talk about butts.

1152
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,000
No, we don't.

1153
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Nope.

1154
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,780

I am a teenager.

1157
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,640
And I was too.

1158
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,880
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.
