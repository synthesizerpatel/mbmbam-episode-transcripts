1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:47,120
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,720
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,040
We just forced our editor to cut out three minutes of us talking about

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,200
Terra Cells before we could start the program. It's an epidemic, folks.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,080
Guys, we've got a brand new watch, and I can't stress enough how legitimate this watch is,

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,160
and I'm very excited about it. Yesterday, news went out, DuckTales reboot cast, have you seen it?

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
Griffin, are you losing your mind about this DuckTales cast?

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,840
It's an insane DuckTales cast, but I have a problem with making this a watch, boys. I don't

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,640
think the small screen can be a watch. I think a watch, if it was Passenger's Watch, if it was

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
Star Wars, there's a new Star Wars, that's a big blockbuster watch.

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,440
Bobby Moynihan, Danny Putty, Ben Schwartz, David Tennant, are you kidding me?

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,800
I think it's PewDie because Danny Putty is the fun new holiday toy.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,880
You put it on the newspaper, and yeah, Danny Putty.

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,280
It's hot as hell. Is it a watch, though? Another problem I have with it is it's not here yet.

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,240
I can't watch it.

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,680
How about we're watching the horizon? We're scoping. This is a scope.

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,200
Then it's a scope. If we're doing a watch, then I'm sorry, but it has to be. Trolls is on DVD now,

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,760
probably. It might be.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,600
Here's what I want to ask you guys. They put out the cast list, right?

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,480
Yeah, okay.

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,760
It's pretty, like, they revealed a lot here, but there's still some major characters that

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,800
they haven't announced the casting for, and I want to throw it to us to make that decision for them.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,520
Here's the characters that I didn't see on that list.

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,720
One, the big one jumped right out to me, Magic of Dispel.

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,080
Always trying to get that number one dime so she can cast magic with it.

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,720
Two, Gyrogear Loose.

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
You're just going to, sorry, this isn't a segment where you want to make jokes about

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,960
the actors and actresses that we think could fill these roles. You just want to sort of spout

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,400
lore and show off how many DuckTales characters you know.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
Well, I mean, I do want to talk about, but yes, mostly I wanted to talk about. Also,

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,000
I had this really great joke that you just stepped on where I was going to talk about

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,400
Gyrogear Loose, or it might be Eurogear Loose, and I wasn't sure how it's pronounced.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
It was really good. I've been working on it for weeks.

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,280
Oh, God, I'm sorry to step on that one.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,160
That's okay. You know, they'll fix it in post.

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,600
Okay, so let's start with Magic of Dispel. Griffin, where are you at?

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:28,880
I mean, Emily Blunt, I know she's busy, but not too busy for DuckTales. If David Tennant

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,360
is in the mix, then if Beck Bennett, is Beck Bennett still on SNL?

44
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,880
Uh, yeah.

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,760
He's busy too. Get in there.

46
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
Ooh, Kate McKinnon.

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,960
Okay, yeah, I mean, any SNL, let's just make it an all SNL cast.

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Yeah, can I hit you guys with a sick Magic of Dispel, and it's Ms. Jessica Walter.

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,480
Oh, shit.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
Yeah, from downtown.

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,560
Okay.

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
Shit, that's good, Justin.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,400
It's really good.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,520
Is this gonna, are we gonna get a revival of hot cartoons from my kid age? Are we gonna

55
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,320
get, are we gonna get a tailspin starring Denzel Washington as Baloo?

56
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
That would be amazing.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,360
Reprising his character from flight with just replacing Baloo.

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,600
Uh-huh. He flies the plane upside down drunk, I think. I didn't see it. I saw the trailer,

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
and I think he was drunk.

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,080
Just screaming, wahoo! I see that. It was amazing.

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Here's my question. Here's my question. Here's my question. It's 2016. It will be 2017.

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Donald. Donald. That's what you're wondering.

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
Well, Donald's a big one, but 2017, right, is when this is coming out. It's hitting shores,

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,960
2017.

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,680
What takes, what's taking him so long? You're just drawing funny pictures.

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,880
Well, one, that. But two, what kind of dark, gritty elements do you think they're gonna

67
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,320
put in now that weren't there in our childhood?

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Guns.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,320
Okay.

70
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,560
His cane has got a poison tip. It is fatal. That's a new thing.

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,200
Oh, I wonder if there'll be whole storylines about income inequality in Duckburg.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Interesting.

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,200
We'll raise some troubling, it's a troubling visual. Once you realize he's absolutely one of

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,680
the 0.01 percenters.

75
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,920
He probably, the series probably opens with him getting picked for a cabinet position.

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:31,280
And I think the first episode, we have to watch Launchpad McQuacks, or nope, sorry,

77
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,480
Robo-Duck's grizzly surgery that turns him, that replaces all of his fleshy duck parts

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,200
with cybernetic stuff. So like the lung, the lungs are gone. The duck lungs are gone.

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,840
That weird spiral pee pee, that's gone.

80
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
He's gotta carry them all in a backpack now.

81
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,480
It's all his organs they took out.

82
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,800
I would like to pitch, if you're listening to this Disney XD, and I know he's super

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,440
busy, listen, you can't find a busier man in show business right now, but Fit and

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,040
Crack Show, AKA Gizmo Duck, is Lin-Manuel Miranda. Like that would be amazing casting.

85
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,000
That'd be really good.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
Please make that happen.

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,320
And he could really sell the duck screams as, cause he's awake during the robo-surgery.

88
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
And I don't know why they make us look at this and I don't know why, it's a children's cartoon.

89
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,240
Uh, if I could just put it in my hat here for Donald, cause I feel like, um, my Donald

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,200
is so nightmare-inducing as I've tried to like replicate it for our child. It's so bad

91
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,600
that, uh, my wife makes me do it on command just to make fun of me because she's that

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,480
much in dis-

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,040
Hey, break, break me off a, break me off a piece of that football cream.

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,520
You guys gave me like a line from DuckTales 2017 that he-

95
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,880
Oh my God, my God. There's duck guts everywhere.

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,120
Yeah.

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,840
You sound like, it sounds like a, an interstellar transmission from the cataracts, which is

98
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,840
an alien species that's just sort of, uh, based around violence.

99
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,600
You might also be some kind of like the fly hybrid between Donald Duck and the fish from

100
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
Pee-Wee's Playhouse.

101
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,840
Yeah.

102
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,520
Do you think when you're trying to get your Donald, you have to sound like that for like

103
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,040
a hundred hours and then it just like gels, like it just comes to you? Do you think that's

104
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,360
how it works?

105
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,680
I don't know, bud.

106
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,280
No, I think you're born with it. I think either you've got it or you don't.

107
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,080
Yeah. Uh, and you, you do, you do. Congratulations, Justin. You, baby, you got it. You got that

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,040
sound I've been looking for.

109
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,120
Would you guys be interested in a new podcast called Let Me Hear Your Donald? And it's just,

110
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,760
you talk to new parents or parents who've been in the game for a while, any parents,

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,320
and just like, let me hear your Donald real quick. Let me hear the Donald you're working

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,560
with.

113
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
I mean, if the last year has taught me anything, it's that just we can do basically anything

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
up here and people will listen to it.

115
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:00,800
So.

116
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,160
Yeah. Yeah, do true.

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
Do you want to hear mine?

118
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,040
Yeah, let's hear your Donald.

119
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,640
Hello, I am Donald Duck.

120
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,760
No, that's not anything.

121
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Now I know, I know what you're thinking. That's not it. But here's what I'm planning.

122
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm going to read books about Donald Duck to my child long before she ever sees him

123
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,240
in any kind of moving picture.

124
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,200
And so then when she hears that, that person's doing it wrong.

125
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,440
That's how Donald. So no, no old Disney cartoons, no Kingdom Hearts.

126
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,120
Not till she's like five or six. You know what I mean?

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,760
I put myself out there actually. Real quick, can I just hear, I'm going to leave you boys

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,960
with Uncle Scrooge in your best Donald and not a joke, but like right now, cold.

129
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,520
Give it your best to try to make that classic.

130
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,400
I've got I've got my expense.

131
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
Sure. That'll make it perfect.

132
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
Even better.

133
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,440
What a nice timber that will lend to your performance.

134
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
OK, I'm going to do my best.

135
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,120
Yeah, OK.

136
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,280
Justin, did you do yours one more time as a reference for me?

137
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,040
This is what Donald is supposed to sound like.

138
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
No, no, you do yours right now.

139
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Cold, I'm not stalling for you anymore.

140
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
Make the sound of Donald with your mouth.

141
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,720
I can't.

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,520
I got nothing.

143
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm going to leave you boys with Uncle Scrooge.

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold

145
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,480
Yeah, Travis, I need you to do it for real and not don't laugh through it.

146
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,280
This is serious.

147
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,520
Don't fuck with Travis.

148
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,080
Stop laughing.

149
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
This is a serious moment.

150
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
It doesn't help that Travis is looking at me in horror.

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm going to leave you boys with Uncle Scrooge.

152
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:30,960
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

153
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:59,920
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

154
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:28,880
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

155
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:57,840
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

156
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:26,800
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

157
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:55,760
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

158
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:24,720
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

159
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:24,720
No, I think I'm just doing Bobcat Gold.

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:53,680
