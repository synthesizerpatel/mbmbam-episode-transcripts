1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,760
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. We're live here from the show floor of San Diego Comic Con,

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,440
where we have just witnessed the reveal of Thor 2, Hammer of Thor. Travis, what was your takeaway?

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,320
I- the floor is abuzz, Justin. The floor is on Thor. I tell you what,

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
we can't stop talking about it over here in the booth.

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,440
Now, is it true that they- Griffin, is it true they've started taking- calling the show floor

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,920
the show Thor just because that's how ever-present Thor fever is at the San Diego Comic Con?

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,760
Mjolnir? I don't even know her. Good one, Griffin. Good one.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,200
Jokes like this are some of the many jokes that you'll hear.

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
Thor-related, Thor-centric, everyone is talking about Thor.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,480
Over here at the Stan Lee booth, he's already talking about his cameo appearance

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,200
as that guy who turns around and says one sentence.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,040
Travis, you watched 30 to 40 seconds of teaser footage.

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
What were some of the big takeaways that you noticed?

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,480
There was hammering, there was some lightning, he looked dreamy, there was a swirling cloud.

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,920
I think of something- I wasn't really paying attention. I thought it would be longer.

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
I looked away to get some popcorn. When I came back, it was over.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,000
I read on coolthorblog.com that Loki's up to his old tricks. Confirm or deny?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,480
Oh, no way. He was there, but I could not tell of what quality his tricks were.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
Tell me about Skrull X. Skrull X was awesome.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
Skrull- sorry.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
What?

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,120
Skrull X.

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
Skrull X, is that a Skrull DJ?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
He's a monster. He's a monster in the new Thor movie.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,960
Thor 2, Hammer of Thor, out summer 2013. I'm excited.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,320
Thor 2, Hammer of Thor, out summer 2013. Is it true that they've taken to cooking

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,840
s'mores there at the show floor and calling them Thors?

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
They've called them s'mores? They call them s'mores?

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,840
S'mores?

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
They call these- they call the treats S'morth, Justin.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
And they all have speech impediments. It's very embarrassing for them.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,240
All the Revengers are here. They're all cooking up.

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,960
Fresh S'morth. There's Metal Man.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,720
The- the folk. The folk is there.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
The folk is there, I hear.

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
There's Meat Man and Metal Man and Kit Girl.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Captain USA is there.

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,720
Uh, fresh off- fresh off, uh, fresh off his new movie success,

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
Andrew Garfield is on the show floor in costume as the Flipster.

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,400
He's flipping around, uh, websing- websing any size of foe, uh,

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
and then all this is going on at the San Diego Comic Con,

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
and we are live on the show floor of it.

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,840
The show Thor.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720
On the quietest corner that we could find on the floor.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,440
We managed to hide inside a burrito booth.

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Can we give some advice now?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,240
Yep.

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,640
Don't go to San Diego Comic Con.

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
Stop.

56
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,720
Every- everything I hear about San Diego Comic Con,

57
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,160
it makes it look like a nightmare.

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,560
I had no-

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
You know what, you say that till I see pictures of people, like,

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,600
hanging out with the Mythbusters and hanging out with Mark Hamill.

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,240
And there was-

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,560
Mostly that's just, like, Chuck Bryant.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
Yeah, our friend- our dear friend Chuck Bryant did post a, uh,

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
post a, uh, a picture of himself hanging out with John Noble of, uh, fringe fame.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,160
So-

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,840
From what I can tell, Chuck Bryant just has, like, the best life.

67
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,400
Yeah.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,880
He's, like, living every person's dream.

69
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,520
Yeah.

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,800
He's living like he was dying.

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,480
He's getting it.

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,160
He's getting it into what he does.

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Uh, let's- let's get some advice, uh, answered, given.

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,960
Let's give some advi- ah, Christ.

75
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Let's advice it.

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
Let's advice around.

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
Last August, my girlfriend of seven years dumped me.

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
The worst part is that she was my concert-going buddy,

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
and all my friends are too busy or money-conscious to go to shows with me.

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
I haven't lost my luster for live music,

81
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,440
and would still like to go to shows when I can without relying on having company.

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
Problem is, I don't want to be the creepy dude

83
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,480
at the Dave Matthews Band Show standing by myself.

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,120
Is it okay to go to concerts alone?

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,760
If it is, what can I do to feel like less of a creeper?

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,080
And that's from a real indie rocker in Indiana.

87
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,320
Well, let me just clear this off right off the bat.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,360
You are not the creepiest dude at the Dave Matthews concert.

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,080
Oh, man.

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,880
You're rotate.

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,720
There are going to be people who are way, way creepier than you.

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,240
There are people in the band that are creepier than you.

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
Look to your left.

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
Look to your right.

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,760
One of these people smells like Cheetos.

96
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,080
Both of them have devil sticks.

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Both of them are operating devil sticks.

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,080
Yeah, you have no worries at the Dave Matthews Band Show.

99
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,720
In fact, there are probably concerts that you're gonna fit in better

100
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
because there's more of a communal vibe, right?

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,760
You go to a Dave Matthews Band Show, a reunited fish show,

102
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,760
perhaps a wavy gravy tribute.

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Maybe go to Modest Yahoo and see what his thing is.

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,680
Is he still on the set?

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,320
Oh, he's still good.

106
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
He just had another big hit.

107
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
He's had another big hit.

108
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
It is Modest Yahoo, right?

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
It is Modest Yahoo.

110
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Humble Yahoo.

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,240
Yeah, so I think that those sorts of communal concerts

112
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
would probably be a better fit if you want to go by yourself.

113
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,640
I mean, can I be honest with you guys?

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,120
Yeah, you don't like concerts.

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,040
I am a person in general.

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,520
I just don't get concerts.

117
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
Like, there are special occasion concerts.

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
There's stuff like the concert we went to with Regina Specter

119
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
and They Might Be Giants.

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,400
That was great.

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Seeing Mike Doty in concert.

122
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,200
Like, that was incredible.

123
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,640
You and me saw a show with Amos Lee, Costello, and Dylan.

124
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,600
That was great.

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
That's a big special event.

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,640
I saw Pavement before they really got big.

127
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,760
Yeah, me too.

128
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,160
Let me think.

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,840
That was like, 92.

130
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,640
I saw a show with Electric Six and Junior Senior.

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,880
It was the most amazing show I've ever been to.

132
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,240
So you do like concerts.

133
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,640
But no, but the idea of sitting there around a weekend

134
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,200
and be like, do you guys want to go see a concert tonight?

135
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,080
And like finding, you know, searching one out

136
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,520
and purposefully going.

137
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
It's usually like some big deal.

138
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,320
I would say in my life, I've maybe gone to 20 concerts.

139
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,800
Yeah.

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
In my 28 years.

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
That's the big appeal of festivals to me.

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,160
And I would definitely go to those alone.

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
Because then you don't have, you don't,

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,440
like if you want to leave a show 20 minutes in,

145
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
you're not going to have any baggage there, you know?

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
If you want to go to the bathroom twice

147
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,480
during the Modest Yahoo concert,

148
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,080
there's not going to be a friend there who's like,

149
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
fucking really, dog?

150
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,280
Really, man?

151
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
We've been here for 30 minutes.

152
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,320
What have you been eating?

153
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,320
That's really my big concern is standing in a hot room

154
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
with a lot of people.

155
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,880
Sometimes you got to take a break.

156
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,240
Sometimes you got to dip out.

157
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Can I make a call to arms of all the people

158
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
that go to concerts and listen to our show?

159
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,640
If there are seats available,

160
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,240
if it's like a stadium or they're seating,

161
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
don't don't stand up.

162
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
Why are you standing up?

163
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
You can enjoy it sitting down.

164
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,200
Sitting down is so wonderful.

165
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,080
No, you can't tell people.

166
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

167
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
No, wait a minute.

168
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,600
What are you saying, Travis?

169
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm saying that I hate standing up.

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,480
There are seats there.

171
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,360
I want to stay seated.

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
But when everyone stands up in front of me

173
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,040
and I can't see Harry Connick Jr. singing his heart out,

174
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
like what the fuck?

175
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
Weaving his web.

176
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,080
Weaving his tapestry of narrative and melody.

177
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,360
And he's doing a medley of Christmas songs

178
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,840
and doing a trombone solo and doing it right,

179
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,040
if you know what I mean.

180
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,680
And I can't see it because everybody's on their feet.

181
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,440
But let me pitch this to you, Travis.

182
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,440
You're at the sold out stadium Delamitri concert, right?

183
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
And he's laying down the would-be singles.

184
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,840
He's laying down some tracks, Delamitri is.

185
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,200
It is one man, Del.

186
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
It's a man's name.

187
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
And so Del is up there.

188
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
He's doing his thing.

189
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
And all of a sudden you hear the telltale

190
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,520
Roll To Me intro pluckiness.

191
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,400
Oh, Roll To Me's kicking in?

192
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,480
Yeah, everyone's been sitting this whole time.

193
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
You're telling me that you can resist that

194
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,000
ba-da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

195
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,720
You're telling me you can keep your ass in the seat.

196
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,840
When you hear Roll To Me.

197
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
I think there should be an immediate wave

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,400
of people standing up like, I recognize this song.

199
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760
And then 20 seconds later,

200
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,840
just a synchronized sitting back down.

201
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,000
I think Spike should shoot out of the seat

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
when Roll To Me comes on.

203
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Because if you're sitting on that song,

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
the bad news, you're fucking dead.

205
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,240
Poisoned seats.

206
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
This shouldn't matter because you're a corpse.

207
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
Yeah, your heart's not beating.

208
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,920
It's not pumping blood.

209
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,400
Okay, so how about in the circumstance

210
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,840
that you're at the Delamitri concert

211
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,920
and only then are you allowed to stand?

212
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,760
You should always, like, I don't care if you want to sit

213
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,880
and I don't care if you want to stand.

214
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,280
What I care about is if I'm standing

215
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,040
because I have rented this square for the evening.

216
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,520
This is my real estate for the evening.

217
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,640
If I want to stand and you want to be a grumpster

218
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
because you're a lazy bones,

219
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
that's where I run into issues.

220
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,840
I feel like you're talking directly to me.

221
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,760
Yeah, I mean, apparently.

222
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,720
Like, I didn't know you had such bad taste in manners.

223
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,520
No, it's not that.

224
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,800
Like, we went and saw Foreigner, which was awesome.

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
And Journey, which was awesome.

226
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,800
Let's all list every single concert

227
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,360
that we've gone to because it's charming

228
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
and it's good radio.

229
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
The first concert that I ever went to,

230
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,280
I went with Justin when I think I was 15 and he was 18.

231
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,360
And we went and saw Tom Jones.

232
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,720
That was great.

233
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,080
That was a great show.

234
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,600
So is there more to that story or just-

235
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
No, it starts there.

236
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,520
You just wanted to sort of, I guess, brag?

237
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,440
Does that count as bragging when you say

238
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,960
I went to a Tom Jones concert?

239
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,640
My brother.

240
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
Guys, guess what?

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
Check this out.

242
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
I clipped my toenails yesterday.

243
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
I don't want to brag, but-

244
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,240
Hey guys, check this out.

245
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
Check this story.

246
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,080
I thought that it was time to change my oil,

247
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,000
but I got like another 500 miles.

248
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,520
Not a problem.

249
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,880
I don't even have to worry about it right now.

250
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,400
It can be-

251
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,560
There are people out there that are real jealous of me right now.

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,960
It can be a real bummer summer though

253
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,160
when you're trying to get enthused about a concert.

254
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,880
We went to-

255
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
It's a big problem at festivals.

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Like, we went to Bonnaroo one year

257
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,640
and they have all these different shows at the stage,

258
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
one right after the other,

259
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
and so everybody went and camped out for Radiohead,

260
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,280
but Elvis Costello was playing two shows before Radiohead,

261
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,880
and all these hipsters were laying down

262
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
and saving up their dance juice for when Radiohead was on.

263
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,440
It was like me and two 50-year-olds,

264
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
the only ones standing for this Elvis Costello show,

265
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
trying to groove because he had-

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, who was the-?

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,640
Toussaint?

268
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,040
What's his-

269
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,760
Allen Toussaint.

270
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,800
Allen Toussaint up there.

271
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,440
We were trying to groove to the New Orleans sound

272
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,520
and all these hipsters were sleeping.

273
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,960
Did you have a moment of recognition

274
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,880
with the other 50-year-olds though?

275
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
Did they see you and feel-

276
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
Yeah, we had to.

277
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,280
We had to, and we were actively dancing.

278
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,960
We were dancing on the hipsters.

279
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,520
If you can make it over our way,

280
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,080
we've got some crispy balls of Pinot Gris,

281
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
some rock shrimp,

282
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,160
devein and shit if you want to come over and hang.

283
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,880
Stand near us,

284
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
we'll pop up in another bottle of this Pinot Gris.

285
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,400
I think you just got to go with the consensus.

286
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
If everybody's standing, you got to stand.

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,640
If everyone's sitting-

288
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,600
Was that the question?

289
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
I can't remember the original question.

290
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,400
Can you go to concerts by yourself?

291
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,480
I say yes because it makes it inherently

292
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,440
a stress-free experience.

293
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Now, if you're going to a Skrillex,

294
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
if you're going to a Skrillex concert,

295
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
or if you're going to a Girl Talk

296
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
and there's going to be dancing and gyration and movement,

297
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,600
why not take a few friends?

298
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
Rub up, find out.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,880
What's underneath?

300
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
What's underneath those Tommy H's?

301
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
Let me check it.

302
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,800
What would this feel like?

303
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,520
Hey, Jenny, we've never talked about it.

304
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,880
Let our bodies do the talking.

305
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
Just let the dubstep take you.

306
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
How about we jump to a Yahoo answer?

307
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,200
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Kate Stull.

308
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,760
Thank you, Kate.

309
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,640
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Humphrey, who asks,

310
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,080
will I ever need to wear my cap and gown again?

311
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,760
I just graduated this year.

312
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
What to do with the robe and cap?

313
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
I was wondering if I would ever have an occasion

314
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,960
to wear it again so that I should spend $35 on dry cleaning.

315
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,200
It's not cheap to dry clean the stupid robe.

316
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
My college regalia colors are different

317
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
from my high school regalia colors,

318
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
and I doubt that I could wear it

319
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
to my college graduation ceremony.

320
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,920
I was wondering if any of the following events

321
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,880
would require a cap and gown

322
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,320
or even permit me to wear one.

323
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,080
And what would I wear to these different events?

324
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,760
I will probably be attending this coming year.

325
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,480
Am I clueless?

326
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,560
And then there's some-

327
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,400
All right, list the events.

328
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,280
We'll vote.

329
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,520
Thesis, presentation, and defense.

330
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,720
I do not know what that is.

331
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
It sounds like a power play, though,

332
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
to wear a cap and gown.

333
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,720
A formal academic award ceremony.

334
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,400
Just the cap.

335
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,080
And nothing else?

336
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,800
Nothing else.

337
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,240
Now that's a brave look.

338
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,960
Tell me about that.

339
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
What it says is that I graduated

340
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,080
from the University of Buckin.

341
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,360
Can I put-

342
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
What about just robe?

343
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,280
I got my magna cum loud.

344
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,600
What about just robe cinched?

345
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,120
Oh, rolled up sleeves to the shoulder.

346
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,520
So you're showing the guns.

347
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,160
I like to see some black jeans underneath the robe.

348
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,520
That's a really cool look.

349
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
If you get that look going.

350
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,600
Hem it up.

351
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,080
Hem it up.

352
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,880
Cinch it with a belt.

353
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Hem it.

354
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,160
Black jeans.

355
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
No shirt.

356
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,960
No shirt.

357
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,280
You got a tunic, basically, or a blouse.

358
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,440
Yeah, and have it open to the navel.

359
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
Fraternity party.

360
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,880
Yes.

361
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,520
It depends on the theme, right?

362
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,280
But if you do it, you have to wear it

363
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,640
to every fraternity party

364
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,360
so people start to know you as the robester.

365
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
Oh, that's nice.

366
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,280
Robes Pierre.

367
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,200
Robes Pierre is here.

368
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,680
Could you be Professor Beer Hands?

369
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
Your hands would need to be made of beer.

370
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,680
Have you guys ever heard of Edward Forty Hands?

371
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,640
Yes, I've heard of Edward Forty Hands.

372
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,040
Please, Professor Beer Hands is my father.

373
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,840
Call me Edward.

374
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,640
Professor Beer Hands was invented

375
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,760
right after I got out of college,

376
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
which is a shame because it seems like

377
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
the kind of problem solving I could really get into.

378
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,960
I have to tell you, it sounds like hipster legend.

379
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,360
I don't believe anybody actually does Edward Forty Hands.

380
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,040
I don't believe it happens.

381
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
Can you imagine doing Edward Forty Hands

382
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
and then like you get a phone call?

383
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,880
Yeah.

384
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
Or like there's a knock on the door.

385
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
Or how about you've just consumed 80 ounces of liquid

386
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
and you need to pass it through your body

387
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
via penis or vagina.

388
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
What's the next step there?

389
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,720
Tell me where that terminates.

390
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,320
You just start smacking at your zipper, I assume.

391
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,720
Yeah.

392
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
And hope that luck comes into play.

393
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,600
Yeah.

394
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,920
Dorm Formal, is that like a sex thing?

395
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,880
First off, I hate to see a good portmanteau go by.

396
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
I, it's your Dormal.

397
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,640
I think that is what you should call it.

398
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,280
Secondly, how, I mean, that's pretty formal.

399
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,480
That's pretty, I mean, that's a formal look.

400
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
It makes you look like an educated sorcerer.

401
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
And I don't think there's anything more formal than that.

402
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,320
Hem up the bottom of the robe about six inches, right?

403
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,720
Okay.

404
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,560
And then dress shoes, no socks.

405
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,040
Army guys can wear their Army clothes,

406
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,920
Army guy clothes to fancy occasions.

407
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,440
And graduating from school is like

408
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
graduating from the University of the Army.

409
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,280
These are my brain fatigues.

410
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,680
Thank you.

411
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,120
Yeah, I did a tour of smart duty.

412
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,360
And I think you should be able to like,

413
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
let people know that you're, that you graduated.

414
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,080
I think it sounds like what we're deciding is

415
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,600
every occasion is a robe occasion.

416
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,280
Yeah, we're batting a thousand right now.

417
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,080
How about a job interview?

418
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes.

419
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,800
If you're interviewing for a sorcerer, yes.

420
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,760
I mean, again, it's a power play.

421
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,240
Cause it's like, don't, you don't need to look at my diploma.

422
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,400
You don't need to look at my resume.

423
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
Look, look at this robe.

424
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, and it's also an intimidation play.

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,040
Cause if you think about it,

426
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,480
all the other people in the waiting room

427
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
about to go in for the interview, they look around.

428
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,960
They're like, oh, that guy's way more educated than I am.

429
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,800
Yeah, he's wearing his brain on his sleeve.

430
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,160
Were we supposed to wear our robes?

431
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,960
I had no idea.

432
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,680
Can you, can you wear,

433
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
can you wear over the robe a Boy Scout vest

434
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,400
with all your badges on it?

435
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,880
And maybe like, you know, a miss,

436
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,560
whatever your state is, sash.

437
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,320
Even if you're a man, I'm saying you should deck yourself

438
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,120
with as many status claiming clothing items

439
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,960
as you can possibly get your hands on.

440
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,200
And like a bandolero with like all of your,

441
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,960
all of your baseball trophies in it.

442
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
Yeah, now you're gonna have to tell me what that is.

443
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
You know, like a gun, like a bullet belt.

444
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
That's called a bandolero, you say.

445
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,920
I believe so.

446
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,440
It's a bandolier, bandolarista.

447
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
It's a borbillion.

448
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,240
Borbillion.

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
Should I bring my gold medals?

450
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
Gold medals would be great, a tiara.

451
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,960
Maybe those special contacts you got in high school

452
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
that make your eyeballs look like money signs.

453
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
That necklace that says I'm number one.

454
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
Just let them know.

455
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,040
Such a great investment.

456
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,200
I didn't think it was gonna pay out.

457
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
I didn't know if I was gonna get enough use

458
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,920
out of my money sign contacts.

459
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,680
But I really did.

460
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Because at first you got them for that gag

461
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,800
when someone was like, we're gonna get paid.

462
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,640
And you could go ka-ching, ka-ching.

463
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
And look at them.

464
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
But it has so many more uses.

465
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,560
Not really.

466
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,640
It has about as many uses as your graduation robe.

467
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,360
Because I have mine from, I guess it's from Marshall.

468
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I just don't, I have it, it's in my closet.

469
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
And I keep it and I don't know why.

470
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,120
Because it's not very comfortable.

471
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,080
Graduation robes have one use.

472
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
You hang them on the back of your closet door

473
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
and then you get really stoned

474
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
and then you trick yourself into thinking Dracula's in your closet.

475
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
Okay, that's it.

476
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,320
That's a good one.

477
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,240
Or if your plant is exploding,

478
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
you can wrap your baby in one when you're shooting it.

479
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,360
That's another thing.

480
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,720
That's another thing to go for.

481
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
But that's the only two things.

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,360
Martha?

483
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
Martha seems to be a baby in this crater

484
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,320
and he seems to have graduated from the University of Oklahoma.

485
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,600
Martha, maybe it's just me,

486
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,320
but does this baby look fucking smart or what?

487
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,260
Shit.

488
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,560
He's gnawing on that cord.

489
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,120
It must have essential nutrients in it.

490
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,040
God, he's smart.

491
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
Just throw them away.

492
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
I want to see pictures.

493
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
I want to see pictures of every listener of this show.

494
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,920
And I want to see beers taped to your hands.

495
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,760
I want to see putting a robe in the garbage.

496
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
With your beer 40 hands,

497
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,520
trying to maneuver into the garbage.

498
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
That way they'll have one more use.

499
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,960
They'll help you win our love.

500
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,880
So there you got two uses out of it.

501
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,840
And also to sop up all of the beer that you've spilled

502
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,120
by trying to do something with beer hands.

503
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
Hey brothers.

504
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,880
I've got a problem.

505
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,920
I want to be an actor

506
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,640
and I know it's a very difficult route to take,

507
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,520
but an opportunity has come up that's just too good to pass up.

508
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
I recently started a day job though to make some money

509
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,200
and my parents are very against me losing this day job,

510
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,360
which I might have to lose to take the acting job.

511
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,880
How I let them know my priorities differ from theirs on this one.

512
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,680
That's from Sam.

513
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,520
It's easy.

514
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
You don't tell them.

515
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,840
Yeah, they'll never know.

516
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,520
Wait, what?

517
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,840
What?

518
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I agree with you on that.

519
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,880
There's a ton of stories of celebrities and comedians

520
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,920
who tell the story of like,

521
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,880
well, for a long time,

522
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,600
my mom thought that I was still in law school

523
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,200
or they had no idea that I was doing stand up comedy at night.

524
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
Like, it's the thing to do, man.

525
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,280
Like, don't tell them until you're successful

526
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,760
or until you've got a solid contract and then say,

527
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,280
oh, I'm making money doing that.

528
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,120
Yeah, because that's what is the...

529
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,120
See, you took that road.

530
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,400
So what's the average?

531
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Like 99% of the time you end up on Saturday Night Live?

532
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,880
Oh, yeah.

533
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,600
The problem is you would be able to answer this question really easily

535
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,160
if you could see the perspective in which these events will be viewed.

536
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,680
If you bet big and it turns out you're a success,

537
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,680
none of this will matter.

538
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,920
In fact, it will sweeten your story of success and sacrifice.

539
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,480
If you don't make it,

540
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,040
then this is just a depiction of how low you sank.

541
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,360
Yeah, and you've got to remember that your parents

542
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
are looking at this from the outside in.

543
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,400
And so they're not looking at all of your potential

544
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
and your confidence in this.

545
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
They're looking at it from the perspective of people that love you

546
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,200
and fear for your well-being.

547
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,680
And they're going, that's a pretty big risk.

548
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,440
Yeah, exactly.

549
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,800
When they talk to Grandma Judy this year

550
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,480
for their one time a year Grandma Judith check-in,

551
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
this is the thing that they're going to talk about.

552
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,960
This is it.

553
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,400
Do you think Grandma Judith is like an actual biological grandmother

554
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
or like an old friend of the family?

555
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
I think she's just an old lady who walks around the neighborhood

556
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,680
in her graduation robe from 1938.

557
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,840
She seems wise.

558
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,200
Check it, our son is so dumb.

559
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
What's he doing?

560
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
He had a great job at the Costco.

561
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
I think if you want to broach this topic

562
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
in a way that's going to be palatable to your parents,

563
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,640
what you need to have is a...

564
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm sure that you are confident of your ability

565
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,120
to continue to sustain yourself without the day job

566
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,840
or else this wouldn't be a problem.

567
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,480
You need to talk to your parents about how you're going to

568
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,080
continue to be a sustainable person without the job.

569
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,800
Because if you can do that,

570
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,000
if you can convince them of why you'll be able to continue to take care of yourself,

571
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,960
they won't care.

572
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,600
It's not like they love the fact that you work at Einstein Brothers Bagel Bakery so much.

573
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,400
They just want you.

574
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
Maybe they do, maybe they get a discount on the bagels.

575
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,600
Maybe they do get a discount on the bagels,

576
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
in which case I can't help you.

577
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,760
But all your parents want is to know that you're going to be safe and secure.

578
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
So if you can convince them of that,

579
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,560
they won't really give a crap if you want to have a day job.

580
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,880
You might be able to explain it to them from the point of view of

581
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,880
you get a day job to support yourself to do the thing that you want to do.

582
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,080
So if you have to turn down acting jobs to keep your day job,

583
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,560
it kind of defeats the purpose of having the day job.

584
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:06,320
Um, I think you should sit your pants down and then, uh, like act, act in front of them.

585
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,840
Oh.

586
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,160
Just like do some acting in front of them.

587
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:19,040
To like say, I like, I understand that you do not want me to leave my, uh,

588
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:26,720
assistant manager position at, at the fashion bug, but, uh, would it, would it change things

589
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,600
if I was Sir Lancelot?

590
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,240
And then your parents are like visibly like their, uh, like their eyes go wide and they're

591
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,960
like jaw slackens a bit and it's like, Oh my God.

592
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,600
Oh my God.

593
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,840
It's like Lancelot is here with me.

594
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,000
It's just never, I've just never seen it in context.

595
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,840
Did you hear what he did with his voice?

596
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,960
Where did our son go?

597
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,800
Fuck.

598
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,160
Uh, I know you want me to keep working a day job, but how can I continue to work?

599
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,800
Why should I continue to have a day job when I'm Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark?

600
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,360
It doesn't make any sense for me to make bagels.

601
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,080
Mama and Papa, I have a date.

602
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
I am a Prince.

603
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm a Danish Prince.

604
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,120
Bagels haven't been invented yet.

605
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,800
This is a Danish voice.

606
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,280
Who ever heard of Moliere working at McDonald's?

607
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,560
Probably a lot of people.

608
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,720
Oh yeah, probably would have.

609
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,000
It probably definitely would have.

610
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,600
Uh, I, I hope that helps.

611
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,720
Or you know what?

612
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,560
You want some advice from your old buddy, J-Man?

613
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,640
Just keep the day job.

614
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,920
Climb that ladder.

615
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,520
No, don't listen to J-Man.

616
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,240
J-Man, J-Man is wrong.

617
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,800
J-Man wants everybody to just earn a living and build a society with me.

618
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,520
How about that?

619
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,240
How about everybody, everybody, here's my dream.

620
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,800
We're all in a society together and we all have jobs.

621
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,520
How's that?

622
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,240
How's that?

623
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
We all pay in our own way.

624
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,680
You should quit your day job.

625
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,880
You should pick up a newspaper.

626
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,560
There's jobs everywhere.

627
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,080
People are crazy with jobs.

628
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,440
There's job fever.

629
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,520
They can't find enough people to fill all these great, great jobs they have.

630
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,840
So by all means, quit your day job.

631
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,520
I'm sure you'll find another one.

632
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
You're going to be, you're going to be 23 forever.

633
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,160
Don't listen to your parents.

634
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
You'll be 23 forever.

635
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,320
Oh man.

636
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,820
Fuck.

637
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,180
Come on.

638
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,860
Come on, build this with me.

639
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,180
I know it's not fun being a cog.

640
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,680
Come on.

641
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,540
Come on.

642
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,020
You gotta be a cog to support, you know, the bigger cogs that are on top of you, crushing you.

643
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,100
All that we're saying is that my toilet is broke and it is fucking wicked expensive to fix it.

644
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:47,220
Supply and demand, more toilet engineers equals cheaper toilet maintenance for myself and my man.

645
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,860
Nobody, competition brings down rates.

646
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,260
Yeah.

647
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,300
I had a discussion last night with a, with a young man who was carving a pig.

648
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:01,620
The pig's name was Brian and the, and the, this young man carving, carving it out of what?

649
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,900
What was the man's name?

650
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,740
I do, I did.

651
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,580
I swear to God, I did not learn that man's name.

652
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,300
The pig's name was Brian.

653
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,800
Christ.

654
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,460
Did he take his name tag off and put it on the pig as a goof?

655
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:11,940
Possibly.

656
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,780
Was the pig talkative?

657
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,620
No, the pig was dead.

658
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:23,060
Oh, what? And he told me that I said, where is the best, most delicious meat on Brian?

659
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,500
And he said, Brian's most delicious feature are his cheeks.

660
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,980
People, but they don't sell pig cheeks because that doesn't make any sense.

661
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,060
You, you know, you get one pig, two cheeks.

662
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,180
You can't really box that.

663
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,780
The economics of that don't scale.

664
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,660
And I said, well, why don't you shave me off one of Brian's cheeks and I'll just eat it now before

665
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,500
Brian Grimm gets to tuck into this piggy pig pig.

666
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,860
Cause they won't, they won't, they won't know that the cheeks are the best.

667
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,540
They'll mix the cheek meat in with the rump and then it'll eat it and be like,

668
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,500
oh, that was good rump.

669
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,820
And you're like, you dumb assholes.

670
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,060
You just wasted two sweet cheeks on rump.

671
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,420
So I walked away eating a cheek and thinking

672
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,100
how nice it was to have a conversation with a person that knows anything.

673
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,740
That you didn't bother to learn his name.

674
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,940
He seemed nice.

675
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,020
I, I did not pick up his name, but it was so nice to talk to someone

676
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,780
who actually knew about anything in this digital era.

677
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,740
Pretty much nobody knows anything.

678
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,140
Yeah.

679
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,940
It is so refreshing to talk to someone who has a skill,

680
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,740
some sort of skill that actually has some value.

681
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,620
Especially not like acting, which is bullshit.

682
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,740
Right.

683
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,500
Like learn a trade skill.

684
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,820
Those people are the real artists yourself to somebody like a metallurgist.

685
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,180
Don't do that.

686
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,220
I read Johnny Tremaine.

687
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,260
I know how that shakes out.

688
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,020
Don't do that, but please just learn a skill.

689
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,300
Get in the machine with me, please.

690
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,580
Let's just get this chest.

691
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,820
Let's get this old fucking, this old.

692
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,700
I still think that maybe I'm alone.

693
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,540
I still think there's some kick and some get up and go left in this beautiful,

694
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,780
old machine named America.

695
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,100
Yeah.

696
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,780
So why don't you get in here with me?

697
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,860
Let's rev this engine, kick the tires,

698
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,540
and see if we can't still put some miles between us and the Ruskies.

699
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:15,860
You know?

700
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,220
Because actors are like the fuzzy dice of America.

701
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,540
Yeah.

702
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:19,940
Right?

703
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,500
I love this.

704
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:20,820
Yeah.

705
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,860
I love this.

706
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,740
Please keep chasing this metaphor.

707
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,660
I'm just saying actors are the fuzzy dice.

708
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,980
And like the assistant manager at Einstein's Bagel is like the gasoline.

709
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,380
You're the gasoline that keeps it going.

710
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,620
I think you know about things like bagels.

711
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,340
The produce guy at IGA is like the side view mirrors, right?

712
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,940
Basically, yes.

713
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,740
Take your shot.

714
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,020
And the door handles are the guy who works at the secondhand music store.

715
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,740
Okay.

716
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,500
Take your shot at acting.

717
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,380
Here's your course.

718
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,820
Take your shot at acting.

719
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,500
And even if you miss, you won't land in the stars.

720
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,740
You will land back at home unemployed.

721
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,860
But then what you do, fire up the TiVo, load up an episode of Dirty Jobs,

722
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:08,020
and just throw a dart at the TV and then your TV's going to break the screen.

723
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,420
And then decide that you're going to be a TV repairman.

724
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,220
Precisely.

725
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,300
Real quick before your parents get home.

726
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,260
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

727
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,420
Phoenix Online, help me.

728
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
I need a two and a half hour degree.

729
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,460
Fuck.

730
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,700
Only I learned a skill.

731
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,580
I'm so busted.

732
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,540
Guys, this week on IFC, it's Comedy Bang Bang.

733
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,820
It's an absurd half hour comedy show that only looks like a talk show.

734
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,740
It's comedy so nice they banged it twice with your host Scott Ackerman,

735
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,380
band led by Reggie Watts, and amazing guests.

736
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,980
People like Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen.

737
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,860
This week it's Ed Helms who shows off his banjo and animal noise making skills.

738
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,740
That's this Friday.

739
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,460
Check it out.

740
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,900
Hey, I want to tell you about Squarespace.

741
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,580
It's where you can go to create your own website or blog in just minutes.

742
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,860
It's easy to use.

743
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,820
They've got these beautiful templates and there's a support team there 24 seven online workshops.

744
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,860
Again, someone with a skill making the machine run.

745
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,980
They got free domains when you sign up for one year.

746
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:13,700
So go to squarespace.com and our listeners will get 10% off by using offer code my brother seven.

747
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,100
That's my space brother space seven, the number seven.

748
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,820
So use that code and go build something for yourself.

749
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,780
How about a Yahoo answer?

750
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
Yeah, I'm ready.

751
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,660
Oh, shit.

752
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,260
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

753
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:28,740
Thank you, Lisa.

754
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Minty Fresh who asks, what are some good dance crew names?

755
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,220
I'm putting together a dance crew and previously our name would have been Snick Snacks

756
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,820
with Xs.

757
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,820
There were some issues with using that name as we wanted male dancers too,

758
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,740
but the name was appealing to them.

759
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,500
So the members that I have now wish to change it to a badass name.

760
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,620
Does anyone have any ideas?

761
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,780
We might use the name and we might change some things in it

762
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,220
to make it more suitable for the look of the group.

763
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,180
Thank you, smiley face.

764
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,620
First of all, I want to address that.

765
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,900
What is there inherently about Snick Snacks that implies anything one way or the other?

766
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:14,260
I think Snick Snacks would be a good name for like a plump centric dancing crew.

767
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,460
Those have to exist, right?

768
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,100
You would think?

769
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,980
Like a dancing crew that is mostly comprised.

770
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm just saying that heavy people like snacks, I guess.

771
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,500
Basically, in short, heavy people like snacks.

772
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,980
Can I revise the goof?

773
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,380
Can we looper it, please?

774
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,660
Allowed.

775
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,700
What if it is just composed of Clarissa from Clarissa Explains It All

776
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,500
and Keenan and also Cal and the All That crew?

777
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,460
Oh, I see.

778
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,500
Hey, do you guys remember Snick?

779
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,300
Do you guys remember Snick?

780
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,300
Okay, wait.

781
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,860
Hold on.

782
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,500
Let's operate on the preface that you remember Snick.

783
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,460
I'm going to looper it again.

784
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,860
Back up.

785
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,980
Hey, do you guys remember Snick?

786
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,420
It was this great programming block on the Nickelodeon channel.

787
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,540
Came on Saturday nights.

788
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:16,340
It stood for Saturday nights in kids, Saturday night, Nick, it's Snick, Saturday night, Nick, Snick, Snick.

789
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,860
Are you sure this wasn't a factor?

790
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,500
I am 150,000% sure.

791
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,420
It's been 20 seconds and I can't think of another word that starts with C.

792
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,140
TV.

793
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,700
TV used to be so much more edgy.

794
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,740
You want some All That, you little cunt?

795
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:42,980
Anyway, so this joke, it involves characters from the Snick lineup.

796
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,300
Fuck it.

797
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,780
Oh, I see.

798
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,580
Let's just go.

799
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,540
Let's just go.

800
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,780
I'm trying to think of some kind of badass name

801
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,660
that contains the word Steppen with an apostrophe.

802
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,460
Steppenwolves?

803
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,580
I think that's taken.

804
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,460
Yeah, I guess.

805
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,420
Not the plural, though.

806
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:05,060
So, Travis, I've created a game to help us answer this question and get our brains working.

807
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,700
I'm going to ask you, give you a series of different names.

808
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,340
For each name, I need you to tell me if it's

809
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:17,140
one of the teams that competed on America's Best Dance Crew or one of the Snorks.

810
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:25,140
Now, I feel like I need to sit this out because I've actually watched a couple of seasons of that

811
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,860
and I know how crazy town this shit can get.

812
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,060
I've never watched it.

813
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,780
Let's do this.

814
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,860
All right, Travis, are you ready?

815
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,180
Yes.

816
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,500
Small Star.

817
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,340
Snork.

818
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,380
Correct.

819
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,380
It's a yellow-skinned female infant Snork.

820
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,060
Blueprint Crew.

821
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,780
Dance Team.

822
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,180
Correct.

823
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,020
Hype 5-0.

824
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,100
Is it a Snork?

825
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,700
Incorrect.

826
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,740
That's a Dance Crew.

827
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,180
Vogue Evolution.

828
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,900
That's a Dance Team.

829
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,400
Stop.

830
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,660
Okay.

831
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,420
You expected there to be much more across the arena.

832
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,620
I thought there would be much more.

833
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,420
Anti-Marina.

834
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,580
Oh, I'm going to go with Snork?

835
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,140
Correct.

836
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,940
Static Noise in a Y-Z-E.

837
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,900
That's definitely a Snork.

838
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,700
That is correct.

839
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,580
I'm going to tell you a name.

840
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,380
That is indeed a Snork.

841
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,340
I'm going to tell you a name and I want you to tell me if it's a full name.

842
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,300
A former U.S. president or a member of the Parliament Funkadelic.

843
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,620
Begin.

844
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:38,100
I'm going to say a word and I want you to tell me if it is a fruit or not a fruit.

845
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,900
Here we go.

846
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,460
Asphalt.

847
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,780
Travis, let me hit you with this.

848
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,540
Iconic Boys with a Z.

849
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,260
Is that a Dance Team?

850
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,740
Correct.

851
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,860
Eclectic Gentlemen.

852
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,780
I want it to be a Snork.

853
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,180
I know.

854
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,460
I want it to be a Snork, too.

855
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,540
Is it?

856
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,180
Enigma Dance Crew K.R.U.

857
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,940
I mean, obviously that's a Dance Crew.

858
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,980
I'm just trying to decide if that's the full name of it.

859
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,580
Dance Crew K.R.U.

860
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,060
I can't help you any more than I already have, Travis.

861
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,260
I'm so sorry.

862
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,540
I'm going to go with Snork.

863
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,140
Just trust my gut on this one.

864
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,740
What a big shame is, Travis, what about Jabberwocky?

865
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,820
I know that that's a Dance Team because they do the scary neutral masks.

866
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:30,020
See, if they didn't have that, if they didn't have that fame, that is the only possible

867
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,780
Snork crossover I could think of.

868
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,460
Okay, Travis, one more for you.

869
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,100
Gary Diperman Shider.

870
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,580
Dance Crew.

871
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:46,900
Unfortunately, Gary Diperman Shider was a member of the Parliament Funkadelic.

872
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,580
The Parliament Funkadelic.

873
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,700
So that was cheating on that front.

874
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,660
Travis, grapes, go, begin.

875
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,860
Fruit, it's a fruit.

876
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,940
Yahoo Answers user Izzy dropped some suggests in the Yahoo Answers.

877
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,700
Izzy suggested Maniacs, Bar-

878
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,260
With an X?

879
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,940
No, unfortunately.

880
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,900
Bar-Bara-Ains with a Z and also misspelled.

881
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,140
Possibly Bar-Bara Brains, which is cool.

882
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,460
Bar-Bara Brains.

883
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,100
Fusion, Inbeat Aerodynamics with a Z.

884
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,260
There's also Ferocity 911, which I actually do like that a lot.

885
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,940
Hannah Bar-Bara.

886
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,940
Snork.

887
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,820
Hannah Barbarian.

888
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,660
Man, hey.

889
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,940
Hey Roller Diver girls.

890
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,420
Hannah Barbarian would be a pretty good name.

891
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,540
What about Snorks with an X?

892
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,420
I feel like-

893
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,020
Oh my god, that would be a good Dance Crew.

894
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,500
And then you could just come up with other variations on like little star,

895
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:04,660
but you work the word like high jump into that because that's like an integral move.

896
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,420
You guys would not believe some of the things the Snorks are doing with bubbles.

897
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,940
That's crazy.

898
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,020
They climb into a bubble at one point.

899
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,820
They're in a bubble.

900
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:19,140
Do you guys ever think about what it would be like to be a part of a Dance Crew?

901
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,340
I can't imagine any other like union,

902
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,780
like any level of unity that I could feel with a person more than-

903
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,260
I feel like-

904
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,220
More than a Dance Crew?

905
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,380
Yeah.

906
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:34,820
I feel like my problem would be that I would constantly get momentary groove impulses

907
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,340
and my body would tell me to follow a groove and it would mess up my-

908
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,700
You're a loose cannon, McElroy.

909
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,260
Yeah, exactly.

910
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,260
You've got no place on the Snorks revolution.

911
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,460
I need your dance badge on my desk by three o'clock.

912
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,380
You would be the turbo of the community.

913
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,420
I can't go back to the dance mayor one more time and explain to him why you-

914
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,900
The dance commissioner's on my ass, McElroy.

915
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,460
I'm getting too old for this shit, literally, because my old bones won't do the flips.

916
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,900
I'm tired of answering for your groove shenanigans, groove nanigans.

917
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,700
Maybe you should try putting moves together instead of busting them constantly.

918
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,100
You cost $20 of damage to the dance floor yesterday with your groove.

919
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,500
You set it on fire, literally.

920
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,700
Now I got a- Now the chief of dance commissioning is on my case, on my back.

921
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,780
You're a showboat, McElroy, and you got us fired from working at the showboat.

922
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,580
This is your new partner, a drum machine. Let's kick it.

923
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,860
He's an actual dance robot.

924
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,940
He's a dance robot. You're being replaced.

925
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,980
This is your new partner, Skrillex.

926
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,860
And this is Blade Runner, the dance movie.

927
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,300
Two weeks later, you'll never believe it, the dance robot is turned.

928
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,260
We need you back.

929
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,740
There's one man for this job.

930
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,260
No, I swore.

931
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,020
I swore I would never dance again.

932
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,860
I swore I would never dance again.

933
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,700
No, Paul, don't do it.

934
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,540
You said we're gonna build a life together.

935
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,940
You said you would never dance again.

936
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,380
Don't you understand, Tammy?

937
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,660
If I don't go back and defeat that dance robot in a dance battle, who will?

938
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,900
Get ready to smell the funk.

939
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,820
I will kill you like I did your partner.

940
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,740
I have captured the dance mayor.

941
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,980
I'm going to dance your daughter to death.

942
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,900
No!

943
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,380
No human is brave enough to dance against me.

944
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,420
Oh yeah?

945
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,940
Me and inspiration with three z's have something to say about that.

946
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,460
Let's go, team.

947
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,260
I'm back.

948
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,020
You get him, Dance Carl!

949
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,260
Get him? Really, Travis?

950
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,620
What? What's wrong with Dance Carl?

951
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,140
I'm literally googling Dance Cruise right now to find a name to say.

952
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,380
Oh, fuck.

953
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,220
It's Dance Carl with an X.

954
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,420
Oh, shit.

955
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,460
That is pretty edgy.

956
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,380
Hey, I got a question here.

957
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:07,060
I don't know if I often go to movies because I find the unpleasantness surrounding the screen

958
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,980
outweighs the thrill of seeing what is essentially a really big TV.

959
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,900
In the case of a person making an unreasonable amount of noise, what is the proper etiquette?

960
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,500
The scold in me wants to shush them like an 80-year-old librarian,

961
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,620
but I don't want to be an even bigger asshole than the noisemaker.

962
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,660
What would you do?

963
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,500
That's from Incensed in Indiana.

964
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,820
If I've learned anything from Dad, the proper response is you turn around,

965
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,660
and you make your eyes really big and angry, and you kind of purse your lips together,

966
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,380
and you just stare at them really hard for like 30 seconds,

967
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,740
and then you turn back around without actually doing anything.

968
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,540
I think that's move one, and then move two is you say to them,

969
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,580
hey, can you keep it down?

970
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,940
We're trying to watch a movie.

971
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,340
If that's not enough, if that doesn't work, then I say go to The Usher.

972
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,780
Or nobody wants to be a killjoy like that, but I think that's the only option left.

973
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,660
I think you guys are escalating it a little bit too slow.

974
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,660
I think you gotta shock and awe.

975
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,300
Just like turn around, no warning.

976
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,580
Just yell like, shut it!

977
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,660
Like that in that voice.

978
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,220
Oh boy.

979
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,900
Making direct eye contact with them.

980
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,580
Do you think dump a buck of popcorn on their heads?

981
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,180
I think dunk a buppet of lava.

982
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,580
Just dunk one buppet.

983
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,980
Just dump a buppet of lava on their face.

984
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,700
Dump a buppet.

985
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,460
Get a buppet, fill it with lava.

986
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:30,020
Do I get a discount for buying one carjun of soda and a buppet of popcorn

987
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,980
if I buy both the carjun and the buppet together?

988
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,220
Can I get just like a Borks of Junior Mets?

989
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:42,740
Let me just get some Bummy, get some Bummywerps and a buppet of sweet, sweet nuttered cop corn.

990
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,980
Can I get one of those hot purzels with a little bit of that Cho's all over it?

991
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,460
Thanks.

992
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,460
Do you have the Nietzsche Cho's?

993
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,860
I prefer sort of a mooxican flaver to that.

994
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,540
You got them hot dogs?

995
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,820
I love my hot dogs.

996
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,540
I have all the aphasias.

997
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,820
But you're right Griffin in that you really shouldn't ever have to ask.

998
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,980
We should all know how to behave.

999
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,580
We should all know how to behave, it's not like they have encroached unknowingly

1000
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,460
on your auditory personal space.

1001
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,340
There's no way that you miss that lesson growing up,

1002
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,380
hey don't like talk when people are watching movies.

1003
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,980
Right, I mean it's 101.

1004
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,380
Can you just quietly lift your middle finger in the air and leave it there for the remainder of the film?

1005
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,540
Like without turning around?

1006
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,740
Don't turn around, yeah yeah, because you're watching the fucking movie.

1007
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,220
Don't let them distract from two of your senses.

1008
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,380
Just stick your middle finger in the air and let them know,

1009
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,500
because what are they going to do then?

1010
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,900
What are they going to do then?

1011
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,700
What's their, what's their?

1012
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,780
Oh and like maybe you've drawn a little man on your finger shushing them.

1013
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,860
I don't, I think that, I think that after five seconds he's like,

1014
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,500
hey whatever man, and then after like five minutes he's like,

1015
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,140
okay man, and then like an hour into it he's like,

1016
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,540
I don't know, do I go talk to, what do I do?

1017
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,180
He seems angry still.

1018
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,220
You know what I hate?

1019
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,820
I hate when I'm at a movie theater and I just want to stand up and enjoy myself.

1020
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,540
There's always one guy, there's one guy behind me who's like,

1021
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,260
the groove is overtaking me, I just want to dance in the aisles.

1022
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,620
Yeah, I just want to stand up and just enjoy the movie.

1023
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,020
There's always some jerk.

1024
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,660
I just want Harry Connick to know that I'm really enjoying the show.

1025
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,780
Yeah, yeah.

1026
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,660
Even when he's not there.

1027
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,860
If I want to masturbate during the Katy Perry film.

1028
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,900
You should be able to.

1029
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,860
I, I guess.

1030
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,020
Oh, there's a hilarious, if you guys get a chance,

1031
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,100
check it out on YouTube, it was on the Max Fun homepage, so go check it out.

1032
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,100
Jordan Morris wrote a parody video of an advertisement for Katy Perry for dads.

1033
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,060
Yeah, and Jesse Thorne, yeah, narrated it.

1034
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,180
It's good stuff.

1035
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,380
It's on Funny or Die, I believe.

1036
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,500
Hey, serious answer to that question, just moved to Austin.

1037
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,660
Our theaters, if you talk here, they shoot you.

1038
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,900
Yeah, dude, we went to the Alamo Drafthouse, it was amazing.

1039
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,700
Yeah, yeah, everybody just so, it's so scared.

1040
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,700
I've never been so terrified watching a film before.

1041
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,260
They play scary music and they put up words on the screen

1042
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,940
that say they'll fucking kill you.

1043
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,500
They'll fucking kill you, I saw it once.

1044
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,140
I thought the scene, the scene they show from Schindler's List was a little unnecessary,

1045
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,220
but I certainly think it gets the point across.

1046
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,380
Yeah, I saw them kill a kid.

1047
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,580
Yeah, that was pretty hard.

1048
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,140
They fucking killed.

1049
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,540
It was like that scene from Reservoir Dogs.

1050
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,060
Here's the worst part, it was during a Dora the Explorer short at the beginning,

1051
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,980
and she was asking for feedback.

1052
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,220
Yeah.

1053
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,740
I mean, she was begging them to say, where is, where is Steeler?

1054
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,940
Yeah, what is this?

1055
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,740
It's a backpack.

1056
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,620
Oh, fuck.

1057
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,660
Sorry, Swiper.

1058
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,780
Fuck, fuck.

1059
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,260
Hey.

1060
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:44,900
Hey.

1061
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,220
Hey.

1062
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:45,700
Fuck.

1063
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,100
Hey.

1064
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,420
Guys.

1065
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,340
Guys, if we can't at least be factually correct about Dora the Explorer,

1066
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,780
then what the fuck are we doing here?

1067
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,420
If you wanna keep us from swiping things, then you're gonna need to follow us.

1068
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:21,620
Who's this message from?

1069
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,220
It's for Jasmine.

1070
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,340
Who's this message from?

1071
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,180
It's for Matt.

1072
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,620
Happy birthday, Jasmine.

1073
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,140
I got you this Jumbotron,

1074
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,860
because I know how much you love those McElroy brothers.

1075
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,620
Almost as much as you love cooking bacon,

1076
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,620
candy, delicious things, beating me at Magic the Gathering,

1077
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,020
playing Guild Wars, and watching documentaries about bears.

1078
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,420
That's the best life ever.

1079
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,540
That's such a good life.

1080
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,580
You've done it.

1081
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,980
I think you're the coolest and love you like crazy.

1082
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,020
That's from Matt.

1083
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,180
He put it with three T's both times.

1084
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,980
So I'm thinking that is how he actually spells it.

1085
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:56,260
Do you think maybe it's pronounced like Matatata?

1086
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,540
His name is a drum roll.

1087
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,220
Matata was my favorite Pokemon.

1088
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,180
Matt, Matt.

1089
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,460
Hey, Matt.

1090
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:06,580
Matt.

1091
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:07,540
Yes.

1092
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,540
You rang.

1093
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,340
You rang, yes.

1094
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:13,780
Can I help you?

1095
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,180
This message is for Jillian.

1096
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,180
It's from Seth, who says,

1097
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,020
congrats on getting through your surgery, you got through the tough part, now just take it easy.

1098
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,460
It might be hard right now, but if it wasn't hard, everyone would do it.

1099
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,380
The hard is what makes you great.

1100
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,220
Just keep calm and stay strong.

1101
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,780
Best foot.

1102
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:31,940
Isn't that sweet?

1103
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,700
Proud of you, Jill Jill.

1104
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,700
We get a lot of, we get a lot of goofies in here,

1105
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,060
but sometimes something real sweet and genuine happens.

1106
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,060
And I think that that was one of those moments.

1107
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:48,660
And I think the more we talk about it, I think it magnifies it somehow.

1108
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,460
Beautiful.

1109
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,940
The more we inspect it, the more beautiful it becomes.

1110
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,820
It's almost as if we are more responsible for it than they are

1111
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,460
because we have dwelt on it for so long, don't you think?

1112
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,260
Yeah, it's like we made it happen retroactively.

1113
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:11,060
Hey, I want you guys to check out a new San Francisco based lifestyle podcast with a humorous

1114
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,300
bent. It's called the Philosopher Kings.

1115
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,740
They discuss topics like the fashion sense of Captain Ron,

1116
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,460
which Eiffel 65 song is topping the charts in Germany,

1117
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,220
the ultimate cocktail to accompany your next screening of Point Break.

1118
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,620
There are special guests like a Google employee,

1119
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:31,140
acclaimed drag queen slash filmmaker Peaches Christ,

1120
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,020
and our lesbian roommate, Lauren the Ape.

1121
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,820
So, I have nine questions in this show.

1122
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,860
Yeah, I have 50 questions. I need another podcast about how to understand the ad for

1123
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,540
the Philosopher Kings Guide to the Good Life. That's in iTunes.

1124
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,220
Search for Philosopher Kings and subscribe right now.

1125
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,780
And honestly, if that description isn't enough to make you do it,

1126
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,580
I don't know what you're waiting for because that's a lot of enigmas there.

1127
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,060
I'm going to be a bridesmaid for a wedding this fall.

1128
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,660
The bachelorette party is scheduled in about a month,

1129
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,060
and I've just received word from the maid of honor that it's going to be fairly classic,

1130
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,380
or cliché, depending on your viewpoint.

1131
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,260
She has scheduled an afternoon at the spa, followed by dinner, drinks, and dancing downtown.

1132
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,260
We are expected to perform the evening's festivities decked out in...

1133
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,380
I was waiting.

1134
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,380
In penis jewelry.

1135
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,820
Is that jewelry for your penis?

1136
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,380
That is not jewelry for your penis. It is jewelry depicting

1137
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,700
the image of a penis.

1138
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,820
The knight is going to culminate-

1139
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,420
Like a die-cast medal of penis.

1140
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:38,980
Exactly.

1141
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,660
His knight is going to culminate with a visit from a male stripper to our hotel room.

1142
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,940
Hey, I've got one of those.

1143
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,980
I see y'all are big fans.

1144
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:58,340
I see you're fans of dicks. Well, get ready. I have one to enjoy. Please to enjoy.

1145
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:04,260
My dick's got a smaller ring with a dick on it. Check this out.

1146
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,980
Somebody get a microscope and see the dick that's on Hit's dick.

1147
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:16,820
Do you have any tips for how I can get through this shindig with some dignity intact?

1148
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:21,540
Some dignity intact. That's from Petrified in Pittsburgh.

1149
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:26,420
Yeah, I got a quick solution for you. Don't go. That sounds like the pits.

1150
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,460
This is one of those things where it's not like you're missing something

1151
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,580
and there's some trick to coming through it with your dignity.

1152
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,380
It's designed to be embarrassing and wild and crazy and silly.

1153
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,260
But it's not, though. Is there some point-

1154
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,980
And I'm legitimately torn on this question because

1155
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,580
we can all take a vote and agree that's terrible.

1156
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:52,260
Yeah. And let's make it clear, regardless of gender,

1157
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,700
if the genders were swapped, still fucking awful.

1158
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,300
That's the pits. If I have an evening as a gentleman

1159
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,380
where one guy is going to look at me and be like,

1160
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,700
this is just like in Swingers. I'm out.

1161
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,660
Oh no. Fuck that dude.

1162
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,580
I'm 100% out.

1163
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,060
And I love Swingers at night.

1164
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,620
You're ruining my point.

1165
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,180
Don't get me wrong. Anyone who says that makes me want to kill them.

1166
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:17,380
The problem- Okay, so there's one perspective that I can definitely see this from

1167
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,980
where it's like, you're a fuddy duddy.

1168
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,380
I know it sucks, but just go along with it because this is what you do.

1169
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,340
But isn't that like while we're still doing funerals?

1170
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:30,580
Because no one says, hey, this blows. Can we not anymore?

1171
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,140
I don't want to be rude, but- Isn't there a possibility, though,

1172
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,340
that this is what the bride really wanted for her thing?

1173
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,300
Because she's nasty.

1174
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,780
She wants to get rowdy and nasty.

1175
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,860
I mean, is it possible that this is her dream bachelorette party?

1176
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,140
That's- I mean, that's probable.

1177
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,100
I mean, you have to suppose that.

1178
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:58,820
And it's like, this is the last legit non-jewelry penis

1179
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,620
that this woman's going to see other than her sweet betrothes.

1180
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,820
I could see- maybe, I guess.

1181
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,300
I can't divorce myself from the fact- I could never be in that situation,

1182
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,100
and I have not been in that situation, but I could never be in it

1183
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,580
and be like, this is a professional.

1184
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,460
It's cool because we're giving them money.

1185
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,180
It would still be like, here's a naked person in a place where they're the only one.

1186
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,540
So, neat.

1187
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,300
How enjoyable.

1188
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,380
Hey, that's neat, I guess.

1189
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,340
Having a great time.

1190
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,540
Good. You know what you should do?

1191
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,740
You should go full blown.

1192
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,940
You should just furiously masturbate and just be like, what?

1193
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,740
I'm enjoying it.

1194
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,180
Isn't this what you wanted?

1195
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,700
This is a typical response, right?

1196
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:40,820
What?

1197
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,180
Should I not be twibbing it right now?

1198
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,300
Yeah, expose-

1199
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,420
You planned it, Debbie.

1200
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:44,980
You deal with it.

1201
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,540
Expose-

1202
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,460
Planned it.

1203
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,380
Expose the norm.

1204
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,180
That's what I'm saying.

1205
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,180
If I find I'm going to be in an uncomfortable scenario,

1206
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:00,260
sometimes one of the tricks I do is I try to learn more about the scenario than anybody there.

1207
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:06,740
So, I can try to make myself the most- like, get super deep into etiquette for male strippers.

1208
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,620
Like, what is off limits?

1209
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,180
What is good?

1210
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:10,580
What is not?

1211
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,780
Oh, no, no, no.

1212
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,260
Okay, Susan, you'd have a dollar for each ball.

1213
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,100
It's a dollar per ball, Susan.

1214
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,260
Oh, you looked right into his spread, but you can't-

1215
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:25,300
Is that a move that male strippers do?

1216
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,020
He parted them for you, you know that.

1217
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,700
He parted them, it's five dollars.

1218
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,060
I know what you're going to love.

1219
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:39,380
You know the part of the show where he spreads his butt cheeks and stands motionless for 15 minutes?

1220
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,820
And you throw Skittles.

1221
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,020
It's like a carnival game.

1222
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,580
You're not actually supposed to look for more than 20 seconds at a time.

1223
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,460
Or else it loses its specialness.

1224
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,020
Actually, no one's supposed to look.

1225
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,700
If you look, he leaves.

1226
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,980
He scambres off.

1227
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,420
He just starts-

1228
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,180
Oh, you spooked him, Sheila.

1229
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:02,660
Damn it.

1230
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:02,980
No.

1231
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:09,220
He starts anytime someone looks inside his spread bow, he starts the timer over again.

1232
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,260
People die of hydration this way.

1233
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,700
Hey, somebody look.

1234
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,380
God damn it, Christy.

1235
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,300
God damn it, I gotta start again.

1236
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,060
One, two.

1237
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,740
No one look at my spread butthole.

1238
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,380
Please.

1239
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,980
Isn't that the plot of Magic Mike?

1240
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:36,660
It's basically the first hour and 45 minutes are him trying to get through the 15 minutes.

1241
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,100
No, it's an interactive film.

1242
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,780
It is just Stockard Channing-

1243
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,060
But it's on the honor system.

1244
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,780
You have to push the button connected to your seat if you-

1245
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,060
It is just Stockard Channing's spread butthole on the screen.

1246
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,820
Yes, mom and dad.

1247
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,300
I do want to pursue acting and I'm sorry, but I'm quitting my day job as the usher that

1248
00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:00,260
has demanded the audience to make sure no one looks at Channing Tatum's spread butthole.

1249
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,100
I said Stockard Channing!

1250
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,100
You said Stockard Channing!

1251
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,260
Stockard Channing doesn't hurt me!

1252
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,140
You said Stockard Channing's spread butthole!

1253
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,420
You conjured that image into existence with your words!

1254
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,060
Throw up!

1255
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,540
Now everyone is thinking about Stockard Channing's spread butthole.

1256
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,380
It's your fucking fault!

1257
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:28,020
You know, you actually said it and I went through this montage similar to like Showgirls

1258
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:33,300
where Stockard Channing is like training Channing Tatum.

1259
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,420
No, you gotta spread it like this to really get the soldier's vitriol up.

1260
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,540
Your humors are all out of whack, Channo.

1261
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,140
Take it from me.

1262
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,380
You know that's not the first time that switch has happened.

1263
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,420
Oh, Christ.

1264
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,740
This has been our comedy advice show.

1265
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,420
My brother, my brother and me, thank you so much for listening to it.

1266
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,660
Griffin has a formal apology he'd like to issue.

1267
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,420
I'm sorry, Ms. Channing.

1268
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,100
You were the president's wife and I did you wrong.

1269
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,580
Yeah, you did it real wrong.

1270
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,540
Thank you for everybody tweeting about the show.

1271
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:18,260
Jay Christie, Billiard123, Socketeer, Scrattybones, Luke Docker, Slaskimo,

1272
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:23,460
Pit Danger, Tracy Wilson, Ivy Warner, everybody.

1273
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:32,020
Thank you for tweeting with the MBMBAM hashtag and helping us to spread the word about the show.

1274
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:37,140
If you tweet about it, you want to help expose more people, that's the best way we have it growing.

1275
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,020
Just send it to bit.ly forward slash It's My Vim Bam.

1276
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,820
That's our sampler and then get a get a taste of the show and see if they like it.

1277
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,820
And I want to say a special thanks to Lori and Jonah.

1278
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:53,780
They came and saw the complete works of William Shakespeare with me in it and brought me

1279
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,020
a shit you're not the most amazing cupcakes I have ever tasted in my entire life.

1280
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,500
That's sweet.

1281
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,460
Thank you guys so much.

1282
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,860
And Lori was sweet enough to make me swear that I would share them with the stage manager

1283
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,140
because her brother was a stage manager and nobody ever brought him anything that was

1284
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,580
brought the actor stuff.

1285
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,420
I know it was like the sweetest thing.

1286
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,780
So thank you guys so much.

1287
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,580
Thank you for coming.

1288
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,380
Thank you for watching.

1289
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,060
Thank you guys so much. Thank you for coming.

1290
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,420
Thank you for the cupcakes.

1291
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,060
Now you definitely didn't share those with the stage manager, right?

1292
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,420
No, I shoveled them straight into your throat.

1293
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,300
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1294
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,980
It's a departure off the album.

1295
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,740
Putting the days to bed.

1296
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,100
Go buy it.

1297
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,140
I can't stress this enough.

1298
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,180
Don't Spotify it.

1299
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,420
Don't because I'll know.

1300
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:39,460
Also, if you haven't, go give a listen to the other maximum fun shows.

1301
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,380
Jordan and Jesse Go, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Throwing Shade.

1302
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,340
And our new little brother, Memory Palace.

1303
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,540
There's some good stuff in there.

1304
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:51,620
It's a bit of a tonal shift, I would say.

1305
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,180
They're not going to talk about Stock and Channing Spread's wide butthole.

1306
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,300
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to it.

1307
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,180
In fact, it probably means you shouldn't listen to this anymore.

1308
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,660
Ironically, no.

1309
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,300
So go check out the Memory Palace.

1310
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,420
Yeah, it's on iTunes.

1311
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,060
You search for it.

1312
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,700
You listen to it.

1313
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,500
You subscribe.

1314
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,780
And subscribe and review our show.

1315
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,100
As long as you've got the program booted up.

1316
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,860
As long as you're already winning your C prompt and loaded iTunes.

1317
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,140
Go ahead and throw us a review.

1318
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,540
This final Yahoo was sent in by Jake Carter.

1319
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,100
Thanks, Jake.

1320
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Cory, who asks,

1321
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,620
can a kid with a very mild concussion go to Dave and Buster's?

1322
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,300
I'm Justin McElroy.

1323
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,020
I'm Travis McElroy.

1324
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1325
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,060
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1326
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,860
Kiss your dad.

1327
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,300
This boy on the lips.
