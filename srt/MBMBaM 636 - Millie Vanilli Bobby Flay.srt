1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,420
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,920
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother my brother me an invite show for the Machinero. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I am your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,880
Justin's got the goggles out. I got the binoculars. This is my new thing

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,440
I feel like Tom has been posting more videos on our tik-tok channel. Yeah

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
We got a Richard sink up there on YouTube

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Does that

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,320
But Tom's been doing more tik-tok so I feel like I should be it's McElroy family if you follow us on tik-tok

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,240
He might win a big prize and the prize is entertainment

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,560
Yeah, to be fair throwing that might in there is a big might because doing anything you might win a big prize

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,080
You might win a $100 Dave and Buster's gift card

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,480
For an unrelated reason. Yeah, not from us. Just like all things are connected kind of way

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,440
so I'm trying to incorporate more visual elements and this one I came up with his like I'm looking in all our

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,960
Friends that have joined us more something for kids. Okay, I guess here's what I'm saying. There could be visual elements for kids

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Elements for adults so it's a if the kids are watching on YouTube. They like it better. Yeah

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,720
Do you understand so the one? Yeah, I will say that a majority of our audience still does live in the audio

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
Space and so when we do these things

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,300
They won't get that and they'll hate that and they'll either tell us they hate that which hurts my feelings

25
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,340
Feelings or they'll stop listening and supporting us

26
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,800
fungibly and that hurts

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,420
What? Okay, Justin has found us adding some marbles. Is that what that is? Is that a little mark?

28
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
I have these clips in a bag

29
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,660
The audio elements are for adults. Okay, then just watch it on mute. So it's got to be stimulating for kids

30
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:04,940
Okay, if I may what we need is a visual like maybe mascot character or somebody who pops up that we do not reference

31
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,420
But it's just like in like the corner of videos, right a little fun

32
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,220
Now Justin's talking to his guitar clip. It's his capo. Yeah, but Travis you don't mention it. That's the thing

33
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,360
That's the challenge Travis is that we do the can we maybe mayor? This is mayor capo

34
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,140
mayor of music bird fucking go

35
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,900
He's the mayor of music burg. He's a kids love

36
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,340
The capo character mayor capo. Yeah, I think he's he's upside down for the way

37
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,800
I think he should be shaped as a character. Here's the okay, you're not wrong, but I can't squeeze

38
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
Maybe we flip it because

39
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,740
adults

40
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:52,920
the left side of their brain is the visual cortex and they like they like that and but kids like to have a

41
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,760
imagination so they maybe we should do the audio for kids and

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,560
and the

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
Grown-ups get the video so it can be like hey

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,520
Why did the cow go to on a where the cow go on a Friday night to the movies?

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,680
That's pretty good. My with my hands. I'm doing a pork in it gesture. That's right. Do you know what I mean?

46
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,700
Yeah, what do you call a fish with no eyes?

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,920
And then I'm still doing the pork in it gesture. Well, here's the problem with these visual elements. What's wrong trap?

48
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,120
They're very distracting for me. Hmm. Yeah, because I can't stop looking at what Justin's doing

49
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,680
Yeah, and trying to figure out exactly what he's going for. He's a real sourpuss. I've got a terminal case of the grumpies

50
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Yeah, a terminal case

51
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,840
Kids know that that means they have exactly 15 minutes to save me before I

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah, and so they have to send money in they have to send money

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,680
And buy our merch join the max fun network then buy our merch at Walmart and Target and get our new meal delivery

54
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,800
We have our own pop-up kitchen

55
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,200
It's called Mackle snacks and that's use on you can get that on all your favorite apps kids

56
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,840
And the Mackle snacks aren't very good and they are it's like $15 for like a girl can open their own ghost kitchen

57
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,340
Why yeah, I have noticed that we don't do enough BB likes the videos. It's like we're this family's

58
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,340
Like promoting themselves to earn money and shilling out to YouTube and we're gonna all sleep

59
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,540
Don't you hate when families promote themselves?

60
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,980
I know right isn't the worst we're gonna we're gonna sleep in a bouncy castle inside the house tonight

61
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,180
And then BBO trying to like can we sleep in a bouncy castle and I have to try to explain to her like that's not

62
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,420
A real thing that people do that's the thing they're doing for this fun YouTube. This is not an option

63
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,940
Normally good converting our living room into a like a ball pit is not a thing

64
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,380
It's not a thing. That's not a thing people Charlie asked me if we could do it eat only orange food challenge

65
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,140
And I said kid you you're already doing daily food challenges. It's called the eat only bread challenge

66
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,680
Yeah, and then cry if you don't I do that try to get my kid to eat a good variety challenge every day so far

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,080
Uh, the hit rate is low. Hey, this is an advice show. We're giving you freebies right now

68
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,400
No, even ask for our pairing advice or just dumping it right on your lap. Yeah. Oh, okay

69
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,680
No one should ask for our parenting advice, by the way, I mean, I'm not saying we're bad parents

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,320
But I'm my kid is there's no way that it's a normal like the thing that I'm going to just

71
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,360
She sometimes turns into a gargoyle at night. It's not important. Don't worry about it guys

72
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,840
You

73
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,360
Guys remember that show gargoyles. I got to real that got to my girlfriend recently proposed to me by setting up a beach picnic

74
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Oh

75
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,760
Both move a beach picnic because with too much wind that's all yeah to me

76
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,840
It's one of my favorite favorite foods

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,140
Including a butternut squash pasta dish

78
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,000
Since she did not have access to the recipe. I usually use she ended up improvising

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,600
Oh boy and researching an entirely different recipe. The problem is I actively dislike this recipe. Oh, man

80
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,280
Obviously, I wasn't gonna say anything is I don't want to hurt her feelings or ruin the thought you put in our proposal

81
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,480
But now she wants to include the pasta dish in our daily rotation of recipes

82
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,400
And I don't know how to sidestep it without admitting. I never liked the engagement pasta. Oh boy

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,760
Engagement pasta sounds like something a social media ninja would be would be yeah

84
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,960
Sure, people bro the SEO the engagement pasta on this tweet. It's pretty low need more J pegs

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,160
Hey Olive Garden, it's me Doug your social media manager. Let me I have a suggestion for you. It's called engagement pasta

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,120
You're gonna finally raise them in brothers. What do I do?

87
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,800
Do I admit I don't like our engagement pasta and risk putting a cloud over what was a very thoughtful and amazing proposal or do?

88
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,640
I resign myself to eating mediocre and post my posture pop

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,880
jerk

90
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,780
Impostor pasta. Thank you for the rest of my life. That's from pasta prisoner in South Carolina

91
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
What do you think of this move

92
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,840
The next time they make it say hi. Did you do something different this time?

93
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,240
It doesn't taste the same and and then try to do like the maybe it was

94
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,200
Like just so full of love as you didn't put any love in this one. Why didn't you put it?

95
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,440
Yeah, that runs a pretty serious risk Travis of making it sound like you are ready for this engagement to be terminated

96
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,400
Just like hmm. Oh, this is very this very important passes VIP

97
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Something's missing something is missing Patrice. Oh, maybe that's it. It's very important pasta. I just feel like we should save it

98
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,480
For special occasions. This is like a special that's a special pasta. We can't just have this pasta every day. This is our

99
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
Engagement pasta. I yeah, there's ritual their sack their ceremony. There's

100
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Sacrifice their sacrifice gonna say sacrifice, but that's not what I meant. They're a sacrifice that butternut was doing just fine

101
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, thank you. I think it's cool

102
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,840
To do beach pasta and nobody talks about this

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,080
But when you go on the beach, everybody's like I brought goldfish crackers. I brought

104
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,720
ham I brought no pasta I didn't bring pot but every time I'm on the beach and I'm eating

105
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Fritos and I'm eating

106
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,520
Uncrustables, I'm sitting there thinking like

107
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Some gnocchi would go down pretty smooth right now, but nobody's brave enough

108
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,120
I wish I had a nice hot pasta a nice because here's the thing

109
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sure that some people right there like already jumping to mastodon

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,280
To mastodon us. Yeah, I haven't figured it out to say like in their little weird holes

111
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,340
To say like what about pasta salad? It's like no no, no, we're talking about a nice steaming bowl of hot butternut squash

112
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,340
hot butternut squash pasta

113
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
I've been married for

114
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,060
17 years now ish

115
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,160
What's your what's your secret? That's so long. I'm about to reveal it actually

116
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,600
Be old. That's okay. It's number two is uh, I

117
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,800
Can say with confidence you do not need to address this because my friend is gonna come out

118
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,160
You're gonna take a they're gonna they're gonna ask you how much you love it

119
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,140
There's gonna be a half a moment a nanosecond of hesitation

120
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,040
Yeah, just a single moment and the person who knows you better than anything in the world is gonna say you you don't

121
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,880
You don't like it. You don't like the dish and then you can address it

122
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,880
You don't have to intentionally take it on. The other thing I tell you is the

123
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,000
Idea that we get to choose our food is a relatively new concept in the process of humans

124
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,400
All right, here we go again, and you should probably just

125
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Yeah, you should probably just eat it a little salt little pepper. I

126
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,880
Little tahini from this guy on your butternut squash tahini on your little

127
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,840
I don't go wild maybe a little like a ginger based hot sauce in there

128
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Yeah

129
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,040
Maybe crumble up some fucking

130
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,920
Takis and like throw that in there and then maybe put in some fucking maple syrup like you're the elf from elf is what I'm saying

131
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
This will like address

132
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,480
The issue if your partner sees you go to get the ingredients that aren't in this one

133
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,320
Yeah, like it's like hey

134
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,720
Can we have some table side cumin so like salt and pepper and some table side cumin with fresh parsley that's like chopped up

135
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Like can we have some of that just like table side and maybe like pizza on the side the original

136
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
The original recipe is on

137
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Uncompromised it is it the love recipe is still there

138
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,280
But the the tahini represents our growth since the engagement it

139
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,600
Represents the curveballs that life throws at us sometimes sometimes also it represents that recliner

140
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,960
We bought together. You know what? I mean? Like you make it just make it you make the butter you make it you make it

141
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,280
You make hot shot. Hey hot shit. You think you're the best at making butternut squash. Why don't you fuck?

142
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,320
Let's see what you've got and send it to the three of us. We'll eat it live on air

143
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,920
Oh, yeah, it was an A&B Pepsi verse coke taste challenge. We'll do a blind taste as a both of them

144
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,420
We'll tell you which one loves the other one more if you make it and your partner is not like this is outrageous

145
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Yeah, this is so much better than what I normally do then they then listen

146
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,800
They like there's more. Yeah. Oh, maybe you make your own

147
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,240
personal pan butternut squash beach pasta and then you put it before a panel of judges including

148
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,820
I net garden. Yeah, Bobby Flay. Yes, and for no reason Millie Bobby Brown

149
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,600
I believe Bobby Brown and Bobby Bobby Flay is our new show on the Food Network. We ran out of ideas

150
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,120
It's Millie Vanilla Bobby Flay, come on, let's go we have no ideas left

151
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,520
The wizard would like to share it it you're done talking about butternut squash pasta. I have a hard time believing that I'm

152
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,240
Hungry, I am hung. It's making me really hungry. Actually, I would like to move

153
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,360
I don't even like butternut squash pasta, but it's one of those things where when you talk about it enough

154
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,400
It's like do I like squash is deceptive like that, especially butternut squash. Yeah, you hear that you say that enough times

155
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,120
You're like sweet creamy treat and you try to eat it. No, the only squash that lives up to it is

156
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,120
Delicata everything else is a pretend everything else sucks shit. This is how to pick. I mean everything how to become a fool

157
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,720
I

158
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,960
Become a fool. This one's got a lot of good wisdom in it is also posted in fun activities pranks practical jokes

159
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,600
So it's like that's a that's a big scope wiki. How fun activities is

160
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
most

161
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,600
Fit like umbrella umbrella, but that could be like taking a nap or bowling

162
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,440
Damn, I'm looking at the have fun activities list now and there's some there's some stuff in here

163
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,600
I've never even thought about before like how to have computer fun content games writing and more or how to pop a balloon

164
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,080
Huh? There's how to tie up a balloon and then how to pop a balloon and then how to perform grindcore vocals

165
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay, how to release a balloon back into the wild. Yeah, damn

166
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,960
I almost kind of want to read some of these how to entertain yourself without objects. Holy shit

167
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,440
Oh in like a in a completely empty void

168
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,400
Yeah to entertain yourself. There is no

169
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There's no I'm in a

170
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,240
Room free of mass and space. It's just time and thought in here

171
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,200
I have it. I'm in my mind prison and I'm going to entertain myself now how to become a fool make assumptions

172
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,780
It said that assuming makes an ass out of you and me. Well, nothing has changed it does

173
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:04,740
Can I cool I've I've always wondered about that saying by the way because I get the like I made an assumption and that

174
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,500
Made an ass out of me

175
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,820
But how does you making an assumption make an ass out of me too?

176
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,220
Yeah, like Griffin makes an assumption that makes an ass out of me in

177
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,020
And all that it'd be cool if in Sherlock season 5

178
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,860
Benedict Cumberbunch was like, ah

179
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,460
Your cell phone has a scratch on it, which means what am I doing?

180
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Fuck me, right, you know

181
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,540
But the constable walks with a limp so he couldn't have at what nips. Yeah, I don't know you're sure though

182
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,260
I don't know for you. We know none of us know for sure. So like

183
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,580
You know, you make a deduction you make a dead out of you and sure

184
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,620
I I try to get for a while

185
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,460
I tried to get assuming makes an ass out of you because like assume makes an ass out of you and me

186
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,940
It doesn't make sense, right? It's just like that's the spelling gag, right?

187
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:01,260
But it when you say assuming it means not like assuming there's nothing. Yeah, so I try to get for a while going

188
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:08,620
Assuming makes an ass out of you and being size celebrity chef and restaurant. Oh, yeah. Okay, but no

189
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,880
Really got into it very much, but I did have a good ten years where I tried to get

190
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,460
That's a long time on it doesn't pop up so often and you know what actually I

191
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:27,180
I will say now 12 years because we're here. I'm doing it now. Yeah trying to get it going again

192
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,020
Well, don't read your insurance schedule and policy wording is another good way to be a fool

193
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,220
Huh?

194
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,140
If you had an insurance claim declined by your insurance company

195
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,100
You will know that this is one of the more detrimental acts of foolishness one can commit

196
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Now usually there's some I would say a little better pacing in wiki

197
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,980
How articles of like we're gonna start very broad and raw

198
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,260
general

199
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,100
but to go from

200
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
make assumptions

201
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,780
Don't read your insurance policy. It's like wait, hold on. There's no steps between those two

202
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:07,060
But why I will say I if you don't read your insurance policy you are making the assumption that it's all fine

203
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,220
Yeah, that's true. That's an assumption. That's

204
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,060
People are good. Yeah, I assume that these little words are fine, but that's like also

205
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,060
insurance

206
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
like if I wanted

207
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:28,140
to worry about every little thing and have like my fucking head on a swivel 24-7 despite the

208
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
my own sort of

209
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,780
mental

210
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,100
It's a caduceus that I've got going on my little what's it's that I've got going up up there

211
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,300
I wouldn't have the insurance. I would be always ready for it

212
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,660
I have insurance so I don't have to sweat this small stuff, baby. You know what I mean?

213
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,780
Yes, yeah, I guess that's true

214
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,740
Don't have a legal eye glance over your contracts

215
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,780
Those believing they can do this alone are somewhat foolish. You must have a sound knowledge of law

216
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,940
I can't I'd say those assuming that they don't need that and we're already covered here

217
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,580
Yeah, I was gonna say just this a great point cuz I was gonna say you could just say don't read contracts before you sign them

218
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,740
But that does fall under the bigger umbrella of making assumptions

219
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,060
Don't make assumption and also I will say that assumptions are

220
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,860
Fundamental to our survival as a species. Yeah, right. So what do you want from me?

221
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:27,340
Don't be a fucking dum-dum because here's step four. Go ahead breach a contract now. Oh

222
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,740
Challenge now are you this writer? Okay, the writer this wiki how article has not been paid in three months

223
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,960
I think that's right tell June that maybe sometimes you do think about looking at other people

224
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,420
That's one thing you could do. Hey, here's one thing you could do get a job at wiki

225
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,340
How and then just assume that the insurance they give you is in a cover elective procedures

226
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,780
They don't and you're like, well then I quit and they're like, well you need to give us six weeks notice and I'm like fuck

227
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,780
I didn't read that contract

228
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,180
Shit view this article as a do as I say not as I do and that this person writing this has

229
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,540
had a personal crisis or crises or it's like the joke of like

230
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,020
Opening up a fortune cookie and saying like you found a fortune that says like help

231
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
I'm trapped in a cookie factory, right?

232
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,140
This is someone trapped at wiki how by an ironclad contract with bad insurance trying to call for yes

233
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,100
Okay, so what ever written a memoir called? Here's how I fucked up. I think that

234
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,420
This is a living document. It's a living document that we find ourselves in

235
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,140
Now like it's a

236
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,420
Spotify would pay 20 million. Yeah

237
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
the story of Spotify

238
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,080
Just like follow the story of this sad person. Do we have author info here?

239
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,040
No, literally nothing. Okay, we'll call him jar

240
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,040
Josh

241
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,300
So just to go through it again Josh made an assumption and he didn't read his insurance schedule policy wording

242
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,120
And he didn't have a legal eye glance over his contract and then he did go ahead and breach the contract

243
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:16,000
Do you guys know what an insurance schedule? Yeah, definitely the net the next step in charge is when you do insurance on time

244
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,080
He'll tell me later. I assume if I need to know

245
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,880
In the next step in his journey over extend yourself financially

246
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,220
Governments that have passed national credit acts and have imposed strict law surrounding borrowing and lending of money are to be commended

247
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,360
Governments I know we all we all give you a hard time

248
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,080
We all like to think that you know, Sunday morning quarterback and all that but you know

249
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,960
The ones that have passed national credit acts and imposed strict law surrounding borrowing and lending of money

250
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
They I give them a big round of applause

251
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,640
Does it ever broaden back out to like, you know make promises?

252
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,680
You can't keep or is it continue on this like business strategies only?

253
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,800
Well, let's I mean it starts to unravel here a little bit stands surety for someone else's debt

254
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,060
I don't know what that means. But if that word sounds strange, it's because the next sentence is the Bible teaches us that this is foolishness

255
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,340
Standing surety for someone else's debt. It is often an emotional decision

256
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,240
It's fun when the Bible gets in there and it's like bye. Whoa, bye. Is this it? Has it been Bible stuff the whole time?

257
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,600
I didn't know the Bible had stuff about insurance in it or contracts

258
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,620
Do you think that the the the author like turn it in and wiki house like you can't call it the libertarian agenda

259
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,540
That's not how that's not the structure that we use. Yeah, he's like well

260
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,000
What about this?

261
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,560
Yeah, I would I would also say if you're gonna cite the Bible in an article of like how to be a fool one

262
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,820
there's plenty of stuff in the Bible about fools and stuff and like a fool and like but also

263
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,880
Plenty of people have read the Bible have been a fool my dude. That also doesn't work Travis

264
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
It doesn't say read the Bible

265
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,240
It says don't purchase real estate timeshares or property fractions without physically viewing the property a saying exists in God

266
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,400
We trust everything else. We audit the same should be for property or real estate prior to purchasing it. That's good. I mean

267
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,640
That's good advice. Hey, we can make jokes about it

268
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,080
But like go to the house before you buy it with all the money. Are there people who aren't doing that?

269
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,120
I mean are there people in the world who are like, what's that a timeshare you say sight unseen?

270
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,640
I'll take it. You seem like a trust or the man

271
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,280
I did have to put an offer on the house that we live in now in DC without going to it first

272
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:39,580
But what if you've gone there Griffin and it was 1 8th scale. There was a little baby house guys just for like a

273
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,800
Shits and giggles I did a quick Google search of the Bible. Yeah to see mentions a fool a man

274
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,160
We give the Bible a hard time sometimes

275
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,380
There's a lot of stuff that has been used bad, but man, there's some good stuff

276
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,220
Well, give me some Bible juice. This is Proverbs 18 to okay

277
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,220
Oh

278
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,300
Marker where he should start the no context. Yeah, sure talk here right here

279
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,020
So I just want to take it to the word for a second problems 18 to says a fool takes no pleasure in understanding

280
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,560
But only in expressing his opinion. Oh

281
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Damn Jesus from downtown

282
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,860
Jesus that's a slam-dunk man good a

283
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,080
Fool's lips walk into a fight and his mouth takes a beating walk into a

284
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
Fight in his mouth takes a beating

285
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,380
Well, yeah, okay that one doesn't actually do it for me as good Bible the Bible. Okay, well

286
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,260
In the lips. Yeah never trust in his own mind is a fool

287
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,300
This is how Joe Rogan starts every episode whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool

288
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,640
But he who walks in wisdom will be delivered. That's Proverbs 28 26

289
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,420
That's not a one-to-one though. Is it no trust in his own mind, but he who is wise

290
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,780
Now there's also kind of a comedy rule of threes thing

291
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:10,500
But for the Bible where if you read three Bible verses on your podcast your podcast is a Bible podcast

292
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,460
Yeah

293
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,180
By by bringing in Proverbs 26

294
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:21,860
3 through 12 just listen to this 3 through 12 is a lot juice 3 through 12 is a lot of Bible my

295
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,500
Each one is one word over. We never read the Bible. I know Justin

296
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,780
We never read the law. He saved it up. We got a big load built up

297
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,660
A

298
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,260
Whip for the horse a bridle for the donkey and a rod for the back of fools. Well, hold on

299
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,060
Oh, yeah, it's good. No, that's not correct

300
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,060
That part's not good

301
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:52,140
But listen to the next part answer not a fool according to his folly lest you be like him yourself

302
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:59,980
Answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own eyes whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool

303
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,380
Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. Okay

304
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,660
No, you said you have book ended like in the center there of like hey when someone's being dumb don't answer him dumb

305
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:17,140
Or just makes you seem dumb, too. Great. But in the first part there it was like yeah with that horse bridle that donkey

306
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,620
Beat up that idiot. And then the next part was if I remember correctly

307
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
He who sends a message

308
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,040
By the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks fire. Yeah, I love sometimes when the

309
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:38,120
Yeah, I love sometimes when the Bible is like do not have to borrow from thy neighbor and not if

310
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,160
Repay it thine pride shall

311
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,480
Cast ye off into hellfire and cut off your dick and your balls and feed it to goats and it's like holy shit

312
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,560
I'm like calm dude dust. Thou not readeth thine insurance policy

313
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,880
Then cut off your head. It's pretty modern. Oh, I mean well

314
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,440
Okay. Yeah, I do like that part where it's like it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it

315
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,840
Is for a lame-o to do a sick ollie. Yeah, it's like wait, hold on

316
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,360
Well, it's like oh that's fucking feet and his hands at arms put him in a pot and make his mom eat it

317
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Don't borrow

318
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:24,000
The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh. What that's Ecclesiastes guys

319
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,080
Well, I'm fully out of Proverbs. Yeah, the fool whole folds his hands and eats his own flesh. I've never

320
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,660
That is a good point if I saw somebody just knowing on themselves over bike don't be a fool don't come on

321
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:45,180
Have you uh food heard of it? Hey, what does the Bible say about don't use the internet without the correct security slash antivirus settings?

322
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,980
Want your money stolen out of your bank account your hard drive infected with scary viruses your hard drive crashing on you at that crucial

323
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,880
Moment right when you're about to finish if not, don't do this

324
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Don't try to fix a man slash woman

325
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,100
Huh? I don't know. I don't know if that's a good one wiki how now once again though

326
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
To go from insurance

327
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
read a contract

328
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:20,440
You know don't take on someone else's day. Don't try to fix someone. It's like what hold on big props though wiki how

329
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,080
wiki Bible for this next Bible how for this next one don't engage in an extramarital affair

330
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,960
This one doesn't apply to open marriages if it's within the terms of your mutual understanding

331
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,720
alright, there's a version of this that doesn't include that post script and I I

332
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Appreciate it. Yeah

333
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Probably forced in by the editor

334
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:50,080
Editing pass here or there. I do like the idea of wiki how editors, but they only care about very specific things

335
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,020
It's like you mentioned the Bible in here. That's fine or whatever

336
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
But over here you talk about extramarital affairs

337
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,720
Does that apply to people with open marriages where that is within the bounds of the agreement between them?

338
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,600
Why just include that for safety for safety and also I mean we get into some more virtuous stuff here

339
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,920
Don't slander don't make promises. You can't keep then it gets into

340
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,200
Don't read contra indications on medicines and ingredients on natural health products and foodstuffs

341
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,120
What what is this post Griffin? Well, it's how to not

342
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,440
Spiraling this don't be a fool. This guy's had a hard time of it Justin. He has made assumptions

343
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,640
He has fucked his insurance up. He did a bad contract

344
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Behind his wife's back

345
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,200
She said we did not pills that hate each other

346
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,880
yeah, then he did buy a property that did not have walls or a

347
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,200
Floor in it or roof and then he was got on the internet to find out what legal comp

348
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,000
Like what how paid he could get for that?

349
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,920
but then he got viruses and he tried to fix someone and then he took two pills that made him sick and

350
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,440
Then he believed that STDs only happen to other people is the last step in here

351
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Oh

352
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:16,160
Is it Griffin is there like a secret last line on this wiki how it's like by reading this article

353
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,840
You're already a fool. Like yeah, like or a stonemason

354
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,600
You've made it this far

355
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,480
Step on in to your you haven't clicked away. You have the rigor we're looking for. Yeah

356
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,760
Yeah, this is a there's some stuff in here. I'm worried actually that this

357
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,000
Segment will have a net negative effect

358
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,560
Because there's some stuff in here. That's like you should make sure that your medicines don't counteract each other. That's good stuff

359
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,960
Yeah, you don't want yeah, you don't want to pop some you know

360
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,080
Well reason in the afternoon and then a little bit later taking a you know

361
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,600
cold formula that also has gualphicin in it your shits gonna be

362
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Your shits gonna be whacked out

363
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,400
But in doing that you have assumed that these two pills don't hate each other. Yeah

364
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,520
Yeah, you've assumed that pharmacists and like scientists know what they're talking about. Okay, that's true. That's a good point

365
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,060
Okay, so I guess the whole thing is just don't assume don't assume baby question

366
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,740
Everything what they had in one the truth is out there. The truth is out there question everything

367
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,580
We are taking a beating this segment from

368
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,820
We are eating our own flesh right now. Yeah

369
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,460
We're holding our hands and eating your own flesh to drink violence drinking violence left and right

370
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:45,780
I woke up this morning. I say it's delicious. All right, that's what they don't tell you violence. Mmm. It tastes like butternut squash

371
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:51,220
Um, so I went to Dave Matthews concert last night and I yes

372
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,020
I brought back a very special thing. Can I show you guys? Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Give me a second

373
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
Why is he doing a visual?

374
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,580
It's for kids. This one's for kids kids. Love Dave Matthews band

375
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,220
My kids love Dave Matthews band cuz I told him about we dumped poopy on a bunch of people

376
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Me Dave Matthews

377
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,660
Holy shit, it's

378
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,660
The one and only Dave

379
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:22,100
Ask why you had to stand up from your desk to go get a pair of sunglasses

380
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:30,140
That was that was my good friend Travis and I just why didn't he have the glasses ready to go at the table?

381
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,380
I'm wearing the glass. I had to switch places with Travis Dave

382
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,100
I heard you did a killer show last night in Dayton. I did I barely remember it

383
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Uh, but it was three hours long. I heard with no opener. Oh, yeah, baby. How do you not remember that?

384
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:53,580
Well, all the shows start to run together after a while, especially when you have done so many drugs

385
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
Hey, can you talk normal Dave?

386
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
No, Dave

387
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:07,060
No, what brings us what brings you to our show Dave? Wow, what an honor? Thank you so much for asking

388
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,800
Did you know about the Bible and you were like gotta get all I love it

389
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,700
Your camera is blurring in self-defense. Go ahead. Well, I have that effect on

390
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
audio-visual equipment I

391
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,420
So as you know, I have conquered the musical scene

392
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,300
I've won several Grammys. You sound a lot like a good tone, which I hate

393
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,740
I get that a lot. Can you try to sound less like Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas? I can try

394
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,380
Was that that was more Oogie Boogie, wasn't it? Yeah, it's going deeper down the bowl

395
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,900
I'm looking to expand the Dave Matthews brand and

396
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,420
So I have done a little market research. Sorry the date what the what Dave Matthews brand

397
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,380
So I've done some market research to look up where other musicians have partnered with brands

398
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,260
So that I can see what's out there because I'm looking for something that screams Dave Matthews

399
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,500
You know when I do it and so I'm gonna read you guys

400
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,820
You really don't sound that much like yourself right now David. I sang a lot last night, buddy

401
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Were you listening to me?

402
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:23,820
By having a hoarse throat would cause one to sort of do the sort of affectations that you're putting on for us, David

403
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,900
I'm just trying to put on a good show here man

404
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:33,780
It's the goal to have fun. And if you will allow me we might just make it play your little game, David

405
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,020
Okay, I'm gonna describe it

406
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,540
This guy is a family man now with a wife and two little babies

407
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,860
So this grammy-nominated producer took his perfectionist attitude to a new endeavor

408
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,380
baby strollers

409
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,420
Together with Cybex. He launched a collection of strollers and other parent gear

410
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Featuring his own designs and logo

411
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,900
Throughout the strollers of bold jungle inspired patterns complete with lions and zebras

412
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
and flora

413
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,060
And on the outside of each is the we the best logo now, it's obvious who this

414
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,140
Who this musician slash producer is?

415
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
But you guys tell me

416
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Rick Rubin

417
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Incorrect

418
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,260
We okay. I didn't okay. So just to sort of tell you where I'm at

419
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,780
And I'm trying really hard this episode and for the rest of my life not to make assumptions. I didn't make any assumptions

420
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,020
And I'm trying really hard this episode and for the rest of my life not to make assumptions. I didn't know that

421
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,020
This was going to be a game Dave

422
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
No, this is market research

423
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,740
Yeah, no for sure, but it feels like a game that doesn't it like it feels like I don't play games

424
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,220
That'll be is it DJ Khaled?

425
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,500
It is a Khaled. Is it DJ Khaled? It is DJ Khaled

426
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
Okay, that's correct. I feel nothing

427
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,460
Now I got that I want you to know I got that right and I don't feel anything

428
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,300
There was very little to be fair that there's very little reaction from day there was no reaction

429
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,900
There was also the biggest I react so that was just all middle that bit

430
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,340
No, it's not done yet

431
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:24,340
Okay, cuz now I'm gonna tell you about my own idea and I'm gonna see what you guys think. I'm gonna make a movie

432
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,180
Yeah, I'm gonna write and direct it and produce it who it's about

433
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:36,620
What are you doing, dude? I just told you I'm gonna make a movie. Yeah, but it's but you you're fucking like

434
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,220
Transmogrifying in it's like you're you exist in a quantum state right now and you'll be telling me about DJ Khaled strollers

435
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm gonna be like

436
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,580
I'm a multifaceted human being a little baby

437
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:57,220
It's like the less confident you become in yourself. The more you move away from your I don't know

438
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:03,000
Why be less confident himself his little brother's negative or his friend. I'm not related. Sorry juice

439
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,180
You're now you're the one who's making assumptions. I'm not related to Dave Matthews. Let David do his segment, please

440
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Can I please tell you about my movie?

441
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,700
Yeah, so are you talking about I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry too. I know you were in the first one

442
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,380
So funny, I already had a good message over screen

443
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,680
And now it is it you don't mess with the Zohan to because I know you were in that one

444
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,140
No, okay

445
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
what it is about a voyeur and

446
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
He falls out of a tree gets hit by a car

447
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,620
And he falls in love with the young woman of the father who hit him with a car and I know what you're thinking

448
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,900
That seems pretty straightforward. Well, here's the twist

449
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,900
yeah, their son from the future shows up and

450
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,020
He gets into some vehicle related shenanigans as well. I call the movie crash

451
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,260
Okay

452
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,820
Dave first of all, I want to say first of all, I want to apologize

453
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,980
Okay, I want to apologize because you know what I did I assumed that what you were gonna say wasn't gonna be very funny

454
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,100
And it was very funny Dave. It was very good

455
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,260
It's a drama. I this is a drama movie

456
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,660
Don't listen you already got the point and you barely got through there

457
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,140
You dropped that uh, you got right through that hairpin turn. You should look back just move forward

458
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,980
They have made a couple of films called crash and one won an Oscar

459
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:38,500
What was it one out one of them won a weird David Cronenberg sex Oscar?

460
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,580
Which is a special award that won the Oscar. What was it about?

461
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,940
Who gets hit by a car I get the films confused sometimes because they are both named crash

462
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
But I think the one that won the Oscar

463
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,260
was the one that fixed

464
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,960
Racism and the one that won the David Cronenberg sex Oscar the award that they made to give David Cronenberg for his films

465
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,620
Was that David Cronenberg sex car crash movie called crash?

466
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,320
But that's fine

467
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,000
I think that that proves the point that there can be multiple movies called crash

468
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,280
People like movies called crash people love movies called crash

469
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Yeah, does your movie have James Spader in it?

470
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,760
And he has sex with a car in an accident. It has Crispin Glover in it

471
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
Well now hold on

472
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:33,540
What's wrong now, why did you put Crispin Glover in there Dave well cuz it's I he's gonna play opposite

473
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,160
Leah Thompson and they have great chemistry. Yeah, they were great and back to the future together

474
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,180
What's that movie? I?

475
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,840
Don't worry about it because nowhere in your synopsis. Did you mention time travel?

476
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,540
So I think that your films in your films in the know the Sun comes back from the future

477
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:57,140
You so you heard it just then right? You heard it just fine. No, it's a it's a different you said two and mines from

478
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
Okay. All right

479
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:07,060
Dave gotta go do some rewrites. Yeah, Dave. You should have gotten out of there man. You got greedy, didn't you?

480
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:12,500
You got greedy got stuck with your hand in the comedy tiller, didn't you but you know what? I'm gonna go

481
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Yeah

482
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,020
But I'll be back with more ideas fucking way to who asked Dave Matthews fair guys, but

483
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,560
Gotta go but not because of that cuz I'm

484
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,460
my own

485
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
My choice not yours

486
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,320
Baby that's good. That's funny

487
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,460
It was me the whole time where the fuck have you been?

488
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:52,300
That's sorry, that's how I start every ad now. Yeah. Yeah, it's a very aggressive but it works

489
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,980
Have you been on the internet?

490
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,960
Because if you have been on the internet, you've seen a lot of great websites and you start looking at me think I could never

491
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,380
I never could make a great website like this. Well, I got news for you my friend. You definitely could

492
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,780
Squarespace makes it easy enough for anybody to make a website and update a website traps is used multiple times, correct?

493
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,660
And if we can do it, I did it one friend anybody can I did Griffin did it to get it once

494
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,900
Let me just throw this out there now might be a great time to start working

495
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,100
You know how you had that great idea for a social media website. This might be a great time to start on that

496
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,900
I don't know if Squarespace could build a social media network for you

497
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,820
But they could probably make a blank Google document and that's about that's a social network

498
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:39,540
It would work better at this way than some other things if they would just be chill. They got

499
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,580
Really cool templates. They're kind of like building blocks

500
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,300
You can move around to put the piece exactly where you want it. You don't have to code stuff

501
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,760
You just have to make something that you like and they have these templates that make it easy

502
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,880
To do that have already been created for you by people who really know what they're doing

503
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,280
And I think you could benefit from it. I think it's worth a shot. It's fun to make websites with Squarespace

504
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,040
That's what I'll say. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? You know what? I'll say if you're like, I don't know about bill

505
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,680

511
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Dusting and you know what that means?

512
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,040
It's time to break out those sweaters, but you know what sometimes you don't know what that means

513
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,520
So when it gets cold Justin the earth is not facing the Sun

514
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,760
I don't okay your war is gotten between I didn't sign up for those doors big body got between us in the Sun

515
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,280
Yeah, and cuz take away kitty told him to so

516
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,440
It's getting colder. It's time to break up those sweaters. I just got some brand new sweaters, right because some of my sweaters

517
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,680
They're getting a little thin little moth-eaten gotta keep them away from those moths guys

518
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,880
I don't know why I let those moths in there. They're eating up my sweaters. I got some new sweaters though from stitch fix

519
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,480
They're comfy. They're cozy. One of the sweaters looks like Chris Evans sweater from knives out. What's up?

520
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,120
Yeah, baby

521
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:23,400
So if you're like, I would like to have that is the chunkiest cable knit I have I

522
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,880
Have I don't know how that thing stays together. So chunky cable knit

523
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,160
It's mostly held together by the salt of the ocean spray as you're out catching lobsters on a cold England morning

524
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,880
it's just his body pressing outward against the

525
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,440
The the cable knit fabric that is just like kind of with tension holding the whole thing on him

526
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
He takes it off and unspools

527
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,380
He takes it off when he takes off the sweater just comes completely undone

528
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,960
Well, now you've got people thinking about Chris Evans taking a sweater off girl. We lost them. They're out of here

529
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:00,800

534
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,460
What you like to wear your price range and where you would take Chris Evans on an expensive dinner

Beautiful boy. Look at this beauty. I see some fresh mozzarella

564
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:27,100
Wendy's unveils Italian mozzarella sandwiches and garlic fries, huh? You see it now

565
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:33,140
Yeah, but there's really good you okay you could guess what those ingredients are for a hundred thousand eons

566
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,260
Well, I mean, it looks like chicken and mozzarella and then maybe marinara on top

567
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,220
Okay, and maybe between the mozzarella and the marinara is that onion is that onion ring?

568

Wendy's all-new mozzarella chicken sandwich the Italian mozzarella cheeseburger and garlic fries are bringing bold and savory innovations to menus this winter

Why it's attack it's a match made in Italian heaven

Satisfied I'm yeah max fun stretch goal that I will get this sentence tattooed on my body

582
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
I think it's the best sentence I've ever read

583
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,820
There's eight different things

584
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:18,620
The Italian mozzarella chicken sandwich brings all the familiar flavors of a homemade Italian dinner in one delicious sandwich

585
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:23,900
Do you hear that? Do you hear that Italian culture? We've summed it all up in a

586
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:31,000
Sandwich this juicy lightly breaded crispy chicken breast is topped with ooey gooey fried mozzarella cheese

587
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,740
savory marinara sauce and

588
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,780
naturally aged rich

589
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,780
Asiago cheese. Oh, well hell way. Yeah, so that's one that's a second panic

590
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:49,740
so it's a big loaf of cheese on top of chicken and cheese and mozzarella and then it's all

591
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,900
wrapped up with the

592
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,980
towering toasted golden garlic not bun friends

593
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:01,740
Well, I think I can speak for Italian Jesus when I say a mama mia. Yeah, this is

594
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,580
You're going to Italian hell

595
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,860
Folks at home who can't see won't when Justin says

596
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,860
fried cheese

597
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:18,940
We are not talking about cheese in the traditional dimensions that one is used to seeing cheese. Yeah, this is a

598
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,860
It looks like one inch tall round. Yeah of

599
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,900
Round loaf of cheese that has it if I may a very pale bun

600
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,860
Well, it's a garlic knot

601
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:36,100
Yeah, so it's not it's a bun. It's a garlic knot bun. It's a guy not garlic

602
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:42,580
You can get it as a hamburger instead of a chicken sandwich. And then it says cheesy square goodness for all

603
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:50,260
Does it say that in a in the context of a larger paragraph or is it just sort of

604
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:56,420
Marginalia like it's someone has just written as a note on the press release like cheesy square goodness for all

605
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,740
For the footnote at the bottom

The sandwich is also available as a hamburger instead of a chicken sandwich period cheesy square goodness for all wait

608
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,980

Well, let him finish the thing cheesy square goodness to all and to all a good night

This is good coated in a flavorful garlic herb sauce

611
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:25,860
The garlic fries are made with Wendy's natural cut hot and crispy french fries and make the perfect pairing for those cozy winter vibes

612
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:31,300
Yeah, can you smell the mouth-watering aroma of garlic yet? No

613
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:36,400
No, never this PR has never asked me a question before I didn't know that I was on the clock

614
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,520
Do we have to write it in like to be how do we answer?

Giving fans an adventurous flavor experience

619
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:09,820
With every bite says John Lee, you know when I go to Wendy's what am I going there for nothing?

620
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:15,780
If not adventure, yeah, and also you step up to Italian Hephaestus and say forge me a sandwich

621
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,740
They forged me in your in your your heavens for your Italian heavens forge

622
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:26,300
I do want to say that every time I go to Wendy's in my car and I get the car food to eat it

623
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,500
Well, I'm at the parking lot of like, you know

624
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,820
My my son's Children's Theatre class because I ran out of time to eat a normal meal

625
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,980
I do always think god dang. I wish these fries were wet like really really really

626
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,060
Like so sloppy and wet

627
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:49,100
I would love to have that in my car this wet fry energy and to make the whole car smell like garlic to

628
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:54,620
Wet and stinky too. Please. Give me that now Wendy's for me Dave. Yeah, they want to be the sloppy provider

629
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,580
It's an adventure. Give me sloppy. Give me wet Dave

630
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Dave Thomas, give me sloppy

631
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,140
We're not just about I'm gonna make a max fun drive stretch goal. I might get Dave Thomas

632
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,740
Give me sloppy a tattoo of my body

633
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:17,300
No, wait, is that Dave Thomas saying it? Is it like give me sloppy or is it like a picture of Dave Matthews?

634
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,300
It's a picture of Dave Thomas

635
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,260
Dave Thomas

636
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:27,380
Same with a speech bubble coming out of his head that says that says give me sloppy, but it's the actor Dave Thomas

637
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:34,100
Probably the best thing that I'd like to see is those two trading jobs for a day. That'd be funny

638
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:40,120
Yeah, oh like trading being a comedian and being dead being a long long dead restauranteur

639
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,460
Being an icon not long dead. How was the Dave Matthews concert?

640
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,460
weird quiet

641
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,300
Wait who's switching places Dave Matthews Dave Thomas or Dave Thomas the actor. I'm so confused

642
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:58,700
Are they all three switching? Are they all gonna be in a fountain together? Throw them in the bag and we'll pull out which one

643
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,100
Mix them up. Can't tell the difference

644
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,540
Popeye's got to give them a quick shout out. They got a new sandwich

645
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,900
It's the black and chicken sandwich. They're starting the chicken wars a

646
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,740
new with the black and chicken sandwich, and I just want to give a

647
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,060
Shout out to their Twitter

648
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:26,660
Because their press campaign on this is to the copycats that tried to copy our chicken sandwich back in 2019

649
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,540
Here are the ingredients of our new breading free flavor full

650
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:38,900

the current

655
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,480
State of Twitter is going to have on MunchSquad

656
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:03,040
Because anybody could claim to be a restaurant and just make up some wild shit

657
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,400
And like we could report it and have to walk it back. Can you imagine? Oh my gosh?

658
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,540
It would be such a blow to our integrity as an organization. Yeah

Oh Jack Jack there was a parentheses next to it that I think makes it not appropriate for kids me off

It's the last name so that's it for this show

708
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:06,540
And I think Justin wanted to share a little word of wisdom as we walk away from it walk away from the burning

709
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,860
Yeah, I mean I've always got

Massey 5-4 tells us blessed are those who mourn for they should be comforted

725
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,460

726
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,460
Yeah, it'll be fine. I guess what we're saying is it's totally cool that you're sad. It's awesome

727
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,540
Man, that's awesome. It kicks it kind kicks ass that you're sad actually. Yeah. Yeah, you could be comforting

728
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:20,180
It gives us somebody to comfort so that we can feel superior. Yeah, this is just an opportunity

729
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,380
