1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,280
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,600
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
What's up you cool baby?

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,400
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,360
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,800
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,040
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me 2021.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Oh, I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
I'm your, I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,800
Oh boy.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,720
And I am cyber, and I am Cyberman.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,800
Looks like we made it.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
If you're listening to this, if you're listening to this, it's 2021.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh, it's so rad.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
That's a big if Justin.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Huge, huge if.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,880
But if they're not listening to it, then yeah, while we record this, still 2020, still pretty,

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,240
pretty bleak out there.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,520
Big hopes 2021, big ray of sunshine, song come out tomorrow, and drain the swamp.

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,000
And we're so stoked for that.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I actually feel jealous of the listener.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know what I mean?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,240
Because we're having to do this now on, you know.

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,120
We're still in the stink year.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,280
It's still the stink year here.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,120
Do you think that there was a time during the dark ages where somebody said, I think

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,280
next year is the end of the dark ages, and it sucks that we're still in the, like, do

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,720
you think that they had that kind of awareness then that they were like, I can't believe

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,400
we have to stay in the dark ages for one more year?

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,840
Yeah, they were like, I just heard about this thing called bloodletting, and it's going

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,280
to turn this shit all the way around.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,080
Y'all heard about humors?

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,680
We're not here to complain about the bad state of things, though.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,520
No, that year's done.

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
That year's done.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
That year's done.

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
But now we're on to the new year.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,880
And gosh, gosh, guys.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,400
Oh gosh, upon.

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,660
Here it is.

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,660
This is an episode.

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,920
This is an annual tradition in much the same spirit of Candle Nights, Candle Nights is,

47
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,760
by the way, either over or still going.

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
I don't know.

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Now one knows.

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Yeah.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,720
We may be on the next one already.

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,880
I would like to begin this annual tradition, which is the naming of the year.

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
What is the naming of the year?

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,960
Well, it's a chance for us to sort of pick a theme, a punny theme for the year.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,280
I would take umbrage with that.

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
It's not always.

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,760
Is someone chewing gum?

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Is someone chewing gum?

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Justin?

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
No, I'm not chewing gum.

61
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Okay.

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
I have a very wet mouth today.

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh, it's going to be a wet mouth show.

64
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,840
Okay, cool.

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,680
So in the previous years, we have been doing this since we began the show.

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
I don't know.

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,040
We did name the year, even though we started in 2012.

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
It was Zolo.

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Zolo.

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Okay.

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Is anybody looking?

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm looking.

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
No, I know off the top of my head.

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,920
I want to quiz Travis on him then.

75
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Okay.

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Okay.

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
2011 was Zolo.

78
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
No.

79
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
No.

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,520
It was 20, uh, what was it?

81
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
It was 2000 in heaven.

82
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Get right with Christ.

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Right.

84
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Okay.

85
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Great.

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I know the next one is 20 Does.

87
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
20 Does.

88
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Gettin' it.

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,440
And then it was 20, oh, and I can't remember if 13 is first or 14 is first.

90
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
You don't remember.

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Yes.

92
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
13.

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Yes.

94
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
13 and then 14.

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Sorry.

96
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
14 and 13.

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Dig it up.

98
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Get it out.

99
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
This one was our weakest.

100
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
20 Forward.

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Oh, 20 Forward.

102
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
That's right.

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
I don't love that.

104
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
It's a little obvious.

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,440
And this is where I think they really get good.

106
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
20 Grifteen.

107
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
The con is on.

108
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
20 Grifteen.

109
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
The con is on.

110
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Correct.

111
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,680
The subtitle of the year is so important.

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,240
And then it's 20 Fix-teen.

113
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Building Bridges.

114
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,560
Well, I want to stick a pin in 20 Grifteen, the con is on, because it may be the last

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:18,080
time that these ended up being correct, which is not that we would now encourage everyone

116
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,600
to get on the grift and the con, but that everybody back in 2015 sure as hell did.

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,480
I feel like 20 Serpentine, zag on them, everybody did an okay job of zagging on them.

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,640
I guess so.

119
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,280
Now, I can't remember 2018.

120
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,560
2018 was Collaborate-teen.

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Collaborate-teen, that's right.

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Stronger Together.

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Stronger Together.

124
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,320
And then it was Frankenstein-teen, Become the Monster.

125
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,240
People took the spirit of Collaborate-teen, Stronger Together.

126
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Yeah.

127
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,960
Yeah, yeah, we did our best.

128
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,040
But it still was kind of a dog shit year.

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
But I don't know how, that's not our fault.

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,760
Frankenstein-teen, Become the Monster.

131
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
So good.

132
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,560
Still a very good one.

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,740
There was 20 Funny.

134
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
This one is contentious.

135
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,520
We need to slow down a little bit.

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Travis felt very strongly that the year's theme was 20 Honey, Down to Beesness.

137
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Yeah.

138
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Right.

139
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
And it became that.

140
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,080
Griffin and I felt very strongly that it was 20 Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter and

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Love.

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Yeah.

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Now, history.

144
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,600
I conceded that, I believe, a few months ago that it was 20 Honey, Down to Beesness.

145
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
It did change.

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I allowed it.

147
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
It did change.

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,640
It pupated and it evolved.

149
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,040
I think what we can do is history will remember it as Honey, Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter

150
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
and Bees.

151
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Right.

152
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,780
I think that that is the culmination of the two becoming one, right?

153
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
That is the year.

154
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,120
To sum it up, Honey, Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter and Bees.

155
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,840
I think that covers both.

156
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,600
Just to, do you think that we, as a nation, because the only Americans listening to this

157
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,200
show are the red blood Americans from the real America, and if you do know what I'm

158
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
talking about.

159
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,720
The underground America, yes, the tunnels.

160
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,880
Do you think they got down to Beesness?

161
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,620
Do you think folks got down to Beesness?

162
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,440
Do you think that in any kind of sticky, coordinated way?

163
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,880
I think that there were periods of time where there was some solid civil action that was

164
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
very down to Beesness.

165
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh, fuck, yeah, you're right.

166
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,640
It got wicked down to Beesness this year, I would argue.

167
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Yeah.

168
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
Well put, Travis.

169
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
Now this is going to be a different year.

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
Right now, it's 2021.

171
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,320
This is going to be a tough one because, okay, I'm going to tell you, it's three words.

172
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,880
Is it because there's so many syllables?

173
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Because there's three words.

174
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
All right, thank you.

175
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,600
So, do you want to know something really, this is like the most that this story could

176
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
be true.

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Sure.

178
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,640
It's so spiritually true.

179
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,800
Right before we got on to the call, I had this thought to myself, oh, I fucking got

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
this year.

181
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I got this one.

182
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Yeah.

183
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
No, let me finish.

184
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Let me finish.

185
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Let me finish, please.

186
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay.

187
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Oh, I fucking got this year.

188
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Twenty Bunty.

189
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
And then I was like, what should be the subtitle?

190
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh, I got it.

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
Just get on base.

192
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,520
Twenty Bunty.

193
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
Just get on base.

194
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,720
What two facts did I forget in having that thought?

195
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:28,200
Well, one, it's 2021, and two, I had that exact same title for 2020, subtitle included.

196
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay?

197
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,120
That's the kind of fucking year it's been.

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
Hey, Justin, three, that's also not how bunting works.

199
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,280
It advances the runner, but you're probably going to be out.

200
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,360
Oh, you mean the second proposed subtitle that was proposed by you.

201
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Yeah, correct.

202
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,040
Correcting me, Twenty Bunty, Advance the Runners was the other one.

203
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Oh, my God.

204
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,280
It's a flat circle, folks.

205
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,640
We are just stuck in it.

206
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,840
I do want to give one more shout out to Twenty Palm and Terry, just in the front, party in

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
the back.

208
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Was that last year?

209
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Yeah, that was last year.

210
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
So strong.

211
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
That was last year.

212
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,800
And also, poor one out for Twenty Twice.

213
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,880
Subtitles include One Mo' Gin, Second Chances, Twenty Twice Feels So Nice, Twenty Twice Won't

214
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,400
Roll the Dice, Twenty Twice Sugar and Spice, Twenty Twice Twice Is Nice, Twenty Twice Let's

215
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,280
All Be Nice, Twenty Twice A Second Look, Twenty Twice Two For The Bunny.

216
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
Now, none of those would have been-

217
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
Lost the plot in those last two, it feels like.

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
But 2021.

219
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
Time to look forward.

220
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,120
I have three that I feel very strongly about.

221
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,840
Well, before we get to new ones, can we, in any way, just to start the conversation,

222
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:39,160
because Travis, I feel like spoiled the apple bunch a little bit on the last time we spoke,

223
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,920
you professed that you had it, and you knew it, and you crushed it.

224
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,040
And so, I don't want to start with that, if you are that excited.

225
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
No, I'm saving that one.

226
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
No, no, no.

227
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
That's a third out of three.

228
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,440
Okay, but what I want to get to before we get to any new material is, is there anything

229
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,600
we can salvage from- No!

230
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Okay, go let me finish.

231
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
That is dead.

232
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,200
No, hey, Griffin, if you're trying, can we use anything from last year again?

233
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,280
Last year is dead to me.

234
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,680
I don't want to- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

235
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
no.

236
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
You've gotta let me finish, bud.

237
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Let me finish, bud.

238
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
You gotta let me finish, bud.

239
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Please.

240
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Okay, finish, bud.

241
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Just bud, finish.

242
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Bud, finish it.

243
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,440
We would salvage it, but we would also add a rhyming word of one to it to the end.

244
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,160
Yeah, that's what I'm, I think we, listen, I think, Griffin, we didn't leave a lot of

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,080
meat on the bone and we have a whole decade.

246
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,040
Like this is, this is what I'm running into.

247
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,720
We are going to have to match the sound 2020 for 10 years, God willing, and the creek don't

248
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
rise.

249
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Right.

250
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,300
So yeah, I do think so.

251
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,000
So something like 20 Funny Fun, empty your bucket of laughter and love.

252
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now what I did, Griffin, it's funny you should mention that.

253
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because my first one, what I played with is the syllables, right?

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,480
All three of mine are syllable and rhyme based.

256
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Okay, cool.

257
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,960
So 20 Good Clean Fun was what I went with for the first one.

258
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,760
20 Good Clean Fun is cool, but it's also not-

259
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Even close.

260
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
It's not, but it's not like-

261
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,800
20 Good Clean Fun, 2021, right?

262
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,440
So I'm going with that and then the, and my subtitle, 20 Good Clean Fun, let's get silly.

263
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Are you saying that we should grant ourselves the ability to ignore the second 20, having

264
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,840
already rhymed it in the first part?

265
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Yes.

266
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,120
And not only that, there's a precedent here.

267
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,940
Frankenstein teen, 20 Serpentine, right?

268
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,760
It doesn't have to exactly, sometimes it can just be close enough.

269
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,000
Collaborate teen, we didn't even have a 20 in there.

270
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

271
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,160
There's, what do we want people to do this year?

272
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
That's a tough one.

273
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,240
Do we have so many syllables to play with?

274
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,040
Because if we could narrow that down, because I don't think it can be anything as trite

275
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,320
as like, let's get, let's work, let's work together, be good to each other.

276
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,440
It's gotta be, it's gotta be, I think more concrete, especially we're starting out the

277
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,920
year in isolation still, we've got to, you know, it's not gonna, we're not gonna be able

278
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
to collaborate.

279
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Let me hit you guys with this.

280
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Okay.

281
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,760
Let me think, what do you think about this one?

282
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,600
20 bunny fun, and what this does is, it just says that at some point in the year, you gotta

283
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,840
get 20 bunnies together and have a little fun.

284
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Just have some fun with the bunnies.

285
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
I like that.

286
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,760
And if you do that, the year is, you're good, right?

287
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Just 20 bunny fun.

288
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
I like that.

289
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
It's actionable.

290
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Let me throw this one at you.

291
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,240
It's prescriptive in a way that I could achieve, which I-

292
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,440
Right, you just get 20 bunnies together, and maybe once this is safe, you know, you could

293
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,800
make a day of it with a bunch of friends.

294
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,040
Is live bunnies a necessity here?

295
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Oh, interesting.

296
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Absolutely not.

297
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,240
I don't want images of 20 live bunnies.

298
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
That would give me hives.

299
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,520
I want, you know, I think that that is completely fine, but I would also love to see people surround

300
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,160
themselves with 20 stuffed bunnies, and just having some fun.

301
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
I like that.

302
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Or some porcelain bunnies.

303
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Just 20 bunnies together.

305
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
20 chocolate bunnies, and you're just eating all of them.

306
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Oh, yeah.

307
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Bunny.

308
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,400
What about, Justin, yours is very actionable, and I like it.

309
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,880
I'm gonna throw out one that is completely unactionable, and a more of those.

310
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,360
Is this your second of three?

311
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
This is my second of three.

312
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Okay, this is your-

313
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,640
I think Griffin should get a term before Travis takes another term.

314
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Griffin, if you have one, please.

315
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Yeah, I don't know.

316
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Oh, great.

317
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,800
This is good energy.

318
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,360
I had like, what popped into my head when you were talking about just sort of syllable

319
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,880
synthesis, is 20 woe be gone.

320
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Huh.

321
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
But that's-

322
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Wow.

323
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,800
Woe be gone is a word that you hear it, and you think it means happy, because you're woe

324
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,200
be gone, but it actually means the opposite, and it means that you're very, very, very

325
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
woeful.

326
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,760
It seems like a bad word.

327
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Seems like they did a bad job, though.

328
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
So that's what you're going with, though, is just like 20 sad.

329
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah, or I don't want that, though.

330
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,520
The other one I came up with was 20 marathon, but we're not even in the one.

331
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,120
It's not an un-marathon.

332
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,280
This one goes along a little bit with Frankenstein team become the monster, right?

333
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,960
Where I think this one's up for interpretation, and it is 20 laser gun, pew, pew, motherfucker.

334
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Nope.

335
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,400
Now, the cussing makes it non-toyetic, which I hate.

336
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,080
Well, you put a fun asterisk in there, and then it's like kind of cheesy fun, where it's

337
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,960
just like, oh, I know what it means.

338
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,480
I don't think, because we could also, like, it doesn't take much.

339
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,360
One gentle step to the left, and it could be 20 Tommy gun, brrat, brrat, brrat.

340
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,800
And I don't want to necessarily champion that particular, you know, arms-bearing right.

341
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
I see.

342
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
You know what I mean?

343
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,560
So you don't want to do, I did at one point think, 20 buy a gun.

344
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Let's just do it.

345
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,400
20 buy a gun, let's just do it, is maybe the worst of both worlds, actually.

346
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Okay, yeah, yeah.

347
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
No, I see it.

348
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I see it now.

349
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,080
Because it's like 20 bunny fun in that it is prescriptive, where it's saying, much like

350
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,120
20 bunny fun says, go get 20 stuffed bunnies, and let's have some fun with it.

351
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,840
You say your objective, should you choose to accept it, is to go purchase a firearm.

352
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,920
I don't think that that's on brand.

353
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,160
No, I wasn't going to do that one.

354
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,440
That's not included in my three.

355
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,520
That's just one that kept popping into my head, and I couldn't stop it.

356
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Yeah.

357
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
I would like to just go ahead and lay out my third.

358
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Just do it.

359
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,640
Yeah, just do it.

360
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,920
I thought a lot about this.

361
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,560
I thought in the past we've had, it was too amorphous, it was unachievable, it was ambiguous,

362
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,120
and I thought, here's a straightforward one that everyone can achieve that is universal.

363
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Okay.

364
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,680
20 on a bun, eat a hot dog, parentheses, at some point, in parentheses.

365
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,040
So this is kind of like the thing you put on your to-do list just so you know you'll

366
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,560
be able to check it off to feel good.

367
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,640
Like somebody could do that today and then not need to worry about the motto for the

368
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
year.

369
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
This is what I'm saying.

370
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
And the whole year is achieved at that point.

371
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
20 on a bun.

372
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,920
And at 20 on a bun, eat a hot dog, parentheses, at some point, in parentheses.

373
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,760
And I figure it leaves us opportunities for some fundraisers where it's like, get a hot

374
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,360
dog, give a hot dog, raise some money for food banks.

375
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,440
And let me be clear, it can be like a vegan hot dog, it could be a bratwurst.

376
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Gluten-free bun.

377
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah, it could be a chicken and apple sausage, right?

378
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,440
But it has to be a wiener of some sort and a split-top bun of some sort.

379
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Indeed.

380
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
20 on a bun.

381
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,840
Justin's been alarmingly quiet for a little while and I wonder-

382
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,080
Makes me think he's on Rhyme Zone.

383
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Yeah.

384
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
20 on a bun.

385
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
Okay.

386
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Hey, 20 thanks a ton.

387
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,840
Can I say, Justin, it's a little rude what you just did to Travis's great suggestion,

388
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,720
which I'm starting to think you weren't even sort of tuned in.

389
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
20 thanks a ton.

390
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
20 on a bun.

391
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,000
Well, 20 on a bun, eat a hot dog, Travis, if I could take it and just twist it just

392
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,560
a little bit, eat a hot dog today.

393
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Not anytime you-

394
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Yours is a little too-

395
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,840
Is it like whenever you hear it?

396
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,740
Anytime you think of it, it's like the game.

397
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:03,400
If you think of it, it's like, shit, I don't know what I'm doing today except for one

398
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,280
meal or big beefy snack, I will be consuming a hot dog on a bun today.

399
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:18,200
I don't necessarily, okay, we made a bee-themed year and so much of our branding became about

400
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
bees.

401
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,320
And I'm not sure I want that for hot dogs.

402
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,680
Okay, Justin, you don't want pens designed where it's us as hot dog boys, but it's just

403
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
like right there.

404
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
It's just so-

405
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,120
I know, but you can't tell me that that's not adorable, 20 on a bun.

406
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,880
I like 20 on a bun, actually, but I feel like eat a hot dog today is where it's tripping

407
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
me up.

408
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,140
I would almost refer to 20 on a bun and then the subtitle is something about trying new

409
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,140
things on buns.

410
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
No, no, no.

411
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,140
See, here's the thing, Justin.

412
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,040
In the past, we tried to do these inspirational ones, and then the year has come back to

413
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,400
bite us solidly in the ass.

414
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,760
But people, but like, okay, I don't want to get too modeling or self-important, but that

415
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,160
is life.

416
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,760
You start on January 1 and you're like, this is the year I'm going to take it by storm

417
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,240
and run it in the end zone, then life's like, actually, I'm not so sure about that.

418
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,780
I'm going to do some bad things and some good things I haven't decided yet.

419
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,840
And then when you get to December, you should feel good if you moved it a little bit.

420
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,440
If you ate a hot dog.

421
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,480
If you moved it a little bit, I think it needs to be-

422
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,840
Yeah, like the length of one hot dog, a bun-sized frank length.

423
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,960
It needs to be aspirational and then you fall short of it.

424
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,200
I've never had a hot dog, so I've been hearing a lot about these guys lately, about whether

425
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
or not they're a sandwich.

426
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,240
And it's not good for anybody.

427
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,360
Even if it was about hydration or something, I could get on board with it, but the idea

428
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,160
that if you consider our year, you have to eat a hot dog, that's like some perverse version

429
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,920
of the ring that I cannot get on board with.

430
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,960
This is why I'm saying eat a hot dog at some point.

431
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,080
Right now, everybody walk over to that big white board that you keep on the wall full

432
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,600
of your yearly goals and just write, eat a hot dog, date, question mark.

433
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Yeah.

434
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
TBD.

435
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
TBD.

436
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,160
I had, I was percolated.

437
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,760
Okay, well, now we'll get to Justin's 20 thanks a ton.

438
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,800
Who are we- Gratitude.

439
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,920
Gratitude is something anybody can do, no matter how bad things are.

440
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,920
If you're feeling gratitude for the things in your life, and more importantly, I think

441
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,960
the people in your life, that 20 thanks a ton, that's powerful.

442
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,920
Now make a subtitle, because you didn't.

443
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,280
20 thanks a ton, hey, thanks a ton.

444
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,920
No, no, that's good, I'm going to write that down.

445
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,000
No, 20 thanks a ton, gratitude- Put it on a bun.

446
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,960
20 thanks a ton, gratitude- Gratatouille.

447
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,880
Oh, okay, 20 thanks a ton, gratitude attitude.

448
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,360
Okay, yeah, I mean, you got to rhyme out of it.

449
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,560
Now what if it's just gratitude with attitude?

450
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Gratitude ratatouille.

451
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Oh.

452
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:04,160
I was percolating on 20 on the run, like let's get out of here.

453
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,640
Let's lay low, 20 on the run, like cheese it.

454
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,320
But then I also wanted to explore 20 born to run.

455
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,520
Let's figure out, Bruce has been a big thing for a while now.

456
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Yeah, what's his deal?

457
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,120
And I'll be honest that I have not explored the gentleman's body of music.

458
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Who?

459
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Oh, the boss.

460
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
The boss.

461
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
The big boy.

462
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
The Jersey boy.

463
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
I guess you're talking about Bruce Willis.

464
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,960
No, you know I love Bruno and his great jazz, but I'm speaking now specifically about Bruce

465
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,600
Springsteen because he did the song Born to Run and not Bruce Willis.

466
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,420
Now I did think, because I thought of On the Run too, Griffin, and the subtitle I thought

467
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,920
of for it was 20 on the run and then hasty getaway.

468
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,800
And it's all about like, hey, you know, once we're allowed to travel, let's get out there.

469
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Let's get out there.

470
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Let's explore new places.

471
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Nah, because that's not-

472
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,240
I like 20 on the run, let's lay low.

473
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,520
Because this could be the year that maybe your goal is just like get off the grid a

474
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
little bit.

475
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Not a whole way.

476
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm not going to be able to- like 20 on the run could be in person, right?

477
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,960
Or 20 on the run could be just like, make yourself harder to get at.

478
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,240
Because I feel like that could actually be a very powerful goal for a lot of people is

479
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,440
just like, hey, have you gotten at Mike lately?

480
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I haven't.

481
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,000
Mike's really hard to get at lately.

482
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,880
You can't get to him and get your stinky little fingers all over him.

483
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,760
What's neat about that, really super neat, is that I feel like 2021, our inclination,

484
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,960
everybody's inclination in this plague-swept country of ours is that once it's over, baby,

485
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,060
we're going to fucking rip it.

486
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
We're going to rip it.

487
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
We're going to ruin it.

488
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,640
Like we're going to smash it and ruin it and fuck it and just like blast it and wail on

489
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,360
it for like forever because we earned it.

490
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
We didn't.

491
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
But we earned it.

492
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
And now it's ours.

493
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,920
I feel like maybe a 20 on the run, let's lay low, almost encourages you to like patience.

494
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Like even more patience.

495
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,960
Like even when it's like party time, like maybe don't be the first, like maybe hang

496
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:14,000
back and like let's rebuild a little bit before we get out there and just start smashing it.

497
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,680
Well, I mean, to be fair, people are definitely going to be needing to build up their tolerance,

498
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,520
their social tolerance once more, right?

499
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Sure, sure.

500
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,400
At this point, if I rolled up to a party full of 30 people, it'd be too much, too much too

501
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
soon.

502
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,760
Give me two people max.

503
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,600
What about, oh, what, okay, what about 20 Chase the Sun, living that beach life?

504
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Whoa.

505
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Oh, that's okay.

506
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
I don't.

507
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Okay.

508
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,000
20 Chase the Sun, live that beach life.

509
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay.

510
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Huh.

511
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know what?

512
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,840
Ah, 20 Chase the Sun ain't, ain't bad.

513
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
I don't like live that beach life.

514
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Oh yeah.

515
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I think we can sum it up better.

516
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,920
Struggle for Griffin.

517
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,600
20 Chase the Sun, to me, feels like spiritual.

518
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,640
Yeah, I'm very much picturing Bodie from Point Break, right?

519
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,160
This like eternal summer, you know, I'm just following the waves, living that beach life,

520
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Chase the Sun.

521
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
It's not even that.

522
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,480
It's about the, for me, it's about the day.

523
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,520
And I mean, we would need to be careful if we walk this tightrope because obviously sun

524
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,960
safety is obviously very near and dear to our hearts and it should be an important thing

525
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
for everybody.

526
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,520
But to Chase the Sun, when I, some days when it's nice and sunny outside and I go out and

527
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,680
I do a little bit of yard work and I come back in, revitalized by the day.

528
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,480
It's like something, it's like a thing I don't get from, you know, food or sleep.

529
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,680
It's like a new energy.

530
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
It's solar, solar powered.

531
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Yeah.

532
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Yeah.

533
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
I love it.

534
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,200
20, 20 Chase the Sun, maybe get that orb.

535
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Ooh.

536
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Get the orb.

537
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Get the orb.

538
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Grab the orb.

539
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Catch the orb.

540
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
What about grasp, grasp the orb.

541
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Catch the orb.

542
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,440
What about clutch the orb?

543
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Clutch the orb.

544
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,040
20 Chase the Sun, clutch the orb.

545
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,320
Clutch this orb.

546
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,360
Clutch this orb.

547
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Clutch this orb.

548
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Okay.

549
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
Now here's what's so great about this one.

550
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,440
You are going to fail.

551
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Yeah.

552
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Yeah.

553
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,600
You can chase it all you want.

554
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,240
You're not going to catch the sun.

555
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,480
Well, how about reach for the orb then?

556
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,000
Cause then it's not about the grabbing.

557
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

558
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,680
Failure will not be inbuilt.

559
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,200
It will be taken rightfully as we have every year.

560
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Yes.

561
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160
20 Chase the Sun, clutch this orb.

562
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Clutch this orb.

563
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,660
And that way it leaves it like you're not going to do it, but it'll leave room to do

564
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,820
it again next year.

565
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
You know what I mean?

566
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
Like we can continue.

567
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,320
We must always clutch this orb.

568
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
I like that.

569
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I do like 20 Chase the Sun.

570
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Okay.

571
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Now hold on.

572
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Now hold on.

573
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,240
20 Chase the Sun is great.

574
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,920
Clutch this orb is also good.

575
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,080
If you start seeing clutch this orb, which I feel is very powerful on, on various merchandise

576
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,880
that may go on different body parts, I feel like, imagine it on a shirt.

577
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
It's not great.

578
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Clutch this orb.

579
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Okay.

580
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
You're right.

581
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,200
What about chase the sun, reach for one specific star?

582
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,840
What about just chase 20 Chase the Sun and then like something with solar power.

583
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,600
Solar power, S-O-U-L-A-R power.

584
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Solar power.

585
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,680
What's it mean?

586
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,760
I think you know exactly what it means, Griffin.

587
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
I don't.

588
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
I need you to tell me.

589
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,800
What if someone made their New Year's resolution to start listening to our show?

590
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Okay.

591
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,560
20 Chase the Sun, solar power is great.

592
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
What's next?

593
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,640
Do we want to ask people for their suggestions?

594
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,680
I could just put out a tweet right now.

595
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Yeah.

596
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Okay.

597
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:58,080
Um, while you do that 20 everyone, uh, you're all in, you're all invited 20 come undone.

598
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,440
Let's take apart this cage we made for ourselves now because that sounds like I'm anti-pandemic

599
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,000
or anti-quarantine.

600
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm definitely anti-pandemic.

601
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Hate this thing.

602
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
You've made that clear.

603
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,120
I like to think so.

604
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,800
Ooh.

605
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,840
What about this, 20 one-on-one.

606
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,320
21 on one is good.

607
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,760
Is it inherently sportsy?

608
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,280
No, no, no, no, no.

609
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
I wasn't even thinking about that.

610
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:34,080
I was thinking about like occasionally dip off sushi to talk to, talk to, talk to your,

611
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,860
you know, your people in real life one-on-one.

612
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,800
What about 21 on one disconnect to reconnect?

613
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,620
Disconnect to reconnect?

614
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
That's a little preachy.

615
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
Yeah.

616
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
Okay.

617
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:58,240
21 on one, I do kind of like it as like a get competitive, like don't be afraid to get

618
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
out there.

619
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Choose an enemy.

620
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
You know?

621
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,000
21 on one.

622
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Prove yourself.

623
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Jesus.

624
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,040
That was rough to even say it now.

625
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,800
It's rough even the one time.

626
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,320
Now I do like, I will say.

627
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
21 on one.

628
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,480
Do it you fucking chicken.

629
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Bet you won't.

630
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,480
I do like this, this feeling of going from very aspirational and very motivational to

631
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,880
much more like, listen, we're moving towards apocalypse as far as we know.

632
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
It's time to get tough.

633
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,960
It's time to get tough.

634
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,000
Like we've all been building ourselves up.

635
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
Now it's time to break it down.

636
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,860
And then maybe we can just do 20 chicken run and then we're going to tell people.

637
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,200
I was taking a drink of water.

638
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
You son of a bastard.

639
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,080
I was just saying that it's a great funny flick and that, you know, we could encourage

640
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,000
people and maybe turn back to it.

641
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,880
It didn't get its day in the sun.

642
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,300
It did not get its day in the sun.

643
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,200
It sounds like chicken run needs to chase the sun.

644
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Yeah.

645
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Hmm.

646
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,860
How about, how about 2020 Dune?

647
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,860
Work on rhyming.

648
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,860
Hmm.

649
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Okay.

650
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
Is this from the audience?

651
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
It's to celebrate.

652
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
No, it's to celebrate.

653
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,120
The release of Dune.

654
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,960
The major motion picture.

655
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,160
I have gotten 30, oh my God, I shouldn't have asked for it.

656
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
You really should know.

657
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,280
I told you not to.

658
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,120
Also the bad thing is I, you know, Griffin told me to.

659
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,680
Also I asked for them to be sent to both me and Barack Obama, so it's going to be a complicated

660
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
day for him.

661
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
Oh boy.

662
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,820
I'm just going to read them and if you guys like one enough to consider it, I will tell

663
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
you who said it.

664
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Okay.

665
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,400
Well, no, if you say it on the show, you should say who said it.

666
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,760
But people's usernames are so weird.

667
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,840
I don't even, I can't, okay, this is from blended chicken noodle soup.

668
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Jamie's got a gun.

669
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Hmm.

670
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
No.

671
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
That's a, but we're not even going to get 20 in there.

672
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,480
I feel pretty strongly we should at least have 20.

673
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Yeah.

674
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
All right.

675
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,760
Um, see, I'm saying, okay, Mal said 2021 W-O-N, but I feel like that is just begging

676
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
for it.

677
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
That's right.

678
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Yeah.

679
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Begging.

680
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,880
Some more buns, some, some more buns.

681
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,720
Okay.

682
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,200
Trace mask face mask says 2020 done.

683
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,680
We're not going to take it.

684
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Hmm.

685
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,760
But this is, this is also the type of thing I'm like, it feels so obvious.

686
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,400
Like we should all not, we should also, we should continue to not take it.

687
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,480
Oh, okay.

688
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,200
Mr. Skeleton suggests 2020 shun and it's a year about removing toxic people from their

689
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
life.

690
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,160
I like the, I like the idea, but shun to me has such a powerful negative feeling.

691
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Yeah.

692
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,000
How about, how about 2020 stun?

693
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Looking so good.

694
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,760
Um, that's, that's not it.

695
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Um.

696
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,360
No, I'm just trying to think of rhyming words.

697
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,680
Ah, let's, let's make a deal here.

698
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,680
The second, the second 20 has got to do some lifting.

699
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Yeah.

700
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Right.

701
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,840
I think, I feel like you can't just do 2020 and then rhyme with the last word.

702
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Right.

703
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,680
That's why 20 on a bun is so powerful.

704
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Yeah.

705
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
20 overcome.

706
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
Hmm.

707
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,080
Not close enough for me, but I am a stickler to be fair.

708
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Yeah.

709
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,720
If, if un wasn't such an easily rhymeable syllable, I would give it to you.

710
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Yeah.

711
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Okay.

712
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:27,440
Now here's one from Pete, Pete queer that I want to hit you guys with 27 y'all.

713
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Ooh.

714
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Ooh.

715
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,400
That's pretty good.

716
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,440
How about 27 y'all savor the grape, savor the grape.

717
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
This is like Travis's.

718
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,720
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to save this one 20, 27 y'all savor the grape.

719
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,160
I can't believe I spelled that right.

720
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,280
And then savor the grape.

721
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,960
So that one's kind of like Travis's hot dog one, except for grapes.

722
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Yes.

723
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Okay.

724
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,560
Um, not bad, not bad.

725
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,880
So what have we got so far on the list that we like?

726
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Yeah.

727
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
I mean, honestly, it's 20 chase the sun is tough for me.

728
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,160
20 chase the sun solar, solar power.

729
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
It really gets me going.

730
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,880
And I'll tell you why, because it sounds like, it sounds like something that would be printed

731
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:28,920
quite cheaply on a t-shirt that we would get on a Southern Baptist winter retreat or something

732
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,320
along those lines, chase the sun solar power.

733
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,280
It's a little new age exercise class vibe.

734
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,580
So I don't know about that, but Oh, I'm tempted.

735
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,840
Now to be fair, Griffin, I think it would make it a little bit more a Southern Baptist

736
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:56,680
retreat if it was S-O-N, but wait, hold on, Travis has brought up a good point that there

737
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,560
is a homonym opportunity here that we, a homonym opportunity here that we should dip our snoots

738
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
into.

739
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,960
Justin, I need you to turn off Twitter just for a second so we can take this conversation.

740
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
What about 20 begotten son?

741
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,280
No, 20 chase the son, S-O-N sun.

742
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,920
So S-O-U-L-A-R power.

743
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,920
And then we are, we have made a hard swing.

744
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,360
We have really planted a flag in the ground at that point.

745
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:32,480
Did you hear they're recording a new demographic over at my brother, my brother and me.

746
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,160
I deleted the tweet asking for name suggestions.

747
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,440
Hopefully that will stem the tide.

748
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Okay.

749
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,400
I imagine that you got about 400 in the interim.

750
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,240
350 actually, thank you very much.

751
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,800
So what do you think, Justin, about a hard Christian slogan?

752
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,440
Does that mean it has to be 20 chase the son S-O-N?

753
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
Yes, correct.

754
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
Okay.

755
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:03,280
Ah, man, it's just enough people that have a complicated past with Jesus and all of his

756
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
great friends.

757
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
I wouldn't love that.

758
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Yeah, I see that.

759
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
I see that.

760
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
I see that.

761
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,400
Okay, but now, but now boys, here's the Piccadillo we've gotten ourselves into.

762
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Now I feel like we can't go with 20 chase the S-U-N solar power because people are going

763
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,480
to think that we're trying to backdoor it in now, that there's no way we're trying to

764
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,680
get a little bit of Jesus in there for you.

765
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,800
There's just enough.

766
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,080
It's just like silverback, you know what I mean?

767
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,280
There's like a mild pecan of Jesus.

768
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,680
There's a sliver of Jesus.

769
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Life house.

770
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
There's just a kiss.

771
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Just a kiss of Jesus.

772
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
A life house.

773
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
A kiss of Jesus.

774
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Life house.

775
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Half teaspoon of Jesus.

776
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,520
20, okay, I am on rhyme zone now, 20 megaton.

777
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,400
That feels 20 megaton is like, we don't need it.

778
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,440
We don't need that level of-

779
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,080
But that's a powerful rhyme.

780
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
I will just say it's a good rhyme.

781
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,680
It is powerful.

782
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,560
It's not quite as good as chicken run, which I think we all agree is the way we're leaning

783
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
right now.

784
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm still sticking by 20 on a bone.

785
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
The message that I'm leaning towards is this.

786
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,600
And it's the thing that I think could be the most pragmatic and the kind of thing I would

787
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,760
stand behind is that as the year 2020 has been dog shit, but I feel like the thing that

788
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:33,120
has come out of it is a toughened hide or an adoption of certain skill sets or becoming

789
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,200
an expert in a certain type of thing or doing things that you didn't know you were capable

790
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
of.

791
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
All of that is powerful stuff.

792
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,720
That is the kind of stuff that you do when you're faced with a rough situation.

793
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,280
I want to encourage people not to shed that, not to lose that.

794
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
You know what I mean?

795
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,000
Even when it's all over, there's good stuff that comes with toughening your chitin a little

796
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
bit.

797
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah.

798
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But how do you rhyme that with un?

799
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,960
Oh, but you weren't building to a theme.

800
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,840
No.

801
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,280
What about 20?

802
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
It's begun.

803
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Ooh.

804
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
I like that.

805
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
20 it's begun.

806
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,840
We did forget to do commercials.

807
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm wondering if we should do those and then, uh, get back into, what do you think?

808
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,400
Yeah, that would give me some time.

809
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,140
And the commercials people, listen, I'm not going to be all in the right head space for

810
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
these commercials.

811
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,140
I'm going to be thinking of rhymes with one.

812
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:37,400
Can I just say, Rhyme Zone, got a lot of on, not a lot of un, because mastodon is good,

813
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,680
but that doesn't rhyme with 21.

814
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,880
Maybe we all just start saying it's 20-20 on.

815
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
20-20 on.

816
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,320
And then we can, okay, let's go to the money's on.

817
00:34:48,320 --> 00:35:05,240
20, my grandson.

818
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:16,920
Folks it's me, a paid endorsement guy, and I want to talk to you about, let me see this

819
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,920
here, Squarespace.

820
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,880
Seems like, um, I mean, this isn't my kind of thing, but, uh, it says here you can make

821
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,000
a website and it's really easy.

822
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,600
They got a lot of different kinds of people that are doing it and it sounds like a good

823
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
deal.

824
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:40,160
Uh, they got coaches on here and writers and, and, uh, designers, instructors, record labels

825
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,320
and agencies and art galleries and healthcare and financial services, and they're all, uh,

826
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
making websites.

827
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,520
You, I never knew really how those were getting made, but I guess you can do it yourself.

828
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,960
And take it from me, a paid endorser, this is the number one way I know of to make a

829
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,960
website and, uh, uses Squarespace that the templates on there, you gotta see them.

830
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Oh boy.

831
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,200
They're gonna, they're, it's, they are just top notch, um, uh, analytics.

832
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,840
So you can make sure your dad's visiting as often as he says he is and, um, great hosting,

833
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,400
you know, they'll put a charcuterie out or whatever for your guests.

834
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,480
I don't know all the ins and outs of this kind of techno babble stuff.

835
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,120
Let me see here.

836
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,640
Um, oh, there's a, so we got a deal for our listeners.

837
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,760
Take it from me, a paid endorser.

838
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,500
If you go to squarespace.com slash my brother up, my brother for a free trial.

839
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,700
And when you're ready to launch, you can use the offer code, my brother, my brother, sorry,

840
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:53,040
my brother to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

841
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,480
So you, I guess you have to buy the websites.

842
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,980
I I'm sorry, folks, I can't make heads or tails of it, but Squarespace seems like a

843
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,000
good thing and they're a good friend of the show and good friend of the program.

844
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,640
And I'm just so happy to have him supporting, uh, my brother and, and my brother and me.

845
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,320
And Justin is, Justin's now taking off his headphones and leaving the sound booth.

846
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,800
Oh, he's gotten in his car.

847
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,840
It's driven away.

848
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,280
You know what I miss?

849
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
What do you miss Travis?

850
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,200
I miss licking stamps.

851
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,960
You remember when you used to have to lick stamps?

852
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
You remember this?

853
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Sure.

854
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,840
And you lick the envelopes and you'd send them to people and they know you, your tongue

855
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,720
had touched their envelopes in at least two places.

856
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
You remember this?

857
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Yeah.

858
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
It's like a, yeah, it's like a kiss.

859
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Yeah.

860
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,280
But like the tongue, I French kissed this letter for you.

861
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Yeah.

862
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
You don't do that anymore.

863
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,260
So what's the point of even going to the post office if you can't lick the envelopes?

864
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,460
You might as well just use stamps.com at this point.

865
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,640
It's the closest your tongue's going to get to those envelopes.

866
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,640
That's their slogan, stamps.com, the closest your tongue can get.

867
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,940

869
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,900

870
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,120
You don't have to, it's not part of it, but you can.

871
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,640
And with stamps.com, you get five cents off every first class stamp and up to 40% off

Hey I'm Dan McCoy.

884
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm Stuart Wellington.

885
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,320
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

886
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,240
Together we're The Flophouse.

887
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,280
A podcast where we watch a bad movie and then talk about it.

888
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,000
Movies like Space Hobos, Into the Outer Reaches of the Unknown and the Things That We Don't

889
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,120
Know the Movie, and also Who's That Grandma?

890
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:30,240
Zazzle Zippers, Breakdown 2 and Backhanded Compliment, Elvis is a Policeman, Baby Crocodile

891
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:38,340
and the Happy Twins, Leftover Potatoes, Station Wagon 3, Herbie Goes to Hell, new episodes

892
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:44,160
available every other Saturday, available at MaximumFun.org or wherever you get your

893
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
podcasts.

894
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Bye!

895
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,720
That was certainly enough time for us to come up with some good names for the year.

896
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,400
Because I'm looking at the list.

897
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,240
I was carrying a load on my shoulders of advertising, as was Travis.

898
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,720
Griffin, why don't you just slather them on, baby?

899
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:08,160
Okay, I had 20 Never Done, Keep It Going, Keep the Fire.

900
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,520
20 Never Done.

901
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,160
What about 20 Octagon, Let's All Do MMA?

902
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,840
Again, we're getting back into On territory.

903
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Oh, you're right.

904
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
You're right.

905
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
You're right.

906
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
20 Tons of Fun?

907
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:27,240
20 Tons of Fun, it could be the sequel to 20 Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter and

908
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
Love that everybody's asking for.

909
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,280
It could be the sequel to Operation Dubber Trout.

910
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,240
20 Saskatchewan.

911
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,200
Again, you're back in On Town, Trav.

912
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,040
I need you to get off whatever Rhyme Zone page you're on, because it's not treating

913
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
you well.

914
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
It's just Rhyme Zone.

915
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
It's the page I'm on.

916
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,240
It's not 2020 none, but in you in, and then it's like, cloister up.

917
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Cloister up.

918
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,800
I do like cloister up.

919
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,280
Yeah, that's what we need right now.

920
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
We should be in cloister.

921
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Well, now I feel like we're one year behind at that point, right?

922
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,720
We would have seemed absolutely prophetic if we had been like, it's 20 quarantine.

923
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
What do we know?

924
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,600
Fuck it.

925
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,440
Let's review where we're at right now and see if any of them are strong enough, because

926
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,800
I feel like there's two.

927
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,440
For me, there's two right now.

928
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Okay.

929
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
And it's 20 on a bun.

930
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,360
No, it's 20 on the run, let's lay low, and 20 Chase the Sun solar powers.

931
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,080
Now, you're not willing to give 20 on a bun even the third spot there, just for-

932
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I hate 20 on a bun.

933
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
You do!

934
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Oh, okay.

935
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,640
No, I would take any F of ever 20 on a bun.

936
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,440
Now, 20 on a bun, this is going to be down to business, where people are going to be

937
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
like, I can't believe-

938
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
It's not!

939
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
No, we're never doing that again.

940
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
I can't believe you didn't do 20 on a bun.

941
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,160
I want to walk you through my next pitch, because I am looking at Rhyme Zone, and one

942
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,600
of the rhymes on Rhyme Zone is home run, but how do you make that fit in with the right

943
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,900
number of syllables?

944
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:57,420
And what my mind immediately jumped to was 20 big home run, 20 big home run, knock it

945
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
out the park.

946
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,960
20 big home run.

947
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
This one's for the game.

948
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:09,360
20 big home- Slam it.

949
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Grand salami.

950
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,680
Angels in the outfield.

951
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,340
There's a lot of baseball stuff that's inspiring to the layman, somebody who doesn't really

952
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,880
care about sports or baseball in particular.

953
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,920
There's a lot of stuff that I do know, just through osmosis, about baseball.

954
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,640
We've just messed this up so badly every year, I just want to do it right.

955
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,960
Yeah, like 20 on a bun, where it's really actionable.

956
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,000
How is 20 big home run doing it wrong, Justin?

957
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,840
I'm genuinely asking because I feel like you're poo-pooing what is my current favorite idea.

958
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:47,440
It's not that, it's that like, imagine we get to July, right?

959
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:57,080
And the bug king is like, so you thought this year would be a home run, fascinating.

960
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,560
Tell me more about podcasts.

961
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,840
I mean, but that's hope, isn't it?

962
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,960
There's no such thing as false hope, huh?

963
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,680
I could have a great year and not get a home run, you know?

964
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,820
I just think it would be cool if all of our fans were all of a sudden wearing baseball

965
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,440
merchandise and then people would be like, what the fuck?

966
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,240
We could have some fun with that nasty, scary, ugly baseball man on the big- oh fuck, what

967
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
are those movies?

968
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,800
They made like a million of them, it's like nasty baseball humor.

969
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Major League.

970
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Major League, thank you, Travis.

971
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Yeah.

972
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,960
You know what I'm talking about?

973
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,200
We could have our own little Mr. Baseball guy and that's fun.

974
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,760
Well, over here in Cincinnati, his name is Mr. Redlegs.

975
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,440
Yeah, we don't have a mascot and we could have like a big baseball guy mascot for 20

976
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,800
big home run.

977
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,280
I think, okay, I'm on the hook for big home run, 20 big home run.

978
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,920
Now, Griffin, I need you to reel me in with that just killer tagline.

979
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,440
Subtitle, yeah.

980
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,640
That's where we're struggling, huh?

981
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,160
What about 20 big home run, no, bring them home, has home in it again.

982
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,480
Yeah, you can't have home in it twice, I think.

983
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, 20 big home run, round and third.

984
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Like we're-

985
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,680
We're almost there.

986
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
That feels Christian.

987
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,240
Yeah, that actually feels more Christian than 20 Chase the Sun.

988
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
Okay.

989
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
20 big home run.

990
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Doesn't it feel really Christian?

991
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
A little bit.

992
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,360
20 big home run for all the marbles.

993
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,280
But they don't really do marbles in baseball.

994
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,800
No, they don't, do they?

995
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,200
Is there a way to incorporate angels in the outfield?

996
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:48,560
20 big home run, thanks, angels.

997
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,440
Thank an angel today.

998
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,560
Guys, I don't feel like you're going to shake me off 20 Chase the Sun.

999
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,400
I feel like it's so powerful.

1000
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,800
Can I try this?

1001
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
I'm just going to put this-

1002
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,120
You can try anything, it's a podcast.

1003
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,600
Okay, I'm just going to try this.

1004
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,080
Try everything.

1005
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:15,640
I don't know if we brought up Zozo last year as a thing because of the two and zero, right?

1006
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
Yeah, no, I get it.

1007
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,680
Can we do Zozi?

1008
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Zozi.

1009
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,920
Okay, but what does that mean?

1010
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,080
I don't know, man, but it's a cool little word there, isn't it?

1011
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Zozi is-

1012
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
Zozi.

1013
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,080
Zozi.

1014
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,600
It could be something that you say in the dark a few times, I don't know.

1015
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,120
It's perhaps the least merchable thing you've said so far.

1016
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Are you kidding?

1017
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,240
I mean, Z-O-Z-I, that would be like-

1018
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,240
What is that?

1019
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Who is that?

1020
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,240
I must date them.

1021
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
You see that on my shirt.

1022
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:56,560
Let's do an ARG where we slowly reveal what Zozi is over the course of the year.

1023
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,560
It's 2021.

1024
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,400
Yeah, but I mean, is it a luxury lifestyle brand?

1025
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,240
What are we doing with it?

1026
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,040
Let me see what URLs we could get.

1027
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,880
On 2025, I also went to Sosi, right?

1028
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,880
Because it could kind of be that, and then I thought about how 2024 could just be Sosa,

1029
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:23,440
and then we could do 20 big home run, something something Sammy Sosa.

1030
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,640
So we have 2024, set that one aside.

1031
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,000
Put that one in the time capsule.

1032
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,840
Yeah, Sosa's locked up.

1033
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,720
20 big home run, 7-th inning stretch.

1034
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,880
It doesn't mean anything, it's just very baseball.

1035
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Yeah.

1036
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,200
20 big home run, bases loaded.

1037
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,680
You know what I like about that?

1038
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:53,080
What I like about that is it's saying everything is in position for you to blast off, and maybe

1039
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,200
you won't, maybe you don't.

1040
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,800
It leaves room for failure.

1041
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,800
There's plenty of time.

1042
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Base is loaded, and baseball doesn't always mean a good thing because it's a lot of pressure.

1043
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,440
But you did just say big home run right before it, didn't you?

1044
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
I mean, you did just say it.

1045
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,800
Well, I mean, I think that that implies that the chances of success are high, but the rest

1046
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,080
of that could be, this could be a big home run.

1047
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,840
It's almost backwards, right?

1048
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
It is actually explicitly backwards.

1049
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,360
You would want it to be bases loaded before you start thinking about the big home run

1050
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,400
you're about to score.

1051
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,400
But you're stepping up to the plate here, right?

1052
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,440
And here's the thing, everybody believes in you, right?

1053
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,840
Because they're like, this could be a big home run.

1054
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,720
No one's saying, oh no, I wish it wasn't them at the plate.

1055
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Right.

1056
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,600
What about 20 big home run, we all believe in you.

1057
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,400
We're all behind you.

1058
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,360
We're all behind you.

1059
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:51,600
We, whoa, whoa, whoa, 20 big home run, be your own angel.

1060
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,960
You're at the plate.

1061
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,500
The bases are loaded.

1062
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,920
You look in the set.

1063
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Who's that with the wings?

1064
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,920
It's you.

1065
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
It's you.

1066
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,840
You're looking at you saying you got this.

1067
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,200
You're also Joe Sukhoi and Levitt.

1068
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,880
You're your own angel.

1069
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,520
Be your own angel, 20 big home run.

1070
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,360
If I could just trunk it- 20 big home run.

1071
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,640
We're all angels now.

1072
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,420
No, let's see that's- No, just 20 big home run.

1073
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,880
Be the angel.

1074
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,400
20 big home run, be the angel, because that means that you don't have to get the home

1075
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
run, do you?

1076
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,920
You just have to see a big home run, be able to recognize it, and maybe you're the one

1077
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,920
flapping now.

1078
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,000
You're the one flapping.

1079
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You can flap your- You're flapping a big home run.

1080
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,280
You're flapping now.

1081
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,560
It's almost a weird parallel to 20 Frankenstein team.

1082
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,560
Become the monster.

1083
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,560
Yeah.

1084
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,560
20 big home run.

1085
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,560
Be the angel.

1086
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,560
I like this.

1087
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,220
Because people think maybe you're supporting yourself, maybe you're supporting someone

1088
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,280
else who needs it.

1089
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
It's disarming.

1090
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,840
If somebody sees that on a shirt, they would be like, oh, that's nice.

1091
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,560
But it's like, no, you don't understand.

1092
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,840
I mean an angel in the context of cheating at sports to slam one right out of the fucking

1093
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,840
park.

1094
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,400
This isn't about protecting someone just out on the street or whatever.

1095
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,760
My dad, I'm trying to get my dad's love back.

1096
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,120
That's the only way I could do that.

1097
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,440
Or I'm defending my thesis today, and I'm going to be the angel.

1098
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,680
I'm not going to be the one up there hoping that somebody comes and helps me.

1099
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,800
I'm the angel in this one.

1100
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:24,520
I'm a being of celestial might, and I'm going to get up there, I'm going to win the roller

1101
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,520
derby.

1102
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,160
Now, is it too late to think more about 20 Bunny Fun?

1103
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,360
20 Bunny Fun feels like the one we're going to pivot to in August when we realized that

1104
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,640
no one was their own angel.

1105
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,640
No one's their own angel.

1106
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,700
We didn't chase the sun.

1107
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,700
Nobody ate a hot dog.

1108
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:43,660
Because the thing is that this, the one weakness of 20 Big Home Run, be the angel, is that

1109
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,320
it is contingent on you having seen the film Angels in the Outfield.

1110
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

1111
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,960
It does require homework, doesn't it?

1112
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,720
It does.

1113
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,520
I feel like our listeners are of an age where they've definitely not seen that.

1114
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,280
You started that sentence thinking it was going to go one way, and then it decided to

1115
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,280
go another way.

1116
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,160
Well, we have a wide swath.

1117
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,700
Some people have probably seen and enjoyed Angels in the Outfield.

1118
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,920
Some people have probably not seen it.

1119
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,720
I refuse to believe that some people have seen it and not enjoyed it.

1120
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,720
That group does not exist.

1121
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
No, no, no, no.

1122
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,680
20 Big Home Run.

1123
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:26,760
Just someone say it, and I want to message it to our on-staff artists immediately.

1124
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,760
Okay.

1125
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,480
Well, I need this to be settled.

1126
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,280
It's the tagline that's because-

1127
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Yeah, Big Home Run is really getting me.

1128
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,320
20 Big Home Run is it.

1129
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,640
I think we can agree on that, at least.

1130
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,300
But what's the most powerful thing?

1131
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,380
It could be be the angel, or be your own angel, I think is more explicit, and I like that,

1132
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,380
but it's a little-

1133
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,580
Let's think about Big Home Run terminology.

1134
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,280
It's out of here.

1135
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,260
Big Home Run, flamma jamma, you know?

1136
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,160
Big Home Run- Knock the skin off the dang thing.

1137
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,240
Knock the skin off that greasy cheddar.

1138
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,760
Big Home Run, sliding into fur- No, Big Home Run-

1139
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,760
Eye on the ball.

1140
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,000
Eye on the ball.

1141
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Eye on the ball.

1142
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Shoot the moon.

1143
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,600
No.

1144
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,280
Big Home Run, call your shot.

1145
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,920
Ooh, I like that.

1146
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Call your shot is good.

1147
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,240
It sounds like we are saying, ooh, ooh, Justin.

1148
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,200
I kind of got chills a little bit.

1149
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Did you get chills?

1150
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
A little bit of chills from that.

1151
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,880
20 Big Home Run, call your shot.

1152
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,480
Ooh, I like that.

1153
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,000
There's a level of confidence, a little bit of swagger to that that I love.

1154
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,040
Yes, but also you're the one determining the boundaries of your own success, aren't you?

1155
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,440
Yeah, you could call a very close shot if you wanted to.

1156
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,640
Call whatever shot you want.

1157
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,640
This isn't about Judgement.

1158
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,640
I'm hitting it over there.

1159
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,880
It's like 10 feet.

1160
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,080
I know.

1161
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,240
It's a few inches behind shoot your shot, which is a thing I feel like people said a

1162
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
lot this year.

1163
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,400
Just like, yeah, send a, you're in love with this Instagram model.

1164
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Send them a message.

1165
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
That's how I met my wife.

1166
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
Shoot your shot.

1167
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
But this one's like-

1168
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,400
Works for everybody.

1169
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:13,160
This one's like, if you can think about messaging the Instagram model that you want to marry,

1170
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,000
but you don't actually have to do it, just call it.

1171
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Call your shot.

1172
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Just call the shot.

1173
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I would like to do that.

1174
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You don't even have to do it at that point.

1175
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
See, that's the thing.

1176
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,560
Everybody talks about that one time when Babe Ruth did it and nailed it.

1177
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,160
Nobody talks about the hundreds of thousands of other times that people point at a stand

1178
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,160
and they don't.

1179
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Every time he pointed.

1180
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Like, come on.

1181
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
Sometimes he would start kind of waving generally.

1182
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,160
He would just point, pass himself into the catcher's mitt.

1183
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,160
Yeah.

1184
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,600
That's the gold shot.

1185
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
It's going right there.

1186
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,920
It's going to be a great pitch from my friend Doug, who just because he's on the other team

1187
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
is still my friend.

1188
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,000
I still love him.

1189
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,800
We still hang out.

1190
00:52:52,800 --> 00:53:00,080
There's an intentionality to this that I feel like will be genuinely helpful as we transition

1191
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:06,160
out of quarantine times to just set some goal.

1192
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,900
That's all you got to do.

1193
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:12,680
It's going to be a weird transition no matter what, but if you have, if you call your shot,

1194
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,120
you might just get that big home run.

1195
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:21,060
It does, again, boys, give us access to the powerful iconography of a big, ugly baseball

1196
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,560
head man to use on merchandise.

1197
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,080
I do like that idea.

1198
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,120
We're already human bobble heads.

1199
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
Why not bring it home?

1200
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,120
Yeah, let's have our own.

1201
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,640
I'm talking about partnerships with Big League Chew.

1202
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,640
I'm talking about baseball caps.

1203
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,640
Hello.

1204
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,720
I'm talking about sponsoring little league teams all over the country.

1205
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,440
Man, if we sold out, guys, these slogans used to be about the people.

1206
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
No, no, no.

1207
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,480
I just got excited about actually sponsoring little league teams.

1208
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Or I guess-

1209
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,480
Oh, no.

1210
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,480
That's very good.

1211
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,480
That's really actually super good.

1212
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,480
It's possible to sponsor people's work softball teams.

1213
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,460
Now, I realize they're probably already sponsored by the business that they work for.

1214
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,720
But if I could pay to have my name above that business, Travis's Subway Warriors or something,

1215
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,720
that would be very exciting to me.

1216
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
That's cool.

1217
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,720
Okay.

1218
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,720
Now, in terms of URLs-

1219
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,760
Oh, they would be the Subway Home Run Artists.

1220
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,760
Excuse me.

1221
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,760
I can get bighome.run.

1222
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,760
Ooh.

1223
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,760
You can't get bighomerun.com?

1224
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,760
Of course not.

1225
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,880
I can get bighomerun.art.

1226
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,280
I like that.

1227
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,040
I can get bighomerun.me, bighomerun.click.

1228
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,320
Bighomerun.org is just right there.

1229
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,320
What about bighomerun.gov?

1230
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,320
No.

1231
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,320
Bighomerun.biz.

1232
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Bighomerun.biz is available.

1233
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Okay.

1234
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
What about bighomerun.geocities.com?

1235
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,320
I'm not going to spend $18 on bighomerun.biz.

1236
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,320
I like bighomerun.run.

1237
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:47,120
Bighomerun.run, but that's what breaks the flow.

1238
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
That feels good to say.

1239
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,120
Bighomerun.

1240
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,000
It feels like it changes it a little bit.

1241
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,340
Oh, this bighomerun.run.

1242
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,340
It almost sounds like that.

1243
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,340
Yeah.

1244
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,340
All right.

1245
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,340
I'll get bighomerun.run.

1246
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,340
All right.

1247
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,640
Is it too late to change it to bigdogrun?

1248
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,640
Bigdogrun.

1249
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,640
Run, dog, run.

1250
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,640
20 rundogrun.

1251
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,640
20 rundogrun.

1252
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,640
20 bighomerun.

1253
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,640
Be the big dog.

1254
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
Bigdogrun.

1255
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
20 bigdogrun.

1256
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,640
No bones about it.

1257
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,640
We've lost the plot in a pretty major way.

1258
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,640
I think...

1259
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,640
Oh, man.

1260
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,640
Bigdogrun.

1261
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,640
No bones about it, though.

1262
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,640
It's very good.

1263
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,640
We always do this to ourselves.

1264
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,640
We can't do...

1265
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:35,640
20 bigdogrun.

1266
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,640
It's meaningless.

1267
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,640
20 bigdogrun.

1268
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,640
No bones about it.

1269
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,640
It's right there.

1270
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,640
That's what I don't understand.

1271
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:47,640
Have you guys ever seen the movie Sliding Doors?

1272
00:55:47,640 --> 00:56:00,640
It's the two paths have diverged through the once-in-a-lifetime.

1273
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:11,640
You cannot, we cannot go wrong with a year called 20 bigdog.

1274
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:18,640
Because it is strictly defies reason.

1275
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,640
20 bigdogrun will definitely achieve this year.

1276
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,640
No bones about it.

1277
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,640
No bones about it.

1278
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:38,640
20 bigdogrun.

1279
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,640
What's great is we can save 20 big homerun for 2031 if we need to.

1280
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,640
That's right.

1281
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,640
Yeah.

1282
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,640
That's true.

1283
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,640
That's true.

1284
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,640
What does bigdogrun mean?

1285
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,640
Does it...

1286
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,640
Bigdogrun, it sounds fucking great to say it.

1287
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,640
Yeah.

1288
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,640
I already paid for big homerun.

1289
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,640
Well, cool.

1290
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,640
Redirect that to bigdog.run.

1291
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,640
Bigdogrun.

1292
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:12,640
It's like saying, yeah, I was a little nervous about asking for a raise at work, but bigdog's

1293
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,640
got to run.

1294
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,640
But bigdogrun.

1295
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,640
No bones about it.

1296
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,640
Yeah.

1297
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
Bigdogrun.

1298
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,640
Okay, so I could get bigdog.run.

1299
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,640
Yeah.

1300
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,640
Now, are we going to get in trouble?

1301
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,640
Is the big dogs brand active?

1302
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,640
I can get bigdogrun.com.

1303
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,640
Yes.

1304
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,640
I think bigdog is DAWG.

1305
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
No.

1306
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
I don't think so.

1307
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,640
No.

1308
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
No.

1309
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,640
If you can get big DOG, bigdogrun.

1310
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,640
Bigdogrun.com?

1311
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,640
Yeah, bigdogrun.com.

1312
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,640
Or bigdog.run.

1313
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,640
Can we get both and redirect to each other?

1314
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Yeah, I'll get both.

1315
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,640
Just an infinite sort of loop.

1316
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
Yeah.

1317
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,640
20 bigdogrun.

1318
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,640
No bones about it.

1319
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,640
I mean, I think that that's-

1320
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,640
That's it.

1321
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,640
I'll tell you, you can't mess it up.

1322
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,640
You can't mess that year up.

1323
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:12,640
If we can generate at least one prescriptive, okay, if this is a mantra, which is, I think,

1324
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,640
ultimately what these year names are, when would one deploy it?

1325
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,640
I think you nailed it, right?

1326
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,640
You know, I wasn't going to do it, but then I remember, bigdogrun, right?

1327
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,640
If you're going to run, you're a big dog.

1328
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,640
And if you get nervous about actually running, then you have the subtitle there that swings

1329
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,640
in to tell you, no bones about it.

1330
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,640
Yeah, bigdogrun.

1331
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,640
But again, I do have to, very important, ask if the big dog brand is going to be upset

1332
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,640
with us.

1333
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,640
I don't think that they can claim the idea of large canines is all theirs.

1334
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,640
Listen, okay.

1335
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,640
I'm going to head out.

1336
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,640
Let me head over to the trademark office.

1337
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,640
Okay.

1338
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,640
We've never done this on our website, on our podcast before, so let me just check.

1339
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,640
It would be, it would, we would-

1340
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,640
Just let me look at the trademark database.

1341
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,640
Big dog holdings, big dog cat.

1342
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,640
I mean, like, there's so many big dog things.

1343
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,640
I don't know that they can really get it.

1344
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,640
Yeah, I think we stand by it.

1345
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,640
And you know what, Griffin?

1346
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,640
Maybe this is the year we get sued by big dog.

1347
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,640
I feel like this is the year where we maybe tempt fate with big dog a little bit.

1348
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,640
What if we did get big dog to sue?

1349
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,640
I mean, if we could get sued by big dog, that would be like-

1350
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,640
Would there be a better ending of this podcast than us being sued out of business by big dog?

1351
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,640
What it will be is we'll have to become like indentured advertisers for them where it's

1352
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,640
just like every episode brought to you by big dog.

1353
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,640
That is the best case scenario, Travis.

1354
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,640
That is the best, that would be a great max fund drive push for us.

1355
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,640
We no longer make ad revenue.

1356
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,640
We work for big dog, unpaid.

1357
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,640
We are still digging out of that big dog hole, and there's no bones about that.

1358
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,640
No bones about it.

1359
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,640
This is it.

1360
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,640
Okay, this is it, folks.

1361
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,640
This is the year-

1362
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,640
We got to make sure we say 20 in there.

1363
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,640
20 big dog run.

1364
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,640
I almost feel like 20 is unnecessary at this point.

1365
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,640
20 big dog run.

1366
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,640
No bones about it.

1367
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,640
No bones about it.

1368
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,640
It's so bad.

1369
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,640
Okay, I'm looking at our trademark search.

1370
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,640
I think we're good.

1371
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,640
There is one here for big dog.

1372
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,640
There's a company called Big Dog Licensing that has the trademark on big dog as it refers

1373
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,640
to hot dog sandwiches.

1374
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,640
Oh, we're fine.

1375
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,640
We're fine.

1376
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,640
We're fine.

1377
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,640
Thank you, folks, for listening to our program.

1378
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,640
We hope you're satisfied with the theme of this year.

1379
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:43,640
I hope you can bring the spirit and energy of 20 big dog run, no bones about it, into your life.

1380
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,640
I'm sure we'll have merchandise available soon, which is secondary to the thematic statement of-

1381
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,640
Can we still at least have one piece of merchandise?

1382
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,640
And it will say 20 big dog run, but it will have the ugly, nasty baseball head man in it.

1383
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,640
Yeah.

1384
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,640
Okay, cool.

1385
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,640
Yeah.

1386
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
Yeah, we can do that for you.

1387
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,640
It's no problem.

1388
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,640
You're our brother, for crying out loud, you know?

1389
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,640
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1390
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,640
Trav, do you have anything that you would like to mention?

1391
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,640
I sure do.

1392
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,640
If you would like to learn how to make your own podcast, which will determine the fate of the year,

1393
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,640
well then, my friends, have we got a book for you and a free book event.

1394
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,640
Our how-to podcast book called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You,

1395
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,640
we're doing that live book event January 26th at 9pm Eastern Time.

1396
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
We partner with six independent bookstores.

1397
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,640
If you pre-order from them, you'll get an exclusively designed book plate signed by one of us with your copy.

1398
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,640
While supplies last, just go to bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book event for bookstore links and more event info.

1399
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:52,640
And in perhaps the most serendipitous occurrence, the January pin of the month is a Cerebus pin with the three of our faces on it.

1400
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,640
It is literally a big dog.

1401
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,640
Which is a big dog.

1402
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,640
It is a big dog, my friends.

1403
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:06,640
And that's going to be benefiting the NARAL, which fights for access to abortion care, birth control, paid parental leave, and protections from pregnancy discrimination.

1404
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,640
So get that pin of the month, show your big dog lifestyle, and support the NARAL.

1405
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,640
Travis, we have to say big dog run lifestyle every time.

1406
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,640
Big dog run lifestyle.

1407
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,640
We can't give them ammunition to use against us.

1408
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,640
You're right.

1409
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:25,640
We've also got a Knights Templar II Wacky Wizards sticker to show that you belong to a secret society.

1410
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:32,640
And that Candlelight's merch, if you're listening to this on the 4th, Candlelight's merch posters and stuff still available with proceeds going to Harmony House.

1411
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,640
So go get those.

1412
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,640
McElroymerch.com.

1413
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,640
The Sawbones book is out in paperback now.

1414
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,640
It's newly revised and updated for 2020.

1415
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

1416
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,640
Get that book.

1417
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:53,640
They got, Justin and Sydney got totally boned and hosed and screwed when the book first came out with a series of uh-ohs and whoopsies that were heartbreaking.

1418
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,640
But now you can fix it by getting this new, better version of the Sawbones book.

1419
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,640
Yeah, please do that.

1420
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,640
Thank you.

1421
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,640
I really appreciate it.

1422
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
Bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

1423
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,640
And then, you know, you can go to bookshop.org or wherever you get books.

1424
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,640
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1425
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:14,640
You want to talk about some big dogs run and that's that network, the Maximum Fun network that we've been in.

1426
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,640
That's where the big dogs really run.

1427
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,640
I don't have any yahoos.

1428
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,640
I haven't even found any yahoos.

1429
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,640
I could just like make up a yahoo.

1430
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:30,640
No, no, no, let me, I'm going to go to the absolute first thing on yahoo dancers and we'll just cackle at it like buffoons.

1431
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,640
Oh, Justin, do you want to hit us with the final yahoo?

1432
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,640
This one is from anonymous.

1433
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:44,640
Does Fireball's brain shake around in her skull like a shell?

1434
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,640
Wait, wait, there's another one here.

1435
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:53,640
Atheists, what do you think about the discovery of a fossilized cage around a group of velociraptor bones?

1436
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,640
My name is Justin McElroy.

1437
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,640
I'm Travis McElroy.

1438
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1439
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,640
The evidence is piling up on the atheists.

1440
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,640
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1441
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,640
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1442
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,640
Okay, that was the show.

1443
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,640
Hope you had some fun.

1444
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,640
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1445
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,640
Go back into the world.

1446
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,640
Face the day ahead.

1447
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:45,640
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.
