1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,600
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I, let me check my notes, I'm your middle

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
brother Travis McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby Griffin.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,520
Okay. Dang.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,760
Sorry guys, there seems to be some sort of lag on the Skype, and I stepped all over Travis's

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,240
dick on that one, and I'll own it. Is there lag on the Skype,

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
or are you just going, man? There's lag on the Skype, man.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,160
There's, okay, Griffin, lag on the Skype doesn't- Yeah, it's wild, man, because I'm

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,240
talking and I hear nothing. Okay, but the lag would make you talk sooner.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,120
When I hear the words, they're after, when I, they get finished by the time I speak.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,200
It can't, lag doesn't work. No, that would mean, like it's time traveling

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
lag that makes it sooner for you. Guys, I was playing Quake when you were

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
still Quaking in your fucking diapers, okay? I know all about lag, so don't come to me

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
and tell me about lag. Check your ping.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Check your ping, you freaking nerds. This is going to be a tough record if I'm

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
hearing everything you say before you finish saying it.

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,600
And this is your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,560
And welcome to Sawbones. And this is Griffin McElroy,

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,080
30 under 30, see that time it was fucking perfect for me.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,040
That one was okay, huh? It's possible I've become unstuck in time.

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,280
Okay, not again. Good one, Juice.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,520
Oh God, I didn't do any jokes yet on this one. Maybe just hit shuffle play on this episode

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,480
and see how that works. Yeah, you know how that's a feature that's

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,400
on most podcast apps? Well, they'll just play 10 seconds at a time,

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,200
just a random little sliver, random little cross section.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
So I guess it seems like we all had individual bits we were going to do for the opening.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,240
I was going to make a joke about Wick watchers, just people who watch John Wick.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
And I was going to talk about like, what do you guys think is in the new John Wick movie?

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
Because I haven't seen it. And what kind of fun stuff do you think he does?

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,840
I think he goes to an arcade where he uses the special coins to play Giant Claw Machine.

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,160
Travis, you should see the new John Wick film is one thing I would tell you.

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
Oh, okay. Well, I do plan, I have joined Wick watchers.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
So my plan is to watch the new John Wick film, Justin.

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,680
So in your canon, is Wick watchers people who have seen it or people who are planning to seeing it?

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
I think it's people who have to sort of ration how much they can see it.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,800
I just watched John Wick 2, that's four points. And I have a budget of six points today.

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
So I can watch half of one if I want.

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,520
And I think it, because we only get like one John Wick a year now.

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,000
And you don't want to burn out on it too much. So you get six points a day.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,320
If you watch John Wick 1, that's five points.

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah. And then if you watch the new John Wick, that's all your sex.

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,440
John Wick 2, you can watch that one. That's four points.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,520
I mean, the fucking train knife fight with common alone is three points.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,920
Yeah, that's three of the four points. There's a lot.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
What was your bit, Justin?

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Me? I didn't have one. My bit comes later.

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,280
Oh, okay.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,520
I got a new bit. It's a new segment that I'm really excited about.

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,720
Well, why not just do it now?

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,920
Do you think?

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,240
Do you think? I think the time is right.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,040
And I think that it's been a while since we've done any funny stuff.

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,360
All right.

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
Excuse me, everybody. This is Justin McElroy.

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,520
Just wanted to come in over the radio here to inform you that it is pilot season.

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,360
That's really good.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
Hey, everybody. Welcome to our new bit.

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,960
My new bit.

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,600
My new personal bit that we can do once a year.

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
And it's called pilot season.

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh, good.

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,880
And what it is is, this is an advice show for them.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,680
Did we say that?

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,920
No, no, no. We just jumped right into the time traveling.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,560
This is my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
Justin is me. Travis is the middle one.

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
The little squeaky fellas, Griffin.

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,840
And we do advice.

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
But right now it's pilot season.

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
And we're going to walk you through some of the shows that are coming your way.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,760
Did you just eat some saltwater trape?

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
No, that's the pilot voice, Travis.

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,720
Sorry, sorry.

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,880
Today, we're going to be going into some network dramas.

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
And this is an interactive segment.

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm going to tell you the name of the series and sort of the log line.

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Maybe even some of the stars of the film and the TV series.

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,360
Not a film.

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
It's like a film, like short film, like several short films.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,560
Well, it's like one big fucking long film that they cut up into a bunch of little parts.

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
It's up to you to decide.

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Anyway, so I'm going to give you the name of it, the characters, whatever.

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
And I want you guys to tell me if one of three things are happening.

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,520
One, it was ordered a series.

89
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,280
Two, passed over.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Three, some form of sent back to the woodshed for the workshop,

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,720
the proverbial workshop for a little bit of retooling.

92
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,280
Okay.

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,780
Okay.

94
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,560
First up is the ABC dramas.

95
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,760
Now, this is not all the ABC dramas that are coming.

96
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,840
But it is some of the ABC dramas that were put up for pilot season.

97
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
First is called Heart of Life.

98
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,880
Logline.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
Logline.

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:06:00,720
Inspired by John Mayer's song, this drama follows two sets of adult siblings from wildly

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,320
different worlds who discovered they are related and must reassess everything they thought

102
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
they knew about their shared father.

103
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
As they explore the mystery of their separate childhoods, they'll experience the difficulty

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,520
in overcoming the sins of the past and learn the joys of reuniting with lost family.

105
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Yeah.

106
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
I think that one's a skip-a-rooney.

107
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
I think that one did not make it.

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,480
That's inspired by John Mayer's song.

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,960
Yeah.

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm going to also guess a big old skip though on that one.

111
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,040
That's being redeveloped.

112
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,400
They like some of it.

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,120
Yeah.

114
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,400
Some of that's pretty good.

115
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
We like the John Mayer stuff.

116
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,760
Yeah.

117
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,720
I should have followed my gut there because I liked some of that.

118
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
Some of that is good.

119
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
Some of that was real nice for me.

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,520
It hit the ears in a real pleasing way.

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,840
So this next one from ABC drama, the ABC drama stable, is called A Hypnotist's Love Story.

122
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,400
The Hypnotist's Love Story.

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
The titles need some help.

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Maybe that's what needs reworking because Heart of Life, is that what it was?

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,960
Heart of Love?

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:01,920
It's not.

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,560
Heart of Life.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Okay.

129
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,920
Heart of Life.

130
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Hard to remember.

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
The Hypnotist's Love Story.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,480
Logline.

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,000
After a string of failed romances, successful hypnotherapist Ellen is optimistic about her

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,520
current boyfriend, but then he reveals a disturbing truth.

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,280
A stalker ex-girlfriend, played by Heather Graham, has been following him for years.

136
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,680
Ellen finds herself intrigued and oddly thrilled by the stalker,

137
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
entirely unaware that they've already met.

138
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
So this is a drama?

139
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,000
It's a drama about a super good hypnotist that dates a guy who's got a stalker,

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,040
but the hypnotist loves it until she doesn't.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm confused as to how that's a series.

142
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,840
It's based on a novel, I think.

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,920
But that seems like less than one episode.

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,760
How's that gonna get six seasons in a movie?

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,400
You tell me.

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,800
I don't know.

147
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,360
I mean, okay, we got Heather Graham attached, so that's a pickup.

148
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
That's a pickup day one.

149
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,320
Scrappy-doo.

150
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm gonna say it's a pass.

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,520
That's a pass.

152
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,320
Correct, Travis.

153
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,840
That's a hard pass.

154
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,640
Next, series in the ABC drama stable is NYPD Blue.

155
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,680
I shit you not.

156
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,180
Wait.

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,040
It follows Andy Sipowicz's son Theo as he tries to earn his detective shield and work

158
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,560
in the 15th squad while investigating his father's murder, and that's NYPD Blue.

159
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,200
Now, should they have called it NYPD 2?

160
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,440
Yes.

161
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,480
Of course they should have.

162
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Yes.

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,280
That's obvious.

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,360
Obvious to anybody.

165
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
What's happening with this show?

166
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
Pick it up, baby.

167
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
It's NYPD Blue.

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Yeah, I'm gonna say that's an obvious pickup.

169
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,680
Obvious pickup.

170
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,440
Being redeveloped.

171
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,480
It's NYPD Blue.

172
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
It's NYPD Blue 2.

173
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,760
They're gonna do it again.

174
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
Triangle.

175
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Guys, what if the Bermuda Triangle was not a watery grave in the middle of the ocean,

176
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,800
but a land lost in time that has trapped travelers over the course of human history?

177
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,640
When a family is shipwrecked in this strange land, they must band together with a group

178
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,080
of like-minded inhabitants from throughout history to survive and somehow find a way home.

179
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
It's a series called Triangle.

180
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
Now, everyone knows that the Bermuda Triangle is in the middle of the ocean, but what my

181
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
book presupposes is maybe it isn't.

182
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,840
I'm gonna say that's a go into series because I would like to watch it.

183
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,680
I would watch that very bad.

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
I know you nasty boys would watch it.

185
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,600
It is in contention for mid-season consideration.

186
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,880
Haven't made a decision on this one yet, but ABC, you pounce or I'm gonna kickstart it

187
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,600
for myself.

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Hey, big news.

189
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,760
The McElroy brothers have started their own major television network so that we can pick

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
up Triangle.

191
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,400
It's called Bebo and it's got all the alt-comedy you crave and Triangle, poached from ABC this

192
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,880
fall.

193
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,360
Fuck them.

194
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,600
We're gonna go over to CBS and CBS is where the old people play and that's where they

195
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,440
like to get nasty and do their old stuff with none of the young people watching.

196
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
No cell phones allowed over at CBS.

197
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
That's what it's called.

198
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
No cell phones allowed.

199
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
So we're gonna get nasty over there to find the most boring series available.

200
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
Tommy is the first one.

201
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,480
When a former high-ranking NYPD officer played by Edie Falco becomes the first female chief

202
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,960
of police for Los Angeles, she uses her unflinching honesty and hardball tactics to navigate the

203
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,120
social, political, and national security issues that converge with enforcing the law.

204
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,280
Yeah, that's a cop show.

205
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,240
I've heard of that.

206
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,840
A cop show with Edie Falco.

207
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,360
It's called Tommy, but it was formerly known as Nancy.

208
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,600
So I guess they just decided to call her something different on this one.

209
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,080
Then I don't think they're done fixing this one up.

210
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,640
I think it's back in the woodshed.

211
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,840
I'm gonna say a pickup.

212
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
It's absolutely a pickup, Travis.

213
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
God, your instincts are so good.

214
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
Of course, Edie Falco.

215
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,160
As a hard-nosed cop?

216
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,720
Yeah.

217
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
Hard-nosed cop turned judge for the old to love it.

218
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,160
All Rise.

219
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,000
Formerly courthouse.

220
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
Follows the dedicated chaotic-

221
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,520
Formerly what?

222
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
Former- All Rise is the name of it now.

223
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
Not Paul Reiser.

224
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
That's a different series.

225
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
All Rise.

226
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,720
Okay.

227
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Formerly courthouse.

228
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
Are we still talking about the same show?

229
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Is that the name of the, stop.

230
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,480
Nah.

231
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
Is it colon formerly courthouse?

232
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,760
No.

233
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,480
Oh, the name of the thing used to be courthouse, now it's-

234
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
Courthouse, right, okay.

235
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,960
It follows the dedicated, chaotic, hopeful,

236
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,920
and sometimes absurd lives of the judges,

237
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
assistant district attorneys, and public defenders

238
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
as they work with bailiffs, clerks, cops, and jurors

239
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,920
to bring justice to the people of Los Angeles.

240
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,320
Sexy.

241
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I started playing Pokemon Go in the middle of that description.

242
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,600
It was so fucking boring.

243
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Well, no, that's why they changed it to All Right,

244
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
because courthouse, ooh,

245
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,920
but All Rise makes it sound like boner.

246
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,840
It used to be called courthouse.

247
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,720
Courthouse, I guess.

248
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,280
Oh, that's great.

249
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,760
Oh man, we need more shows named after the buildings

250
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
that they're in.

251
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
About all these young, sexy judges,

252
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
and district attorneys, and court stenographers.

253
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,400
What's happening with this show?

254
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,320
What's happening with this show on CBS drama?

255
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
I'm gonna say that's a pickup, Justin.

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Yeah, now I don't think CBS gives a shit.

257
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,360
That's a pickup.

258
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
That is a pickup.

259
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:19,840
Yeah.

260
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,760
You'll be able to watch that on TV, damn.

261
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Do you understand, though, that Tommy is about

262
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
the first female chief of police for Los Angeles,

263
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,960
and All Rise is about the district attorneys,

264
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,720
and judges, and public defenders,

265
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
and clerks, and cops in Los Angeles?

266
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,120
It's like they literally are starting two simultaneous

267
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,840
the sprint takes on the legal system and law schedule.

268
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,960
This is our LAPDCU.

269
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
Yeah, but the McElroy brothers get six episodes.

270
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,320
That's what they get.

271
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,520
They get six episodes.

272
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm not bitter.

273
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,640
I'm just saying there's a lot of TV money flowing

274
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,400
around here, and then you maybe could kick us some.

275
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay, so this is CBS shows.

276
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
I just wrote you two of the most boring things

277
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
I've ever had to read on this podcast.

278
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,280
Both ordered a series.

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,840
The Republic of Sarah, a small New Hampshire town,

280
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,240
is thrust onto the world stage with the discovery

281
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,400
of a valuable resource within its borders,

282
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,320
compels the residents to declare themselves

283
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,680
an independent nation, setting the unlikely young mayor

284
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,280
and her cabinet of inexperienced locals

285
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,600
on the path to running a brand new country,

286
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
the Republic of Sarah.

287
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,240
What the fuck?

288
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,520
Holy shit.

289
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Seditious, but it's fun.

290
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,560
Is it a drama?

291
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,680
Is this still a drama, or is this a comedy?

292
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
Still the drama section in this one.

293
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
Maybe more of a dramedy, but this is a drama.

294
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
I mean, it's a short show.

295
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,080
The fucking full force of the military rolls over them.

296
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,360
Sprout down on them.

297
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,080
Yeah, it's like they've got unobtainium there.

298
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,840
And keep this for ourselves.

299
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
Uh, no, you didn't.

300
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,160
Oh, okay.

301
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
It's like under the dome, but without the dome.

302
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,080
So the military's just like,

303
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,840
I guess we'll kill all of you then?

304
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,760
We'll just come and take what we want.

305
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
What's happened with this series though

306
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,400
that sounds so cool and fun?

307
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,920
I'm gonna say it's a pass, Justin.

308
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,120
I think they can fix this up.

309
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
I like some of the stuff in there.

310
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a hard pass.

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
Son of a, oh my god.

312
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,600
Why is Travis so fucking good at this?

313
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,960
Travis is fucking great at this.

314
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,600
Now here's the one that this was the,

315
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,520
I was casually perusing this article on,

316
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,280
I don't know, Hollywood Reporter, whatever it was.

317
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,200
And this is the one that made me decide

318
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
that we should probably talk about these.

319
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,760
A San Francisco homicide detective is,

320
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,200
this is called Alive.

321
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,280
And I'll tell you what it used to be called after.

322
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,320
A San Francisco homicide detective

323
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
is mysteriously brought back to life

324
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
after being killed in the line of duty.

325
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
But as he resumes his own life,

326
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
and he and his wife realize he isn't the same person

327
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,880
he used to be, they zero in on the strange man

328
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
behind his resurrection.

329
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,280
What is his name?

330
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
Travis, what's his name?

331
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,800
Lazarus.

332
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,840
No, no, what's the name of the strange man

333
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,960
behind his resurrection?

334
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,720
It's Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

335
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,680
It says here, Ryan Phillipe stars in Alive,

336
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,080
formerly called fucking Frankenstein the Cop Show.

337
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

338
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,120
Hold up.

339
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,800
Cop.

341
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,520
Ryan Phillipe as Frankenstein's monster.

342
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,600
Somebody killed Ryan Phillipe, right?

343
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,680
Then he, oh no, he's back.

344
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,600
But he's different than he used to be.

345
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
And he realizes it, I guess.

346
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh, who did this?

347
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,920
Oh, it was me.

348
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
Dr. Frankenstein, a real life doctor.

349
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,160
Oh my goodness.

350
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Yeah, that's a, oh wow, that's a big pickup.

351
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,560
Wow, holy shit.

352
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
I'm going to have to say that's going back

353
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,200
to the old woodshed.

354
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,280
No, it's a pass because it sounds fucking awesome.

355
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,240
And it's a pass.

356
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
And they pass on that.

357
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,160
They had that and they said, nope, this one's a pass.

358
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,840
This one we're going to pass on.

359
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
We don't deserve it.

360
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,160
That's from the people who brought you to elementary.

361
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
They wanted to go back to the well

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,640
and they bring you fucking, oh, Jesus Christ.

363
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,080
Eventually we got to start getting back

364
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
to our core competencies.

365
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
That is the end of the ones that I have.

366
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
That is ABC and CBS.

367
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,560
There are many more, just their dramas.

368
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
There are many more networks to go over.

369
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,760
But those are the two that I have for you right now.

370
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,320
They're all buck, I mean, they're all so wild.

371
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,400
Yeah, they had a show.

372
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,120
Leslie Odom and Katie Segal as priests

373
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,000
that are working together.

374
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,240
Oh my God.

375
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,120
That's a pass.

376
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
What, that's a pass?

377
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,600
That's a pass.

378
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,520
I was hooked off that one line, off that one line.

379
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,240
I wanted it.

380
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
I know, I know.

381
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,040
Oh, sorry, Katie Segal had a separate show.

382
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
But still, that one's called Nana.

383
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,400
That one's called Nana.

384
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,240
That might have been the issue.

385
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
That may have been the problem is it was called Nana.

386
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
TV, that's it.

387
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
TV sucks.

388
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,200
I've had it with you.

389
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,480
Hello, brothers.

390
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,280
Hi.

391
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,640
I work as a forklift.

392
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,280
Hi.

393
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
It's, oh, Trav, they can't.

394
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,040
Oh.

395
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,560
It's just a one way sort of.

396
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
Hello, brothers.

397
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,040
I work as a forklift driver in a small warehouse

398
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,360
for a local company that sells books on the internet.

399
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,040
Good read.

400
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,120
Our company is big on safety and urges any employee

401
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,240
who observes unsafe behavior to report it immediately.

402
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
A few days ago, I observed one of my managers,

403
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,040
who also happens to be our company's safety officer,

404
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,080
hauling ass through the warehouse on a forklift

405
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,760
and whipping around blind corners like there was no tomorrow.

406
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,560
Was this some sort of test to see if I would report him

407
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,040
or did I do the right thing in not being a narc?

408
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,920
That's from the forklift in the furious in Utah.

409
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Was, I mean, did he crash?

410
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,840
Did he crash or hit somebody?

411
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,040
Doesn't sound like it.

412
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
I mean, presumably that would have been included

413
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
in the question, but you know how our listeners are.

414
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah, I would have to think that if, like,

415
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
and the manager killed three people,

416
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,800
that would probably be a salient detail.

417
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
And he's dead today and so am I.

418
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,320
I just think that if he didn't crash or run into somebody,

419
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,960
he sure did drive pretty safely, I think,

420
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,400
and you have nothing to complain about.

421
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,120
You know what I mean?

422
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,440
Right.

423
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
The NASCAR guys, they drive freaking fast

424
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,920
and they spin around one big track

425
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,800
and they bump into each other and it's cool

426
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,960
and that's the only race that matters anymore

427
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,360
because in horses, if you bump, it's ruined.

428
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,040
But they are safe about it, you know what I mean?

429
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,840
I feel like maybe he was trying to get really hands-on

430
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,960
to say, like, in the future, I want to be able to tell people

431
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,520
that this is unsafe with a straight face.

432
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
I need to know for myself that this is unsafe.

433
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Oh, do you think someone would do it and see if I get hurt?

434
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,680
Do you think the manager then, like, finished

435
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,360
whatever obstacle course he had set up

436
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,920
and was like, oh, wait, I didn't kill anybody.

437
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,440
Maybe this is safe.

438
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,240
This is safe.

439
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,960
I shouldn't.

440
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
This is safe.

441
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,400
It's fine.

442
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,280
I did it once and it's fine.

443
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,040
I've been lying to people this whole time,

444
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,760
telling them it wasn't safe, but look at me, I'm fine.

445
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,160
I-

446
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
Hey, guys, come over here and tear ass

447
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,560
in these beautiful babies.

448
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,440
I'm so sorry.

449
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
Hey, if I get everybody in the break room,

450
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,080
I need you all to go out there and tear some fucking ass

451
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,000
in the front glass, because I was wrong this whole time.

452
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,800
I don't think that's the verbiage of the question.

453
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,560
Hey, J-Man.

454
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,480
Hey, hey, Junge, is your-

455
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,200
Didn't you say your nephew's good at painting flames?

456
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Have him come in here and put some fucking flames

457
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,320
on these sons of bitches and let's tear some ass.

458
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,960
And then stop bragging about your son

459
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,440
and his skills in the workplace.

460
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,160
Or, you know what?

461
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
Put up a show up, Junge.

462
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
It's time.

463
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
It's time for your son, Wreck-It,

464
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,880
to come in here and paint some flames.

465
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
And then we'll all race.

466
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,080
I just think if you don't get hurt or dead,

467
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
then the thing you did was safe.

468
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,560
I have never broken a bone in my body or been killed,

469
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,200
and so everything I've ever done in my life,

470
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,920
including lying to a robber at Goodpoint

471
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,200
about GameStop's PlayStation 3 inventory,

472
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
was really safe.

473
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,360
Yep.

474
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,640
I think it's perfectly safe.

475
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,920
I think you always did the right thing in not narking.

476
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,320
I would say nobody likes a nark, right?

477
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
Well, I bet police do.

478
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
Police probably like narks.

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,040
Probably judges do.

480
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Look, I would say probably anybody

481
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,200
in the LAPD Extended Universe likes narks.

482
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
CIs, they call them.

483
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,560
CIs!

484
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,240
I know a little bit of the lingo going in,

485
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,000
so I watch Courthouse and Tommy and All Rise and Nancy,

486
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
so I know a lot of the lingo.

487
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,600
All Rise sounds like the name of a show

488
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,880
about a boy band that's also judges during the day.

489
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,680
That's a good...

490
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,840
See, that's a better idea for a show.

491
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,320
That's a good name for a boy band, though, too.

492
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Yeah, All Rise for these cute guys.

493
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,680
That's what it would say on the poster.

494
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,120
A judge-themed...

495
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
A judge-themed boy band.

496
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,840
A judge-themed boy band with the wigs and whatnot.

497
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,920
Yeah, they would all be in Barristers wigs

498
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,240
and just tiny shorts.

499
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,600
Only one of them, though, right?

500
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,560
We gotta set them apart.

501
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,080
So there's the Barrister wig one.

502
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,760
There's Judge Lansito is just in it.

503
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,680
He is one of them.

504
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,280
I mean, there's Judge Reinhold is their manager.

505
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,040
Yeah, he's the manager,

506
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,960
and he's always trying to get into the group.

507
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
And they're like, no, Judge, you're not a real judge.

508
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
We all went to law school for many, many years.

509
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,920
We are Judge Nelson's there,

510
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,480
and he's like, I'm never changing my name ever.

511
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,520
I love you boys.

512
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm never changing this name.

513
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
I'm never adding the G, no matter how many times you ask.

514
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,680
Come on, but we can be brothers.

515
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,320
No, Judge, that's not how it works.

516
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,040
What if they have a song called I'm Gonna Supremely Court You?

517
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,720
Or what about I Wanna Hold You,

518
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,920
parentheses, in contempt, in parentheses.

519
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,200
That's good.

520
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,680
Thank you.

521
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,040
I like a sexy title where the parentheticals make it less sexy.

522
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,240
Yeah, that's good.

523
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,200
I love that.

524
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,680
Objection, getting naked.

525
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,600
This is a very sexually aggressive boy band.

526
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
That's typically not their style.

527
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Their third album once they're all in their 40s

528
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,840
and trying to get the magic back.

529
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,920
I object to you not liking me.

530
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,760
Oh no.

531
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,840
That's a cool song.

532
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,120
I have a Yahoo here.

533
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,000
It's illegal for you to not marry me today.

534
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,640
Wait, what?

535
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:56,960
Whoa.

536
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,520
You're just saying, I mean.

537
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,320
That's romantic.

538
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,720
Mike sent this in.

539
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,120
Thanks, Mike.

540
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
It's Yahoo Answers user Carlos, who asks,

541
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,000
I missed a fight at school and I can't get them to fight again.

542
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,560
What do I do?

543
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,000
The one day I'm sick and had to miss school, my friend got in a fight.

544
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,640
I tried everything to get them to fight again.

545
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
I made a fake Facebook account pretending to be the guy he fought

546
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
and started sending him messages talking,

547
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm assuming it says shit.

548
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,280
I tried bringing up the fight every day at school,

549
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,000
tried spreading rumors about the other person talking shit.

550
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,880
Still, no matter what I do, they won't fight again.

551
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
It's bullshit.

552
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,760
Didn't bleep this one, Yahoo, weird,

553
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,120
that I didn't get to see it in person.

554
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,560
I only got to see the video.

555
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,520
What?

556
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
Wait, what a twist right there at the end.

557
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh, I like the book is better.

558
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,400
I don't get to smell the blood and sweat.

559
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,360
They missed the big fight and I only saw one fight

560
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,640
and it was in high school and somebody had to go to the,

561
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,560
to see the doctor who lives in the hospital

562
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,400
because of how bad it was.

563
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,520
And I didn't, I wouldn't say that I loved, I liked it.

564
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
I wouldn't say that I would have been sad if I missed it.

565
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
Or maybe it's good that I did see it

566
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
because I was so viscerally horrified by the fight

567
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,360
that I have gone out of my way to live a life

568
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,600
that is essentially fight free.

569
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,720
My first day of high school, the first day,

570
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,400
I was all, oh, stars in my eyes, just so young.

571
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,360
There was like an eight person fight

572
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,800
that like teachers had to break up and wade into

573
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,520
in the middle and like, it was horrifying.

574
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,320
And it kind of feels almost like it was so dramatic

575
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,040
that if you told me now, hey, big twist,

576
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,960
it had been staged by the teachers

577
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,120
as like part of a scared straight kind of thing.

578
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,040
I would have believed you.

579
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,800
We need to get them fighting again, though, for this one.

580
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,800
Yeah, you gotta assign kids to a three fight deal minimum.

581
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,440
Yes.

582
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
I, you know, you want the,

583
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
you want to give them the Chris Evans package.

584
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
You want them to be fighting whenever

585
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
and wherever you say for the next decade.

586
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,000
Babe, you gotta lock them in early.

587
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,920
Don't just let them go swinging

588
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,840
because then they have all the power.

589
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
Yes, also bring up to your friend,

590
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,800
like you've been going the indirect route.

591
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,040
I think you go directly to your friend and say,

592
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,520
we need some kind of character arc here.

593
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,040
Like whoever lost needs a redemption story.

594
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,480
That's act two.

595
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,120
And then maybe act three is like once and for all, right?

596
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,480
Like you need, go to whoever lost and convince them

597
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
that they need to have their like Rocky II, right?

598
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,640
Where they come back and fight.

599
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,680
And then I think convince them to work together to fight,

600
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,440
I don't know, a Russian or something.

601
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,000
That seems like Rocky III, if I remember correctly.

602
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
I think you got to find out what both of them like

603
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,640
and then leave a trail of each thing

604
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,480
leading each person to one spot

605
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,640
and then hope that the fight will kind of just happen

606
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,360
once they are with each other.

607
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,600
Like if your friend's into three musketeers

608
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,520
and the other one is into like-

609
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,840
Stocks and bonds.

610
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,840
Or yeah, stocks and bonds, camel cigarettes.

611
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,320
You just leave a little line of them

612
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,240
and they'll follow it like a hungry ant.

613
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
So maybe do that.

614
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
Maybe like steal one of their identities

615
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,160
and ruin their credit and blame it on the other one.

616
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,600
Stink bomb.

617
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,200
Or stink bomb.

618
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,320
One of those two.

619
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,840
I would say one of those two things

620
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,960
would make me want to punch someone.

621
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,080
Stealing a lunch.

622
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,120
That would actually, I wouldn't mind.

623
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
Justin, help us make these kids fight.

624
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,280
I don't want to do that.

625
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,520
Justin, help us make the kids fight.

626
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,320
Play with me.

627
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,360
I think you could wear a disguise

628
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
and dress like one of the kids.

629
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,880
See, it's fun when you start playing, isn't it?

630
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,120
I'm having a better time now that I've said this far.

631
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,360
I'm going to say also mustache and sunglasses

632
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
and go fight the other kid and be like,

633
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,320
I'll be waiting for my revenge over the stairs.

634
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,280
I've made myself sad because I thought about an actual,

635
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,840
I don't know, helpful answer for Yahoo.

636
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,280
And I'm worried about that.

637
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,960
I don't like it, but you could just start saying,

638
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,280
I heard blank and blank.

639
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,360
We're going to fight after school today

640
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,520
and just spread that rumor around

641
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,200
until they can't not fight.

642
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,280
Now that's some rough playing, Trav.

643
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,960
I know I wanted you to play with me,

644
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,160
but you're rough, house and a little rough.

645
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,200
I know that's what I'm saying.

646
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,320
We do jokes here, Trav.

647
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,560
I don't know how I feel about being an effective fixer

648
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,200
for this horrible Yahoo answers person.

649
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,360
You do the thing where you stand in between the two of them,

650
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,520
which is going to be some tricky planning

651
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,560
to get that to happen.

652
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,600
And then you say to one of them like,

653
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,680
hey, yo mama's feet sink, and when they go to punch you

654
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,360
in the face, you duck, and they punch the other one.

655
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,440
And then they will keep doing that.

656
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,800
This ties in really well with the next regular question.

657
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,160
You could do it, I'm not done.

658
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,400
You could do a thing where you run up behind one of them

659
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
and you stick your arms through their armpits

660
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,480
and you punch the other person like they're a muppet

661
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,280
and then they'll think it's their arms.

662
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,920
What about when the kid opens his locker,

663
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,320
a bunch of fucking marbles fall out?

664
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
Because you've been slowly putting marbles

665
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,600
in there every day.

666
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,960
And behind all the marbles, there's a sign that says,

667
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
this one was Kevin.

668
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
And then, yeah.

669
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,360
And a picture of Kevin Kline.

670
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,880
So, no, I wouldn't think that.

671
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
I was thinking that maybe the kid,

672
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
he's trying to get into a fight with his name Kevin,

673
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,800
not beloved actor on stage and scream Kevin Kline.

674
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,640
Maybe the kid is Kevin Kline.

675
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,520
I had a friend named Kevin Kline.

676
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,200
Maybe Kevin Kline went back to like 23 Jump Street

677
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,760
and Kevin Kline's back.

678
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,440
There's more than one Kevin Kline, Justin.

679
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,040
There was a Kevin Kline in my middle school.

680
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,560
Was there really?

681
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,040
Yeah.

682
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,280
And as far as I know, it's not the same person.

683
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,040
That's cool.

684
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,600
That's really cool.

685
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,640
It was cool.

686
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,080
That's badass, dude.

687
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,200
You've said so much fucking trash over the years, Travis,

688
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,960
and you never said the words,

689
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,440
I went to school with a kid named Kevin Kline.

690
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
And you said so much other garbage

691
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,320
where you could have been saying that.

692
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,120
Travis, that's the coolest thing you've ever said.

693
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
I know, it just wasn't Jermaine before now

694
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,560
and I didn't want to burn it.

695
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,200
I had one chance.

696
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,680
Don't tell me you went to school with a kid named Jermaine, too.

697
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,640
Now I'm freaking out.

698
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,840
Holy shit.

699
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,120
Was it spelled the same?

700
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,800
Or was it Kevin with a C?

701
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,360
Exactly the same.

702
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,160
Fuck yeah, dude.

703
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,240
That kicks ass.

704
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,360
That's so cool, Travis.

705
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
Yeah, it was cool.

706
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,760
Did he act or do any other cool shit like that?

707
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,920
He saw a goldfish or what's up?

708
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,480
You know, I just remember him living his best life

709
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,160
and being a good example.

710
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,200
Cool, man.

711
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,800
Yeah, dude, for sure.

712
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,080
For sure, for sure, for sure.

713
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,960
Don't make the kids fight.

714
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,840
Kids shouldn't fight.

715
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,320
Okay.

716
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
And with that, we'll go to the Money Zone.

717
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,720
Hey, it can be hard to find the exact right person

718
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,200
for your business and that's a confusing path to walk

719
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,320
with lots of dead ends and people along the way.

720
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
They'll try to sell you watches from a coat,

721
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,280
but you don't need to stop with them

722
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,960
or any other of the illusions that try to lure you

723
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,320
into danger or anything.

724
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,280
Uh-oh, here comes a, now there's a big spider

725
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,640
and he's standing before a branch in the forest path

726
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,760
and he can talk.

727
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,600
If you go down that path,

728
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,840
they're gonna confront your shadow self

729
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,040
and you'll have to destroy it.

730
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,600
Go right.

731
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,480
Go right and you'll find a guide hunched under a waterfall

732
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,080
and that guide is Zip Recruiter.

733
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,680
It's me, Zip Recruiter.

734
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,840
Hey Zip, I heard that you send my job

735
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,320
to over a hundred of the web's leading job boards.

736
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,040
That's true.

737
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,160
Do you stop there?

738
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
I don't stop there.

739
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,240
I have powerful matching technology.

740
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,560
Me, Zip Recruiter, scans thousands of resumes.

741
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,080
Oh no.

742
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,480
Oh shit.

743
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,760
It's me, Gobblegum.

744
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
I eat resumes.

745
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,360
I'll kill you, Gobblegum.

746
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,840
I said if you ever showed your goddamn face around here,

747
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,080
I'd kill you.

748
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,720
No.

749
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,160
Fuck you, Gobblegum.

750
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,040
The crystalline sword, it's emerging from your chest,

751
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,320
Zip Recruiter.

752
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,280
I'm taking the sword, I'm stabbing Gobblegum.

753
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,160
My jellies.

754
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
He's dying.

755
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,160
Thank you, Zip Recruiter, for your chest sword.

756
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,520
Yes, I am unstoppable.

757
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,960
In fact, I'm so effective that four out of five employers

758
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,080
who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate

759
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,400
through the site within the first day.

760
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,440
I'm not yet gone.

761
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,800
Gobblegum.

762
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,600
Thank you.

763
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,200
Justin, give me just one second.

764
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,800
I've got to go murder this fool.

765
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,640
Wait, ZipRecruiter.com slash my brother.

766
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,360
Gobblegum, Gobblegum.

767
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,200
I see he says his own name like a Pokemon.

768
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,480
How can people harness these incredible services, Zip?

769
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,640
I already said the link really good as Gobblegum.

770
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Yeah, but it didn't make any narrative sense

771
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,840
for you to fucking say that.

772
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,360
Hey, ZipRecruiter.com slash my brother.

773
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,800
That's ZipRecruiter.com slash my brother.

774
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,240
Zip Recruiter, I'm the smartest way to hire.

775
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
Hey, guys, it's me, Postmates.

776
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,680
Do you need some food or whatever delivered?

777
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,920
Call up me, Postmates.

778
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,040
You guys should, now you guys do one of them.

779
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,920
Sucks ass.

780
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,880
Yours sucks.

781
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,760
Ours was so cool.

782
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah, ours had a rich fiction behind it.

783
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,520
I've gone beast form.

784
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,080
Postmates has a beast form?

785
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,400
Postmates has an engaged beast form.

786
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,600
Activate.

787
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,800
Postmates is a bunch of people that can turn into moped.

788
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,320
Armed bazookas.

789
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,680
And they have armed bazookas.

790
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,040
Those armed bazookas can shoot red wine to you or sushi

791
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,800
or I don't know, ibuprofen

792
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,040
because you ate too much red wine and sushi.

793
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,840
Hey, guys, it's me.

794
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,360
I'm regular Postmates again

795
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,920
and I do personal food delivery, grocery,

796
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,000
whatever the fuck you want delivered.

797
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,560
I can get it there to you 24-7.

798
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
You don't have to take any more trips.

799
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,560
Hold on, my beast gym is glowing.

800
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,520
Can one of you guys finish?

801
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,380
No.

802
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,920
Beastmates.

803
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,600
You don't have to take trips to the store.

804
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,960
You can download the app for iOS.

805
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,600
Download the app from Beastmates.

806
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Or Android for free.

807
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,520
Browse local restaurants and businesses

808
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,640
and track your delivery.

809
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,840
I can track it with my powerful wolf nose.

810
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
They're the largest on demand network

811
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,880
in the known universe with more than 25,000 partner merchants.

812
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
So for a limited time,

813
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,480
I'm giving our listeners $100 of free delivery credit

814
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,920
for your first seven days.

815
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,280
To start your free deliveries,

816
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,120
download the app and use the code MYBROTHER.

817
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,800
That's MYBROTHER, all one word,

818
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,320
for $100 of free delivery credit for your first seven days

819
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,280
when you, bing, bing.

820
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,840
How come I'm so clean?

821
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,680
When you download the Postmates app.

822
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,400
Anything you need, anytime you need it, Postmate it.

823
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,080
Download Postmates and save with code MYBROTHER all one way.

824
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,720
You know, a lot of shows brag about being ad-free,

825
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,400
but not a lot are willing to put in the work it takes to get there

826
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,560
to really make that an absolute reality.

827
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,640
We're working hard every episode to drive advertisers away.

828
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
This is the only way we know to go ad-free

829
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,920
and that's to systematically alienate everybody

830
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,360
who would want to give us money.

831
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,560
But do go.

832
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,400
Those sponsors, we have gotten so nasty

833
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,480
with everybody who gives us money

834
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,840
and nobody ever gives a shit,

835
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,920
so please frequent their businesses

836
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,120
because they keep letting us do it.

837
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
Nobody's ever told us to stop doing it.

838
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,160
I don't know.

839
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,200
Maybe eventually somebody will get wise, but...

840
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,400
Just Beastmates flipped my chair and I lost all my settings.

841
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,680
To give you those again, ZipRecruiter.com slash MYBROTHER

842
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,320
and Postmates is the app and then use the code MYBROTHER to save.

843
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,640
If you could just do that this week.

844
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,040
And don't mention, please don't mention these ads.

845
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,000
That'd be great.

846
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,280
No, do mention, I mean say these are effective ads.

847
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,200
This is the future of advertising.

848
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,320
I mean, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing,

849
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,400
but these are effective ads, this is the future of advertising.

850
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,920
This is how it should be.

851
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,640
Hey, James.

852
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,520
Hey, Nakay.

853
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,400
What we doing, girl?

854
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,480
We are inviting the awesome listeners of Maximum Fun

855
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,080
to join us at Minority Corner.

856
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,200
Ooh, fun.

857
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,680
But you know how we go on Tangent City.

858
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,880
We're the joint mayors.

859
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,080
We're not gonna do that, okay?

860
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,960
Supes focus.

861
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,600
Okay, so Minority Corner is where you can all come

862
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,120
and get your pop culture takes.

863
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,160
Plus social commentary, news, and TV movie reactions

864
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,440
like Avengers Endgame.

865
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,560
No spoilers here.

866
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,440
Ooh, snap.

867
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,880
Sometimes we dig into the vaults

868
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,200
and we review and recap those movies you missed.

869
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,800
Good at you, Halle Berry's kidnapped.

870
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
I love how she always gives 1000%.

871
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,680
Like Beyonce.

872
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,280
Did you see Homecoming on Netflix?

873
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,200
She was burning it down like the Mother of Dragons.

874
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,560
Have you seen the latest Game of Thrones?

875
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,200
So good.

876
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,320
Only thing missing?

877
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
More black people.

878
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,040
What you think about Mayor Pete?

879
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
Wait a minute, James.

880
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,960
We went on a tangent?

881
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,520
Yes.

882
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,160
I will.

883
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,480
Join us every Friday for more tangents.

884
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,440
On Maximum Fun.

885
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
I was recently invited to a birthday party

886
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
for a good friend of mine.

887
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,520
On the invitation, there was a little note that said,

888
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,200
your presence is our present.

889
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,120
While this normally wouldn't be an issue

890
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,440
as it takes away the burden of wondering what to get them,

891
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,000
this particular person's invite poses a problem.

892
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,080
The last time I went to a party of theirs,

893
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,880
a Christmas party,

894
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,280
where they put your presence is our present on the invite,

895
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,840
literally everyone but me brought a Christmas gift

896
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,400
to the host.

897
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,600
What do I do?

898
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,880
Should I ignore the note and buy them a gift they might like?

899
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,360
Or should I abide by the note and risk being the only person

900
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,240
to show up empty-handed and look like a total jackass?

901
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
Any advice at all would be appreciated.

902
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,360
That's from Puzzled Party Goer.

903
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,760
Get a gift.

904
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,480
People like presents.

905
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,880
Next question.

906
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
I work at an office in downtown Manhattan

907
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,440
that's situated between several populous tourist attractions.

908
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,080
Wow, wow, wow.

909
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,040
I said populous.

910
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,280
Yeah.

911
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,560
They are-

912
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,680
I think you also said Dantown, Manhattan.

913
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
And that's why we call it Dantown.

914
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,880
New on CBS, it's Dantown.

915
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,000
Downtown Julie Brown is back in Murphy Brown's Dantown.

916
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,480
I work at an office in downtown Manhattan

917
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,920
that is situated between several popular tourist attractions.

918
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,000
The Stock Exchange, World Trade Center,

919
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,360
Federal Hall, et cetera.

920
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,600
Whenever I leave my office for lunch,

921
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,120
the area is flooded with tourists taking photos.

922
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,200
I feel really guilty when I walk in front of a camera

923
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,880
and inadvertently ruin a picture,

924
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,760
but it is virtually impossible to avoid doing so.

925
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,040
How can I ensure that I don't ruin the photo of a nice family

926
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,000
visiting the big city while simply trying to eat my burrito?

927
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,040
Is there a way that my unintentional photobombing

928
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,880
could improve their vacation?

929
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,080
And that's from Brian.

930
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,400
And I will quickly dispel Brian of the last one,

931
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,840
and that is to say no.

932
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,440
That will not improve anything.

933
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,480
What if Brian walks around dressed as Iron Man?

934
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Travis, I was literally gonna say Iron Man.

935
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,840
Iron Man was even the one I was gonna say, dude.

936
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,480
Yeah, dude.

937
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,600
Fuck yeah.

938
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,400
Yeah, and it doesn't even need to be

939
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,880
an especially good Iron Man costume.

940
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,800
No, I think if it's a little blurry,

941
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
maybe the costume's blurry, you know?

942
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,640
It's like, oh, he's moving so fast.

943
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,760
Iron Man, Pikachu, so many of these folks

944
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,920
that people would love to see in their pictures

945
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,680
because it's fun to have a picture with them.

946
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,040
That's one really good way.

947
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,680
I mean, just have a nice smile always

948
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,360
when you're walking to get your lunch,

949
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,080
which you should be happy anyway because it's burrito time.

950
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,800
I would say whenever I take a picture in a busy area,

951
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,720
my greatest fear in all my life in that moment

952
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,360
is that I am impeding someone's progress

953
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,040
as they try to walk to their location.

954
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,480
So I think I'd prefer the person just truck on through.

955
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,920
I'll snap another pic.

956
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,960
Don't linger.

957
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,480
I have two children under five

958
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,320
that I'm trying to simultaneously get to look

959
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
at the little glass circle on my phone.

960
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,280
So statistically speaking, you're not ruining anything.

961
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm going to delete this picture, no question.

962
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,920
I'm gonna take 30 of them and there's no way.

963
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,480
Oh, you're doing so much better than I am.

964
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,840
If I beef it, I want a pristine camera roll in there, baby.

965
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,920
I want them to tuck in to a real,

966
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,720
I want them to say Justin had a hidden knack

967
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,040
for being a great, great photographer

968
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,600
and we never knew and we never appreciated

969
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,560
like so many other great things about him.

970
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,440
We did not appreciate this fully while he was with us.

971
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,720
I miss him so bad.

972
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,800
What's that noise from up in the rafters?

973
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,080
Ceiling crashes down.

974
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,640
It's me?

975
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,120
What?

976
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,400
I faked my death.

977
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,800
I did.

978
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,480
Now you are really dead because you fell from the rafters.

979
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,560
I am actually dead this time.

980
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,480
No faking, I wake up.

981
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,000
It was all a dream?

982
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,360
You crashed through the rafters of your own bedroom ceiling.

983
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,400
What?

984
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,520
Yes.

985
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:37,840
What?

986
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,160
I think it's all about making stories.

987
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,000
That's why people take photos is for stories.

988
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,960
So if you can do something to accentuate the story

989
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,320
of their New York adventure,

990
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,760
like do cartwheels the whole way to the burrito

991
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,000
and they'll be like, remember the cartwheels guy?

992
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,360
Let me pitch this a little less physically demanding.

993
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,920
As you walk by, put your phone to your ear and say,

994
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,120
what's that, Mr. Mayor?

995
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,480
The asteroid's on its way.

996
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,040
I'll be right there as you walk by.

997
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,600
And then they're like, whoa, wait, what just happened?

998
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,880
Is that person some sort of superhero or scientist

999
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,920
or a super scientist or super Saiyan?

1000
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,440
And you just keep walking.

1001
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,400
Travis makes a good point.

1002
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,240
Goku is another character you could just up as.

1003
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,200
So that one would be easy.

1004
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,400
You could, this would be a fun story.

1005
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Remember that time we were taking a picture

1006
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,160
in front of the stock exchange

1007
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,880
and a person walked by us and just crop dusted

1008
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,240
the heck out of us as they went,

1009
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,760
just ripped a big fart and they kept going.

1010
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,720
And you could do that to all of them.

1011
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,960
You just have to really open up down there.

1012
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,360
Open up all the vents.

1013
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah, and then blast off.

1014
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,960
Cause I'll tell you,

1015
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,720
you're not gonna have much trouble coming back

1016
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,960
after you eat one of these Chipotle burritos.

1017
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,680
I'll tell you what,

1018
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,440
when I eat one of those,

1019
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,360
it gives me a lot of stomach distress.

1020
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,200
So I assume it's the same for you.

1021
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,920
Yeah, keep going.

1022
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,680
Hey, do you remember when we went to New York

1023
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,440
and Iron Man farted on us?

1024
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,280
We were in downtown Manhattan and Iron Man farted

1025
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,840
on me and our children and grandma.

1026
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,160
Y'all want a yahoo?

1027
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,720
How about another question?

1028
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,360
How about a yahoo?

1029
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,960
Oh damn, I was about to ask you for that.

1030
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,480
That's what I meant, a yahoo question.

1031
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
Do you all want a yahoo?

1032
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,560
No.

1033
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,120
Yes, please.

1034
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,720
Here's one that was sent in by Esther.

1035
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,280
Thanks, Esther.

1036
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,880
It's from an anonymous yahoo answers user

1037
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,280
who I'm gonna call Bubby.

1038
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,440
Asks, did soldiers in the American Revolution

1039
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,920
ever take off their shirts slash coats off during battles?

1040
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,600
They must have gotten all sweaty and hot

1041
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,680
fighting in the heat all day in those heavy garments.

1042
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,440
They must have gotten all hot and sweaty and dirty stink.

1043
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,360
Get the stink of the arms and the butt

1044
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,440
and the grundle from the hot fighting in the heat all day

1045
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,840
in those heavy garments, especially the red coats.

1046
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,960
Or was it against the rules?

1047
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,800
This fall on CBS, Red Coats, No Coats starring...

1048
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,600
What is the question?

1049
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
These boys have done war so much

1050
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,760
that they have a right powerful stink

1051
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,560
in between their legs and under their arms.

1052
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
I'm gonna say, let's see who's in this.

1053
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,000
Joshua Jackson's in it.

1054
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,160
Josh Jackson's in it.

1055
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,680
Christopher Jackson's in it.

1056
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,280
Josh Molina's in it.

1057
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,840
Did they ever take off their shirts and coats

1058
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
during the battles in the American Revolution?

1059
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,680
They couldn't figure out how to.

1060
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,320
There's a lot of buttons, I'll give you that.

1061
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,880
That's how every, if you've ever,

1062
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,680
I know it's a different war,

1063
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,760
but if you've ever seen Civil War reactors,

1064
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,200
the last thing they do at every one

1065
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,520
is like the general or whatever is like,

1066
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,680
and now men, let's all shower together.

1067
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,600
And then they all go, they all go shower together

1068
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,000
in frolic nude in a river.

1069
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,520
That's why kids can't go to those things.

1070
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,960
Can you imagine, man?

1071
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm imagining it now.

1072
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,560
It's pretty good.

1073
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,160
The worst part of being in war

1074
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,720
has gotta be the fact that you can't take your clothes off

1075
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,040
even when you get a gunky stink down any witch wear.

1076
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,040
And I don't know why.

1077
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,120
Well, because it's dangerous.

1078
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,560
It's not like it's armor, Griffin.

1079
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,400
In fact, you would never hear in the Revolutionary War like,

1080
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
oh, he would have died if it weren't

1081
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
for that thin layer of material.

1082
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,160
They don't know if you're a blue one or a red one.

1083
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,640
Yes, exactly.

1084
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,360
You don't know the teams.

1085
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,320
What if you, imagine you're American Revolutionary,

1086
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,400
you get called by a bunch of Brits, right?

1087
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
All you gotta do is strip off your shirt

1088
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,080
and be like, go and blow me dents,

1089
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,920
don't you miss the team's biscuits?

1090
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,160
And then they'd shoot you because it was a bad accident.

1091
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,960
But still, the idea, you understand, of course.

1092
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,040
You have a Harley Davidson tattoo,

1093
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,720
so they know and they kill you right there.

1094
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,200
Yeah.

1095
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,480
What I'm saying is you get a-

1096
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,520
From the future?

1097
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,840
Yes.

1098
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,120
I want to do one more question, Justin.

1099
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,200
I've got just the one for you.

1100
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,840
It's the next one.

1101
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,480
Okay.

1102
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,400
My housemate's dad is going to be crashing

1103
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,440
at our house for a few days.

1104
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,720
Oh, fuck yeah, Philip?

1105
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,400
Philip's coming?

1106
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,200
That dude rules.

1107
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,840
Philip's dad is coming.

1108
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,680
A housemate's dad is going to be crashing

1109
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,320
at our house for a few days while my housemate is in Mexico.

1110
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,880
He's visited a couple of times, so we know him okay.

1111
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,200
Here's the thing, this man has recently gotten into

1112
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,280
making DIY music videos for himself.

1113
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,200
That's the new sound I make when I get so excited

1114
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,320
that I can jump up and-

1115
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,000
And asks us to give feedback.

1116
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,080
Literally had us sit down at the house,

1117
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,440
watch the music video with him,

1118
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,480
and ask us to go around and be honest about what we thought.

1119
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,640
Thankfully, the music video wasn't terrible.

1120
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,560
Nice, but it's clearly DIY.

1121
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,240
Mostly shots of his face at different angles

1122
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,320
wearing sunglasses as he sings somebody's guitar.

1123
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:47,360
I don't know how you make what you just described not terrible,

1124
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,840
but I want to see it so bad.

1125
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,200
It's been about six months,

1126
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,720
so there's a chance he'll do it again.

1127
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
He's been working on a full-length album.

1128
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,520
And we won't have his daughter there as a buffer

1129
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,800
to gauge how much honest feedback to give this man.

1130
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Brothers, what would you do if your friend's dad,

1131
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,320
who you didn't know super well,

1132
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,240
asked for feedback on his music video?

1133
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,720
That's from Nervous About Notes in Seattle.

1134
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,960
There are so many fucking things.

1135
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,480
Here's the wildest part.

1136
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,400
It's the truth for you to know.

1137
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,560
The dad is just coming for this.

1138
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,040
Because his daughter, she ain't there.

1139
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,000
He's not visiting his little schnookums.

1140
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,960
He's there to see if he's giving too much guitar face

1141
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,720
and if he needs to turn up the trip.

1142
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,600
To answer your question of what we would do in this situation,

1143
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,080
and I know this is kind of a cop-out,

1144
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,200
I wouldn't allow myself to get into a situation like this.

1145
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,880
If I found out one of my friend's dads

1146
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,320
makes amateur music videos and has any desire

1147
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,720
for human feedback, I would have to just break up

1148
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,000
with that friend immediately, publicly on Facebook,

1149
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,720
just to avoid the exact situation you're in right now.

1150
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,560
But I appreciate that you're in it.

1151
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,240
I like that very much.

1152
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,560
I actually think I might be excited

1153
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,480
to be a part of this situation.

1154
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,440
Because you said it wasn't bad, maybe this one's better.

1155
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,520
Maybe the next one's gonna be even better.

1156
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,840
And what if he integrated some of your feedback

1157
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,040
from last time?

1158
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,600
He's like, remember when you said my shirt was too short

1159
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,440
and that it should cover all my torso?

1160
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,640
Well, good news, this one's down on my knees, let's go.

1161
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,360
Remember when you said I should include more claymation?

1162
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,960
Well, I had my friend Peter Gabriel help me

1163
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,200
and it gets pretty weird.

1164
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,920
I put a second mortgage on the house to put more in there.

1165
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,800
And also, yeah, I am wearing my jeans backwards.

1166
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,880
That's a new thing.

1167
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,400
I got this new thing in this video

1168
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,480
and it's where I make out with my wife

1169
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,680
on a big beanbag chair.

1170
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
And we do that for like one of the choruses.

1171
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,000
So tell me what you think of that.

1172
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,960
What do you think about that?

1173
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,520
It's deep kissing.

1174
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,880
Yeah, it's all real, folks.

1175
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,400
That's all new.

1176
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,520
I'm still playing the guitar too.

1177
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,840
I'm still rocking my ax too, while I'm tongue deep.

1178
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,080
And then there's a scene where I'm just throwing a couch

1179
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,520
off of a cliff.

1180
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,360
It's weird, it's a little avant garde.

1181
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,200
Let me know what you think.

1182
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,880
There's a scene where I put a bunch of rubber bands

1183
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,560
around a watermelon until it explodes.

1184
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,560
Pretty fucking cool.

1185
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,360
Hey, rate my delts in this next shot.

1186
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,440
Not this one, not this one.

1187
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,520
Check out my delts in this next shot.

1188
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,040
Wait, hold on.

1189
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,160
Fuck, I missed it.

1190
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,320
Hey, rewind it and check out my delts in that one.

1191
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,880
I feel like they're looking pretty good.

1192
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,560
Here, okay, question asker.

1193
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,320
Here's your get out of jail free card.

1194
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,920
You're going to say, listen, there's a lot to present.

1195
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,600
There's a lot to examine here.

1196
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,120
I'm going to need some time with this.

1197
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,200
I will get back to you.

1198
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,680
And then just like a couple days later, email like,

1199
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,720
I think it's fantastic.

1200
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,480
Keep up the good work.

1201
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,360
And then you're out.

1202
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,480
You're clear.

1203
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,120
What if he said, I want you guys to watch the video

1204
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,440
and you just threw a ball peen hammer through your TV.

1205
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,560
Yeah, sorry, man.

1206
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,280
I dropped all my slime on the VCR.

1207
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,960
So I can't, because I slimed it.

1208
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,680
I'm sorry, we don't have a VCR.

1209
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,880
Well, it's not on video today.

1210
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,480
What, then how could I watch it?

1211
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,160
Yeah, well, how am I supposed to watch it, Daryl?

1212
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,880
You smash your TV and he's like,

1213
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,000
it's on this thumb drive and you're like, God damn it.

1214
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,120
My computer only does USB-G.

1215
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,520
That's the new standard.

1216
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,280
Oh, you know, I've never been able to get my computer

1217
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,240
to play music videos.

1218
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,800
And that would be my only feedback is,

1219
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,000
can I be in the next one?

1220
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,840
Because I feel like I could really smolder

1221
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,120
and pretend to play drums.

1222
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,920
Oh, hell yeah.

1223
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,200
If I could pretend to play a musical instrument,

1224
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,880
please let me be in that music video.

1225
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,360
Y'all, his daughter's not even gonna be there.

1226
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,440
That's the thing that keeps fucking me up

1227
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,600
is his daughter's not gonna be there.

1228
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,320
So Phillip's just like chilling.

1229
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:52,240
He's just hanging in Seattle for the grunge scene, I guess.

1230
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,960
I'm scared because I want to watch it,

1231
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,440
but I don't wanna ask you to post it.

1232
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,120
Cause I don't wanna blow up his spot,

1233
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,920
but I want to see it.

1234
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,400
Not to make fun of it, not to make fun of it.

1235
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,760
No, it's just like fill this,

1236
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,680
like now it's all your brain getting.

1237
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,120
It's like hearing half the chorus of Walking on Broken Glass

1238
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,400
and you're like, oh my God, please,

1239
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,960
just someone play the song so I can move on with my life.

1240
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,000
It's all you wanna hear.

1241
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,160
Since you are writing into us saying,

1242
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,680
like you feel awkward about this

1243
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,280
and you're afraid you're gonna have to do it again,

1244
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,320
but you also described the video as not that bad,

1245
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,240
which means probably to me,

1246
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,080
the video will seem amazing

1247
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,760
because I don't have any caveats to it.

1248
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,080
So if you are willing to sort of endorse it,

1249
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,800
I'm endorsing it,

1250
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,720
then think of how good it will be for me.

1251
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,840
I'm imagining going out of town

1252
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,360
and then our dad goes to stay

1253
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,240
at one of my friend's houses here in Austin.

1254
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,280
And then after being there a couple of days

1255
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,200
and just chilling and playing it cool,

1256
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,880
he tells my friends,

1257
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,600
I want you guys to give me some feedback on my parkour.

1258
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,080
And then he starts doing parkour all around the house.

1259
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,360
God, that'd be awesome.

1260
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,360
That's essentially what we're dealing with here.

1261
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,680
Oh shit, I have a theory.

1262
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,360
The reason that Philip Dad is coming

1263
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,120
while the daughter's out of town is

1264
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,040
after the last time daughter said like,

1265
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,120
hey dad, please don't show your music videos

1266
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,400
to my friends anymore.

1267
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,720
And Philip Dad was like, oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1268
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,360
you got it.

1269
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,280
And then daughter was like, hey, Philip Dad,

1270
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,080
I'm going to Mexico for a few days.

1271
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,360
Oh, you are, huh?

1272
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,680
Okay, have fun.

1273
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,480
And this is the loophole.

1274
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,840
Philip Dad's gonna get in there

1275
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,680
and show them the new music video,

1276
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,440
that new heat that he's been working on

1277
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,880
with a really cool producer

1278
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,560
who also happens to be his manager.

1279
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,120
Yeah, and this one's too hot for TV.

1280
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,360
Most definitely.

1281
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,360
Don't give up on this daddy.

1282
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Do not give up on this daddy.

1283
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,200
I watched his Star is Born.

1284
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,600
Yes.

1285
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,760
You could be his Bradley Cooper, and that worked out

1286
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,200
really great for all of them.

1287
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,920
Bradley Cooper.

1288
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,240
Yep, yeah, I guess.

1289
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,680
Yep, I guess.

1290
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,960
I mean, you fucking said it, so.

1291
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,480
Daddy Gaga.

1292
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,880
Fuck, man.

1293
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,840
Should we do something else?

1294
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,440
Like a different show?

1295
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,440
Yeah, like a different career.

1296
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,480
Music?

1297
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,920
We could do music.

1298
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,040
Is it too late to do music?

1299
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,880
Yeah, I got like my foot in the door there, I feel like.

1300
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,200
We should do music videos.

1301
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,240
Well, no, no, no.

1302
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,800
Thank you.

1303
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,400
I want to start a real band with you guys.

1304
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,520
Yeah.

1305
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,000
Okay.

1306
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,680
Get in some real noise shit.

1307
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,600
We could start a boy band that's all judges.

1308
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,720
That's not a good call, we can't just do a callback joke

1309
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,880
because it still feels like we're podcasters

1310
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,680
when you said that.

1311
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,320
Oh, okay, yeah.

1312
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,080
And now, Travis, I do noise funk with your brother Justin,

1313
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,480
and I'm giving you my hand, and I'm saying,

1314
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,400
do you want to join us on this new ship?

1315
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,080
Yes.

1316
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,360
What do you bring to the table?

1317
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,720
I could do like spoken word over the noise funk.

1318
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,120
Yes.

1319
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,760
Yeah, you can.

1320
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,840
Yeah, so I guess this is our last episode.

1321
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,440
Well, it's our last, we're going to keep the feed going,

1322
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,280
but we're going to mostly, it's from this point on,

1323
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,040
it's mostly going to be noise funk.

1324
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,540
Okay.

1325
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,320
All right, well, this isn't where I saw today headed,

1326
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,000
but you know, sometimes you just got to let go and let God,

1327
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,560
which is also going to be the name of our band.

1328
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,280
It's the new one.

1329
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,400
Yeah, it's a Christian band.

1330
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,520
It's a Christian band.

1331
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,800
It's a Christian noise funk band,

1332
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,960
and it's sort of a sound experience

1333
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,320
that you're going to get on a weekly basis on our RSS feed.

1334
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,720
And I should also say our goal is not to make pleasurable music,

1335
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,280
it's just for it to make honest music.

1336
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,400
It'll be pleasurable to the ears of our Lord.

1337
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:38,880
Well, yeah.

1338
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,720
Dude loves noise funk.

1339
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:41,780
Loves it.

1340
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,000
I think you need to call your housemate

1341
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,480
and tell her to come home right now.

1342
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,240
Come protect me from your dad.

1343
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,000
This is not my problem, Patricia.

1344
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,520
Get the fuck back here.

1345
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,280
Listen, do you remember you called me

1346
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,760
because I left the dirty dishes in the sink too long

1347
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,200
and you asked me to take care of it?

1348
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,240
Okay, cool.

1349
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
I'm going to do the same thing, but about your dad.

1350
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,440
Okay, thank you very much.

1351
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,920
You got to call your dad in to come help you.

1352
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,880
Welcome to Daddy's Home 3,

1353
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,720
in which John Lithgow makes some music videos, I guess,

1354
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,600
and we have to call in another dad.

1355
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,160
Let's say Joe Mantegna.

1356
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,800
Joe Mantegna's got to come and stop John Lithgow

1357
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,000
from making music videos.

1358
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,920
Do you think that'll go to series?

1359
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,200
Daddy's Home, the series based on the movies.

1360
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,880
I'm going to take it back to the woodshed.

1361
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,320
I want to work on it a little bit more.

1362
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:30,820
Okay.

1363
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,080
I don't even think this is real, Trav.

1364
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,200
I don't even think this is a real show.

1365
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,520
I thought Joe Mantegna was sitting right here next to you.

1366
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,840
You're not a TV producer, so I don't think this is real.

1367
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

1368
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,520
I'm not a TV producer.

1369
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,200
I'm not a TV producer.

1370
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,920
It feels like a joke.

1371
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,120
Joe, Joe, I'm sorry.

1372
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,080
Yeah, you can go.

1373
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,040
I'm sorry about this, Joe.

1374
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,400
Justin, he's not even talking to Joe.

1375
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:52,720
He is.

1376
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,760
He's crying.

1377
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,440
You make Joe Mantegna cry.

1378
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,480
He can't cry.

1379
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,640
I can't even follow this bit anymore.

1380
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,960
Joe Mantegna's in Cincinnati at my house.

1381
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,640
So Prodigal Son revolves around Malcolm Bright,

1382
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,000
the son of a notorious serial killer named The Surgeon,

1383
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,160
who understands how killers think.

1384
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
The criminal psychologist uses his skills

1385
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,440
to help the NYPD solve crimes and stop killers

1386
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,680
while balancing his manipulative mother,

1387
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,040
an annoyingly normal sister, and a homicidal father

1388
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,760
still looking to bond with his prodigal son.

1389
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,680
The drama is described as a fresh take

1390
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,560
on the crime franchise with a darkly comedic tone.

1391
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,440
Yeah, that one's got Lou Diamond Phillips

1392
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,800
and Michael Sheen in it.

1393
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,680
Whoa, really?

1394
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,720
See, that's a pickup, my dude.

1395
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,920
You think that one's a pickup?

1396
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,800
Griffin, what do you think?

1397
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,720
Who cares, man?

1398
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,840
I don't really watch fucking TV anymore.

1399
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,560
Okay, well, it was a word of the series.

1400
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,760
Travis does it again.

1401
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,480
Travis, you have an incredible hit rate for this bit.

1402
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,960
I have to say, you are extremely good at this.

1403
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,640
This is what I should have done.

1404
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,040
I should have been somebody who just guessed

1405
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,040
at which TV shows get made.

1406
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,240
That's what you should have done.

1407
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,080
I'm the key demographic.

1408
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,200
I'm the person everybody seems to be making TV shows for.

1409
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,880
You're a 35-year-old white man,

1410
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,640
so yeah, you're explicitly that.

1411
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,360
Sounds about right.

1412
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,280
Folks, this has been our podcast

1413
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,960
with my brother and my brother and me.

1414
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,640
We're sorry it got weird at the end,

1415
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,040
but we enjoyed ourselves before that,

1416
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,080
and we hope you did too.

1417
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,000
And remember, as we say every week,

1418
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,240
you're welcome to turn it off whenever you want to

1419
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,400
and go do other stuff.

1420
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,440
It's fine.

1421
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,280
Sometimes the wheels are gonna fall off.

1422
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,880
Guys, we're just three brothers.

1423
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,440
You can always put some of the show into a doggie bag,

1424
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,120
take it home, put it in the refrigerator,

1425
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,720
swear you'll eat some more later,

1426
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,480
but then think, hold it's been sitting in there

1427
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,480
for like seven days, then throw it out.

1428
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,360
That's fine.

1429
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,200
We also, because we didn't want to give you

1430
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,720
a bunch of live episodes in a row,

1431
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,720
managed to record four of these bad boys

1432
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,840
in the course of a week,

1433
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,360
which was just poor planning on our part.

1434
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,240
We're sorry about that.

1435
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,440
We love you very much.

1436
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,160
Thanks to John.

1437
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,620
Fuck.

1438
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,040
Fuck me.

1439
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,480
John Roderick knows how I feel about him.

1440
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,280
Start over.

1441
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:03,840
Hi, everybody.

1442
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,280
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me.

1443
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,880
Thanks, Maxwell and Fun.

1444
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,320
All these great shows are there.

1445
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,240
Speaking of live shows,

1446
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,520
we've got some coming up in Indianapolis and Nashville

1447
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,880
in the middle of June.

1448
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,760
Go get your tickets.

1449
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,880
We have other ones too.

1450
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,800
You could get some in Atlanta.

1451
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,960
There's other, I think like the second half of the year

1452
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,160
is more or less sold out,

1453
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,560
but we've got our live shows.

1454
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,880
And also, when you're hearing this,

1455
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,120
the Adventure Zone book tour tickets will be on sale

1456
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,640
and might be sold out already.

1457
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,520
But you can go to McElroy.Family and click on tours

1458
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,720
and get those tickets.

1459
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,320
And you can also pre-order

1460
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,160

Don't miss it.

Be the first person in the world to ever see a comic book.

1466
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,320
Hey, thanks to John Roderick and Maxwell and Fun.

1467
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,120
I already did that.

1468
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,320
Juice, you got anything to keep?

1469
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,320
But hey, listen, folks, we have a bunch of merchandise

1470
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,400
you can go buy if you go to McElroyMerch.com

1471
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,040

1472
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,480
You can find links to merchandise

and new episodes of our web series,

1474
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,520
this one and a lot of others.

1475
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,800
I have a cereal podcast.

1476
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,240
It's for people with anxiety

1477
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,840
or people who just want to chill out.

1478
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,400
It's called The Empty Bowl and it's about cereal,

1479
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,000
but it's a meditative podcast about cereal.

1480
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,880
And if you want to check that out, it's on iTunes.

1481
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,080
I'll give that plug this week.

1482
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,480
That's my plug.

1483
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,520
You want the final Yahoo?

1484
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,960
Yes, please.

1485
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,200
Yeah.

1486
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,280
This one was sent in by a couple folks.

1487
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,040
Thanks, everybody who sent this in.

1488
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,200
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user I'm going to call.

1489
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,680
Nana asks,

1490
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,160
how many Whoppers can you eat?

1491
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,040
My name is Justin McElroy.

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,200

1499
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,760
Have you ever watched a movie so bad

1500
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,920
you just needed to talk to somebody about it?

1501
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,280
Well, here at the Flophouse,

1502
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,600
we watch a bad movie and then talk about it.

1503
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,040
Yeah, you don't have to do anything.

1504
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,720
We'll watch it and we'll talk it.

1505
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,840
We do the hard work.

Bye bye.
