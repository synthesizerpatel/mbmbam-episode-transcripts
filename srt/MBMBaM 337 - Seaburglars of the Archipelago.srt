1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello everybody, and welcome back to the jungle of 2017. My brother and me is the podcast,

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,200
and I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. And I am the brother that is in the middle,

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,160
Travis Patrick McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother,

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,800
30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Gonna try to get that in every episode,

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,360
just get it in real fast. Work on your brand.

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,520
Practice saying it real fast so it's not a big distraction, 30 under 30 media luminary.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,800
So, it's 20 Serpentine, y'all. We're zagging left and right.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,680
Well, no, but- We are zag nuts over here.

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,720
I mean, you can't zag left and right. We are zagging either left or right,

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,520
and then the other direction that would technically be a zig.

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,840
Incorrect. Incorrect.

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,280
Okay. Okay, I see what you're saying. And like, you're getting to the root of it, I think.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,680
Yeah.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
We're close there. There's something to what you're saying, because one would be a zig.

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
But like, I wasn't thinking in sequence, but I guess once you started in a line,

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,680
all lefts are zigs, all rights are zags.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,840
But you can't zag every time, because then you're not zagging. You know what I mean?

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,800
If you zag, zag, zag, zag, zag, that's nothing. You got to zag, zag, zag, zig. What?

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,040
What? What?

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,000
Where'd that zig come from?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
Oh my god, Travis, are you suggesting that this week, we zig on them?

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
Maybe we zig, Griffin.

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,680
All right. I do want to say that at this point, I have mostly purged my Facebook friends and

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,040
Twitter followers and LinkedIn connections and friendster friendos of all non-30 under 30 media

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,680
luminaries. But you two have made the cut. You're some of the, we call you standards,

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,400
or we call you non-30s. You two are some of the only non-30s that I have on my list.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,400
And following you two on social, it's not as enlightening as the other stuff is,

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,840
but I noticed that you've been doing some mad zagging just in this one week where you've been

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
trying this bold new experiment.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,880
Well, we do have to congratulate, I think, the zag of the week, I think, has to go to Forbes,

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,680
honestly. Like, you don't zag much harder than naming Griffin one of the 30 people under 30

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,560
in media on a list. I was like, is it like best or most? Is it most?

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:17,760
Most would make sense. Best, I vore Nintendo toys professionally, so I'm not sure how I can go

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,440
up against a Jesse Eisenberg, who would also be considered for media, I think,

39
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,640
or a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has his own media company.

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
He's not, wait, he's not 30?

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
No, definitely not. That dude's like 22 years old.

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
Damn.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
Thank you, Forbes, for the honor. You zagged all of us pretty hard.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
Joseph Gordon-Levitt's 35 years old. Thank God.

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,520
Don't do this. Oh, thank God.

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,480
Shit, we don't Facebook. Keep it.

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,440
Thank Jesus.

48
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,160
Travis, your zag, you have, so what I like about you, Travis, is you're working on a zag now,

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,040
and you've also got a prospective zag in the future that you want to chase down.

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,800
I have four zags.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Oh my God.

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,200
I have major zags and minor zags that I have charted throughout the year,

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,560
and then I'll probably just surprise myself, zag on myself,

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
and do stuff that's not in there.

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,680
Right now, working on electric guitar.

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah, so you started, you've never played an acoustic, right?

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Correct.

58
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,960
That's where most folks get their, okay.

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
Because, because, because.

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
You want to shred.

61
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,680
I want to shred.

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,880
Every time I've ever picked up an instrument ever, if I was not immediately magically good at it,

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,840
I then set it down, and it has been dead to me.

64
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,160
Okay.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,320
And, and I sat down with my new electric guitar for an hour the other day, like yesterday,

66
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,240
just practicing moving my fingers up and down the frets.

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
Like, that was it, for an hour.

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm committed to becoming good at this long term,

69
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,920
and not just like, I'm going to learn to play three chords and call it a day.

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,520
Like, I'm going to fucking shred.

71
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
This year.

73
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm going to learn three chords and call it a day has been working for me on guitar for 15 years.

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,440
Well, don't knock it till you tried it, buddy.

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,480
Also, I do very much enjoy the rationale of the electric guitar, which is to say,

76
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,600
I don't know how to play this, but I do wish it was louder.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,080
Yeah.

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,760
I do wish I could hear better what I was doing so poorly.

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,560
And my neighbor, I would love my neighbors to know I'm, I'm just starting out something over here.

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,680
This isn't anything.

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Everyone's got to check this out.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
My baby's going to love this.

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,840
Oh, yeah.

84
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,000
What did you tell me?

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
Run down those other zags though, Trav.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
Oh, I don't know how much I want to give away.

87
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
I'll do some minor zags.

88
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,800
I've decided to get really into dips.

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm going to make, I'm going to master guacamole salsa.

90
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
Okay, well, that's not, that's not.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,840
Okay.

92
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
I'm also going to get a sleeve tattoo.

93
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah, that'll zag me pretty good.

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,080
Yes.

95
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,320
Yeah.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,400
Because I was looking, Travis, I was looking over here.

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,920
There you are over here, over here on the other side.

98
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,800
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

99
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
You're thinking, oh, guacamole.

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
Yeah, guacamole.

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,080
Tattoos.

102
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,440
Can you get tattoos of just a big glistening bowl of guaco?

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,480
Perhaps.

104
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,080
I mean, I can.

105
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,320
I don't know if I will.

106
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm done with your zags.

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Justin, your zag surprised me very much, but I'm very excited by it.

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,560
Can you tell-

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
Yeah, I took a taekwondo class on Wednesday.

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
Got some gi and everything.

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
Two classes, one gi, $30.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,680
Walk me through.

113
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
Is this going to be a continuing thing or did you just do one and done it?

114
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh, no, I'm headed for mastery is where I asked them to put me on the mastery track.

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,040
Yeah.

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,520
It's the one thing that they said that was attainable.

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
Two important questions.

118
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
One, tell me everything that happened in the class.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,240
Okay.

120
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,440
And number two, because maybe you want to start with number two is why did you choose

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,840
this particular discipline of all of the martial arts sort of specializations?

122
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,320
Well, I researched them all very much.

123
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,600
And the one that was five minutes from my house was taekwondo.

124
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,960
That's how Bruce Lee did his thing.

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
Yeah, that's how Bruce Lee got started.

126
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,480
When I arrived, I said, this is fun.

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,760
They told me I should show up and observe a class.

128
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
And when I showed up, I said, you know, I was interested in maybe taking a class.

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,040
And the lady like disappeared behind the counter and came back with a gi.

130
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,200
And I was like, oh, apparently I'm just taking a taekwondo class today.

131
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,440
This is not what I had anticipated.

132
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,520
And I had just written a strenuous 20 minutes on the stationary bike.

133
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,760
But right before I was not in any sort of headspace to start learning taekwondo.

134
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,400
The other thing that surprised me about the taekwondo class.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Probably the biggest surprise.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
Is this how early I started punching?

137
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,080
Like when I was instructed to punch, I kind of looked around like, I don't know how to punch.

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
I certainly didn't.

139
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,600
You don't think they're going to let you punch day one, right?

140
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,480
No, they didn't say that.

141
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,840
Yeah, you don't show up to med school day one and they're like, all right, cut this dude.

142
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,320
What?

143
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,760
Cut this dude right now.

144
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,280
Wait, so what do they dangle in front of you if they let you punch day one?

145
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,840
You know what I mean?

146
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
What's the cliffhanger that brings you back for day two?

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,560
I guess punching in a way that would have any sort of effect on anything on earth would be good.

148
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,920
I see, punching with purpose.

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,080
So important taekwondo question.

150
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,880
Yeah.

151
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
Keep in mind, I've had one class go on.

152
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,760
Has it got belts?

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah, it's got belts.

154
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm headed.

155
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,400
I feel like, okay, so here's, this is my actual like thing.

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,560
I know that a black belt would take a very long time, right?

157
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,280
So I've sort of ruled that out.

158
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,840
That's probably not in my future, but I feel like if I get any color belt, most people don't know

159
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,600
the order in which the belts come, right?

160
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,680
So if I attain a yellow belt and I can tell people like, oh yeah, I'm a yellow belt in taekwondo.

161
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
They're not going to know if that's impressive or not.

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
That's number two.

163
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
That's like the second one.

164
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,440
Well, you know that and I know that now after my one taekwondo class.

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,640
But yeah, it was, it was, it was actually, you know, here's the surprising thing.

166
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
It was very hard.

167
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,680
What would the physicality of punching and kicking for an hour?

168
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
That was not great.

169
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
That part was a little hard for me.

170
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,040
I've been, I've been trying to think of my own Zag I can do.

171
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
Cause you guys are setting a pretty like bonkers precedent over there.

172
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,640
And just by saying this, I'm ruining my, this Zag and I definitely won't be able to do it after

173
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,200
I say it, but how great would it be if my Zag was like, okay, I'm going to do this.

174
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,960
My Zag was that I also took taekwondo classes without telling you guys.

175
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,320
And then at our next live show, Justin and I had to fight each other.

176
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
While I, while I accompanied you on electric guitar.

177
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,160
Oh man.

178
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,720
That's a good, that's a good look in that shit.

179
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Damn it.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,520
Maybe I'll edit this out of the podcast.

181
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,080
Justin and I will just like, well, I don't edit the podcast.

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
Well, no, it's too late.

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,480
Everybody knows now that Justin and I are martial arts enemies.

184
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,520
Well, we're, we're the masters of rival dojos.

185
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:01,920
Damn it.

186
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,360
The, the idea that I would actually come in contact with another person with punches and

187
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,760
kicking while doing taekwondo, while doing my taekwondo art, uh, occurred to me about

188
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,960
15 seconds ago when you said that I had not even prepared myself for the eventuality that

189
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,640
I would someday meet another person who I had to be good, better at punching and kicking than.

190
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,080
Or else you will be punished with, with, with physical harm.

191
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,000
Or they steal my belt, don't they?

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,640
Yeah, that's it.

193
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,760
That's it.

194
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,400
Steal my belt.

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,440
There's only like five black belts around, going around and they sort of cycle, you know?

196
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,400
They sort of cycle in and out.

197
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,520
You gotta beat, you gotta beat a black belt in order to take them down.

198
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,160
Or if you have like a fancy, you know, black tie affair, like a wedding or something coming

199
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,280
up, you can, you can ask them to borrow it because you don't want to clash.

200
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,200
Um, I don't know what to zag as.

201
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,280
I'm taking, I'm taking zag suggestions.

202
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
You can't think about it too much as the thing.

203
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,720
I have.

204
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,760
I, I drove past that place and I didn't even plan to take a taekwondo class.

205
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
The zag came to me.

206
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah.

207
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,280
I think if you're open to the zag, it'll, it'll come to you.

208
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,800
Um, I did want to, uh, give a, uh, and maybe we'll do a few of these regularly.

209
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,760
Uh, 2017 is the year we're zagging on them.

210
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,080
They think we're going to zag, we zag.

211
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,680
Yeah, zag watch, zag watch.

212
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,840
Yeah, quick zag watch.

213
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,520
I want to give a shout out to, uh, uh, Hallie, um, from, or perhaps Haley.

214
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,600
It's, it's, it's hard to say, uh, uh, on in the Facebook group who has no black

215
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,760
blacksmithing experience, but has decided that, uh, they're going to make several

216
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,240
swords and attempt to sell them at the Bristol Renaissance Fair in Wisconsin, uh,

217
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,880
Wisconsin.

218
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,800
And just to prove it, there's a video of them just like making a sword on what

219
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
appears to be a grill.

220
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,520
Maybe it's, well, listen, I will buy that sword.

221
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,760
I will buy a sword from you.

222
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,080
Yeah.

223
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,600
Um, get in contact, tweet at me and let me know how I can pay you to commission.

224
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
So I'm going to say, I'm going to commission your 10th sword.

225
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
I do not want your first one.

226
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
Nobody wants your first.

227
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,920
Fuck that.

228
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,520
I'll take the first one and then I'll frame it.

229
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,040
And then in 20 years when you're a master blacksmith, I'll hand it back to you.

230
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,640
Fucking Bartlett for America style.

231
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,160
Um, that's a good, that's a damn, that's a good zag.

232
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,720
Wow.

233
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,040
Great zag.

234
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
It's a really good zag.

235
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,280
Let's go, Griffin.

236
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,320
I have an idea for you.

237
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
Let me take your zag to you.

238
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:29,920
Okay.

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,120
Keep in mind that I have like two hours of free time a week.

240
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,680
Yeah.

241
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,280
You should start raising chickens.

242
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,040
Ooh, that would be, well, my cat Defo murdered them.

243
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,280
Defo.

244
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,880
You put them in a thing.

245
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
No, he'll, he'll break in like, um, it'll, it'll be bad.

246
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,600
It'll be bad.

247
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,920
Okay.

248
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
Ostriches.

249
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
Now we're, now we're cooking with gas.

250
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,240
But it's bad gas and it's bad food that we're cooking, but we are, it is being cooked.

251
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,640
I think we should do some questions since we did negative one last episode.

252
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
Uh, yeah, let's get into it.

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,360
Um, let me decide upfront though, just so people are waiting on it or not.

254
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,320
Um, do we want to update the Fushigi Arts patronage or no?

255
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
I haven't seen, I haven't seen anything that really blew my, I blew, blew my, you know,

256
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
I saw lots of people buying them.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Um, but I haven't, I haven't really seen, we can't just give it out to everybody.

258
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,920
It's not some, these millennials and their participation trophies is just not going to

259
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,880
happen with this one.

260
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,960
I need to see that fucking, I, it doesn't have to be the best Fushigi I've ever seen,

261
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,520
but I do need to see that fucking spark of life.

262
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,480
I do want to compliment Will Far is the first Fushigi Art video that I've seen on our, uh,

263
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,280
Facebook page.

264
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,520
Okay.

265
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:39,760
Yeah.

266
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
But Will, the music that it's actually set to.

267
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,240
Okay.

268
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,520
But Will, guess what?

269
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,960
There was a drop in the video.

270
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,080
So like, I got to see that spark.

271
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,400
I saw at least one drop in Will's video.

272
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,240
And if I, if I see a drop, that just shows me that there's the sparks just not there

273
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,480
yet.

274
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,720
Will.

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
I'm just adding him to the Fushigi Arts patronage list.

276
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,120
If you make your own Fushigi Art, it has to be bespoke for us exclusively.

277
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,920
And you can put it on our Facebook page, hashtag Fushigi Art or on Twitter hashtag Fushigi Art,

278
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,040
but do include the hashtag Fushigi Art, or else we'll might, we won't be able to annex

279
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,680
it and find it.

280
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,480
God, this is the dumbest thing we've ever done.

281
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,840
It's dumb.

282
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,480
We're giving away $500, um, in chunks.

283
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,000
Someone offered, emailed us to offer to donate more money to the Fushigi Art space patronage.

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,840
And I had this moment.

285
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,120
I had two moments.

286
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,120
The first one was, hell yes, let's build this up.

287
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,920
And then my other one was, oh no, this would snowball very quickly.

288
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,320
Yeah.

289
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,120
I cannot be, I have two full-time jobs.

290
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,880
I cannot be, oversee the world's largest Fushigi Art.

291
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,160
After a certain monetary amount, we would reach the point where anytime anything bad

292
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,560
happened to anyone else in the world, we would feel pretty weird about how we've sort of

293
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,040
channeled our philanthropy, uh, in this one very specific, very useless avenue.

294
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,520
Yeah.

295
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:05,920
All right.

296
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,280
So we did no questions last week.

297
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:14,320
So we're going to actually do some this week on our podcast of questions.

298
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,520
I just received a robe as a Christmas gift and my God, how have I been living without

299
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:19,920
one?

300
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,840
It feels like a blanket is hugging you.

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,880
Needless to say, I haven't gotten dressed today.

302
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,200
Is that needless to say?

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,920
However, I have a couple of friends coming by to hang out, watch a movie in a short while.

304
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
My inclination is to put on real clothes, but then I thought maybe this is fine.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
First, is it my place there?

306
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,120
It's my place they're coming to.

307
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,280
It's not like a walk in someone's house and pajamas.

308
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,760
Secondly, this is very much a let's watch a movie and chill and not let's have a serious

309
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,560
conversation about life.

310
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,680
Hang out third.

311
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,800
Maybe I zig when they expect me to zag.

312
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,120
Anyhow, I'll definitely have gone for it by the time you even see this email, but maybe

313
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,600
you'll be able to vibe me for future situations like this pajama party in Portland.

314
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,280
Yo, um, so many variables.

315
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,400
Variables, huh?

316
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,240
Because you're wearing pants under that bad boy, right?

317
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,400
Because if not, you can't entertain folks.

318
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,000
It doesn't seem like that's good to have that happen to them.

319
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,200
It's very robe dependent, isn't it?

320
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,560
I mean, I feel like if you show up in a...

321
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay.

322
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,080
If I show up to a party and the host is wearing a silken robe, perhaps one that's heavily

323
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,760
ornamented with some sorts of with embroidery, perhaps.

324
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,040
Like a half there.

325
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
Like a full half.

326
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,440
Like a half kind of vibe, but like cool.

327
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,120
So like if they did that, I think I would feel like this is going to pop off.

328
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,680
Like this is going to be ribald to the max.

329
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,080
I don't know that I would feel that way if it was like just like Garfield popping up

330
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,040
from a pocket.

331
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
It's like, I hate Monday, so I'm staying in my robe.

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,680
And the robe was like had like lots of knits on it.

333
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,400
Oh, shit.

334
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,080
Mustard stains covered in Cheetos.

335
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,040
Just lasagna stains on it to continue the Garfield sort of metaphor.

336
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,400
And also it would have like a big streak of Odie's shit.

337
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,000
It's just despicable.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
Yeah, it's just soaked in John's tears.

339
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,040
It's robe dependent, I think.

340
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,200
Well, I think the problem is you run the risk of your friends showing up and you giving

341
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,920
off the vibe of like, I don't want you here.

342
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,120
I wish you weren't here.

343
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,520
Yeah, exactly.

344
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,320
I'd rather just be laying around in my robe like you're really imposing.

345
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,720
You want one that says, welcome to my boudoir.

346
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,520
Like that's what you want.

347
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
No, I don't think you want.

348
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,040
No.

349
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,960
Maybe in bright flashing letters.

350
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,280
What the fuck is both of you talking about?

351
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
Justin, especially.

352
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,400
This was my main red flag that went up when this question was asked, which is like, you

353
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,440
don't want your friends to think you're trying to get them down into the fucking grotto to

354
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,600
like get to get weird on them.

355
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,880
Especially when you use the phrase, watch a movie and chill.

356
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
There are connotations to that these days.

357
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,560
Yeah, for some reason, the millennials have taken that from us and now it means to have

358
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,840
do sex stuff while Orange is the New Black plays in the background.

359
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,560
Not sex.

360
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,080
It doesn't have to be sex stuff.

361
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
You just said the boudoir.

362
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
What the fuck else does that mean?

363
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
I meant to say bungalow.

364
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
That's the problem.

365
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,680
Welcome to my bungalow.

366
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,760
Now we're getting somewhere.

367
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
Now we're on habitation.

368
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,560
Habitation, I think what I'm saying is, I don't think like sex stuff.

369
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,320
I feel like if I show up in the hostess in a robe and they have like nice slippers, like,

370
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,960
you know what I mean?

371
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
Like nice.

372
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Then it's the kind of party where maybe some sorts of drugs that I would have no way of

373
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,240
procuring otherwise might be exchanged and they'd be like in a T and it would be like

374
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
so chill, you know, like it's that kind of scene.

375
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,000
When was the last time you went to somebody else's house, Justin, that was not related?

376
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,160
It's been a minute, huh?

377
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,760
It's been a minute.

378
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,040
Here's my advice.

379
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:16,320
I would say that this is perfectly acceptable on the condition that ahead of time you make

380
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,320
these plans with your friends like, hey, let's have a super chill day where we all like just

381
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,280
hang out in pajamas and robes and like just like watch cartoons or whatever.

382
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,720
Because I think that that's fine.

383
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
But if they show up and they're like dressed, you know, like they're going out and hanging

384
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,640
out and doing an event and they show up in urine pajamas and robe, then it's weird.

385
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,920
But if everybody's having like a Saturday morning cartoon hangout, like let's just be

386
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,160
chill, maybe naps will happen and we won't have to like end the party just because I

387
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,280
want to take a nap.

388
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,920
That's fine.

389
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,720
You just have to establish that vibe beforehand.

390
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,000
You also got to be careful what you're signaling, not to other people, but to yourself, right?

391
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,760
Like if you put on a robe, part of the reason that feels so luxurious is the supposition

392
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,840
that you now can't do anything.

393
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,480
Like nothing can be expected of me.

394
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
I'm wearing this robe.

395
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,560
Like the world's got to take a backseat.

396
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,400
If you start wearing a robe and then going about your day to day, one, you're going to

397
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,320
lose the power of that connotation.

398
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,520
You're going to think like, oh, I'm wearing a robe.

399
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,960
This is what I do my taxes in.

400
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
Like that's not going to be luxurious or pleasant for you at all.

401
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,040
You're going to need an assortment of robes.

402
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,800
You're going to need your tax robe, your laying around robe, your time to make the donuts robe.

403
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,040
So you're suggesting that this person do it sort of in the Japanese style with a formal

404
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,120
kimono and a semi-formal kimono and then one that you wear to funerals.

405
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:47,920
Yep.

406
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,680
That's exactly what I'm saying.

407
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,040
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

408
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,800
I can't podcast in sweatpants.

409
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,000
What?

410
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,480
I can't podcast in sweatpants.

411
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,720
I think it's sweatpants is robe adjacent.

412
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,920
I can't podcast.

413
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,000
If you've ever heard me on a podcast, like 99.9% of the time, almost without fail.

414
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,440
Just pants?

415
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,760
Unless my jeans were in the wash, I cannot podcast or do any work in sweatpants.

416
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,720
It's always jeans.

417
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,800
Wearing jeans right now, always jeans.

418
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,680
Can't do it in sweatpants.

419
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,160
That's insane.

420
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,240
My body can't make the connection.

421
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,720
You took that.

422
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,080
You're on that Elizabeth Gilbert tip.

423
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,720
She came to our podcast and told us not to wear sweatpants when we podcast.

424
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,000
And Elizabeth, I'm very sorry.

425
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,600
You are a bastion of great advice, but it's 10 44 AM and I need to do me.

426
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
I need to do me, Elizabeth.

427
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,240
I work out of my home.

428
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,360
I have to keep the lines clear.

429
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,960
I have to make those lines clear.

430
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,920
I can't do it.

431
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,960
And I think a robe might be kind of the same thing.

432
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,280
I don't know.

433
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,240
It's definitely the same thing.

434
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,640
This person is a blanket that you wear.

435
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
That is not work time stuff.

436
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
That's not socialization time for sure.

437
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,600
You don't want.

438
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,360
But what I'm saying is if it is a robe hangout, if that's the event you're like,

439
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
I did this with my friends on Christmas.

440
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,280
Like come over.

441
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,120
We're going to watch Christmas movies and hang out in our pajamas and eat Christmas cookies.

442
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Like cool, but not like a, hey, every time we hang out from now on, get used to this robe.

443
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
Cause you'll always be seeing it forever.

444
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,240
This is me now.

445
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,160
Here's a good measuring stick.

446
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,600
Imagine you open the door in a t-shirt and jeans and then at about an hour in you leave

447
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,320
the room and return in a robe.

448
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
Try to think about the signal that would send because I think that might make it a little

449
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,880
clearer, right?

450
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,240
Like if I said, somebody does that to me, I think, oh, I should, we should go.

451
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,520
This is very passive aggressive, but you, you want us to go.

452
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,160
We should go now.

453
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,560
Um, can I do the Yahoo?

454
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,840
Yes.

455
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,200
It was sent in by Jeffrey Corbello.

456
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,760
Thank you, Jeffrey.

457
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Wilma.

458
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,600
And I just want to give another shout out to the fucking Yahoo ad department because

459
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,840
it's not telling me Melissa McCarthy's dead this time.

460
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,800
Thank you.

461
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
It's an advertisement for spam.

462
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,440
And what I'm seeing here boys is just the sweatiest looking bowl of macaroni and cheese

463
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,920
that, uh, has ever been devised on God's green earth.

464
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,200
And there are just these sort of desperate islands of spam floating around in this bowl

465
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,760
and it is maybe the gnarliest thing I've ever seen.

466
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,200
And it also says save $1 on the advertisement and like how much could this possibly cost

467
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,760
me?

468
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't want to get all prices righty on me here, but damn, this is a gnarly looking

469
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,680
bowl of food stuff that you have shown me.

470
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,240
It's just a visually challenging website every time I visit it now and I can't wait

471
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,520
for it to die.

472
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,680
Speaking of spam, I just have to say this real quick.

473
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,280
I got an email about a voice changer with effects app that is spam.

474
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,960
And the icon of this fake account is Guy Fieri pointing at me directly.

475
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,720
And the subject line of the spam email is, all caps, this is spam.

476
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,440
Don't judge.

477
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,240
All right.

478
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,760
That's a new game.

479
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,320
Zag.

480
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
I clicked through.

481
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,960
You got me on that one.

482
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,920
That's quite a zag.

483
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,520
Oh, I thought of a zag I did this week.

484
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,480
I didn't even bring up.

485
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,720
I watched Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on demand.

486
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,280
It wasn't just on and I just had the TV on.

487
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,520
I sought out the triple D.

488
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,640
You pouted your fist on your sweaty, cheese dust coated fist on the table and said, I

489
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
demand to watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.

490
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,040
It was 3.30 in the morning.

491
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,360
I got on Kayak.com and bought a fucking one-way ticket to Flavortown.

492
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,800
Did you actually do this at 3.30 in the morning?

493
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,440
Yeah.

494
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,480
That's when Henry likes to party with his Uncle Guy.

495
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,080
All right.

496
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,440
It's so cute.

497
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,760
He pulls his sunglasses off his head, but then they just snap directly back on that

498
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,560
cool strap.

499
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Wilma asks, need, oh, and this is in Yahoo!

500
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,480
Products, Yahoo! Mail, sending and receiving messages.

501
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
So I think it's time we give back to the community.

502
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Wilma asks, need email that I sent to Gary Spangler.

503
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,280
Need email that I sent to Gary Spangler.

504
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,680
We never do like IT, you know, technology advice here.

505
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,440
Wilma has sent a delicate email to Gary Spangler and we all do this in the heat of passion.

506
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,360
We click that send button and we think, oh, gosh, I shouldn't have clicked that send button

507
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
on this Yahoo! Mail service I use.

508
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,080
How do we get this email?

509
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,120
Is it F-P-A-N-G-L-E-R?

510
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,720
Are you trying to look him up and like, what are you doing?

512
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,920
Like a social hacking where you call him and ask him to delete all his emails?

513
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,960
Don't you worry about it.

514
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,240
Oh, Jesus.

515
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,280
No, I'm worried about it.

516
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,520
Well, okay.

517
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
There's a Gary Spangler.

518
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, God, Trav, this is getting, I don't want to do anything to Gary Spangler.

519
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,840
Well, no, but I want to make sure that we are not talking about like an actual person

520
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,480
that might, this might get worse.

521
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,800
You said a full name, Griffin.

522
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,840
You just said a first and last name in this Yahoo! answer.

523
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,080
So what?

524
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,520
There's lots of Gary Spanglers.

525
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,720
We didn't say like Gary Spangler from the Bronx.

526
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,560
Well, this is what's interesting to me, Griffin.

527
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:25,520
When I Google that name, the first 10 responses are like all the same dude.

528
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,720
Oh, maybe it's Gary Spangler then.

529
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,480
So say we said-

530
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
Spangler with an E or Spangler with an A?

531
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,240
A, Spangler with an A.

532
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,480
So say we sent him a delicate email and we are an old person and we just need that email

533
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,520
back very much because there was stuff in there that, in vino veritas, you know, sipping

534
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:56,240
those mai tais and we got some of that liquid courage and so we sent an email to Gary Spangler,

535
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
but we shouldn't have sent the Spangler missive.

536
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,680
How do I retrieve it through Yahoo!'s mail service?

537
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:13,280
I think if you just email him again with the subject line undo, I think it just does it.

538
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,040
Oh, you have to type the whole email backwards and then send it to him and that will erase it.

539
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,880
You're saying an anti-email.

540
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,080
Fascinating stuff.

541
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,520
I also think you can just respond,

542
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,200
Hey, Gary, sorry about that.

543
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,560
My kid was on the computer.

544
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,400
Have no idea what they sent you.

545
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,680
Anyways, hit me back.

546
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,080
Love, Wilma.

547
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,120
Love, Wilma.

548
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,560
That wasn't me again.

549
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,240
I would never say that to you, Gary.

550
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
I hate you.

551
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
He can't put that genie back to the bottom.

552
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,360
I mean, sending an opposite email that deletes the other email is not a thing,

553
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,040
but if you send them another email with the exact opposite sentiment,

554
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,440
you zagged on them and they're not going to know which sentiment is the real sentiment.

555
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,760
God, I wish I hadn't sent that fucking email to Gary Spangler.

556
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,560
He won't forgive.

557
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,160
He won't forget he's Gary Spangler.

558
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,480
He's Gary Spangler and his alarm is strong.

559
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,600
He can hold both emails in his mind at one time

560
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,680
and know that I both love him and hate him.

561
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,120
Damn you, Gary Spangler.

562
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,120
Damn your strong alarm.

563
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,320
How do I get this fucking email back from Gary Spangler?

564
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,440
You guys aren't helping me at all.

565
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
You can't, Griffin, you can't.

566
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,040
So what you need to do,

567
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,080
you have to bury it in the avalanche of other emails.

568
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,040
Oh my God.

569
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,400
Okay. You just have to start like sending just constant email,

570
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,640
cut and paste passages from Shakespeare.

571
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,120
You know what I mean?

572
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,760
Just send him content after content

573
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,000
until eventually that one email doesn't even register to Gary Spangler

574
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,520
because he's received thousands of emails from you.

575
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,360
Gary Spangler's staying at a nice hotel

576
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,080
and there's something going on in the ballroom,

577
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,680
some sort of conference he doesn't really understand.

578
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,720
So he pokes his head in and says,

579
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,240
hi everybody, my name's Gary Spangler

580
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,280
and I'm just wondering what you're...

581
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,680
And everybody in the room goes like, what?

582
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,440
You're the Gary Spangler?

583
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,480
Because the conference is for porn bot developers

584
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,680
and this man has been made famous through his minis.

585
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,720
Dude, you put my kids through college.

586
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,840
Thank you, Gary Spangler.

587
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,080
What was in this fucking email to Gary Spangler though?

588
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,320
Because now this Wilma's got like eyewitnesses now.

589
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,800
Like now she's got a paper trail

590
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,240
leading back to Gary Spangler.

591
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Oh yeah, and she's claimed the crime too.

592
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,240
You can't erase this from Yahoo.

593
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
Forget how do you get it back from Yahoo Mail,

594
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,280
how do you get it back from Yahoo Answers?

595
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,080
Yeah.

596
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
Gary Spangler, okay, Gary Spangler is gonna Google himself.

597
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,200
Yeah, definitely.

598
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,240
Gary Spangler's gonna Google himself.

599
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,440
He's gonna see this Wilma.

600
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,080
And then he's gonna come to you.

601
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
What was that email, Wilma?

602
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
I couldn't find it because my email box,

603
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
the inbox is just a blighted wasteland of pornography.

604
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,240
That's how I say that.

605
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,720
You burned my email from the inside out, Wilma.

606
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,800
It's poison inside, it's toxic inside of there, Wilma.

607
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,960
No one ever goes in, no one ever comes out.

608
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
I had e-business to do on there.

609
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,640
Just kidding, we're both 96.

610
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
It's too bad, Wilma, I've always loved you.

611
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,280
I thought maybe you felt the same.

612
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,680
Maybe if I'd gotten an email from you

613
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,240
that had not been retrieved or buried in pornography.

614
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,760
Damn it.

615
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,560
Damn it, damn it, Wilma, I'm Gary Spangler.

616
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
Nobody treats me this way.

617
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,800
I feel like you guys aren't into Gary Spangler

618
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,000
as much as I am.

619
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,760
You've built a rich mythology in your head

620
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,680
that I'm trying desperately to access.

621
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,720
Oh, just jump on the fucking Spang train, baby.

622
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,480
There's room for all of us on here.

623
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,720
We can put all our hopes and dreams into Gary Spangler.

624
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,720
I mean, I believe in him.

625
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,240
That's not the question, right?

626
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,400
Like I believe in Gary Spangler.

627
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,040
The question is, does Gary Spangler believe in me?

628
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,320
Damn it.

629
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,760
Here's another question for you guys, my brothers.

630
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,240
I was recently on a long road trip

631
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,080
and about halfway through I passed a driver

632
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,800
whose car's fuel door was open.

633
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,880
I wanted to figure out some way to let the driver know

634
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
without freaking them out and making them think

635
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
there was some worse problem with their car,

636
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,280
but I failed to do so before I was out of sight.

637
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,640
What's the best way to quickly let a filler driver know

638
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,280
about a small problem with their car?

639
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,880
Oh, a filler driver.

640
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,800
A filler driver.

641
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah, I don't know about a small problem with your car

642
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,920
without freaking them out.

643
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,800
Thanks for your help.

644
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,960
Terrible Southern driver.

645
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
See, I sense the Southern coming.

646
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,200
Yeah.

647
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
I try to inject it.

648
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,640
Damn, we gotta all get down on trucker life.

649
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm in my Volkswagen Golf.

650
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,000
I wanna get a CB radio and we all need one, don't we?

651
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
Just for situations like these.

652
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,960
This is no joke.

653
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,200
One time I saw that I was,

654
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,040
this is when I worked at a place in Charleston

655
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,240
and I was driving back and forth

656
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,480
between Huntington and Charleston every day.

657
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
And I saw a car with their fuel door open

658
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,000
and the gas cap fluttering in the wind.

659
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,000
So I called dad at the radio station and said,

660
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,320
hey dad, could you announce on the radio

661
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,160
that if someone's driving to Charleston

662
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,600
in this makeup car, color of car,

663
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,480
that they're casting.

664
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,440
This license plate.

665
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
And this motherfucker did it.

666
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,720
Dad did that.

667
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,120
Dad.

668
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,880
That's inappropriate use.

669
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,400
That's narrow casting.

670
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,640
It's a violation of FCC law.

671
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,360
That's no good.

672
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,960
So if you see this, just call my dad

673
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,640
and tell him to announce it on the radio.

674
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,440
That's what I did.

675
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,920
As far as I see it, there are two options.

676
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,000
One, you do a fucking sick ass transporter style.

677
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,800
Oh, you can press a button to pop up in your own fuel door

678
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,280
and then you spin your car 180 degrees

679
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,880
and drive side by side with them

680
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,720
and high five them so that they push each other

681
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
back into place.

682
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,200
That's one option.

683
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,400
It's tough to do.

684
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,040
The other option is we all just start rocking CB radios

685
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
because you know on Star Trek,

686
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,200
whenever they see another ship, then they hail them.

687
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,960
I want to do that from my golf to somebody's Jetta.

688
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,800
It's Griffin in the golf.

689
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,640
You ever think there's a moment in Star Trek

690
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,000
where they hail another ship

691
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,280
and the other ship is surprised

692
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,040
that their ship could do that?

693
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,400
Like, what is that?

694
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,760
What's that beeping?

695
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,320
That's crazy.

696
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,280
Someone investigate that.

697
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,120
Like, we've been in space.

698
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,520
We haven't seen another ship for like 10 years.

699
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,560
Yeah, that's crazy.

700
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,040
Space.

701
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,240
I have definitely, Griffin, had the exact thought

702
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,920
on like not as a joke,

703
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
the exact thought you're describing of like,

704
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,320
you know what?

705
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
I'm on this lonesome road with these other cars.

706
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
I wish I could just like hail the car

707
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,160
and just like see what's going on.

708
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,760
And then I realized like, I don't do that in life.

709
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,440
This car you call a body.

710
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,600
Exactly.

711
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,720
In my body car that I'm driving with my spirit,

712
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,320
I don't like do that.

713
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,760
Like, I could do that.

714
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,680
Like, I could hail someone at Starbucks

715
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,040
and just say like,

716
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,400
hey, you know what?

717
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,480
We're both at Starbucks was your story.

718
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,200
I don't do that.

719
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,640
But for some reason, if I can like do a Huey

720
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,840
and slam on the brakes

721
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,320
and put them into the Eververse,

722
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,080
I can no longer see or hear them.

723
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
Pick this body up at an old junkyard.

724
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,240
She's not the fastest ship in the verse,

725
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,160
but she gets the job done.

726
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,680
There's a lot of love at this hull.

727
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,800
It would be fun to also be able to shut down hailing frequency.

728
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,280
That's the move that I really do want to be able to do,

729
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,200
to be able to open hailing channels,

730
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,760
to be able to discuss with them how things are going.

731
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,960
And then when things go rogue,

732
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,600
just like close frequencies.

733
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,120
Ray Shields.

734
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,680
Ray Shields calms down.

735
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,800
Divert calm power to Shields.

736
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,240
Fire across their bow.

737
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,120
Divert calm power to Shields

738
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,480
and then you just start honking.

739
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,800
What?

740
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,080
Those are my Shields.

741
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,800
Those are my Shields.

742
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,280
Great job.

743
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,640
Great job.

744
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,880
We would need it.

745
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,840
You can't use the great job horn for this.

746
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,720
I mean, we would need a...

747
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,480
What do we have?

748
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,240
We have the great job horn.

749
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,000
We have the fuck you horn.

750
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,880
And then we have the...

751
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,040
We just have the general alert horn.

752
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,960
And this is another problem

753
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,440
that would be fixed by this trihorn system

754
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,800
where if you heard the alert horn,

755
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
you would check your fucking car out for all of it

756
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,320
and you would see...

757
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
You don't need a horn that's like your gas door is open.

758
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,080
You just need the alert horn.

759
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,680
And if you get tagged with that,

760
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,200
you know to check your shit out.

761
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,720
Pull over and check your shit out

762
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,760
because there's something wrong.

763
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,680
God, Honda, get at me.

764
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,560
Volkswagen.

765
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,160
You are dealing with a lot of stuff right now,

766
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,360
but fucking get at me.

767
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,840
You're still hanging on to Volkswagen, huh?

768
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,160
Yeah.

769
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,760
They're begging to take it back

770
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,040
and you just want to keep killing Earth.

771
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,560
Well, I'll get it fixed.

772
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,800
I'll devise my own system.

773
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,040
I'll put a fucking Brita filter up in there.

774
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,640
I just divested myself of my Beetle on Friday.

775
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,040
Oh, yeah.

776
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,480
And let me say, the lady who took it back

777
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,640
did not seem very jazzed to be there.

778
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:56,880
Yeah.

779
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,480
Seemed like maybe it's kind of a tough...

780
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,560
Kind of a tough time for them.

781
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,760
To be in that gig.

782
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,920
Well, maybe you shouldn't have sold me a Lycar.

783
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
A car full of lies.

784
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,320
Car full of lies.

785
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,520
Thank you for taking it back, though.

786
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
I didn't have room for my card seat in it.

787
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,480
It was kind of a bad choice.

788
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
I mean, mine's kicky and fun to drive

789
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,320
and it's got a lot of get up and go

790
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,520
and great mileage,

791
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,120
but it's full of fucking lies, so...

792
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,560
That's your problem.

793
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,680
That's your problem now.

794
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,480
Hey, can we go to the money zone?

795
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,200
Yeah, follow me.

796
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:34,400
I'll show you the way.

797
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,520
You ready for a zag?

798
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,120
I got a zag for you.

799
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,800
The original Chuckle Boys would like to talk to you about investment.

800
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
We're all adults now.

801
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,120
Yeah, well, I mean, some of us are...

802
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,960
We're put on a very prestigious list

803
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,640
and I don't want to keep dropping it

804
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,000
like several times per episode,

805
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,440
but the list is prestigious.

806
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,600
And you know it is because I'm pronouncing that word

807
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,280
the correct way now, finally.

808
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Bill Gates, Bill and Melinda Gates came to my house

809
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,760
and said, you've been pronouncing that word wrong

810
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,360
now that you're on that very prestigious list.

811
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,320
That's how you're supposed to say it.

812
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,720
Anyway, they told me Betterment...

813
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,080
Well, I shouldn't say that.

814
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,040
Betterment is what you're gonna have to use

815
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,440
to manage your portfolio

816
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
because they just want you to have that good, good money

817
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,720
using a system that is lower cost

818
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,920
than other financial services

819
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,600
and it's easy to use.

820
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,080
Nobody understands investing except for...

821
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,080
I mean, some people do, I guess.

822
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
And included in that very small number

823
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,600
is not you, but is Betterment.

824
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,000
It's a better way to invest your money

825
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,120
and it's your money.

826
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,640
You should understand where it's going.

827
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,960
They combined time-tested investing principles

828
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,760
with the transparency and ease of use

829
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
you expect from great technology

830
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,760
focusing on lower fees and taxes.

831
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,360
Because if you're paying fees,

832
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,480
it's losing...

833
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,600
You're missing the point.

834
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,080
Right.

835
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,640
You know what I mean?

836
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,040
Like, I've only been investing

837
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,240
since I've been on the prestigious list,

838
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,600
which has not been very, very long.

839
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,640
But I do know that that, fungibly,

840
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,520
just doesn't...

841
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,200
That just doesn't add up.

842
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,240
Now, we do wanna be upfront.

843
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,080
Investing involves risk, right?

844
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,640
There's no...

845
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,120
What?

846
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,400
Yes, there's no guarantee.

847
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,280
I just invested all my...

848
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,760
Great.

849
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,840
But it does involve risk.

850
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,320
But right now, you can get one month managed free

851
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,680
and to find out what you need to do

852
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,000
to qualify for that one month of free management,

853
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,800
just go to Betterment.com slash MBMBAM.

854
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,600
That's Betterment.com slash MBMBAM.

855
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,240
Betterment, investing made better.

856
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,720
I really don't know anything about money.

857
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,080
So a service that helps me out with that

858
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,640
using technology,

859
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,600
it sounds like a pretty great thing to me.

860
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
As far as I'm concerned,

861
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
this may as well be an advertisement for a wizard school.

862
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
Another thing that I don't really know about,

863
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,760
but it would be cool if someone could help me out with it.

864
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
I wanna tell everybody about Squarespace.

865
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,280
Websites are getting pretty hot,

866
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,160
and you're probably wondering how everybody's making them,

867
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,960
because it doesn't seem to be a button on your computer

868
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,160
or anything like that.

869
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,840
The secret is Squarespace.

870
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,320
We're supported by Squarespace.

871
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,160
So yes, we're a bit biased,

872
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,520
yes, we're a bit biased, but it's time for you to,

873
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,680
this is a copy here, I didn't make this up.

874
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,800
Make your next move, make your next website.

875
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
That's right, it's time to zag.

876
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,160
Even Squarespace knows that you need to make a website

877
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,520
this week that's gonna zag people in a pretty wild way.

878
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,080
These are award-winning templates,

879
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,760
and they're the most beautiful way

880
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,920
to present your ideas online,

881
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,040
and it's an all-in-one platform.

882
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,920
You can make beautiful websites with this platform,

883
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,200
and then there's nothing to install,

884
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,760
you don't patch, you don't upgrade ever,

885
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,800
and it's got award-winning 24-7 customer support.

886
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,280
You should make a website, at least.

887
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,720
I should do this,

888
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,360
because I just went to griffinmacaroy.com,

889
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,880
which I remembered redirects to my Tumblr,

890
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
which I have not updated since September,

891
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,040
and one of the top things on there

892
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,720
is a list of Overwatch characters

893
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,040
with Monster Factory names on them,

894
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,600
and so if you see me on the Forbes 30 Under 30,

895
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,720
and you say,

896
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,280
I wanna know more about this young media luminary,

897
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,680
one of the very first things you see at griffinmacaroy.com

898
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
is a picture of Soldier 76 from Overwatch

899
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,280
with the name Grandpa Piss on it,

900
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,120
and that's one of my first sort of brand representations.

901
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,600
Need to fix that.

902
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,240
Justin, what website would you make on Squarespace?

903
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,000
Well, I can't fucking do justinmacaroy.com

904
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,360
because Justin Macaroy got it.

905
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,560
I'm sorry, bud.

906
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,520
He's my archenemy.

907
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,960
He works for CBC Vancouver.

908
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,320
People tweet at me at crimes

909
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,400
getting done in Vancouver all the time.

910
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,880
That's cool.

911
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,560
And I try to investigate it myself.

912
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,680
It seems like a pretty good platform

913
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,280
for me to start investigating crime.

914
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
You should have invited him out to the Vancouver show.

915
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,640
He could have jumped his ass.

916
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,860
Yeah.

917
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

918
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,800
welcome to the stage Justin Macaroy,

919
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,960
and I'm just in the back getting blazed.

920
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,080
Yeah, I have a message here,

921
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
and it's for Julie Lange.

922
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,920
Wait, did we give the thing, the free trial thing?

923
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,200
Oh, farts.

924
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,520
I hope so, but if not, you can get a free-

925
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,000
Here, let me try again.

926
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,160
No, I'll do it because you fucked up.

927
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,640
You guys didn't even ask me what website I would make,

928
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,000
and I thought of a real humdinger.

929
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,360
All right, Travis, what website would you make?

930
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,960
I would make a website about my conspiracy theory

931
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,880
that Chuck the Show is a reboot of the Computer War 10 issues,

932
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,720
and I would call all of my readers

933
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,280
chuckolds.

934
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,240
So if you want to get a free trial

935
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,080
and 10% off your first purchase,

936
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,640
you can visit squarespace.com slash my brother.

937
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,920
Don't be a chuckold about it.

938
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,120
I have a message here for Julie Lange,

939
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,200
and it's from Charlie Lange, who says,

940
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,000
Hi, Mom.

941
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,080
Hope you're having fun while I'm off at college.

942
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,240
I know Dad won't listen to Blather with you,

943
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
but I'm still your podcast buddy,

944
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,240
even if I'm half a country away.

945
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,960
Also, sorry to Travis for that dinner invitation in June,

946
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,760
but Ma dared me, and I'm way too easily bribed.

947
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,880
Hope this message makes up for it, Ma.

948
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,840
Firm handshake.

949
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,960
Love, your pumpkin.

950
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,400
And that's very sweet, and it's supposed to go up in January.

951
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,200
So what's up now, Charlie and Julie?

952
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,160
We crushed it.

953
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,040
Travis, do you remember this din-din invitation?

954
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,680
I do.

955
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,600
I believe they tweeted at me or emailed me

956
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,240
to let me know that they were in Los Angeles

957
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,040
while I was still there and offered to take me out.

958
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,400
And I didn't do that,

959
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,880
and I don't want the Lange to take it personally.

960
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,280
No.

961
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
I don't like interacting with humans in that way.

962
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,600
No.

963
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,400
I mean, one out of every hundred people on Twitter

964
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,960
will just be a skin taker, and it's not you.

965
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,000
I know it's not you, Charlie,

966
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,920
but if there was a 1% chance, would you throw it all away?

967
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,280
Would you have the courage?

968
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,680
I don't think so.

969
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,040
If you have one shot but not have your skin taken,

970
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,840
would you take it?

971
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,040
Well, I have a personal message too,

972
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,000
as long as we're throwing these around.

973
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,400
Yeah, sure.

974
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,600
It's for Brandon Mueller, 2004.

975
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,400
And it's from BB Bearded Bro Rye Rye.

976
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,560
Yeah.

977
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,120
Rye Rye.

978
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,880
Hi, Brandon.

979
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,440
I love you.

980
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,880
Hope you grow up big and stretch your arm strong.

981
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
If you ever get the time,

982
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,640
you should play some MechWar online with me,

983
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,840
roleplay servers only,

984
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,760
and by the time this comes out,

985
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,680
I'll be most likely living in the woods again

986
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,120
without high bandwidth internet,

987
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,480
so I might need help.

988
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,160
Come find me.

989
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,560
P.S.

990
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,080
See you in hell.

991
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,800
Winky face.

992
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,040
Is this actually-

993
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,240
And the preferred time frame is night, afternoon, time.

994
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,840
Which is my favorite part of the whole thing.

995
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,360
Is this...

996
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,000
Okay.

997
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,680
Was this email supposed to be sent through time channels

998
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,000
to actually land in 2004?

999
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,480
Okay.

1000
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,360
Cool, cool, cool.

1001
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,800
Regardless, we were paid for it,

1002
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,040
so I could care less, honestly.

1003
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,320
My job here is done.

1004
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,560
Yeah.

1005
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,840
It might also have been generated by some kind of bot

1006
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,280
that just collected every 10th word it saw on Twitter

1007
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
and strung it into some kind of message.

1008
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,000
That makes a lot of sense to me.

1009
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:36,240
Yeah, that tracks.

1010
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,000
Hey, I have one Yahoo here,

1011
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,160
and it's from Morgan Navy. Keep it waving, Morgan Navy.

1012
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,400
Thank you.

1013
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1014
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,720
Sting has come to save Yahoo Answers.

1015
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,200
And look at that.

1016
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
The profile picture is the wrestler Sting

1017
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,760
with his fun makeup.

1018
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,680
Sting, the wrestler, asks,

1019
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,080
is there any way to take a good mug shot?

1020
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,840
I know it's never a good thing to get arrested,

1021
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,280
but it happens, right?

1022
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,780
Nah.

1023
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,880
So what would your attitude be like going in for your mug shot?

1024
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,560
Would you just try to make the best of it

1025
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,400
and take a good pic or still be sad?

1026
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,520
Nobody wants to get arrested, but everyone does.

1027
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,480
Not as much true that sentiment.

1028
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,640
The secret to a good one,

1029
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,240
I've seen a lot of celeb mug shots,

1030
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,800
and I think the secret is you got to have a facial expression

1031
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,440
that says, I bet I'm famous by now,

1032
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,560
because otherwise it won't happen for you.

1033
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,880
Yeah.

1034
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,520
You know what I mean?

1035
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,360
Like, that's sort of like the secret.

1036
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,920
Like, take the mug shot that you feel like expresses

1037
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,360
the life that you want to have,

1038
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,880
not the one that you do have currently.

1039
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,120
An aspirational mug shot,

1040
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,600
which should be a great compliment to the domain

1041
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,760
I do own, sexymugshots.com.

1042
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Every time I press S on my keyboard

1043
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,000
while Google Chrome is open,

1044
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,040
it autofills to that,

1045
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,480
and I keep reminding myself it is a domain that you,

1046
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,640
a madman, owns and not some weird fetish I got into.

1047
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,800
Like, three years ago that Google Chrome remembers.

1048
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,440
If you want to see our YouTube videos,

1049
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,600
the most recent one came out seven months ago.

1050
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,320
Sorry.

1051
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:14,880
Oops.

1052
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,240
We should probably do better at that.

1053
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,480
Yeah.

1054
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,360
Because sexymugshots.com is the only URL you need.

1055
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,800
I love your idea about aspirational superstar mug shots, though,

1056
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,200
because I would go with the Tim Allen sort of rugged,

1057
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,200
true grit ass cowboy man mug shot.

1058
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,920
Mm-hmm.

1059
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,960
You see that, and you think like,

1060
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,960
this guy's A, gonna be a home improvement star,

1061
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,040
and also handsome as just all get out.

1062
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,880
I'm looking at it now,

1063
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,120
and this is the most handsome Tim Allen has ever, ever looked.

1064
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,000
There's also the handsome mug shot guy who happened last year,

1065
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,960
and now he's been released from prison,

1066
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,440
and now he has like a Bugatti or something.

1067
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,760
People are just like crazy about this guy and his handsome face.

1068
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
So I think there's a lot of opportunities there.

1069
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,800
You know, if it were me,

1070
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,160
what I would do when I had a mug shot taken,

1071
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,520
is try to like screw my face up into like a weird face,

1072
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,040
and like mess my hair all up,

1073
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,880
and like mess my beard all up,

1074
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,000
and try to look as unrecognizable as possible in my mug shot.

1075
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,760
And then as soon as the mug shot was taken,

1076
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,120
I'd like shave my beard,

1077
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,720
and like get my hair cut short,

1078
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,800
and like bleach it blonde,

1079
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,000
and maybe like, you know,

1080
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,480
wipe off that fake face tattoo I had,

1081
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,680
that kind of thing.

1082
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,520
Because then the next time someone saw my mug shot,

1083
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,640
they're like, oh, that's not me.

1084
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:28,960
Hmm.

1085
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,480
That's a really great,

1086
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,760
that's actually not a bad,

1087
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,800
they wouldn't let you do that,

1088
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,840
but it's like-

1089
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,200
Yes, like a good idea.

1090
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:35,760
It's a good idea.

1091
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,080
They explicitly wouldn't let you do that.

1092
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,440
Maybe that's why Tim Allen shaved off

1093
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,560
that Jeff Bridges true gray ass cowboy mustache

1094
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,320
that he had in the sexy picture.

1095
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,160
Do you guys think that,

1096
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,760
do you guys have it in your area,

1097
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,560
the magazine that they sell at the gas station?

1098
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:50,720
Oh yes, oh yes.

1099
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,480
Okay, so this is like a common thing everywhere, right?

1100
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,600
It's not just here in Huntington.

1101
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,320
The mug shot magazine?

1102
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,600
If I could fit it, like what I was,

1103
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,400
I'm talking about the magazine they sell at the gas station

1104
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,640
that has pictures of everybody's mug shots

1105
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,680
that are just like,

1106
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,200
someone realized that that was a free renewable resource,

1107
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,840
and they decided to bring that hot property.

1108
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,320
Not sure what the market is there.

1109
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,360
Like I would love to see some down on their luck people

1110
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,160
who made some pretty bad mistakes.

1111
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,000
I would love to see just sort of a cattle,

1112
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,680
a yearbook of them, of sad thing, of sad stuff.

1113
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,160
I would say, I have an idea.

1114
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,840
I have an idea.

1115
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,840
Guys, what if we combined mug shots

1116
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,760
and Instagram filters or Snapchat filters?

1117
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,600
What do you mean?

1118
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,240
You know what I mean?

1119
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,320
So like you took your mug shot

1120
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,560
and then like a rainbow was coming out of your mouth.

1121
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:44,880
What?

1122
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,040
I mean, that's fun.

1123
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,480
Don't get me wrong, it's super fun.

1124
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,360
You know what I would do if I was getting my mug shot taken?

1125
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:54,880
What?

1126
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,440
I would stand there and do exactly

1127
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,200
what the arresting officer told me to do,

1128
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,040
and I would be respectful

1129
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,040
and sort of acknowledge that I had done a crime

1130
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,600
and got caught at doing the crime.

1131
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,600
And so like I lost the game of law,

1132
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,240
and so I have to sort of deal with the consequences of it.

1133
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,480
I wouldn't act like an asshole

1134
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,400
and do some fun like goofy stuff.

1135
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,720
I would stand there and I would be very like compliant.

1136
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,200
And then you'd say, and now let's do a funny one.

1137
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,360
Yeah, or you know what I would do

1138
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,840
when I got my mug shot taken is not get arrested

1139
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,080
because I'm like a really good boy

1140
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,600
who doesn't do illegal things.

1141
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,800
So that's the real secret to a good mug shot

1142
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
is don't be in a position to have one taken at all.

1143
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,520
The best mug shot is the ones you don't take.

1144
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,000
That's true.

1145
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,360
You miss a hundred percent of the mug shots you don't take.

1146
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I work at a craft brewery in Vancouver

1147
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,120
because I'm a cool boy.

1148
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,560
We have a regular customer who stops by every few weeks.

1149
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,120
Each time he visits, he has a new first date.

1150
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,200
All dates look very similar.

1151
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,360
He either has a type or he's a murderer.

1152
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,000
They are all brunette and slightly taller than him.

1153
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,120
Here's the kicker.

1154
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,400
Every time he comes in,

1155
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,720
he pretends that he has never been to the brewery before

1156
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,760
and says things like,

1157
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,240
ooh, what's good and what should we get?

1158
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,400
I don't know much about this craft beer scene.

1159
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
I see this man more than I see my parents.

1160
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,880
Oh, man, this stinks.

1161
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,840
This stinks.

1162
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,800
My question is, do I confirm on his next date?

1163
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,640
Do I let the illusion continue?

1164
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,920
Additional info.

1165
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,600
Every time he gets a flight of beer

1166
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,320
and they've described here four or five ounce beers,

1167
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,960
they share it and he rarely gets another beer.

1168
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,160
They share it and he rarely gets another beer,

1169
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,680
only if the date is going super well.

1170
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,920
Also, not the best tipper.

1171
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,800
That's from slinging beers to,

1172
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,600
quote, strangers in Vancouver, Canada.

1173
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,800
I have an idea.

1174
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,760
Oh, man.

1175
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,560
Have you really?

1176
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,320
Let me say this, Travis.

1177
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,160
Have you really thought this through?

1178
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,880
Have you really?

1179
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,120
There was a lot to absorb.

1180
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,080
I have.

1181
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,880
Go with me here.

1182
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,480
I think you will both enjoy this.

1183
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,320
Travis, you have to Groundhog's Day this man.

1184
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,680
He's gonna come in and you're gonna go,

1185
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,560
Steven?

1186
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,200
No, man.

1187
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,960
He's gonna kind of like make big eyes

1188
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,920
and you're gonna say,

1189
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,240
I haven't seen you since high school

1190
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,800
and you are going to spout all these facts about him

1191
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,960
that you know from him coming in

1192
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,920
and that he knows you know from him coming in

1193
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,280
and see how long he can keep up the illusion

1194
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,920
that you're old buddies from your high school days

1195
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,120
in front of his date.

1196
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,200
Oh my God, that's actually kind of good.

1197
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,600
I mean, they won't do it.

1198
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:39,920
They won't.

1199
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,120
Because that's insane.

1200
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,600
But this is pretty good.

1201
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,280
They go on a bunch of first dates

1202
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,640
and it doesn't, you know,

1203
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,880
they're unlucky in love or whatever.

1204
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,000
Vancouver is a big city.

1205
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,720
You know, there's probably a big dating scene there.

1206
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,400
Big Tinder game up there.

1207
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,360
That's fine.

1208
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,920
Whatever.

1209
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,120
But that combined with the pretending

1210
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,240
you've never been to this place

1211
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,080
that you take all of your first dates to

1212
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,240
is, it's beyond.

1213
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,600
It's a whole nother level.

1214
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,400
Why would you do this?

1215
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,600
What's the advantage of doing this?

1216
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,680
If you're taking a first date somewhere,

1217
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,880
you want it to be like a place

1218
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,560
that you know is cool, right?

1219
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,920
This sounds like a hip cool place,

1220
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,200
hip cool craft brewery.

1221
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,640
So you want to take your first date there

1222
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,400
and be like, I know this cool craft brewery

1223
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,760
that I go to sometimes.

1224
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,960
Why the fuck would you pretend

1225
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,320
that you haven't been there before?

1226
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,520
Unless you're trying to like

1227
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,200
do a really, really unsavory zag.

1228
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,440
This is no bueno.

1229
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,160
I mean, I did one summer

1230
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,880
take like five or six different dates

1231
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,280
to go see Pirates of the Caribbean,

1232
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,920
the first one.

1233
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,800
And each time I can pretend

1234
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,400
like I haven't seen the movie yet.

1235
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,160
Well, I really love the movie, Griffin.

1236
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,680
And I wanted more excuses to go.

1237
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,800
Sorry, did you say you want to,

1238
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,480
you pretended like you hadn't seen it?

1239
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,720
Well, that would be weird if I was like,

1240
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,920
hey, date number three,

1241
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,200
do you want to go see this movie?

1242
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,640
I've already seen four times.

1243
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,280
So when fucking-

1244
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,800
Because she might say no.

1245
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,640
So fucking Barbosa stabs Jack

1246
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,240
at the end of it and you're like,

1247
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,440
oh, you have to pretend like,

1248
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,800
oh no, he's dead.

1249
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,840
But then he has that coin

1250
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,680
and you're like, I knew he wasn't dead.

1251
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,480
Before the movie starts,

1252
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,600
there's a lot of,

1253
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,880
boy, this is quite a character

1254
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,640
who is Johnny Depp is making.

1255
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,000
I don't know if he's going to be able to

1256
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,280
keep it together for a whole movie.

1257
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,080
And then at the end,

1258
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,800
you have to be like,

1259
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,560
wow, he really did pull it off.

1260
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,760
He really stuck the landing.

1261
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,560
And you know what?

1262
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,440
I love this movie.

1263
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,960
You have a moment that marked

1264
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,640
at like 90 minutes where you go,

1265
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,280
wait a minute.

1266
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,160
This reminds me of Keith Richards.

1267
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,760
Wait, is this based on a ride?

1268
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,200
And did you say that before?

1269
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,480
Like, I really love the ride.

1270
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,400
I hope there's a lot of references to it.

1271
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,520
Pirates?

1272
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,200
Novel.

1273
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,280
What is it?

1274
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,080
Some kind of adventures on the high seas?

1275
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,560
What are these ocean thieves?

1276
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,040
Are these like sky pirates who went on water?

1277
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,640
Who are these sea burglars?

1278
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,120
The one that's hardest to commit to

1279
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,560
is every time you see Karen Knightley

1280
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,120
you have to say,

1281
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,800
is that Robin Wright Penn?

1282
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,320
She looks fantastic.

1283
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,920
Hey, hey, does anybody know?

1284
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,040
Is that Robin Wright Penn?

1285
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,000
Oh, Legolas is in this one.

1286
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,960
I loved him in Elizabeth Town.

1287
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,520
Travis, that's also not,

1288
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,720
why did you do that?

1289
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,280
Why didn't you say-

1290
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,960
I was 18 and I just really loved

1291
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,480
Pirates of the Caribbean, Griffin.

1292
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,280
I'm not gonna sit here

1293
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,840
and make excuses to you, huh?

1294
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,880
Like you're perfect.

1295
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,360
I'm just saying you could just say like,

1296
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,720
let's go see Pirates of the Caribbean.

1297
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,400
I've already seen it and it's really great

1298
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,760
and I think you're gonna like it.

1299
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,680
I saw it nine times in theaters.

1300
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,640
At what point do I not have to like keep up?

1301
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,240
At what point are you forcibly removed

1302
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,840
from the podcast when we find a new host?

1303
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,640
Cause that's the-

1304
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,440
That's a good question that I'd love to answer right now.

1305
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,720
It was a very good movie.

1306
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,520
I was 18.

1307
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,160
There weren't a lot of good movies on that summer.

1308
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,680
Not a lot of good movies

1309
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,040
before Pirates of the Caribbean.

1310
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,520
Dang.

1311
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,560
Not that summer.

1312
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,720
No, it was just,

1313
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,400
I loved that movie a lot, you guys.

1314
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,320
And it's not like I stayed with it for the whole series.

1315
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,280
I didn't see the rest of them nine times in theaters.

1316
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,080
Just that one.

1317
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,080
Just Pirates of the Caribbean.

1318
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,880
And I would say only like six of that was like,

1319
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,600
I desperately want to see the other like three

1320
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,080
was like our family went once

1321
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,400
and then like friends wanted to go.

1322
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,480
I'm just saying I have very good reason

1323
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,320
for seeing Pirates of the Caribbean

1324
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,920
nine times in theaters, okay?

1325
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,440
Miserable piece of shit.

1326
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,880
Let's take it to the leaderboard, Mo.

1327
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,440
Let's see.

1328
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,000
Finding Nemo.

1329
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,720
Yes.

1330
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,400
Matrix Reloaded.

1331
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,440
Bruce Almighty.

1332
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,640
X2.

1333
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,160
Terminator 3.

1334
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,440
He's actually got a really good point.

1335
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,560
All these movies kind of blow,

1336
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,600
except for Finding Nemo.

1337
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,360
Bad Boys 2.

1338
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,240
Oh, that's a good one.

1339
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,440
Okay.

1340
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,040
Too Fast, Too Furious,

1341
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,480
you miserable piece of shit.

1342
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,760
The Italian Job.

1343
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,280
Mystic fucking River.

1344
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,320
Sea Biscuit.

1345
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,880
That's not a good date movie.

1346
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,920
That's like a date movie.

1347
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,960
Kangaroo fucking Jack.

1348
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,440
Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.

1349
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,720
Lot of sequels, huh?

1350
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,560
Lot of sequels that year.

1351
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,720
Lot of sequels and remakes, huh?

1352
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,400
Spy Kids 3D.

1353
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,480
June 20th from Justin 2 Kelly.

1354
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,520
Ang Lee's Hulk.

1355
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,880
Wow, what a bad summer.

1356
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,400
Holy shit, Travis.

1357
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,760
You were not kidding.

1358
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,000
Thank you.

1359
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,960
Is Parts of the Caribbean actually a good movie

1360
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,560
or did it just come out like-

1361
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,040
On the same day as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?

1362
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,160
Great question, Justin.

1363
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,520
Is it a good movie or did it just come out

1364
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,360
at the same time as Johnny English?

1365
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,800
A great question, Justin.

1366
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,120
Salient grain.

1367
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,400
Was it actually great?

1368
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,760
And did it come out two weeks before

1369
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,080
Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life?

1370
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,080
It's hard to say what is the truth here

1371
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,800
and what is fake.

1372
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,200
Oh, man.

1373
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:54,960
Tough to say.

1374
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,080
When contrasted from the bright light

1375
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,000
of The Secret Lives of Dentists,

1376
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,400
it's really tough.

1377
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,920
Okay, I get what you're saying.

1378
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,400
I get it.

1379
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,360
Folks, that's gonna do it for our podcast.

1380
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,720
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1381
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,160
You put this fucking person on blast

1382
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,280
the next time you come in.

1383
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,280
Jerry, you come in here every week.

1384
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,080
Stop it.

1385
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,640
Stop this.

1386
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,200
Stop it.

1387
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,560
Stop this behavior.

1388
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,560
Maybe he's like, oh,

1389
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,480
maybe he's one of like septuplets.

1390
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,680
That's no, no, Trav.

1391
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,160
Maybe he's got blank slate disease.

1392
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,320
Maybe he's got the clean slate, maybe.

1393
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,280
Uh, all right.

1394
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,040
Let's end the show.

1395
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,760
But call like a police officer

1396
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,640
or a private detective

1397
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,160
or like a bodyguard or drill bit

1398
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,360
tailor type figure

1399
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,480
in here to do this conversation.

1400
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,840
You are not gonna wanna do this confrontation.

1401
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,600
Get a drill bit tailored and do it for you.

1402
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,520
Also, summer of 2003, great flick.

1403
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,800
Drill bit tailor, thank you.

1404
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,960
Anyway, that's gonna do it for our podcast.

1405
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,160
My brother, my brother and me.

1406
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,760
Sorry, I, on a wild hair

1407
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,960
cause I was looking through my domains

1408
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,920
a little bit ago.

1409
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,600
I clicked through to which one vapes

1410
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,760
cause I was curious where the lead board was at.

1411
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,200
Not a lot of big surprises.

1412
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,960
Dane Cook, Johnny Depp, Jared Leto,

1413
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,640
Kid Rock, Russell Brand, Macklemore.

1414
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,520
They're top six.

1415
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,800
Highest rating woman, Miley Cyrus

1416
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,680
coming in at number eight.

1417
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,040
I was like, yeah, all right.

1418
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,720
Yeah, I really do like those.

1419
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,320
If you click through the leaderboards now

1420
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,720
at the bottom of the leaderboard,

1421
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,240
there's a new segment called Confirm Vapors.

1422
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,160
And it just says John Cusack

1423
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,440
and then underneath his name says,

1424
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,240
Cannot Hide.

1425
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:31,520
What a good website.

1426
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,640
It's like, there it is.

1427
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,520
This one's out.

1428
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,120
We can't vote on this one now.

1429
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,400
Yeah, all right.

1430
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,440
This one's out.

1431
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,400
So anyway, that's our show.

1432
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,360
My brother, my brother and me.

1433
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,840
We hope you have enjoyed it thoroughly

1434
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,960
and you had fun listening to it

1435
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,680
and I hope you're gonna have some good zags this week.

1436
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,880
Got some good ones planned.

1437
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,880
Don't sleep on this year.

1438
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,280
We've slept on every other year's motto.

1439
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,120
This one is too fun not to do.

1440
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,400
Zag on them.

1441
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,280
Zag on them.

1442
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,720
I would like to do a quick plug.

1443
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,960
A new show has just been added to the Max Fun Network,

1444
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,200
the network of which we are a part.

1445
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,240
And it is my favorite podcast in the world.

1446
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,200
It's hosted by a media luminary and his wife.

1447
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,640
And it's called Rose Buddies.

1448
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,520
And it stars, let me check my notes,

1449
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,440
Griffin McElroy and Rachel McElroy.

1450
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
They talk about The Bachelor, The Bachelorette,

1451
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,120
Bachelor in Paradise and other like reality love shows.

1452
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,960
And it is no joke, my favorite podcast in the world.

1453
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,200
Even if you don't care about any of those properties

1454
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,680
and you might even be disgusted by them,

1455
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,360
I would say that the quality of the show

1456
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,000
and the fact that it is the funniest show around

1457
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
kind of negates the need to actually watch

1458
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,080
the source material to enjoy the show.

1459
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,680
You should check it out, Rose Buddies on maximumfun.org

1460
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,280
and also on iTunes.

1461
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,480
Check it out, you're gonna love it.

1462
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,360
Thank you, Travie.

1463
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,400
That was very sweet of you.

1464
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,520
You're welcome.

1465
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,560
Be careful, it might actually lead to you

1466
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,840
watching The Bachelor though.

1467
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,040
Oh, and it's brain poison.

1468
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,080
That did happen to me.

1469
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,560
Yeah, there's lots of other great shows on the network

1470
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,440
though like Schmanners, which Travis does with his wife,

1471
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,120
Teresa, that is so good.

1472
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,600
And Sawbones, which Justin does with Sydney,

1473
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,880
that is also so good.

1474
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,480
And a bunch of other shows that we don't do

1475
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,960
like Jordan and Jessie, go and stop podcasting yourself

1476
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,040
and throwing shade in the flop house.

1477
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,880
Speaking of Jordan and Jessie, go.

1478
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,160
Oh, yeah.

1479
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,280
This weekend at Sketchfest, I am going to be doing

1480
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,400
Jordan and Jessie, go at 1 p.m. on Saturday.

1481
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,560
Come see that, you can still get tickets for it.

1482
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,560
You know, just search Sketchfest Jordan and Jessie, go,

1483
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,120
I guess.

1484
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,160
And they also, they just celebrated their 10-year

1485
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,520
anniversary of doing the show, which is bananas

1486
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,840
and congratulations, Jordan and Jessie.

1487
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,800
That show was like super formative for us.

1488
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,840
Like we were big fans of that.

1489
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,720
And that's sort of how we got involved with the network.

1490
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,760
And so we wouldn't be here on MaxFun

1491
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,760
if it hadn't been for Jordan and Jessie, go.

1492
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,120
So it's a great show.

1493
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,240
Congratulations, guys.

1494
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,240
And here's to 10 more.

1495
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,520
10 more good ones.

1496
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,680
Also on Saturday at Sketchfest at 4.30,

1497
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,400
I'm going to be doing Obsessed with Joseph Scrimshaw,

1498
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,040
talking about video games with Rebecca Watson.

1499
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So that is also happening this Saturday,

1500
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,640
Saturday the 14th at San Francisco Sketchfest.

1501
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,600
I'll see you there.

1502
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,200
I wanted to give a quick plug to a podcast

1503
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,560
I haven't talked about in a long time,

1504
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,840
but it's continued to grow.

1505
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,760
It's not MaxFun Show, but it's called Quarter Pointed,

1506
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:27,040
featuring my father-in-law, Tommy Smurl and Mike Meadows,

1507
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,560
who I guess is my cousin.

1508
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,720
It's hard to, you know, it gets confusing.

1509
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,040
But Mike's a lawyer and they do a show

1510
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,640
that educates you in law.

1511
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,160
I mainly wanted to highlight it this week

1512
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,080
because all of their episode titles

1513
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,760
are always something vs. something else,

1514
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,960
and they're always a delight.

1515
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,360
But this week's episode is called Rasputin vs. JonBenet,

1516
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,600
and you really can't beat that for an episode title.

1517
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,320
Yeah, it's-

1518
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,280
Probably ever.

1519
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,080
I am gripped.

1520
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,640
Yeah, I mean, you're on the edge of your seat.

1521
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:54,960
Sure.

1522
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,200
And it's the beginning of season two of Quarter Pointed,

1523
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,080
which is a good idea.

1524
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,200
We should have done seasons.

1525
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,600
Damn it.

1526
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,480
But anyway, Quarter Pointed is the name of the podcast.

1527
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,920
And thanks to John Rodger and the Long Winters

1528
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,200
for the use of our theme song instead of departure

1529
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,480
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1530
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,720
You've got it at this point, I'm sure.

1531
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,840
But if not, pick it up and tell your friends to pick it up.

1532
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,160
And it's really, really a fantastic album,

1533
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,280
and I think you're gonna like it a lot.

1534
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,480
Should we tie one off?

1535
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:20,880
Is that anything?

1536
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:21,840
No.

1537
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,040
I don't know.

1538
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,040
I think it's something.

1539
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,800
I'd like to read the last question.

1540
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,160
It was sent in by Nicholas Potter.

1541
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:28,720
Thank you, Nicholas.

1542
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,360
This is by Yahoo Answers user Sharon S, who asks,

1543
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,280
when is the best time to have a root beer float?

1544
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,200
My name's Justin McElroy.

1545
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,240
I'm Travis McElroy.

1546
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,040
I'm mediailluminary3030, your girl from McElroy.

1547
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,200
He's been my brother, my brother, and me.

1548
01:02:49,200 --> 01:03:02,320
Cause your dad's square on the lips.

1549
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,600
Hi, this is Griffin McElroy.

1550
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,640
Hi, this is Rachel McElroy.

1551
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,760
And we're the host of Rose Buddies.

1552
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,400
It's a podcast about the Bachelor family of products.

1553
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,080
We watch The Bachelor, The Bachelorette,

1554
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,280
and Bachelor in Paradise.

1555
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,760
Yes, it is garbage television, but we're the king and queen

1556
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,720
of this garbage pile, we're the raccoons in charge around here.

1557
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,240
So join us on Tuesdays.

1558
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,000
Because the TV show's on Mondays.

1559
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,680
And basically we'll recap what we saw,

1560
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,000
and we'll just sort of scoop the garbage around us

1561
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,760
and make a little fort out of it.

1562
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,200
