1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,760
The world is not responsible for fixing your life. Look at the person in the mirror. Oh,

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,680
thank you. Thank you so much. Hi, welcome to my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,680
Who here has never listened to My Brother, My Brother, Me before?

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
How confused were you when Frankenstein had popped up on the screen?

12
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,960
We just really like him. We think he's great. Welcome to your number one Frankenstein fancast.

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,800
So welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. This is a kind of notable episode in terms of live shows

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:58,480
we've ever done in our entire lives because we are sober. I want to step in here and say,

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,600
I've done a lot of shows with diarrhea. There was no way I was drinking during those.

16
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,560
Fair enough. Fair enough. This is par for the course for me.

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,080
I, how has everybody's podcast, this is like, you know, fishing for applause,

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,000
but how has PodCon treated you all? It's nearly the end of day one.

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,920
I have just, I've had a great time. My mind is flooded with great new podcast ideas.

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,400
There's definitely a sense of, I love meeting everybody, but I bet at least a few people in

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
this room have had this thought, this has been so fun. I would actually at this point like to

22
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
just go home and listen to some podcasts, please. I need a little bit of a break.

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,120
I mean, wouldn't it be great that maybe that's something we could offer at PodCon 3 where like

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,400
you're all sitting there watching, but also you're wearing headphones and just getting

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,320
the audio feed through there and you're all in individual cubicles and don't have to see each

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:04,160
other. That would be. That's the dream. I had an idea for a podcast. I wanted to bounce off

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,040
you guys because I'm looking for collaborators. I'm shopping around. You're looking for funding.

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,320
I'm looking for $1.5 million in startup funding. I had this idea for a podcast that was inspired

29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,360
from my experience of being here. And the podcast, I don't have a title or anything yet.

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,640
It's still very early days. But it's about how to use a convention center bathroom like an adult.

31
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,160
And that's not a judgment of the PodCon attendees. I would say you all are above average in that

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,800
department. I've been to a lot of cons in my day. And there's just something about stepping foot

33
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,680
into a convention center that makes a lot of people apparently feel like this is not my home.

34
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:54,080
I can do whatever I want in here. It's universal. It's not just podcast. Marie Kondo could be doing

35
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
like a manners convention and step into a convention center bathroom stall and be like,

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,000
let's see what I can do in here. This is my canvas. This brings me joy.

37
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:19,680
I like podcast. Probably Comic Con is the best for this because I love seeing beloved characters

38
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,440
come out of the shitter. There's nothing better than I just saw Deadpool and he was pooping.

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,200
Seeing a Spider-Man walk out of a bathroom stall and you're like, oh, sick costume. And you walk

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,320
in there after them and you're like, great responsibility, dog. You've done irresponsible

41
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,280
things in here, Spidey. More than that, I've also seen poor cosplay planning where I did

42
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,040
once see a Spider-Man walk up to a urinal and go, oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. And then I just had to

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,160
picture a fully naked Spider-Man. At that point, the mass becomes essential.

44
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,800
No one can know. So anyway, we hope you're enjoying podcast convention too. We know we are.

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,440
So let's get into the podcast proper. This is an advice show where we take your questions and

46
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,600
turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom. Later on in the program, we're going to be taking some

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,400
questions from the audience. So please start cooking those up in your noggin. We're going to

48
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,400
do some other stuff first, though. So let's get right into it. That sounded sinister.

49
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,920
No, but this is wonderful because normally when you do this at home, people can't see

50
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,960
that it's not that you don't have the questions pulled up. You just don't know what you're saying.

51
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,120
So here we go.

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,640
Here we go. I work for a grocery delivery service downtown, and one of our regular customers is

53
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:56,240
Macklemore. He is always buying the best food in the store. Pizza, soda, chips.

54
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,680
In large- Where is this store?

55
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,880
Where is this person is what I want to know. The best stuff.

56
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,640
What else does the store sell?

57
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,160
Well, in large enough quantities that I know he has to be throwing some baller parties.

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
I frequently shop this order for him and it always makes me hungry.

59
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,280
How do I get him to invite me to these parties?

60
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:27,360
Please, sir, may I have some Macklemore in Seattle? Question. Is Macklemore a Seattle person?

61
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:35,760
Okay. Don't brag about it. Round of applause. How common is this? Have you all seen Macklemore

62
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,400
around? Holy shit. That's like half of you. Are you here by the way? Question asker.

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,160
All right. Awesome. Are you prepared for the reality that you get there? I'm like,

64
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
he invites you in and it's just him eating eight bags of chips by himself.

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,320
Oh, thank God. Please come in. I'm so lonely. I'm going to pop some bags.

66
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,760
I've been waiting for someone to ask. I've been buying the best pizzas.

67
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm only getting name brand sodas. Come on. Hey, don't lie to me. Have they invented any

68
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,480
new chips yet? You promise you can tell me, right? If they invent any new chips,

69
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,520
Macklemore's got to be on the edge of chip fashion. Do you think he would take a bite and

70
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:34,320
just be like, more like cracklemore? No, please don't leave. I need you to think through whether

71
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,360
or not you really want Macklemore to invite you to his party. I know you think in theory you do,

72
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
but if Macklemore's like, killer, see you at eight on Wednesday night after church.

73
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,640
After youth group.

74
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,840
After youth group. If you are standing outside his door at 755,

75
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,000
there's not a moment where you're like, am I going to really go into Macklemore's house?

76
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Because you're not going to know anybody there.

77
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,640
You're not going to know fucking anybody.

78
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
Except Macklemore.

79
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Macklemore's going to be like, look, this is my grocery person. I'm crazy about them.

80
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,040
They're cool.

81
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,880
They're so cool, guys. Hold on a second.

82
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
They always give me the best chips.

83
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,720
Do you remember last time at the last party we had chips? They brought those.

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,320
All of them.

85
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,040
So let's take a moment to thank this grocery delivery person for the great chips.

86
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,520
Thanks for the pizzas and sodas too. I don't want to let that get lost in the shuffle.

87
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Hey Macklemore, why did you buy pizza at the grocery store?

88
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,960
If you're here, please.

89
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,520
If only there was an easier way to have pizzas delivered.

90
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,640
I know you're huge on thrift, but please, you don't have to resort to Tombstone, Macklemore.

91
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I don't think there's a person alive who is talking to somebody and they're like,

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
how did you meet your best friend or significant other?

93
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,880
And they'll be like, I met them at Macklemore's party that he had at his house.

94
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
Didn't really know anybody there.

95
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

96
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,320
Yahoo.

97
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,960
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you, Merit.

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
It's Yahoo Answers user.

99
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Well, something's gone wrong.

100
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,200
Someone called them.

101
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,800
Bryce asks, can a PowerPoint be sexy?

102
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
Like a sexual experience?

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,240
So we're not talking about like the slides don't contain sexual material.

104
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,120
Yeah, I think that would be a little too on the nose.

105
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
This is more like the deliver the tone of voice, the pacing.

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,760
The framing of it itself can be...

107
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,040
You know, I think that when you see someone do something they're very good at,

108
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
that can be intensely...

109
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
Like if you see someone play...

110
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,440
Were you about to say the words intensely sexual out loud?

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
I was, I pulled the ripcord and I bailed out of it.

112
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,320
Three quarters of the way.

113
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,960
You stuffed the ripcord back in the hole like, no, no, no, get back in there.

114
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Please don't look at my parachute.

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
And that's all I've got.

116
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,520
Bye.

117
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,000
Bye.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,960
That's my time.

119
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,800
That was a challenging thought to float at a convention about a specific craft, Trav.

120
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,280
Thank you.

121
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,080
I guess what I'm saying is, you know, when you watch Hank and John make a podcast

122
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,280
and you're like, damn.

123
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,780
Yeah.

124
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,960
It's the pacing is so important with a sexy PowerPoint.

125
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,720
Because a lot of people just rush through them before they've completed their thought

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
and you have to slow it down.

127
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
One, hit every bullet.

128
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
What I love is when I...

129
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Make me wait for it.

130
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
When I'm just about to...

131
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,400
Hold your hand up to the screen and act like you're going to click.

132
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,720
It doesn't let your thumb caress the button.

133
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
And then you're saying, moving on.

134
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
Here we go.

135
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
The next thought is coming up.

136
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,520
Up, right.

137
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,020
Now!

138
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,520
And then you just cum.

139
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,120
Come on!

140
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, it was obviously fucking implied, but Jesus.

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,560
Oh, okay.

142
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,440
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

143
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,960
Can we take it back?

144
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,600
Edit that out.

145
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
Of your brains.

146
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,880
I mean, you got a laser pointer.

147
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,280
You could ostensibly go real fast with it to make sort of a laser light show of some

148
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,240
erotic shapes.

149
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,520
And I won't be blue like my rude brother Travis.

150
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,880
This rude boy.

151
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
I guess I'm kind of the bad boy of the podcast.

152
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,840
Last summer, this won't play in audio.

153
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,320
No way.

154
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,680
We sometimes distribute this.

155
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,080
Last summer, I was working for a summer camp.

156
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,560
And I told my mom that I needed a pair of khaki shorts.

157
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,640
The official clothes of summer camp.

158
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,640
If you're going to summer camp or catching Pokemon.

159
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,720
So I got a pair of khaki shorts.

160
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
She proceeded to buy me three pairs of them.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,720
This was fine.

162
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,680
Until the next week when she bought me three more.

163
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,000
This continued every week until I begged her to stop buying me khaki shorts.

164
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,840
Begged.

165
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,160
How do I keep this from happening to me again in the future?

166
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,560
That's from covered in khakis.

167
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,200
Are you here?

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Hello.

169
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,360
I can see you.

170
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
Hey, just how many shorts did that?

171
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,520
What was the grand finale total?

172
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,240
What did you net?

173
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,120
No, that is not divisible by three.

174
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,920
I'm sorry to math you like that.

175
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
21 perhaps.

176
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Well, now we're all wondering what happened to that one pair.

177
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,960
That's mom's cut.

178
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,880
I don't feel like this is going to happen again.

179
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,120
I would say first off, if your concern is you'll somehow fall into this khaki vortex once more.

180
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,960
I do think that I would really appreciate the thrill of going about my life day to day.

181
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,440
Eating whatever chilies I liked or melting ice creams and thinking,

182
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,240
fuck these shorts.

183
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,880
I actually don't care.

184
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,840
Dribble on down all you want, Mr. Chocolate Sauce.

185
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,480
I've got another pair of you at home.

186
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,640
I also think it would be worth it for like just gifting the story to the Goodwill employee

187
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,400
who like opened the bag and was like.

188
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,640
The light shines out of it.

189
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,120
There's like 30 pairs of khaki shorts in here.

190
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
Is this person Doug funny?

191
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
What the hell?

192
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,600
Yeah, that's a good point.

193
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,560
You could actually develop a uniform, which would be very cool.

194
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,680
You could wear the same.

195
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,760
You just need to tell them like, I love green sweater vests and white t-shirts.

196
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
Also, I need them for camp.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,320
I think if you want to stop the flow, you need to find some way to start

198
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,640
doing the shorts like drugs.

199
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,920
I don't know what that looks like.

200
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,720
There's probably some way of getting shorts inside of you that would goof you up somehow.

201
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
I meant like smoking.

202
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
God, you all are nasty.

203
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,720
But the PodCon one crowd was not nearly this yucky and their bathroom usage was way better.

204
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm sorry to bring this back on you.

205
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
I messed up.

206
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,040
I flossed in front of my students.

207
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
Now they won't, uh,

208
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
Now they won't, uh, stop asking me to do it again.

209
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,920
How did I regain power in my classroom?

210
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,280
That's from Courtney in Vancouver.

211
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,840
Are you here?

212
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,080
It sounds like you have the power.

213
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,880
Yeah, you're the most powerful person in that room for sure.

214
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,480
You have something they want.

215
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,000
As you say, do your homework and I shall floss.

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Yes, teacher.

217
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
Or if you don't do your homework, I'm gonna floss.

218
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,400
Is this how far gone we are that they have not seen people floss before?

219
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,560
Like, is it like they've never, they never learned how?

220
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,600
Is that fascinating?

221
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,280
Wait a second, Justin?

222
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,200
You know what I mean.

223
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,280
So wait, hold on, audience, don't reward this.

224
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,600
In your mind, this teacher, this wonderful PodCon guest just stood up one day and said,

225
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
Hey, class, check it out.

226
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,680
And they were like, whoa, how did you put it between your chompers?

227
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
That's why I'm doing it again.

228
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,640
These plaque riddled teens.

229
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
That's why I thought it was so funny.

230
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:52,160
Well, that's our last episode, everyone.

231
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
That's how we knew we were so far out of touch.

232
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,120
We weren't allowed on the internet anymore.

233
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,680
This is the Fortnite, isn't it?

234
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,640
Yeah, it's one of them.

235
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,920
I do not know how to continue with this question,

236
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,240
which is unfortunate because I felt like it had a lot of promise.

237
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,480
I thought it was weird that they flossed in front of, okay.

238
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,120
Okay.

239
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
I did think it was weird that they flossed in front of students,

240
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,080
but also I've been alive for 38 years and flosses meant one thing for like 37 of those.

241
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,880
So fuck off.

242
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:39,120
Wait, how did you turn so quickly to being on his side?

243
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,960
We were all in this moment together 30 seconds ago.

244
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,840
The good news is within like the next three months,

245
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,480
I can pretty much guarantee you that floss is going to go back to

246
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
only meaning that stuff you do with your teeth.

247
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,480
The shelf life of these things is usually very limited.

248
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,240
You made a prison for yourself and it's not our job to scoop you out of it.

249
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,840
We're not going to give you the ball hammer Andy Dufresne.

250
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,480
You goofed up pretty hard.

251
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,120
You give a mouse a floss dance and the rest of the saying.

252
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:22,480
I don't know what the only sort of member of the team up here I feel like.

253
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,280
And I said something dirty like 30 minutes ago.

254
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,320
A real dirty word so you all remember.

255
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
Why do you want them to relish in it?

256
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,680
God, what a weird episode.

257
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,400
I want it.

258
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
I know what it I know what it means.

259
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,000
Do it in that.

260
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,040
No, I'm not going to do it.

261
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,360
No way.

262
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
This is an audio medium.

263
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,000
Not a million years.

264
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,080
He's just scared.

265
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,920
You're making the show worse because there's not a reality in which this will happen.

266
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,720
It's an audio product and I'm not going to have.

267
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,920
Oh, he's doing it.

268
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
He's watching so good.

269
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280
The speed of his arms is lifting him off the ground.

270
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,600
He's ascending into heaven.

271
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,040
Goodbye, Justin.

272
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,520
Goodbye.

273
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
He took his mic with him.

274
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
What's it like in heaven, Justin?

275
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,040
I just Jesus told me that floss has meant something for 2000 years.

276
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
And it wouldn't have occurred to him either, he says.

277
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,400
I do have a Yahoo.

278
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,040
Okay.

279
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,400
This one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

280
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,880
Thank you, Seth.

281
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:34,480
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Jason with an M. Jason asks,

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
what does the moon smell like?

283
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,720
I've always been curious about what the moon smells like.

284
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,760
And because there is no time that I will be on the moon and or able to smell the moon,

285
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,320
it is a question I honestly wonder about.

286
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,360
Also, I can't smell moon rocks that are on earth because their inherent moon smell would

287
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
be compromised by earth smells.

288
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,240
Yeah.

289
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,160
Excellent point, Jason.

290
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,640
I am saddened by Jason's question because of the line there will not be a time because

291
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,560
what I realized is the question is that there will not be a time when I will be on the moon

292
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,080
and or able to smell the moon, which does create a scenario in which Jason is on the

293
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,800
moon but is unable to smell it because of that pesky glass and the helmet and he's

294
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,240
just picking up handfuls of moon turquoise as he sucked back into space.

295
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,480
Okay.

296
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,360
I'm pretty sure it's the lack of atmosphere on the moon that would make it so you can't

297
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,560
smell anything up there, right?

298
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,720
Like even if you could, this is going to be another.

299
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
If you nut in space, does it push you backward?

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,480
I think everything got a smell.

301
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,080
Everything got a smell.

302
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,200
Water has a smell even if our noses can't pick it up so good sometimes.

303
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
Everything got a smell.

304
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,960
Even if you remove the atmosphere around it, if you take a stinky egg and you put it in

305
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,920
a little vacuum tube and you suck all the air out, there may not be-

306
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,840
It would fall at the same speed as a feather.

307
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,400
Yes.

308
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,040
There may not be the egg stink in there, but the egg still has a stink.

309
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,160
Whoa.

310
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,480
So you're saying that if it's dark, like if it's a dark part of the moon, you can like

311
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,400
the rock still has a look, even though you can't see it?

312
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,040
Whoa.

313
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,280
We're sober, but are we stoned?

314
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,120
Here's what I'm saying.

315
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,080
Here's what I'm saying.

316
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
I think that, okay, I'm pretty sure about this.

317
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,920
You could never smell anything on the moon without compromising it with our terrible

318
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,960
earth smells.

319
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,520
Yes.

320
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,000
If you brought a moon rock back in a vacuum from space-

321
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
And you stuck your head in there real fast.

322
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
I think you could have one, right?

323
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:47,600
You'd have one chance where you could like get the good smell of it without the dirty

324
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,240
earth air.

325
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,960
This is interesting.

326
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,800
Justin thinks it would be a very good smell.

327
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,480
Well, but here's the problem.

328
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,400
There would be no context because it literally smells like nothing on earth.

329
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,680
So you would smell the moon and you'd be like, it smells like something.

330
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
What would you compare it to?

331
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
That's like seeing a new color for the first time.

332
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
I want to smell the moon.

333
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,600
But then think of the loneliness that you would have as being the only one who's ever

334
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,560
smelled the moon.

335
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,800
You could never discuss it with anyone.

336
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,960
They would have to, now this is 2019.

337
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,160
There would be like a bunch, they would bring back millions of rocks in tiny vacuum boxes

338
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,480
and they would all be wrapped in like blind boxes.

339
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,800
So you'd have to like have unwrapping videos and the people would smell them on YouTube

340
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,080
is how it would probably go down.

341
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,280
They wouldn't just bring back one moon rock in a vacuum box.

342
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Yeah, Justin-

343
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,760
We've talked about this too seriously for too long.

344
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,360
I'm just saying it's kind of a bummer that you can't smell the moon.

345
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
What do you think the moon tastes like?

346
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,960
No, I'm not going to do that.

347
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
It's just rocks.

348
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,040
But like the smell of-

349
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,240
Like cheese?

350
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,760
No, like the smell of the moon.

351
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,440
If the moon-

352
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,040
It smells like Neil Armstrong's feet.

353
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,160
If the moon crashed into the earth.

354
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,660
Okay.

355
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
That would be bad.

356
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,680
For sure.

357
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,620
Okay.

358
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm a lifelong knitter and whenever I'm going somewhere where I know I will be waiting a

359
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,200
lot like the airport or riding public transport, we know.

360
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,160
I mean, thank you, but like we know places you wait.

361
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,080
I like to take a small project and knit while I wait.

362
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,600
The thing is on several occasions, I've looked up for my work at just the right moment to

363
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,160
see what someone clearly trying to take a picture of me.

364
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,480
More often than not, we lock eyes and they know that I know they're trying to take a

365
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,040
picture of me.

366
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,320
What do I do when I make eye contact with the person trying to stealthily take my picture?

367
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,480
I didn't think knitting in public was that weird.

368
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,520
The awkwardness kills me every time and that's from stitching in your Snapchat stories.

369
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,400
Are you here?

370
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,240
All right.

371
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
And PS, I'm Jennifer Garner.

372
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,820
Yeah.

373
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,280
The great news is you already have two sharp objects in your hand.

374
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,800
What the fuck are they doing?

375
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,920
No matter how interesting or like unusual the thing you're doing is, it's like,

376
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,680
gotta take a picture of this stranger is always weird.

377
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,720
Even if you were flying and someone's like, well, they're not looking.

378
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,800
Like that's a weird, it's uncomfortable.

379
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm gonna bet also that you are not the only person in this room that brought knitting

380
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,720
with you today.

381
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,960
All right.

382
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,280
Yes.

383
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,080
I see somebody.

384
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,480
Yes.

385
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,520
Yes.

386
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,560
This is a sample size that is probably not representative, but still everybody's doing it.

387
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,000
Maybe just everyone that you've seen try to take a picture is like me and has like,

388
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,840
is just sitting there thinking like, this human being can focus on a project that long?

389
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,560
Who is this?

390
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,880
I need to remember them visually forever.

391
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,280
In my phone.

392
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
What were they gonna do with that fucking picture?

393
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,480
Instagram, you'll never believe it.

394
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
A scarf.

395
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,880
Can you, I don't know how quickly you can knit,

396
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,200
but can you super quick knit like, fuck you?

397
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Or like, no.

398
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,080
Or like a net you can throw over them.

399
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,200
Oh, that would be good.

400
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
Give me the camera.

401
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,480
And then you smash it on the ground and then you knit them a new camera.

402
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,640
That's how it works.

403
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,200
Yep.

404
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,680
You knit a little cocoon that you wrap them up in.

405
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,440
That would actually be very comfortable.

406
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,120
That'd be a bad punishment.

407
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
Knit me up a cocoon.

408
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,080
That's just called a hammock.

409
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,600
A fully enclosing apparatus?

410
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
I've been doing hammock wrong.

411
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,080
Yeah, I would say so.

412
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,000
Hey, this is unconventional, but I have a riddle.

413
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,600
We do a segment called riddle me piss.

414
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
And you're not doing the voice.

415
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,520
Riddle me piss, and Travis loves to take it over and do the voice and I hate the voice.

416
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,960
I like to keep it very straight laced here on riddle me piss.

417
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
Riddle me piss, boys.

418
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,160
This is a riddle.

419
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Does it say, Travis, you know this website, does it say who did it?

420
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,140
No.

421
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,720
Someone did this riddle and they thought it was cool enough to share with the internet.

422
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,560
Now I'm going to read it here in this room.

423
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,000
Work it over in your own brain.

424
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
I don't know why my voice just sounded like that.

425
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,640
Do not shout the answer out.

426
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,600
I'll be furious.

427
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,100
Don't.

428
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,320
A man with two heads walked down the street, but no one noticed or cared.

429
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,820
Why?

430
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,200
A man with two heads walked down the street, but no one noticed or cared.

431
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,700
Why?

432
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,160
Everyone was busy.

433
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,760
Because in this cellular age, am I right?

434
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,280
Hey, put your phones down and look at the dude with two heads.

435
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,440
Is it the dirty reason?

436
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,980
Okay.

437
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,760
One head was in a bag.

438
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,240
Zayfod Bibblebrox was filming a sequel to Cherry Head.

439
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,320
You just wanted to say Zayfod Bibblebrox out loud.

440
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,820
Yeah.

441
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,320
Yeah.

442
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,160
That's okay.

443
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,880
What's the answer?

444
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,000
The second head was the head of lettuce he was carrying.

445
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Still, someone should have noticed or cared.

446
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,460
Lettuce.

447
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,960
Nice.

448
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Good for you, dog.

449
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Eating healthy.

450
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,280
If you did see someone carrying a head of lettuce around, you would notice and care.

451
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,080
I guarantee.

452
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
This is from riddles.com, a website we like to visit from time to time.

453
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,960
And I did not realize about this website there is a like dislike function, sort of similar to YouTube videos.

454
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
I looked through a few of these.

455
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,040
I looked through a lot of these.

456
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,280
I looked through a few of these, I looked through a lot of these.

457
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,480
There's not a single one with a positive ratio.

458
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,360
That's my favorite thing.

459
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,880
Because every time you'll see one, it's like 10 likes, 100 dislike.

460
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,160
I'm like, ooh, gotta check this one out.

461
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,880
Yeah, I gotta know.

462
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:07,520
Oh, we didn't time our segments out very well.

463
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,440
All the way out in Seattle, we've been found by a haunted doll watch.

464
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,560
This doll is named Rhea, or rather Meshivius Rhea, haunted spirit doll, haunted doll child.

465
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Is the eBay listing.

466
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:31,200
You can, it's currently bidding with no bids starting at 9.99.

467
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,680
The evil number almost.

468
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,400
The upside down evil number.

469
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,360
Rhea is the spirit of a nine year old child.

470
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
That's rough start.

471
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,160
That's why it's 9.99.

472
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,280
Very active energy and very demanding of attention.

473
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,800
She communicates by spirit board and spirit box.

474
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,640
She has broken English.

475
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
Well, like that's for a ghost is good, though.

476
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,760
If you think about it, that's pretty impressive.

477
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,240
Like, why would you waste time with a bunch of words?

478
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,080
You don't need just like get to the point.

479
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,440
You're using someone's pointer to scoot across the board.

480
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
There's not going to be a bunch of like apostrophes and stuff.

481
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,360
It's ridiculous if my dog started talking and I was like, that's amazing.

482
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
And I'd be like, it's not full sentences.

483
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,760
Yeah, how did you, how did you die?

484
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,440
Horse tragedy.

485
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,280
What does that mean?

486
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,680
Give me some pronouns in there.

487
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,280
Her favorite thing to communicate are.

488
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
Oh, now who's speaking with broke.

489
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,280
Yeah, yeah.

490
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,760
Right.

491
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,040
Her favorite things to communicate are no mine.

492
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:49,840
Get it pretty kitty.

493
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,960
Apple time.

494
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,640
Hey Ray, I'm going out on a date tonight.

495
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,440
How do I look?

496
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,800
Apple time speak sentences.

497
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,840
Get it.

498
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,800
What do you mean?

499
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,520
Pretty kidding.

500
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,400
No mine and various other simple things that she repeats.

501
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,360
Does she speak in broken English or does she say four different things?

502
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,160
Like a, like a peewee Herman doll, you're pulling the string on.

503
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,680
She is known to be heard giggling, especially when your back is to her.

504
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,960
Okay.

505
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,440
Why would you ever turn your back on something haunted?

506
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,160
But you're cool.

507
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,920
That sentence construction would be way different.

508
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,120
If you looked at her and she giggled, you could just write she giggles.

509
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,280
I've seen it.

510
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,760
I watched her face move.

511
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,200
This one is real child.

512
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
Because of her broken communication.

513
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,600
She has been very hard to learn from about her past.

514
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,920
She is very content as she is.

515
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,680
Cool.

516
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,000
That's like good for her.

517
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,920
Why we're all trying to get there, right?

518
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,600
I mean, it does beg the question, then why is she here?

519
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,040
Cause it seems like if you're content, that's when you normally get.

520
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,800
You know, that's an interesting thing that Justin has floated

521
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,280
that if you walk into a there's not a toy store anymore, huh?

522
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,560
Yeah, you walk into an American girl store and it's like, good.

523
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,760
Everyone here is fulfilled their charge on earth and ascended into the afterlife.

524
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,120
All of these empty husks.

525
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,600
I just think, you know, maybe like she died and she got trapped in a doll

526
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
and she was like, oh no, you know what?

527
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,040
It's apple time.

528
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,760
She easily adjusts to new places and people.

529
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,320
If you don't mind bumps in the night and hearing giggling

530
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
and the sounds of little feet running around.

531
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,800
I do mind.

532
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,760
You have a child.

533
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,520
Yeah, I do.

534
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,040
I have a child that we made together and is not a doll.

535
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,400
But when you hear those feet in the night, you're not like, oh damn it.

536
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,880
Actually, that's either my kid or a ghost.

537
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,440
Right.

538
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,160
I would be more scared if I heard feet running around in the middle of the night.

539
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,960
And I did think it was my child who had woken up from slumber.

540
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,000
She is best with other spirits and people who are understanding

541
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,120
and know to expect anything from mischievous spirits.

542
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,600
If you're a lover of spirits and treat them as family,

543
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,320
if you're kind and understanding of their special needs

544
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,040
and care required to own spirit items, then please consider Rhea.

545
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,760
My spirit items come from a clean and non-smoking environment.

546
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
I mean, it's important.

547
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,360
Yeah.

548
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,920
You do.

549
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,880
You want to know that.

550
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
You want to raise them right, you know?

551
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,720
Well, this is my favorite part.

552
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,280
She will arrive to you carefully and safely packed in a discreet manner.

553
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,640
We'll just write on the box dildo box and no one will ever know.

554
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,600
It would be pretty brutal to get like, just like wrapped in cellophane.

555
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Just like a doll is lying on your porch.

556
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,640
Like, well, that tells, that's a short story that tells you everything

557
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,080
you need to know about our new neighbors, honey.

558
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,560
Well, time to move.

559
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,840
I think I cracked the case.

560
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,960
She'll arrive to you carefully.

561
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Please check back as I'm offering many of my spirit items all month.

562
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,280
My items are well-known and loved across social media.

563
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,240
Oh wait, who was this?

564
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,320
Mysterious Rhea?

565
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
Oh yeah, she's great.

566
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,800
I know her on Tumblr.

567
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,040
Previously, I was among the highest entrusted spirit item sellers on eBay

568
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,760
until I took a break a few years back for family and self-care.

569
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,400
I haven't.

570
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,800
You sold a doll that killed someone.

571
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
All right.

572
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,960
You had the lay low.

573
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,240
We get it.

574
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,760
Anyway, that's your, for this week, your haunted doll watch.

575
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,520
Don't do the thing.

576
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,600
You always do the thing where you're like, oh, great job.

577
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
But it's the only one, guys.

578
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,640
It's the only one.

579
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
Why don't I start with like, that's it?

580
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,320
Maybe go negative.

581
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,200
Yeah, neg us.

582
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,560
Okay, okay, okay.

583
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,280
All right, all right.

584
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,080
We could tell they were trying, folks,

585
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
but these boys just couldn't bring it home.

586
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,320
Bride in gears.

587
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,760
Gotta get the long cane and grab them all by the necks.

588
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,680
And who's that holding the cane?

589
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,600
Well, it's Mike Myers and he's playing a new character on this game show.

590
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,840
Comedy god, Dr. Kane.

591
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,920
Dr. Herman Cain starring Mike Myers.

592
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,720
So we have some advertisements that we'd like to tell you about.

593
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,360
Thank you to PodCon, by the way, for coming out to PodCon.

594
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,520
What?

595
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,360
Our first sponsor is Blue Apron.

596
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,480
Blue Apron is wonderful.

597
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,880
Blue Apron makes these boxes and the boxes are full of food parts

598
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,160
and special recipes specifically for those food parts that you follow

599
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,400
to turn them into amazing dishes like sage and brown butter chicken

600
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,600
with roasted vegetables and so many more.

601
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,560
Did you know you can eat the box?

602
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,440
Travis, they don't like it when you say that, I'm pretty sure.

603
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,560
No, I mean, let me be clear.

604
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,800
You're not supposed to, but you can.

605
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,040
Yeah, and we're not gonna tell you that it tastes better than a regular old box.

606
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,440
No, it's not seasoned.

607
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,000
Let me be clear, the box is not seasoned.

608
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,520
We won't not tell you that.

609
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,840
So anyway, they got chef designed recipes that use fresh,

610
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,200
seasonally inspired ingredients and time-saving tips and technique videos

611
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,720
to help you learn how to be a better chef.

612
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,680
It worked for me.

613
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,640
I love cooking.

614
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,680
I used to not and then this magical box came into my life.

615
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,720
I climbed inside of it, traveled six years into the future

616
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,280
and now here I am talking to you today.

617
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
And I just ate it.

618
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,840
So check out this menu.

619
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
I need some gas money.

620
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,840
I left my wallet back in 2013.

621
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,160
Oh no, so check out this week's menu

622
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,880
and get $60 off at blueapron.com slash my brother.

623
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,800
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

624
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,440
And then it says here, Blue Apron, a better way to cook,

625
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,240
parentheses, don't eat the box in parentheses.

626
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,740
Yeah.

627
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,180
I got this next one.

628
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,400
Okay.

629
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,820
Eat stamp?

630
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,460
Stamp for not to eat.

631
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,340
For mail.

632
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,300
Stamps.com is a website that is just like a post office

633
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,700
in that stamps are available but in every other way possible.

634
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,980
It's like a post office in that Mark works there.

635
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,420
There are Marks involved.

636
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,100
But you won't feel like a Mark

637
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,620
when you see these great prices and see how convenient,

638
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,420
easy, reliable and efficient stamps.com is.

639
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,460
You know, it is nice to be able to save yourself

640
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,340
a trip to the post office,

641
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,820
even if you have a delightful staff like I do,

642
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,020
Frank and Tim and the whole game.

643
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,460
I don't have a Mark.

644
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,300
Stamps.com has all the power of the US Postal Service.

645
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,060
And it's available-

646
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,180
Who sweeps your driveway?

647
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,620
It's available during the shutdown,

648
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,860
which a lot of people didn't go to stamps.com

649
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,620
because they thought it wouldn't be working.

650
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,700
But it's right there and you can go for it.

651
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,420
You can enjoy stamps.com with a special offer

652
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,380
that includes a four-week trial plus postage

653
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,500
and a digital scale.

654
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,300
What?

655
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,580
Start the new year off right.

656
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,180
Go to stamps.com.

657
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,420
Click on the microphone at the top of the home page

658
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,860
and type in my brother.

659
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,460
That's stamps.com.

660
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,060
Enter my brother.

661
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,140
I wish people wouldn't put enter my brother.

662
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,500
Really need a different sort of way of saying.

663
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,220
Just don't ever, please don't do that.

664
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,060
Input my brother.

665
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,100
Input my brother.

666
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,380
Type my brother.

667
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,540
Do you think that when the postman brings your digital stamp,

668
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,820
he knows it's his way of saying goodbye?

669
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,740
He just kind of hefts the box and he's like,

670
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,940
hmm, that feels like Jesus.

671
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,500
You wouldn't be trying to cut out the middle mark, would you?

672
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,940
I'm doing my best over here.

673
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,020
But anyway, stamps.com and then also at my brother.

674
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,420
If you click on the microphone, type in my brother

675
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,780
and press the return key.

676
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,820
Mm-hmm.

677
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,740
There, I avoided saying it again.

678
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,740
Hi, I am Lori Kilmartin.

679
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,780
And I'm Jackie Kish.

680
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,260
Together, we host a podcast called

681
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,780
The Jackie and Lori Show.

682
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,780
We're both stand-up comics.

683
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,500
We recently met each other because women

684
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,980
weren't allowed to work together on the road

685
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,820
or in gigs for a long, long time.

686
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,940
And so our friendship has been unfolding on this podcast

687
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,740
for a couple of years.

688
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,500
Jackie constantly works the road.

689
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,460
I write for Conan, and then I work the road in between.

690
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,580
We do a lot of stand-up comedy, and so we celebrate stand-up.

691
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,820
And we also bitch about it.

692
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,940
We keep it to an hour.

693
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,980
We don't have any guests.

694
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,500
We somehow find enough to talk about every single week.

695
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,220
So find us.

696
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,060
You can subscribe to The Jackie and Lori Show

697
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,500
at maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

698
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,060
OK, bye.

699
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,020
That sounds like one to check out.

700
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
If you would like a different podcast, though,

701
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,620
we have half of one, a perfectly good,

702
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,380
half of a podcast left here for you left on your plate.

703
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,460
You know, there are kids in other countries

704
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,540
that would love to eat half of a podcast.

705
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,340
They got earphones with only one cup on them.

706
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,980
Perfect for this half a podcast.

707
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,460
We're going to do a couple questions here.

708
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,980
I guess dead questions, the opposite of our live ones.

709
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,580
Yeah, undead questions.

710
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,380
Our show at PodCon ended up being kind of short,

711
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,860
and we had some issues during the audience questions.

712
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,340
And so we're going to try, instead of delivering you

713
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,820
a 35-minute-long podcast, we're going to fill for time,

714
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,380
as they say in TV business.

715
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,860
Do we have a question, Justin?

716
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,860
I got a question for you.

717
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,940
I work for a very small company.

718
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,740
My boss loves going on cruises.

719
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,260
My husband and I are well-traveled,

720
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,100
but when my boss learned we had never been on one,

721
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,620
he gifted us a trip with himself and his wife

722
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,580
on a cruise to the Bahamas as a Christmas bonus.

723
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,060
Oh, man, it was a fine enough trip,

724
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,340
but my husband and I decided we are not cruise people,

725
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,700
and we would not like to repeat.

726
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,580
Oh, you went?

727
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,300
Dang, you went, huh?

728
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,500
Okay, but my boss had so much fun,

729
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,900
he keeps telling me that he can't wait for another

730
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,340
annual winter trip with us.

731
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,820
Oh, no.

732
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,940
This fucking guy.

733
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,940
This fucking guy.

734
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,340
He already did the biggest, worst thing,

735
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,980
and he's looking for a traditional repeat.

736
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,480
Gross.

737
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,900
Brothers, how do I kindly let down this generous offer

738
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,940
and ask for a different form of Christmas bonus?

739
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,180
That's from Marooned in Michigan,

740
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,940
and I think I speak for all of us when I say,

741
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,620
well, holy fucking shit.

742
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,900
Yeah, are you fucking with me right now?

743
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,700
I cannot imagine more of like a setup spike

744
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,660
than like, I got you a cruise with me.

745
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,700
This seems like the makings of like the next

746
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,340
Bad Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly feature film.

747
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:53,380
I feel like this seems like the plot of a film

748
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,660
more than it does a real thing.

749
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,180
Wasn't this like an Adam Sandler,

750
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,460
Drew Barrymore thing where it's like,

751
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,580
you're gonna go on a trip,

752
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,260
but you gotta go with this person.

753
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,100
I think it was called Flipped.

754
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,660
Flipped.

755
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,460
Flipped.

756
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,500
Flipped the trip.

757
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,780
Flipped our Africa trip.

758
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,280
Yeah.

759
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,900
I think it's called Flipped.

760
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,780
I think it's called Flips.

761
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,620
If you say enough nouns,

762
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,220
eventually you will say the name of a Drew Carey, Adam Sandler.

763
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,100
Drew Barrymore film.

764
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,460
Drew Careymore.

765
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,500
Drew Careymore is the name.

766
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,180
That's their celebrity couple name.

767
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,980
Here's what you do.

768
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,660
Man, I have a pitch.

769
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,380
And it's gonna take a little bit of acting,

770
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,980
but I think you can do it.

771
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,220
You're gonna make direct eye contact with your boss

772
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,540
and say in the interim, since the last group,

773
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
which, oh yes, you did have a wonderful time,

774
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,820
but in the interim, you watched on the same night

775
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,380
Pirates of the Caribbean and Captain Phillips,

776
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,940
and now you can never go on a ship again.

777
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,820
Are you equating the events of those two movies

778
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,500
in any way, Travis?

779
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,180
Pirates take over a ship, Griffin?

780
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,580
I don't know.

781
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,020
Maybe they have a little bit in common.

782
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,580
Maybe they have a little in common, Griffin.

783
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,980
Not in terms of whimsy, they don't.

784
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,660
Their whimsy sort of meters

785
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,060
are on completely different sides of the spectrum.

786
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,900
I haven't seen Captain Phillips.

787
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,380
No, I have to apologize also

788
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,460
if you get any background noise on my feed.

789
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,580
The Ocean's Eleven guys are here

790
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,020
and they're trying to steal my whole house.

791
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,740
Oh, that's another one you could say.

792
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,980
Ocean's Eleven, that doesn't take place on a cruise ship,

793
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,700
but you're just afraid of general crime at this part.

794
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,300
Maybe there's a casino on the cruise ship.

795
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,340
I think fear-based is the way.

796
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,300
That's the way you're gonna wanna go.

797
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,740
We need to step into this question

798
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,860
because we're having a lot of fun here,

799
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,860
but we need to get our hands fucking dirty

800
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,020
and decide what this person's gonna do.

801
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,980
We're making goof-em-ups

802
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,660
and we're talking about Captain Phillips and stuff,

803
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,180
but we really, really need to get bone deep in this one,

804
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,740
I feel like.

805
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,620
Maybe, ooh, is there a patsy in your office

806
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,860
that you can be like, listen, I can't take all the cruise fun.

807
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,540
Sharon was saying the other day how much she loves cruises.

808
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,020
Maybe she and her partner wanna go with you

809
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,940
this year and you make it like a rotating,

810
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,020
oh, like employee of the year bonus,

811
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,900
and then you do a shitty job.

812
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,420
You do a horrible job.

813
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,100
Probably not.

814
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,340
I don't think that one would work, honestly,

815
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,820
because I think that he's crazy for cruises with you.

816
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,900
Just wild for him.

817
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,380
Maybe you could go one more time, but really tank this one.

818
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,940
Like you eat all the shrimp and you forgot your sandals,

819
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,740
so you have to wear business shoes to the pool.

820
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,940
So this is the script for Dude Cruise 2,

821
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,580
which is the second one with Will and John,

822
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,420
and they are getting together on this one,

823
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,580
but this time they wanna have a bad cruise,

824
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,380
because in Dude Cruise 1, they had a great time.

825
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,660
They met their wives.

826
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,020
Crab grabbed onto Will's penis.

827
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,700
And in this one-

828
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,900
But in a good way.

829
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,180
You saw that in the trailer.

830
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,460
Good for me as the viewer, how funny it was.

831
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,020
But in this one, two crabs get on there,

832
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,300
but they have a bad time.

833
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,980
In Dude Cruise 2, something's gone sour on the seven seas.

834
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,620
It's a long poster, but it's a film.

835
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,340
It's a widescreen sort of landscape poster.

836
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,500
Our first landscape poster.

837
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,980
Film historians all agree

838
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,500
that the first ever landscape poster was for Dude Cruise 2.

839
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,980
Sorry, what was the subtitle of the film again?

840
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,260
Something's gone sour on the seven seas?

841
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,060
I believe that's correct, yes.

842
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,740
Now, Griffin, are you saying that

843
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,260
they're gonna have a bad time because it's a bad time,

844
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,300
or that the movie wants us, the audience,

845
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,700
to stop coming to the Dude Cruise movies

846
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,660
so they can stop coming?

847
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,580
Oh, it's like a sabotage.

848
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,260
I don't even think they could pull that off.

849
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,940
There's nothing they could do on that screen

850
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,940
that would make me not come back for the next one.

851
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,180
For Dude Cruise 3, Cruise to the Moon?

852
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,340
I'm just tantalized by the idea of three crabs

853
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,660
hanging off of Will Ferrell's ruined member.

854
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,140
How many more crabs can he put on there?

855
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,300
Yeah, sure, I got one here.

856
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,540
This one was sent in by several people.

857
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,100
Thanks, everyone.

858
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,180
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Jenny, who asks,

859
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,980
cat smelled my vape?

860
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,700
Is that okay?

861
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,860
I was playing around with my vape,

862
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,980
and my cat was beside me.

863
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,180
It was turned on, and my cat, the vape, I assume,

864
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,780
was turned on.

865
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,140
The cat like, I'm alive!

866
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,300
It was turned on, and my cat came over

867
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,740
and smelled it directly in front of the mouthpiece.

868
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,260
I didn't know if it was bad for cats

869
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,460
until I did some research after.

870
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,380
Now I'm really concerned if the cat gonna be okay.

871
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,820
So the concern is that in smelling it,

872
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,260
it was ripping mad cotton, right?

873
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,500
It was so close to the carb or whatever,

874
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,060
and did what I do when it's time for me to do my tricks

875
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,060
at the street corner.

876
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,860
And like I didn't see any of that delicious fog

877
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,380
come out of the cat, but maybe it was just, you know.

878
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,620
Oh, maybe it's still holding it.

879
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,660
It might still be.

880
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,540
And so like three weeks from now,

881
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,420
you're gonna open up, you know, the can of Fancy Feast,

882
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,100
and he's just gonna look up at you like,

883
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,380
baaahhh!

884
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,900
Fuck you, Denny!

885
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,860
You said I couldn't rip.

886
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,340
I couldn't rip, I can rip.

887
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,380
Nah, it's possible.

888
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,820
Then that's not good.

889
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,500
I don't think you're supposed to keep that stuff

890
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,540
in there that long.

891
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,700
Do they make special vape juice for cats?

892
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,100
It's all like tuna.

893
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,700
Or like catnip.

894
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,340
Imagine that.

895
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,980
Like I breathe out just a mad cloud,

896
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,300
and my cat's just like, I love it.

897
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,460
And there's my cat like swirling around in it,

898
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,820
having a good old time.

899
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,540
What if you're-

900
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,780
I'm dead cause I inhaled catnip, but it's okay.

901
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,900
He loves your corpse, he's wild about it.

902
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,060
I don't think you need to make it more addictive for cats.

903
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,660
Cats are already so prone to get addicted to vaping.

904
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,340
I don't feel like you want to make it taste

905
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,300
like something that-

906
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,900
Actually, I don't know, is it taste?

907
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,460
I don't know what drives him so wild about catnip,

908
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,540
honestly, I'm not sure the mechanics.

909
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,300
I think it's just that it's forbidden.

910
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,500
Yeah, is it forbidden?

911
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,700
Okay, that's how they know.

912
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,100
Because it's still a schedule one drug,

913
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,380
so when cats get a chance to get catnip,

914
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,540
they just go fucking crazy because they're like,

915
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,980
who knows, then I'll get more catnip.

916
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,740
I don't have a car or a job.

917
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,260
If we were to develop a brand of vape juice accessories,

918
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:24,260
carbs, turbo batteries, and what have you,

919
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,500
tanks, and all of it,

920
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,980
I'm thinking specifically of the juices and the flavors

921
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,020
were designed so that humans and cats could both enjoy it.

922
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,340
So you and your buddy could pass them back and forth, right?

923
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:44,740
Because I don't want to give a huff of strawberry sex

924
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,940
or whatever I'm huffing today over to the kitty

925
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,980
because they might not enjoy it.

926
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,140
But I don't want to have the stinky tuna

927
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,220
like Travis suggested in my mouth.

928
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,620
So what's the compromise here?

929
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,980
So you're talking about what's the flavor

930
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,940
or what's the brand name?

931
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,660
What's the flavor?

932
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,500
I don't know, I'll think of the brand name later.

933
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,460
This is my bim bam.

934
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,940
Maybe saucer of milk?

935
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,420
90 people will tweet at us with the brand name.

936
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:08,820
You know what?

937
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,620
I like cream.

938
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,460
Kitty like cream.

939
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,860
Cream vape is not good for me, I think.

940
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,980
Kitty like cream.

941
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,940
Kitty like cream?

942
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,740
Yeah, sure.

943
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,780
I don't want milk.

944
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,700
I don't like any sort of milk in my vape.

945
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,060
I love a creamy, round, vanilla cream.

946
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,940
Oh, just a cream?

947
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,420
Lap it up.

948
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,140
Lap it up is-

949
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,140
Oh, lap it up would be a good name for a brand, yeah.

950
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,100
It's just challenging.

951
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,860
It's challenging when you say lap it up.

952
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,780
What if, if there's some way-

953
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,380
Can we just put cream in the tank?

954
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,340
The problem is you can only do that once.

955
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,940
Gotta crank your ohms.

956
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,660
Gotta ask you good ohms though to get through that cream.

957
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,980
I got 1.21 gigabots.

958
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,780
Don't worry about it.

959
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,740
Is there a way-

960
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,020
I love Star Trek jokes,

961
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,420
but that is actually gonna start a fire in your mouth

962
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,140
and I don't think you should try to vape cream.

963
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,980
Is there a way to have a flavor

964
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,500
that when the cat tastes it tastes like Dave killed a mouse,

965
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,100
but when I taste it,

966
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,660
tastes like the peace of mind I have

967
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,420
knowing that my kitty kills the mice?

968
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,020
That was the most abstract thought

969
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,140
that has ever been communicated via this podcast.

970
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,580
Or the English language, I feel like.

971
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,140
That was the most challenging abstract thought

972
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,380
I've ever heard on this exact show.

973
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,820
Listen, what I make is art

974
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,260
and it's up to your interpretation.

975
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,020
I'm not here to tell you how to feel

976
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,500
about the complicated idea I just laid before you.

977
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,940
You look at it, you sit on that bench,

978
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,940
maybe you try to draw it for your art class,

979
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,740
you do a shitty job because you're not where I am.

980
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,700
That's my art.

981
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,020
Travis is like Jackson Pollock,

982
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,220
but instead of paint diarrhea, it's like thought diarrhea.

983
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,260
That's correct.

984
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,700
Lap it up.

985
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,580
Jesus also lasagna flavored.

986
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,140
Oh, nailed it.

987
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,340
Two things are those.

988
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,340
I work at an escape room.

989
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,780
For the most part, I love my job.

990
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,540
Real quick, I gotta place an embargo right here.

991
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,420
We can't talk about the cool escape rooms we've gone on

992
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,020
because that'll take 25 minutes.

993
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,140
Okay, continue.

994
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,660
We'll save that for the after show.

995
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,380
But I will say that if you come to the lost escape room

996
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,300
in Huntington, you're in an area,

997
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,260
our dad is in like three of them.

998
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,940
In like the videos.

999
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,740
Not in the room.

1000
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,980
He might be in the room, but he is in the videos.

1001
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,140
Please free our daddy from the escape room.

1002
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,700
Tell no one.

1003
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,980
I think he's a private detective.

1004
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,700
It's amazing.

1005
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,220
Anyway, I love my job,

1006
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,860
but I really struggle when teams who are very terrible

1007
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,620
at the whole thing ask how they did.

1008
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,460
Usually I mumble some nonsense

1009
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,380
about how they solved a particular puzzle.

1010
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,420
I fear it's very obvious.

1011
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,940
I'm grasping at straws.

1012
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,620
What's the convenient line I could use

1013
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,740
for these hapless dummies to ask me this dreaded question?

1014
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,780
And it's from artisanal escape in Astoria.

1015
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,660
What kind of person do you have to be

1016
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,540
to do a very bad job and lose an escape room,

1017
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,060
but then also be like, how'd I do?

1018
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,180
Like, well, hypothetically,

1019
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,220
you would have died in there if that was a real room,

1020
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,580
so bad?

1021
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,620
I mean, you lie,

1022
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,340
but you need to do so while making eye contact

1023
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,580
with the actually good people in that group,

1024
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,220
who I guarantee are 50 times more frustrated

1025
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,660
than you are at that moment.

1026
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,140
Right.

1027
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,500
Or go the other way and be like,

1028
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
you're the only one who really solved it.

1029
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,620
Remember how you became so focused on that lamp

1030
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,860
and everybody else told you that the lamp was nothing

1031
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,900
and to leave the lamp alone

1032
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,500
because you spent 20 minutes on the lamp

1033
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,700
and it was just a lamp?

1034
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,460
You were right.

1035
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,260
You were right.

1036
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,660
Remember when you walked in and the lamp was the room?

1037
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,860
Do you remember when you walked over

1038
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,860
and you knocked all the chess pieces off the board,

1039
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,740
making the entire room unsolvable for everyone?

1040
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,380
That was so smart.

1041
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,300
That was so smart and cool.

1042
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,140
Do you remember when you ate one of the cookies

1043
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,100
that was on the plate

1044
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,620
and the number of cookies answered

1045
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,980
how to get out of the room?

1046
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,180
Do you remember we told you not to fool

1047
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,180
with the outlets or the vents

1048
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,220
and you unscrewed that one vent with your keys

1049
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,180
and tried to climb in it like John McClane?

1050
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,380
Your arm and head got stuck

1051
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,780
and we called the fire department

1052
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,820
and they had to come ply you out with the jaws of life

1053
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,980
and you lost your pinky finger.

1054
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,980
That was actually, you were very close.

1055
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,660
You were so close.

1056
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,860
You were supposed to lose your thumb.

1057
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,700
There was a key.

1058
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,100
If you just reached a little farther, there was a key.

1059
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,540
When you kept loudly suggesting

1060
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,980
that if everyone just kept farting at the same time,

1061
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,780
the pressure would blow the front door wide open,

1062
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,220
that you're the only one

1063
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,980
and good news, now you're the puzzle master.

1064
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,820
Wouldn't it be fun to have a puzzle escape room

1065
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,260
where at the end of it they lost

1066
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,620
and you say, well, did you pry the power outlets

1067
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,900
off the wall?

1068
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,780
They said, no, you told us specifically not to do that.

1069
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,940
It's like, huh, well, twist.

1070
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,100
I guess you still learned a little something today.

1071
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,260
Nothing is what it seems.

1072
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,620
Nothing is what it seems.

1073
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,620
I also said nothing is what it seems.

1074
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,900
Wouldn't you guys fucking love to make up an escape room?

1075
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,940
I think it would be so fun.

1076
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,540
I think I would, but then I would be so mad.

1077
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,980
I would be watching on the monitors

1078
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,380
and they'd solve a puzzle that I thought was really hard,

1079
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,060
but they do it in like 30 seconds

1080
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,140
and I just go down there and I'm like, no,

1081
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,500
you don't appreciate this enough.

1082
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,000
Leave.

1083
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,020
You're done.

1084
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,500
You escaped.

1085
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,660
You're rushing for your way.

1086
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,460
Gotta enjoy it.

1087
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,340
Savor the lock.

1088
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,300
Savor the lock.

1089
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,980
Did you smell the puzzle?

1090
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,340
I did a good job.

1091
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,100
I don't know why the escape rooms have

1092
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,420
to only challenge the mind.

1093
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:30,920
Yes.

1094
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,540
Why not have a big oiled man in the final,

1095
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,500
standing between you and the actual open door out

1096
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,140
of the place?

1097
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,780
So you open the-

1098
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,900
You do the code.

1099
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,420
Fresh air awaiting.

1100
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,620
Read the globe.

1101
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,740
You connect the dots.

1102
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,700
You turn off the light.

1103
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,860
You use the black light to find the four numbers,

1104
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,660
to turn the key, to swallow the cat, to eat the fly,

1105
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,980
and you open the door to the final lock.

1106
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,980
And there's Brutus.

1107
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,980
And there is a sign above him that says,

1108
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,620
fight the man.

1109
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,380
Fight the man.

1110
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,580
Fight the man for clue.

1111
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,380
Fight man for freedom.

1112
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,660
Fight man for clue.

1113
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,860
And sitting next to him is a six foot party sob

1114
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,180
you have to finish before you can get out the door.

1115
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,660
Yeah.

1116
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,740
Eating challenge, mind, body, stomach, everything.

1117
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,620
Fight man.

1118
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:23,860
Clue.

1119
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,780
And maybe just a challenging concept.

1120
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,940
And what do you think about the idea of faith?

1121
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,140
And you're like, oh, shit.

1122
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,700
Oh, shit.

1123
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,200
Okay.

1124
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,660
The clue's in the man.

1125
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:37,620
Unlock man.

1126
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,020
Unlock man.

1127
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,740
Fight clue.

1128
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,660
Use clue on man.

1129
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,580
Use clue on man.

1130
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,020
Use carrot on man?

1131
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,540
Aw, man ain't carrot.

1132
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,540
I like to stand in escape rooms and just say west, west, west.

1133
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,300
Use door.

1134
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:53,780
Damn it.

1135
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,620
Use note on door.

1136
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,620
Oh, fight man.

1137
00:53:59,460 --> 00:53:59,940
That's good.

1138
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,300
Make you try hug man.

1139
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,340
You would have had it.

1140
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,540
Yeah, you did actually.

1141
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,900
Love was the answer the whole time.

1142
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,700
You had to debate it.

1143
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,060
Love man, love self.

1144
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,300
Debate him about climate change.

1145
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,740
It wasn't a physical fight.

1146
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,100
God, he's a scientist who takes care of himself.

1147
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,700
He's just an in-shape scientist.

1148
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,940
What about your preconceived notions?

1149
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,460
Maybe that was the true challenge.

1150
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,420
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1151
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,700
We got a little bit more for you.

1152
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,100
Live from our live appearance at podcast convention too.

1153
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,620
Thanks again for coming out to it.

1154
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:37,700
And thank you to everyone we met there who was so very nice.

1155
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,420
We had a great time.

1156
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,380
We hope you did too.

1157
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,060
So that's going to do it for us, folks.

1158
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,340
So let's get without any further ado.

1159
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,220
Let's get back into the show.

1160
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,380
Hello, my name is Taylor.

1161
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,660
My pronouns are she, her.

1162
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,620
Hi, hi, Taylor.

1163
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,260
Hello.

1164
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,380
Okay.

1165
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,100
So I have a new boss at my office job and her and one of my co-workers do not get along.

1166
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:05,460
Sometimes they'll go into my boss's office and they like to have, I guess, quiet arguments.

1167
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:11,700
So my question is, what's the best way to eavesdrop so that I can, because sometimes

1168
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,660
like sometimes you can just hear them because they're loud enough.

1169
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,540
But other times it's like standing in my co-worker's doorway that's next to theirs.

1170
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,180
Okay.

1171
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,140
You got to have, you got to have the juice.

1172
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,380
Right.

1173
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:24,740
Got it.

1174
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:24,980
Okay.

1175
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,460
And what is your, your name and question?

1176
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,060
Hi, my name is Lisa.

1177
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,700
Lisa.

1178
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,020
Yeah.

1179
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,900
Pronouns she, her.

1180
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,780
My friend set me up with her fiance's cousin and-

1181
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,220
Oh, thank God you finished that.

1182
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:44,340
And on that setup, he threw up on my shoes and feet.

1183
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,740
She's planning on sitting me next to him at her wedding.

1184
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,620
How do I interact or get away from that?

1185
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:54,980
I really-

1186
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,740
Did the date go well other one?

1187
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,340
No, no.

1188
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,740
It was a real Prince Charming.

1189
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,380
There was one part.

1190
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:09,300
Uh, I want to do that question very badly, uh, because again, I don't know the best way

1191
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,100
to tell you to install a bug in your boss's office.

1192
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,380
That's going to sound ethical.

1193
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,180
I would, I would actually try just like walking past and just say like, King louder.

1194
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,660
Yeah.

1195
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,140
Please.

1196
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,540
Or, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

1197
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:21,940
Okay.

1198
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,420
Wait, hold on.

1199
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,220
I can help very quickly.

1200
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,620
Whisper into their ear as they're talking to, can I just take a moment?

1201
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,460
They said the meanest thing just a second ago.

1202
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:35,460
Just a second ago, you would not believe it and try to make them angrier.

1203
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,980
Cause if they're like really starting up, they might get into it a little deeper.

1204
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,220
Or just lean in and go, what are you arguing about?

1205
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,420
Hey, I want them writing it down.

1206
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,300
I learned shorthand for this.

1207
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,540
HR says I have to hear all of that.

1208
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,580
That happened once we had to call HR down because they were yelling very

1209
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,020
loudly and it was disturbing other people.

1210
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,220
That's why they whisper now.

1211
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:57,700
Okay.

1212
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:57,940
Yeah.

1213
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,700
Yeah, tell them it's a, tell them you're on a special HR mission

1214
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,900
and you have to listen to everyone.

1215
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,300
Tell them HR said this, it was too quiet now.

1216
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,580
They had to find a middle ground.

1217
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:08,660
Right.

1218
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,460
Does that help?

1219
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:09,940
Yeah.

1220
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,500
Average.

1221
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,300
Thank you, Taylor.

1222
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,940
And then I want to, I want to address the other one too.

1223
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,780
You asked what to do in that situation.

1224
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,340
I think the first thing you need to do is cheat a little bit to the right with the

1225
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,460
way that you're sitting next to this, next to this person.

1226
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,700
I say that they're probably, can I say something?

1227
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,540
They're probably not going to barf on you again.

1228
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,220
And you know, here's the wonderful thing about social anxiety.

1229
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,780
I bet they're more nervous than you are.

1230
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,420
I'd hope so.

1231
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,700
They were my favorite shoes.

1232
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,060
What?

1233
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,300
What?

1234
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,780
They were my favorite shoes and suede.

1235
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,500
Oh no.

1236
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,820
Did they refund, like pay for the shoes?

1237
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,260
No, he texted me the next day and I just never responded.

1238
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:51,700
Yeah.

1239
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,540
Well, you made the right choice there, I think.

1240
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:58,740
I think, although what a story that would have been.

1241
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,300
Yeah.

1242
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,180
How did you meet?

1243
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,260
Well, I wasn't sure at first, but it's what's inside that counts.

1244
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,660
Does that help?

1245
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,260
Definitely, yeah.

1246
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,060
Okay, excellent.

1247
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:18,660
Folks, thank you so much for coming to our podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1248
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:29,620
If you would like some merchandise based on our program, there are t-shirts and pins,

1249
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:34,580
some of which like pins you can't get online anymore over at the DFTBA booth over there.

1250
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,340
So go get them.

1251
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,540
Get it.

1252
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,900
It's Apple time.

1253
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,260
Apple time, folks.

1254
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,980
Apple time.

1255
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,780
Also, we have some more like thing and panels and meet and greets and stuff

1256
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,380
that we're doing tomorrow here at BotCon.

1257
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,820
So, but everybody does.

1258
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,060
So check out everyone else's stuff.

1259
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,260
Thank you all so much for coming.

1260
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,140
Like, this is wonderful.

1261
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,020
Yeah, this is incredible.

1262
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,420
Thank you.

1263
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,700
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1264
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:03,060
Maximum Fun is a great place for us to do our thousand podcasts,

1265
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,820
and we are very appreciative of them.

1266
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,620
And to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these four theme songs.

1267
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,460
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1268
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,100
Every week on My Brother, My Brother and Me, Griffin has like a final-

1269
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,300
Don't exit yet.

1270
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,980
Wait, hold on.

1271
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,180
There's still more goof.

1272
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,260
There's lots of good stuff coming.

1273
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,940
I mean, if you all need to go, please go ahead.

1274
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,300
Just don't start a stand.

1275
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,500
And leave me some pizza.

1276
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,460
There's a last question that Griffin says,

1277
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,700
and then we pretend like we're going to talk about it later.

1278
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,660
Here it comes.

1279
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,580
This one was sent in by Sid Ross.

1280
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,300
Thank you, Sid.

1281
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,940
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call.

1282
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,900
Jamison asks, does anyone else crush up Pringles?

1283
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,820
Pour some on the lid and then eat them like a pet licking water from a bowl?

1284
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,100
Or is that just me?

1285
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,140
My name is Justin McElroy.

1286
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,180
I'm Travis McElroy.

1287
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1288
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,340
It's been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1289
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:17,860
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1290
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,620
And I'm Julia Prescott.

1291
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,340
And we're the hosts of Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

1292
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,460
Every episode, we cover a different episode of The Simpsons.

1293
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,460
That is a favorite of our special guests.

1294
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,380
We've had guests that are showrunners and writers and voice actors like Nancy Cartwright.

1295
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,820
And we've also had people that are on the Max Fun Network already.

1296
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,900
We've had Weird Al Yankovic on the show.

1297
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,540
I was just struck by how sharp the writing is.

1298
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,460
I mean, that's no surprise because it's The Simpsons.

1299
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,340
But I mean, you can't say that about a lot of TV shows,

1300
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,540
particularly ones that at that point had been on the air for 14 years.

1301
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,100
Find us on MaximumFun.org, iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.

1302
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,580
All right.

1303
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:26,820
Smell you later.
