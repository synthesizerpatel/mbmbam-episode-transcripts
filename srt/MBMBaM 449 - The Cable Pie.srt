1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show from the

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,560
Modern Era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:09,280
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't, I can't contain myself anymore hearing that amazing annunciation and

9
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,360
that diction. It's because, you know, you got the lips. There's no tip of the tongue.

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,400
There's no Cheetos residue in there blocking the sound waves.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,520
The teeth. It's pick watch 2019. Had the water pick for a little over two weeks or so

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,640
sitting in the Amazon box and I looked at it every day and said, not yet, not yet, not yet.

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,360
But I had about 10 minutes to kill just before recording and I got in there and I just super

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,360
soaked the heck out of it. I had a lot of trepidation the first time I used my water

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,400
pick. I was fairly sure that there was, there's definitely a pressure at which you know you're

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,640
gonna rip it up in there and you're just sticking this tube in your mouth and going for it.

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,160
Yeah, I'm just worried that if I ever used one I would accidentally set it to sand blaster.

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah.

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,000
And it would just tear both the enamel and then everything underneath the enamel,

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,480
just straight out of my mouth.

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,280
But I gotta say refreshing other than the horrible pain of pressure washing my inside skin.

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,880
Uh-huh.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,400
I gotta say the results, folks, I saw a little bit of tastation come out of there.

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Yeah, and those haven't even been around since like 1999.

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
Do you think if we mentioned tastation's enough,

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,160
eventually the company will just give us the IP?

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
I don't think it exists. Wait, who owned it? Is that Nestle?

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,240
That's Hershey's if memory serves.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,040
Hershey's.

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,200
Yes. But anyway, I used the water pick today and my congressional medal of honor has yet

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,960
to appear and I'm confused about that.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,840
That's strange.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
Or at least a big boy sticker.

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,600
Griffin, I do need to know when you said the pain in your mouth,

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
the blasting your inside skin.

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,920
Blasting it.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Can you compare that? I've never used a water pick.

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
Could you compare that level of pain to something for me?

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
Have you ever used one of those massage chairs at the airport

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,880
that have like the balls in it that go in?

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,840
Imagine just putting your teeth right into one of those somehow,

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
like sort of sitting on it teeth first

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,280
and just sort of get over the hygiene issues associated with that.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,400
But, you know, physically that's sort of the feel that we're talking about.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
I don't care for that.

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,360
And then the water, there's a sort of, you know, manners issue

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,840
of what you do with the water as it's being blasted in.

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,120
You don't want anybody to see the unsightly side of you,

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
you know, getting on in there and just dribbling water out of your mouth

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,120
like some sort of sea monster.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
So do you swallow it all?

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
The answer is yes and it's bad.

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Now, I just assumed that as you did it,

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,040
you would kind of keep your mouth open

55
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,520
and it would just be like pouring from you

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,960
like a character in a sci-fi show that was drowning on dry land.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,440
Sure, like a human water feature situation.

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,920
Yeah.

59
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah, but folks-

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,680
You close your mouth tight around it, it'll blast out your nose

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
and then it'll do a number on the sizes.

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,960
But I have so much air moving between my-

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,480
The gaps between my teeth are so big

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
and I'd never appreciated it.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,520
The space between.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,320
Yeah, there's a little-

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
The gap between.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,240
Let him keep going.

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,720
I want to.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
That's all the words I know.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,040
That's all the words he knows

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
because it's the only words in the song.

73
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
I used my water pick today.

74
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,480
Let's not lose the point of this.

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,360
We can make jokes, but I used my water pick today.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,640
Where is that?

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,800
We need a combo t-shirt,

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
I used my water pick today and hey, I might go eat some charcuterie later.

79
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,080
What's up?

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,280
Just a two.

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,080
And then once the charcuterie is trapped in my teeth,

82
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,640
I'll use the water pick again in a never ending cycle until one day I die.

83
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,040
My favorite part is that the sort of relationship I've built

84
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,200
and how it's evolved with my dentist,

85
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,280
who at my first cleaning was like,

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,040
oh my God, because it had been a while since my last confession.

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,320
And then every sort of six months or so, he would be like,

88
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
wow, you really need to floss.

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,160
And he'd be like, you should really be flossing

90
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
or at the very least go get a water pick.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,480
And then like on my last appointment, he was like,

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
I know you're not going to floss.

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
I give up, go buy a water pick.

94
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
And then I used it two weeks later.

95
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,400
Are you sort of hesitant to use the teeth again?

96
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
You kind of hate to because it's like...

97
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
I'll be honest, yeah, a little bit.

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
And I'm trying, yeah.

99
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,040
So I'm trying to figure out if there's other holes I can get the food in.

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,680
If there's other sort of stuff I can do.

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, and other places to put the food.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
There's gotta be other places I can get the food in.

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
And I know the first thing you're gonna laugh and joke about

104
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,200
for this scuzzy podcast is my ass.

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,560
I would never.

106
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,960
I was going to say you could freeze dry it,

107
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
crush it up, snort it right up your nose.

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
That's now we're going somewhere with that.

109
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,120
Yeah, I'm trying to think outside the bun, Griffin.

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm not just gonna say ass.

111
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,320
Oh, you can put it up your, oh, put the food over your ass.

112
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Just eat like a pickle up your butt.

113
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
I would never say that.

114
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,520
But if you wanted to nose-boof some frozen shark udder-y,

115
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
then I don't think there's a law against that.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,440
I have an exciting new feature for the podcast

117
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
that I'd like to pivot seamlessly into.

118
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
Before, because Griffin mentioned Taste Stations.

119
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Half an hour ago.

120
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Half an hour ago.

121
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
My mind has been on Taste Stations.

122
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
And this feature, I think I'm gonna call it Where Is It Now?

123
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
And this is a feature where people on the internet

124
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
talk about a thing that they miss very dearly

125
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
and we can all share in that with them

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
and be there and bond with them.

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
And this is a thread from the Straight Dope.

128
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Are you guys down with this? Are you feeling this right now?

129
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Are you asking us or is this part of the comment?

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes, I'm asking you.

131
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Okay, yes, let's go.

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Are we good? Yes.

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Travis, verbal confirmation.

134
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
This is from the Straight Dope.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Wolfmeister.

136
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
February 27th.

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Holy fucking shit.

138
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Today, the day we're recording this,

139
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,720
exactly the day 15 years ago.

140
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
2004.

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Granted, this is not the most pressing matter of the day,

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
but I'm sure it's important to some people.

143
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I visited the Hershey's website in 2004,

144
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,720
and they don't even list it as one of their products.

145
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
On message boards, it is rumored to have been discontinued.

146
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Of course, the only message board that matters

147
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
is the Straight Dope message board.

148
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,720
So, are Hershey's Taste Stations discontinued?

149
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I find it hard to believe these things are popular.

150
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
IMHO, these are far better than Werther's,

151
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
which are incredibly overrated.

152
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Get them fucked up.

153
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
If Taste Stations have been discontinued,

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
is there anything similar out there?

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Werther's.

156
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
And you know what I think of Werther's.

157
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
They say it right here, you know what I think of Werther's.

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,720
And then, a day later, they say,

159
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
well, there's no responses, okay?

160
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,720
A day later, well, I see my posting has gone from

161
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
relative obscurity to total oblivion.

162
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Some of the dopers here must have a sweet tooth?

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Isn't anyone else a fan of these candies?

164
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Free Range Maniac follows up,

165
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I'm sure I've seen them up here.

166
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I work in a large chain drugstore,

167
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
so I'll have a look and see if I'm right.

168
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Maybe they just discontinued them in the States?

169
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I know you have candy and chocolate

170
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
we never see in Canada.

171
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Paul in Qatar says, what were they?

172
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Wolfmeister, the original Paul,

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Taste Stations are, perhaps were,

174
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
a great tasting hard candy,

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
sold in bags of about one pound.

176
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
They came in a lot of flavors,

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
butterscotch, caramel, and so on.

178
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
No, stop, that was it.

179
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
There's butterscotch, chocolate, and caramel.

180
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
So, there's not a so on, there's three total.

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
To me, and a lot of other people,

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
they were the greatest tasting candy ever made.

183
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Wait, they weren't, I'm sorry,

184
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
there wasn't like a strawberry and cream one?

185
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
What am I thinking of?

186
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
There was like a hard candy that was like a swirl.

187
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Ooh, yeah, I know what you're talking about,

188
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
but I don't know.

189
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Free Range Maniac says, yeah, I checked today,

190
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
they're being discontinued.

191
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Maybe they're more popular in Canada?

192
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
That was February 28th, 2004.

193
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
October 24th, 2012.

194
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Anno Domini, 2012.

195
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Chuckles14901 is coughing.

196
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,720
The dust, what's this old post?

197
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Look, I could just make it out.

198
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Some of the inscriptions here.

199
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
It's about taste stations.

200
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I gotta get my two cents on these.

201
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Hold on a second.

202
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Tap, tap, tap.

203
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
There are few candies as delicious as the taste stations.

204
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
The mint was smooth and refreshing.

205
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
The caramel is tasty.

206
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
But there's only one candy that ever made chocolate.

207
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Taste stations.

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Wow.

209
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,720
No one has made such a delicious candy as the chocolate,

210
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
which tastes like dark chocolate or fudge.

211
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
It is wondrous.

212
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
My heart is breaking.

213
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I would love it if I could find a place that still sells them

214
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
for shipment to the States.

215
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I would pay $10 a bag of mint and chocolate taste stations

216
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
shipping and handling not included.

217
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Wow.

218
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
So you can reach through time and find taste stations.

219
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
This can will pay you $10 for a bag,

220
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
just not going to cover the shipping and handling.

221
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Justin, this is see a need, fill a need kind of deal.

222
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm saying maybe the next McRoy endeavor isn't a podcast,

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
isn't a TV show, isn't a graphic novel.

224
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Bootleg taste stations.

225
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
It's bootleg taste stations.

226
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
If we're making 10 bucks a pound on these things,

227
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
now this is breaking bad too.

228
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
We got that crunchy brown.

229
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
We get some people to build some compartments

230
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
into their fenders on their old jalopies,

231
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
have them drive them down.

232
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Maybe we make them up in Canada

233
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
and then they drive them down to the States.

234
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
We sell them there and then we fly the money down to,

235
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I don't know, Cuba maybe, and we buy more ingredients there

236
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
and the cycle continues.

237
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Taste stations money, baby.

238
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
That was a lot of taste stations talk.

239
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Bring it back.

240
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
But I think in the meantime, we should do a question.

241
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
I love that, Griffin.

242
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
You read my mind basically.

243
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I was on a three hour drive this morning when I got hungry.

244
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I spotted a sign on the highway for a hotel chain

245
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
that I knew had free breakfast.

246
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I like whatever you're doing here, Justin.

247
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
This is a very like noir kind of reading you're doing.

248
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
I was on a three hour drive.

249
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
I think it's appropriate.

250
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I didn't know that going in, but I feel good about it.

251
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
It really works.

252
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Wanting to save a few dollars, I stopped at the hotel

253
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
and walked into the lobby pretending I was a guest.

254
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I went straight to the breakfast bar

255
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
and helped myself to biscuits.

256
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Oh my God.

257
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
And gravy.

258
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
I don't know if it was paranoia or if it was legitimate,

259
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
but as I was eating, I got the feeling the hotel staff knew

260
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
I wasn't supposed to be there.

261
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Unlikely.

262
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I was the only person in the breakfast area.

263
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,720
After seeing three of the hotel staff talk quietly

264
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
to each other and look my way,

265
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
I gulped down what was left of my orange juice

266
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
and made a run for it.

267
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I went out the hotel side of the door

268
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
as to avoid walking by the lobby,

269
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
and thus the staff turns out the side door

270
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
led directly to the outdoor pool.

271
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Keep reading.

272
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
There is a fence surrounding the pool

273
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
that is too high to jump.

274
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
And because I'm not a guest at the hotel,

275
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I don't have a key to get back in

276
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
and look for another exit.

277
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm stuck. Help.

278
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
What do I do?

279
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
That's from being caught stealing in Baton Rouge

280
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,720
and you deserve whatever you have received here.

281
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I've got a great suggestion.

282
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Go to jail.

283
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Go to jail.

284
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Go to jail for the crime you did.

285
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Go to... You fucked up this whole thing!

286
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
You couldn't at least go to the bathroom for like an hour

287
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
and then walk in from the bathroom and go eat.

288
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
The reason they know that you're there,

289
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
that you're not a guest at the hotel,

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
is because you walked in from out...

291
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
They saw you park your car, come into the hotel,

292
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
and eat their pancakes,

293
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
and then drink your juice really fast

294
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
as you looked around at them nervously

295
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
and then sprinted out the side door

296
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
to just go take a fever dip.

297
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
You fucked up every step of this heist

298
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
and you need to go to jail for it

299
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
and while you're there you can reflect

300
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
on how to do better heists.

301
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
You know where they got a lot of free breakfast?

302
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Jail. Jail at it.

303
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
All the free meals.

304
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
One time when mom and dad were visiting Norman, Oklahoma

305
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
where I went to college, Boomer Center,

306
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
they were like,

307
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
yeah, you and your friends come over.

308
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I think Brent went with me and they said,

309
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
and we'll get breakfast.

310
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
We went back to the hotel to meet them.

311
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
They just took us over to the continental breakfast

312
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
there at the hotel.

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm pretty sure that isn't how it worked.

314
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
I did eat it. I was very hungry.

315
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
I was in college.

316
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
I still feel tricked by dad

317
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
and by extension mom

318
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
saying, we'll get you breakfast.

319
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
By which I mean, Best Western will get you breakfast.

320
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Eat up.

321
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
They got it to you. You had it.

322
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
That's like saying, hey, do you want to go get lunch?

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Cool. Let's break into my neighbor's house

324
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
and I'll see if they have any sandwiches.

325
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Not at all like that.

326
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
That one's breaking and entering.

327
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
The other one is a bending, though not a breaking of policy.

328
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
It's a bending and entering.

329
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
If you were going to kick in the doors of this hotel,

330
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
if you were going to plant a C4 charge

331
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
in the front door of this hotel

332
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
and smash and grab some pancakes,

333
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm not against.

334
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
You know me.

335
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
If you're trying to save a buck with a little harmless steal,

336
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
I'm all for it. I love it.

337
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
But you would have been better served

338
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
planting a demolition charge in the front door of the hotel,

339
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
throwing in a smoke grenade,

340
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
running in, grabbing four muffins

341
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
and running out.

342
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
You did a bad, bad, bad job.

343
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Especially once you introduced that the food you ate

344
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
was biscuits and gravy.

345
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
If you grabbed an individual container

346
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
of Lucky Charms or you grabbed

347
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
a frozen Danish

348
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
that had been thawed out, that's fine.

349
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Someone made those biscuits and gravy.

350
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Absolutely.

351
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
You know what's wild about it, Travis?

352
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Thank you.

353
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
There's something about it that's been bothering me,

354
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
and it's only now occurred to me.

355
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
The fact that you sat down...

356
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
You motherfucker!

357
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
You didn't just want to steal.

358
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
You wanted to sit there and fucking relish it.

359
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I've never been to a continental breakfast

360
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
where you could not have swooped

361
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
a banana, some yogurt,

362
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
a Danish,

363
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
some, I don't know,

364
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
even a mouthful of bacon.

365
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
I mean, whatever.

366
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Whatever it is, you could have been

367
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
in and out before they even registered

368
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
your presence.

369
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
But no, you wanted to sit down and really enjoy

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
the ambiance

371
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
of the Holiday Inn Express.

372
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
And as long as we're just doubling down

373
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
on being angry at you,

374
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
our listener, the last sentence here

375
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
about, it turns out the side door...

376
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm assuming is now a skeleton

377
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
in the backyard of the Holiday Inn.

378
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
The side door leads to the outdoor pool.

379
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
There's a fence too high to jump,

380
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
and I do not have the key to look for another exit.

381
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
I feel like I'm playing fucking Zork.

382
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
I don't know what else is there.

383
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I can't send in my answer by mail.

384
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Do you have a holocaust cloak?

385
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Do you have a wheelbarrow?

386
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Or a deck chair?

387
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Something that could build an escape plan here.

388
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Let's do a yahoo.

389
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
I'm so mad.

390
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm not done.

391
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
We don't often ask for follow-ups,

392
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
but I would like a follow-up,

393
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
where we're told beat by beat

394
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
how the conversation of you offering to reimburse them

395
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
for the biscuits and gravy went.

396
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Like, excuse me, what are you doing out here?

397
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Uh, yes.

398
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I stole your breakfast.

399
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Okay, cool.

400
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
You're gonna have to rent a room now

401
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
to justify eating our breakfast.

402
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
How about I...

403
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Okay, let's play a game.

404
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
I don't want...

405
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Let's send jokes out of the room.

406
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
This is a skill testing puzzle for you.

407
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
You are gonna steal the breakfast.

408
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
You're not a guest at the hotel,

409
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
but you have to talk to the staff first

410
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
before you can steal breakfast.

411
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
What is the lie you're gonna make up?

412
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
You can't say you're a guest there.

413
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Are you ready? This is what I would do.

414
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm going to be checking in later,

415
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
but I know that check-in isn't until three o'clock.

416
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Would it be all right if I went ahead

417
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
and grabbed something from the breakfast board?

418
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
If I smash and grabbed something...

419
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
I didn't mean to say smash and grab.

420
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Can I break and enter into your breakfast place

421
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
and have the food?

422
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
I promise I will get you back later at three

423
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
when I definitely stay here.

424
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Here's my ID.

425
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
This is a Pokemon card.

426
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Rubble rubble!

427
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
My pockets are full of yogurt.

428
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
You missed it.

429
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
My dad was robbing you fucking blind

430
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
of Danish while you were talking to me.

431
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
All this trick in the book.

432
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Yeah, it's rough.

433
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
How about that Yahoo now?

434
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Yeah, I guess.

435
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Here's one that was sent in by Emma Kant.

436
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Thank you, Emma.

437
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
It's Yahoo Answers user Round Square who asks...

438
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Okay, come on.

439
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
How do I make other dogs respect my dog?

440
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
My dog lacks confidence

441
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
and is clearly not an alpha male.

442
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
He acts submissive towards other dogs

443
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
and tired of defending him all the time.

444
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
How do I teach him to defend himself

445
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
so he won't be bullied anymore?

446
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh, okay.

447
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
The question I'm asking probably means

448
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
physically defending him,

449
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
not like when your dog walks away saying,

450
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
hey guys, he's doing his best.

451
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Hey, can we all just be cool with Ralph?

452
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
How do I make other dogs respect my dog

453
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
who I have to defend with my human abilities?

454
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
The obvious answer is

455
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
you're gonna dress up like a dog

456
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
and then when your dog comes around,

457
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
you're all scared of that dog

458
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
and be like, oh, I wouldn't mess with that dog.

459
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Like, you guys see this guy over here?

460
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Oh, he's rough.

461
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
And then the other dogs will be like,

462
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
are you the actual Scooby-Doo?

463
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
And you're like, um, yes.

464
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
And then you let your dog kick your own ass.

465
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
He's my cousin.

466
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Scooby-Doo's my cousin

467
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
and I got a dad that works at Nintendo.

468
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
That dog just beat up Scooby-Doo's cousin

469
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
and Jim Tendo's son.

470
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
This new dog is cool as hell, guys.

471
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
His cousin is Scooby-Doo

472
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
and his dad works at Nintendo?

473
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Why is that other dog picking on him?

474
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Hey, jerk, leave Scooby-Doo's cousin alone.

475
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Back off of our new best friend,

476
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Scooby-Doo's cousin. We respect him.

477
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Oh, I was just about to show you guys

478
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
my four skateboards,

479
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
but it looks like I can get my ass kicked

480
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
by this big cool dog.

481
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
So that's backfired.

482
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Oh, my plan.

483
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Oh, that's the one.

484
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
No, that's working as intended

485
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
because the cool dog is your dog.

486
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
How did you guys lose the plot that fast?

487
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
No, but I'm just saying everybody loves Scooby-Doo's cousin.

488
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
They don't want to see him beat up.

489
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
That is the fiction that develops

490
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
and everybody likes the new giant dog,

491
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
the new man-sized dog so much.

492
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Well, then you show up the next day

493
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
and you're horribly injured

494
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
and cool dog, your dog,

495
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
has taken care of you

496
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
and is nursing you back to health.

497
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
You know what? I like that cool dog.

498
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
He brings Scooby-Doo's Nintendo cousin around.

499
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
We hunked out our differences.

500
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Yeah, we figured it out together.

501
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Maybe we go the other way then

502
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
and opposite of my plan

503
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
and you dress your dog up like a human

504
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
and then teach him to walk on two legs

505
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
and then you bring him around.

506
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
All dogs, I think, instantly have

507
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
some form of respect for a human.

508
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
I think that's a good part.

509
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
And then you get him a fake ID

510
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
that's old enough to buy beer

511
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
and then the other dogs are going to be so fucking stoked.

512
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Yeah.

513
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I don't know of a dog old enough to buy beer.

514
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
I don't think there's ever been a 21-year-old dog.

515
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
That's the dog dream.

516
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Every dog is like,

517
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
if one of us can just make it to 21,

518
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
we're going to fucking party.

519
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
I told you to quit smoking, Jerry.

520
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
No, I mean, for a dog, that is three.

521
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
So a three-year-old dog can stumble

522
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
into a super America and say,

523
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
let me get that high life, please.

524
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Yeah, I mean,

525
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
you got to get your dog jacked.

526
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
You got to get your dog fucking diesel.

527
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
Yolked huge.

528
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
And I don't know how you do that.

529
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I don't know how you do that.

530
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
I don't know if there's dog gyms.

531
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
I know you can take them somewhere

532
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
to train them for Westminster and all that.

533
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
But I don't know how you get them.

534
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
There's no Ninja Warrior gyms for dogs, I don't think.

535
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Can dogs build muscle?

536
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
I was a dog trainer for a while

537
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
and I don't know the answer to this question.

538
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Can dogs develop new muscle?

539
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
And I'm terrified of this.

540
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
I mean, if you crank them full of pure whey

541
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
and get them, you know,

542
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
pulling tires, doing some CrossFit,

543
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
five, you know,

544
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
seven hours, five days a week,

545
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
then they'll die.

546
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
So don't do that.

547
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
But there's got to be another way.

548
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Oh, I know.

549
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
I freaking got it.

550
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Oh.

551
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
You put the mask on them.

552
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Oh.

553
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
From the mask.

554
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Okay, capital T, capital M, the mask.

555
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Or the son of mask,

556
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
when the dog gets it on and gets really, really big.

557
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
I think the dog gets on both of them, Gervin.

558
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
So either one, you are correct.

559
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Somebody stop him.

560
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Somebody stop him, indeed.

561
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
He's peeing all over everyone.

562
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
And his pee is so hard, it's like a fire hose.

563
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
It's so powerful, it has killed Jamie Kennedy.

564
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
We are down one lead actor.

565
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Please, somebody save Jamie Kennedy

566
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
from that dog.

567
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Did that dog just piss so hard

568
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
that Jamie Kennedy died?

569
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
That's a cool dog.

570
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Not another Kennedy.

571
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
That there is an elf.

572
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Did you know that Jamie Kennedy is Robert Kennedy

573
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
and John F. Kennedy's little brother?

574
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Did you know that?

575
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I did not know that, Travis.

576
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
He's the last one.

577
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
I started a new job about five months ago,

578
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
and one of my coworkers and I started bonding

579
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
over mediocre romance novels.

580
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I haven't read any since middle school

581
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
because they're so heteronormative.

582
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Not hot.

583
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
But I remember a lot about them

584
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
because my mom still loves to read them all.

585
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
My coworker is in her 60s,

586
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
and she's just happy to have something to talk about,

587
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
so I didn't mention this.

588
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Two months ago, she recommended this series

589
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
of 20-ish books that she has all of

590
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
and offered to lend me the first one.

591
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
I accepted with no intention of reading it

592
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
and returned it after a week saying it was really good.

593
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Oh, no! God damn it!

594
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
This is before you fuck up!

595
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
This is the breaking into the hotel breakfast

596
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
of human social interchanges.

597
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
This is rough.

598
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
She came in the next day with the next three books.

599
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Now I'm on book eight.

600
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
I have not read any of them.

601
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
How do I make her stop?

602
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Oh, my God.

603
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
And that's from, oh, God, there's actually 26 books.

604
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Folks, you have to tell us the names of these franchises.

605
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Yeah.

606
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
And you have to reach out to us

607
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
before you fuck up.

608
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
But I will say at this point,

609
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
it seems like you've already got

610
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
a fine trajectory going.

611
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
You've made it through eight.

612
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
You've got 18 more to go.

613
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
If you could just keep up this, like,

614
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
take it away for a week, bring it back,

615
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
like, yeah, super hot.

616
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
I loved all the caressing.

617
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
And then, like, maybe you can make it through all 26

618
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
and come out the other side.

619
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Half a year gone, yes,

620
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
but you're free now.

621
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Free from this genie's cave.

622
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Sorry, guys, I gotta go sign for a package.

623
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Yep.

624
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Oh, gotta sign for a package.

625
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Nice.

626
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
This is how all great

627
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
romance novels start, right?

628
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Yeah.

629
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Somebody shows up at your door with probably

630
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
alcohol if you have to sign for it

631
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
and be over 21.

632
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Griffin took out

633
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
the stylus and whipped

634
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
his stylus around,

635
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
signing on the tiny

636
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
electronic pad.

637
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
The letter spilled out of his

638
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
hand.

639
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Like so much black jizz

640
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
first a G.

641
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Black ink jizz.

642
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Ink jizz first a G

643
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
and an R

644
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
and then an I and an F.

645
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Could you spell your last name for me,

646
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
said the delivery person.

647
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
I'm about to climb it.

648
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
I'm totally gonna finish.

649
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Although I am gonna deliver

650
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
an orgasm to you.

651
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
I'm delivering a plentiful

652
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
orgasm.

653
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Did you need another orgasm? I could be back

654
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
tomorrow with another delivery.

655
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Or go back and add your middle

656
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
name and I'll climax again.

657
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Yeah.

658
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
What did I come back to?

659
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
What did you come back to indeed, Griffin?

660
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Yeah.

661
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
How was the delivery?

662
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I was signing for a package. Did you guys

663
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
already come up with like funny fake names

664
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
for the thing? Cause I usually do those.

665
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
But if you already did them, I don't want to double up.

666
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Wait, sign for what? Sign for a package?

667
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Wait, what?

668
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
We were making it like you were in a romance novel

669
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
where you were being romanced by the delivery person.

670
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Oh, and I was gonna make love to the mail carrier.

671
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Yeah, you said you had to sign for a package.

672
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Okay, so yeah, I can tell you

673
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
what happened down there if you want.

674
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Yeah, make it saucy.

675
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
His name was

676
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Garbanzo.

677
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Yeah, the sexiest name.

678
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
He was eight feet

679
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
long.

680
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Whoa!

681
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
He handed me my

682
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
package. I said,

683
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
this looks like the

684
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
special shoes I ordered

685
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
for the boat. And then he said,

686
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
yes, yes it is.

687
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
You ordered

688
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
special orthopedic boat shoes?

689
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
I ordered boat shoes,

690
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
but not boat shoes,

691
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
but shoes for a boat. Do you know what I'm saying?

692
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Anyway, Garbanzo.

693
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Go into

694
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
extreme detail. I'm done with

695
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
pornography. Go into extreme detail about your boat shoes.

696
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Are they shaped like boats?

697
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Boat shoes. They breathe really well.

698
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Anyway, Garbanzo said,

699
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
have fun on the boat. This is just chapter one.

700
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
You don't bork in chapter one.

701
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Of course. I wish that they

702
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
would. Just get that out of the way. Chapter one of the

703
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
romance novel is where all

704
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
the sex happens. And then the next 27

705
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
chapters is just like a character doing

706
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
their taxes. Yeah, but the problem

707
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
is Garbanzo turned into

708
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
a swarm of bats. He flew away.

709
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Classic. Sexy.

710
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Yeah, now how can I resist?

711
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
The bats?

712
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Yeah, let me get it

713
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
in that cloud of bats. Nothing

714
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
makes me heartier than Garbanzo.

715
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
The cloud swarm of bats.

716
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
That's

717
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
my favorite Night Vale character.

718
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
In case anybody's been

719
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
asking, my favorite Night Vale character is

720
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Garbanzo, the swarm of bats.

721
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
It's also my favorite Magic Tavern

722
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
character. It's a

723
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
crossover

724
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
event. And

725
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Gryphon has sex with him.

726
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Not yet.

727
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Magic Tavern already does

728
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
have a living swarm of bats

729
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
as a character. That's such a better

730
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
show than ours. Should we go to the

731
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
money zone at least? Yeah, they don't have

732
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
a money zone.

733
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Go ahead and start.

734
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
I gotta feed the cats.

735
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
They're scratching at my door. Ooh.

736
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Gotta feed the cats. Uh oh.

737
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
I wasn't here for the last time you did this,

738
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
but are we gonna be like,

739
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
does that make you horny, baby?

740
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
No, Gryphon.

741
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Here's one about Casper.

742
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Casper makes mattresses

743
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
and when you get on

744
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
them and you fall asleep,

745
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
then it's the best.

746
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
The best dreams.

747
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
You definitely get the best dreams.

748
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Your bones

749
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
feel better and

750
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
get longer while you sleep

751
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
on them because of how it sort of

752
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
cradles your natural geometry.

753
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Creates an environment

754
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
that is really, really

755
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
compatible with bone

756
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
elongation.

757
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
There is one thing. It's while you're

758
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
asleep, you're actually absorbed

759
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
within the mattress. Yes.

760
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
As soon as you wake up, you're popped right back on top.

761
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
So you're absolutely fine. You'll never know it.

762
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
You won't know it unless

763
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
the Goblin King comes up.

764
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Yes. Now you've got an

765
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
issue, but Casper guarantees

766
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
90.9.9999

767
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
99% chance

768
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
the Goblin King will not attack.

769
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
No way. So

770
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
we have not done any of the things that they

771
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
want us to say yet. So here's a lot of that.

772
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
They got free shipping and returns

773
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
to the US and Canada.

774
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
It's no hassle if you're not satisfied.

775
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
You get to try it for 100 nights and then

776
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
if you don't like it, you just send it right back

777
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
and you banish the Goblin King right back to

778
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
once he came.

779
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
I think we all have Caspers at this

780
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
point. You've heard us talk about how comfortable they are,

781
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
but I'll say it again. It's pretty freaking

782
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
comfortable. You can get $50 towards

783
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
select mattresses by visiting

784
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
casper.com slash brother and using the promo code

785
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
brother at checkout, that's casper.com slash

786
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
brother and promo code

787
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
brother for $50 towards select mattresses.

788
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Terms and conditions apply.

789
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
I'm starting to think that these businesses

790
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
listen to our show because they've stopped including

791
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
the phrase enter my brother in here.

792
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Yes. They've wised up.

793
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
I would like to tell you about

794
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
MeUndies. Now we've

795
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
talked about MeUndies before. I could tell you

796
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
about their underpants

797
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
and shirts, which are like three times

798
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
softer than cotton.

799
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
They're different prints.

800
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
You can get like solid colors, adventurous prints,

801
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
you can match with your partner, whatever.

802
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
I want to talk about the sleep pants,

803
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
which is I think

804
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
maybe the greatest invention ever given

805
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
to humankind. Real good.

806
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
They are the comfiest things

807
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
I've ever worn, ever.

808
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
And I would like to be buried

809
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
in them. And you can get

810
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
your 15% off your

811
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
first pair of MeUndies free shipping

812
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
and 100% satisfaction guarantee

813
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
if you go to MeUndies.com

814
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
slash my brother, that's MeUndies.com

815
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
slash my brother.

816
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Do you have teeth?

817
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Yes.

818
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
But if he wants the space between

819
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
clean, he's got that covered,

820
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
but what about the nasty fronts and backs?

821
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Well, that is the

822
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
purview of Quip.

823
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
The backs and fronts are

824
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
awes. They're awes. Back away,

825
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
what a pig. Oh, they're affordable

826
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
teeth. Sorry.

827
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Are you doing

828
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
something else right now while

829
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
talking about this? No, I just

830
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
sat back down. I'm trying to get my fucking bearings.

831
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Quip was designed to make brushing

832
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
your teeth more simple, affordable, and

833
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
even, dare we say it,

834
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
enjoyable. They've got

835
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
sensitive sonic vibrations

836
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
and a built-in two-minute

837
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
timer that pulses

838
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
every 30 seconds to remind you to switch sides.

839
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Brush heads are automatically

840
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
delivered on a dentist-recommended

841
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
schedule every three months for just $5.

842
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
You know, it's always exciting to get a

843
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
package, and sometimes it's toothbrush

844
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
heads. Quip is

845
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
backed by over 20,000 dental

846
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
professionals. Quip starts at just

847
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
$25, and if you

848
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
go to getquip

850
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720

851
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
now, you get your first refill

852
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
pack for free with a Quip electric toothbrush.

853
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
That's a refill pack

my brother.

858
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Wow, that jingle

859
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
was free, so they didn't even

860
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
have to pay for that extra.

861
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Unlike Griffin Space Jam,

862
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
which I had to pay $500,000.

863
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
I'm so rich. Have you

864
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
ever watched a movie so bad you

865
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
just needed to talk to somebody about it?

866
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Well, here at the Flophouse, we watch a bad

867
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
movie and then talk about it. Yeah,

868
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
you don't have to do anything. We'll watch it and

869
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
we'll talk it. We do the hard work.

870
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Featuring the beautiful vocal talents of

871
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Dan McCoy, Stuart

872
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Wellington, and me, America's

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
rascal, Elliot Kalin. New episodes

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
or wherever you get your podcast, dude.

876
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Bye-bye.

877
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Bye-bye.

878
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Level 9000,

879
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Drew Drew, Drew Davenport. Thank you, Drew.

880
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
It's from an anonymous

881
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Yahoo Answers user, who I'm gonna call

882
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Baby Boy Asks.

883
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Alright.

884
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Jim Carrey tribute party?

885
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Smiley face emoticon?

886
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
His best movies he's

887
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
made. Top 6?

888
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
Things I should decorate with. Food.

889
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Activities. Contest.

890
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Music. Ect.

891
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Which I believe is supposed to

892
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
mean, etc.

893
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Anything to make this party off

894
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
the roof.

895
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Ultimate.

896
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
The thought, again. Anything to

897
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
make this party off the roof. Ultimate.

898
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Ha ha. Smiley face emoticon.

899
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Please.

900
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,720
And thanks. I would say

901
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
just off the top of my head, if you

902
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
want to make it

903
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
like, a real

904
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
ultimate Jim Carrey tribute party,

905
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
you're going to need to reference

906
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Copper Mountain.

907
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
The film he did in 1983

908
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
that was a made-for-TV movie, co-starring

909
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Alan Thicke.

910
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
That was basically

911
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
an hour-long

912
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
commercial for a

913
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Club Med location.

914
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
That sounds great.

915
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
Listen, a great film.

916
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
You could also maybe do

917
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
All in Good Taste.

918
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
We know, we know. Hey, did you guys know

919
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
that Travis knows a lot of Jim Carrey stuff?

920
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Yeah, we get it.

921
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Let's talk about snacks.

922
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Number one, he's Eggman in the new Sonic movie.

923
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
So I would say eggs.

924
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
And that one's taken care of.

925
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
That one's taken care of.

926
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Maybe just pieces of rubber.

927
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
In that TV show he's on,

928
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
I think he's got a puppet or

929
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
something named Mr. Pickles.

930
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
So, pickles.

931
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
How about some incredible Burt Wonder toast?

932
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
That's good.

933
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
It would be Burt toast.

934
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
It would be another one of those things.

935
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Oh, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Guacamole.

936
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
That's very good. Earth girls are cheesy.

937
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
That's good. What's that one?

938
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Earth girls are easy.

939
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Yeah, I know, but like...

940
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Oh, it's just cheese, but you get cookie cutters

941
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
and it's like, you know,

942
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
shaped like a woman.

943
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
There's also the Cable Pie.

944
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
That's pretty good.

945
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
You're gonna take all those spare

946
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
HDMI cables or those red, white,

947
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
and yellow cables that we don't use anymore

948
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
and you're gonna put those in a short crust.

949
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Mm-hmm. Plum and plumber.

950
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Oh, delicious.

951
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
It's a bunch of plums and you put

952
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
a picture of Christopher Plummer on them.

953
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
We're gonna start off the evening

954
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
with some aperitifs.

955
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
We got a sampling of different

956
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
beers to enjoy. It's called the

957
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
All Flighty, then.

958
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
That's pretty good.

959
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
It's a good place to start. The Man on the Moon pie.

960
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
That's snacks. We got snacks

961
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
that we fucking nailed down six years ago.

962
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Friar Friar.

963
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Things I should decorate with.

964
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
I think a big sign over the front door

965
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
of the party that says, do go in there

966
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
is a good start.

967
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Yeah, it's good.

968
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
End of that one, though.

969
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Decorations are harder than snacks.

970
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
You blew right past snacks.

971
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
I didn't blow right past snacks.

972
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
We spent a long time in snacks,

973
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
but we have lots of things to figure out.

974
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
I agree myself on pie-reen.

975
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
It's just like your pie.

976
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
I can't believe this dude's

977
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
playing fucking Dr. Robotnik.

978
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
I need to take a minute

979
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
away from the bit and just close my eyes

980
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
and visualize that good

981
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
wrench heat he's gonna bring to this

982
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
honored role of Dr.

983
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Ivo Robotnik.

984
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Don't forget the series of

985
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
unfortunate events heat too, Griffin.

986
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
He's been so great in character roles

987
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
in the last five to ten years.

988
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
God, I can't wait.

989
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Hey, I've got an idea

990
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
for the party.

991
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Why don't you have

992
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Ed Harris show up

993
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
and just every once in a while

994
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
peek at people from behind

995
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
a corner or something like that

996
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
with his camera.

997
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Wait, so is Ed Harris a decoration in your mind?

998
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Yeah, he's decoration.

999
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Ed Harris is sort of a performance.

1000
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
I do like that.

1001
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Let's move from closet to closet

1002
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
and whisper like, zoom in.

1003
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Zoom in.

1004
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Darryl's double dipping.

1005
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
He's double dipping

1006
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
in the guacamole.

1007
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Zoom in on Darryl's

1008
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
gross dip.

1009
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
So,

1010
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
I think activities.

1011
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Mr. Popper's penguins. That one speaks for itself.

1012
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Mm-hmm.

1013
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Every time a new guest comes in,

1014
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
you say, I love you, Philip Morris.

1015
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
I say, yes, ma'am.

1016
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
That's a good sort of call and response.

1017
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Also, you could all just have free cigarettes out.

1018
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
That could also be the smoking movie.

1019
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
That's good.

1020
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Also, you could confront some of your friends

1021
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
who have been lying to you for a while.

1022
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Like, if you know

1023
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
you have an untrustworthy friend,

1024
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
there's going to be a chance to be like, liar, liar,

1025
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
and then see who's lying.

1026
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Or you could make it a fun party game,

1027
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
but I like mine better where it's like

1028
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
the culmination of maybe some

1029
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
deep-seated distrust.

1030
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
If we wanted to do a contest,

1031
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
we could just do

1032
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Jim Carrey impressions.

1033
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Well,

1034
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
the problem is everyone's super good at them.

1035
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
So, it just ends up being a tie.

1036
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Like, Justin, do yours.

1037
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Okay.

1038
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Um, hello?

1039
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Hey, I'm Latke.

1040
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Okay.

1041
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
That's my impression of Jim

1042
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
doing an impression of Andy

1043
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
doing an impression of Latke from Taxi.

1044
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
Here, can I do one?

1045
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1046
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Looks like they got murdered with a knife made out of their own bones.

1047
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
And that's from Dark Crimes,

1048
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
his 2016 movie he did.

1049
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
Ah, cool, cool, cool.

1050
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Yeah, this is sort of a darker...

1051
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Here, can I try again?

1052
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Disgusting number keeps showing up.

1053
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
I love this character.

1054
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
I remember this film.

1055
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Just finish the impression.

1056
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Disgusting number keeps showing up

1057
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
all over the dang place.

1058
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Did you figure it out yet?

1059
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Farts.

1060
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
And that's, I believe...

1061
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Oh no, Griffin broke himself.

1062
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
It's just nice to laugh.

1063
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
It's just nice to laugh.

1064
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
It really is.

1065
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Did we do all of them? What didn't we do?

1066
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Oh, music.

1067
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Just play that fucking Cuban Pete from The Mask.

1068
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Until everyone leaves.

1069
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
I think I could make it through three.

1070
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
It depends on how good the spotless mind guacamole is.

1071
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Because that might get me to stay for a couple more.

1072
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Yeah, I think that's it.

1073
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Oh, with the Etcetera.

1074
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
I think Etcetera is just

1075
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
invite Jim Carrey to be there.

1076
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,720
He would have a great time.

1077
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
He's the only guest.

1078
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,720
He's the only guest. This party's almost certainly going to go off the roof.

1079
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Someday...

1080
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
You guys promised me someday

1081
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
we can record a commentary track

1082
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
for Ace Ventura or Pet Detective Jr.

1083
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I think about...

1084
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
Do you guys have things that you think about a lot?

1085
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
That you haven't seen?

1086
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Yeah, my wife and kids.

1087
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
Theoretically.

1088
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
But you can't really bring yourself to actually ingest.

1089
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Oh, so it would be a coming in fresh commentary track.

1090
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah, it would be like a first time watch.

1091
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Because Ace Ventura or Pet Detective Jr. is like that for me.

1092
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Came out in fucking 2009.

1093
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Never seen it.

1094
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
I watched the trailer for it probably 500 times.

1095
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
And I've never watched the movie.

1096
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Because I know it wouldn't be pleasurable.

1097
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
But I am like obsessed with the idea that it exists.

1098
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
I guess is the best way of putting it.

1099
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Do you guys have stuff like that?

1100
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,720
I still have not seen...

1101
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
Oh, what's the fucking Johnny Depp?

1102
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
Mordecai. I still have not seen...

1103
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
I've seen a lot of Mordecai.

1104
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
But I couldn't finish it.

1105
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
I watched I think the first 25 minutes of it.

1106
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Yeah, I was about to say Mordecai didn't age well.

1107
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
But Mordecai didn't birth well.

1108
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Yeah.

1109
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
This is shame.

1110
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
How about another question?

1111
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah, I love that.

1112
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
Farm wisdom.

1113
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Farm wisdom.

1114
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Farm wisdom.

1115
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Don't make a blunder down under farm wisdom.

1116
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
That's not farm wisdom.

1117
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
This is a farm wisdom.

1118
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
That's right.

1119
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
We're going to farm wisdom Australia in addition.

1120
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
From Ben Hetherington.

1121
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
No, wrong.

1122
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
No way was that right.

1123
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Ben Hetherington.

1124
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Yes, you fully skipped it.

1125
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
We fully did.

1126
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
I was coming in hot.

1127
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
There's a lot of letters all jumbled together.

1128
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
I was just trying to churn through.

1129
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
Ben Hetherington missed farm wisdom.

1130
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
And rather than

1131
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
complain like some people do when they miss

1132
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
bits, Ben made it happen.

1133
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,720
Bringing us some

1134
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Australian farm

1135
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
wisdom.

1136
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
If you have farm wisdom, submit.

1137
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Please do.

1138
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
This is one of my favorite segments to do.

1139
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
It's just hard to find the exact right flavor.

1140
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
But I think Ben has done an admirable job

1141
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
here. Kangaroos

1142
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
and emus

1143
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
cannot walk backwards.

1144
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
The structure of a kangaroo's pelvis and tail

1145
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
won't allow it. However,

1146
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,720
nobody knows why emus

1147
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
can't.

1148
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
It might just be won't.

1149
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
But that's why they're both featured on the

1150
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
Australian government's coat of arms

1151
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
and out

1152
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
in the 50 cent coin.

1153
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
They're supposed to signify

1154
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
that our country is always moving forward.

1155
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
I would maybe hazard

1156
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
that there are other reasons kangaroos

1157
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
are on the Australian currency.

1158
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
But I do like Ben's

1159
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
suggestion here.

1160
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
Yeah, ad astra and all that.

1161
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Hmm. Ben?

1162
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
You got these things

1163
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,720
running around on a farm, bud? Maybe an emu?

1164
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
I'll give you that because they have the big eggs.

1165
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
But I've never had

1166
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
kanga milk, I don't think.

1167
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
People eat kanga meat.

1168
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,720
I mean kangaroo meat is

1169
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
pretty popular.

1170
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
There's commercial kangaroo farming.

1171
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
There's a commercial kangaroo industry.

1172
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Yeah, so read a book, Griffin.

1173
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
Yeah, read a book.

1174
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
I would like to pause it, Ben, and I don't want to put you on blast,

1175
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
but I say this only because it's exactly what I would do.

1176
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
Is it possible that

1177
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
some people might know why

1178
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,720
emus don't work backward and you don't?

1179
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Nobody knows.

1180
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
Okay.

1181
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
I bet somebody knows.

1182
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Apparently, according to the

1183
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Wikipedia article called

1184
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
kangaroo meat, that my day has taken

1185
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
a strange, twisty turn.

1186
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
I didn't expect to be here when I woke up.

1187
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
There's a thing called kangatarianism.

1188
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
And that's where you

1189
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
only kangaroo

1190
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
meat. You're so wild

1191
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
for it. And it's apparently

1192
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
based on environmental and ethical grounds.

1193
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
Unsurprising.

1194
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Goats smell really bad. Surprising.

1195
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
It's a common occurrence

1196
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,720
here to catch wild goats,

1197
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
and the best way to do so

1198
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,720
is to track them by smell.

1199
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Wild goats

1200
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
are common in areas in northern

1201
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
New South Wales and southern

1202
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
Queensland and Australia, and can fetch

1203
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
a tiny profit when sold to a goat farm.

1204
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Even with our especially blunt

1205
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
sense of smell, a person can tell

1206
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
the size and distance of a goat herd

1207
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
at distances of up

1208
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,720
to a mile.

1209
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Yeah, I mean, goats don't smell

1210
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
very good.

1211
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
Damn, that was funny!

1212
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
I'm just on the Wikipedia

1213
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
page called kangaroo industry, and I'm

1214
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
trying to turn my fucking ignorance

1215
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
ship right around. You can't get me

1216
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
I'm reading about the kangaroo

1217
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
meat industry, and you come at me and you're like

1218
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
goats don't smell good. There's

1219
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,720
two pieces of information presented to me. I'm

1220
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
going to go with the savouriest nug.

1221
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Dingo's eating lamb

1222
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,720
has been a big problem for stock farmers in Australia,

1223
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
and the easiest solution is to buy

1224
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
alpacas. Alpacas hate

1225
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,720
the living shit out of dogs.

1226
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
Wild or domestic, it will

1227
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,720
often bomb a sheep and act as their guardians.

1228
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
Alpacas can deliver a devastating

1229
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
kick.

1230
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
And a devastating insult.

1231
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Yeah, they're so mean. They're insult

1232
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,720
comedies beyond reproach.

1233
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Alpacas can deliver a kick

1234
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
as their hooves will grow in

1235
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,720
displayed claws if not trimmed,

1236
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
and can hit anything within two

1237
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,720
yards in any direction.

1238
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
The lamb birth rate can be

1239
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
significantly improved by

1240
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
having alpacas in the herd

1241
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,720
because they make sheep feel safe, and the

1242
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
reduced stress allows the ewes

1243
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
to carry a lamb to term.

1244
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
This is fucking

1245
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
soup to nuts

1246
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,720
bananas. What this

1247
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
has said is

1248
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
like, let's just

1249
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
take it one thing at a time.

1250
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,720
Okay, the dingos eat lambs.

1251
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,720
Yes, that all tracks for me.

1252
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,720
Alpacas hate dogs.

1253
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
Okay, I will have to take

1254
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
your word for it on that. Alpacas

1255
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
can deliver a devastating

1256
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
kick as their hooves will

1257
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,720
grow in displayed claws if not

1258
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,720
trimmed. So you basically have to choose

1259
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
an alpaca that you are making

1260
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
bad already. You are

1261
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
letting grow into a battling alpaca.

1262
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
And can

1263
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
hit anything within two

1264
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,720
yards.

1265
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
That's six feet. What?

1266
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
What are these

1267
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
alpacas fucking doing?

1268
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
Yeah, they look. In what sense

1269
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
Ben? They look so goofy, but

1270
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,720
they're actually the predator.

1271
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
Apparently.

1272
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,720
They can kick up to six feet.

1273
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
Am I understanding that correctly?

1274
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,720
If I'm understanding it correctly, up to six feet.

1275
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,720
I don't see how it's possible.

1276
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,720
I think two feet of that's just

1277
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
claws.

1278
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,720
I also, I think my

1279
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,720
favorite part of this though, is like a

1280
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,720
sheep looks around, sees what

1281
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
he has to assume is a giant version

1282
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
of itself and says, that

1283
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,720
makes me feel comfortable fucking.

1284
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
That's chill as hell. I'm gonna

1285
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
totally carry this baby to term now. Look at that

1286
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,720
giant ass sheep here.

1287
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,720
If I looked over and there was like a twelve foot

1288
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
Travis. His legs

1289
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,720
were guns.

1290
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
I feel comfortable now.

1291
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,720
I'm horny as hell.

1292
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Let's go. How about a question

1293
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,720
or is there more farm wisdom?

1294
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
That's all the farm wisdom I have. I like that.

1295
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,720
I mean I ask for more as if I need more.

1296
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
I am sated. That's good. That's good stuff.

1297
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,720
Thank you Ben. Folks, keep that farm wisdom

1298
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,720
coming in. Would love to

1299
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,720
have a little bit more of it. How about another

1300
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
question here. Every so often

1301
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,720
some coworkers and I will go out for a night of

1302
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,720
KOK. We all have fun,

1303
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,720
but I'm easily the worst singer.

1304
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
Kinda screechy. God I love that fucking

1305
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,720
awareness. Inspirational.

1306
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,720
I'm the worst singer in the group and

1307
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,720
this draws a lot of teasing from the whole office floor.

1308
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
I have a good sense of humor

1309
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,720
and I'm happy that everyone can laugh at my

1310
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,720
mangled 80's hits. But I thought

1311
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,720
taking an actual singing lesson would help me get

1312
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,720
out of the comically bad range. To my surprise

1313
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,720
a number of my coworkers were very against

1314
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
the idea of lessons. Saying that I was

1315
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,720
taking it too seriously and being a

1316
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
killjoy. Should I continue

1317
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,720
with the lessons or is it wrong for me

1318
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,720
to deprive everyone of my unique

1319
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,720
voice? And that's from Music Al

1320
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
in Mobile, Alabama. I'm gonna go

1321
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,720
super Saiyan over here.

1322
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,720
I've never been confronted

1323
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,720
by our questions

1324
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,720
as much as I have been this one episode.

1325
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Yeah. Because hey

1326
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
hey, hey

1327
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,720
why did you tell your coworkers about the

1328
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
singing lessons?

1329
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
Why did you tell your coworkers about the singing

1330
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
lessons? You didn't wanna have

1331
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
that she's all that

1332
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
moment where you get up there and you're like oh yeah

1333
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,720
you made fun of me in high school when

1334
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
I had this job in saying weird. Well

1335
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
look at me now.

1336
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,720
I am like a bird.

1337
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
And you sound that good.

1338
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
Like that.

1339
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,720
Like an angel. Like I just sounded.

1340
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Cause I took singing lessons. I didn't tell anybody

1341
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
about it. I hate to

1342
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
bring it to you but I'm afraid

1343
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
period.

1344
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
But I'm also afraid that your

1345
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
coworkers like

1346
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
that you're not good at karaoke cause

1347
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
it makes them feel better at it.

1348
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
And they're gonna say like oh you're taking it too

1349
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,720
seriously. But they're afraid that you're

1350
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,720
gonna become a dominant karaoke-er.

1351
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
And that they

1352
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
cause here's the thing. If you

1353
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
stop being the bad one, someone

1354
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
else is gonna become the bad one.

1355
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,720
And they're all afraid it's them.

1356
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,720
Too true.

1357
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
You need another reason

1358
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,720
to be getting good at singing.

1359
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
I think maybe you're trying to get up on

1360
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,720
the voice. I think you're trying to meet Gwen.

1361
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
I think you're trying to meet Gwen and Fam.

1362
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,720
Can I

1363
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
proffer this?

1364
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
Stop going to karaoke.

1365
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,720
Keep taking singing lessons.

1366
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
Six months from now,

1367
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
the friends are all at karaoke.

1368
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
And then a new singer

1369
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
enters. They're wearing a

1370
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,720
tiger mask and a tiger costume.

1371
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
They're an amazing

1372
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
singer.

1373
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,720
No one can guess why this tiger has entered

1374
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,720
the karaoke room

1375
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,720
they have rented. They're scared for their lives.

1376
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,720
Hours pass.

1377
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
Is it a believable tiger costume?

1378
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
It's a

1379
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,720
very colorful

1380
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,720
and powerful.

1381
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,720
And hours pass. Your friends drink

1382
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
with the tiger. They bond with the tiger.

1383
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720
They learn the tiger's likes

1384
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,720
and dislikes.

1385
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,720
The end of the night comes.

1386
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
You exchange numbers

1387
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
with a guy that

1388
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
you met there. You go home.

1389
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
You lie down. You realize that you forgot

1390
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
to dramatically reveal that you had been

1391
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
the tiger all along.

1392
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
You remind yourself the next time

1393
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
for sure, when you show up

1394
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,720
at karaoke, you will definitely

1395
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,720
definitely definitely pull off

1396
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,720
your mask dramatically to reveal that you were

1397
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
in fact the tiger all along.

1398
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,720
And that beautiful voice was attached to

1399
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,720
the former

1400
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,720
not so great singer.

1401
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
Time goes by. You realize it's been

1402
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,720
three years. You married that guy.

1403
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,720
You're still the tiger.

1404
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,720
You look back. You wonder

1405
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,720
what have I become? And the answer is you've become the

1406
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,720
tiger. You're more comfortable now as the tiger

1407
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,720
than you've ever been before.

1408
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,720
And then one day he pulls off your mask

1409
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,720
and your head falls off.

1410
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,720
You go back to karaoke.

1411
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
They don't remember the tiger.

1412
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,720
So we're basically starting from scratch

1413
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,720
again.

1414
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,720
You can just be a great singer. You don't have to be a great

1415
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,720
singer to excel at karaoke.

1416
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,720
There are two songs.

1417
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Our former boss,

1418
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
Christopher Grant, sings

1419
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,720
does karaoke with a passion and

1420
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,720
a gusto that I find profoundly moving

1421
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
and the gusto and passion are on

1422
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,720
point and I'm going to stop there. But

1423
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,720
Chris has also through his karaoke

1424
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
artistry introduced me

1425
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,720
to Hames the Wire

1426
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,720
and Telephone Line by

1427
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,720
Yellow

1428
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,720
that I had never heard either of those songs before.

1429
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,720
Two songs that I adore brought to me

1430
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,720
by the artistry of one Christopher

1431
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
Grant and his karaoke

1432
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,720
skills. It doesn't matter how talented

1433
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,720
you are. Now let me say this though.

1434
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,720
Don't do cake. You're going to be

1435
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,720
tempted to do cake. But then

1436
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,720
one minute into cake you're going to realize

1437
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,720
it's pretty fucking boring.

1438
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
People liked cake when it was cake

1439
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,720
but they don't like me faux

1440
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,720
caking out here because it's just mostly

1441
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,720
talking about cars. I'm basically talking

1442
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,720
about driving fast.

1443
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
I don't think

1444
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,720
that this is a great

1445
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
karaoke. You don't have to sing good to do karaoke. You do

1446
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
have to love the song you're doing.

1447
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,720
I've seen so many people make the mistake of doing like

1448
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,720
I'm going to do a funny song

1449
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,720
and then they most likely

1450
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,720
don't know the song well enough to do

1451
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
it. But two, halfway through

1452
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,720
everyone's like okay I get it and now we

1453
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
have another like five minutes of meatloaf

1454
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,720
left. Yeah practice your

1455
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
songs at home folks because you never know.

1456
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,720
It's so important to be

1457
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,720
great at karaoke. It's the most important thing.

1458
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
That is going to do it for us

1459
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,720
on My Brother My Brother Me this week.

1460
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,720
Thank you so much for indulging

1461
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
us and letting us

1462
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
just jab your ear off here.

1463
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,720
We barely let you get a word in

1464
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,720
edgewise. But we

1465
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
very much do appreciate it. Hey can I

1466
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,720
real quick before I forget like I forgot

1467
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,720
last week. We're going to be on the going

1468
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,720
on the JoCo Cruise soon.

1469
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,720
Which is very exciting. But out there

1470
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,720
on that there open ocean we won't have much

1471
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,720
internet. So if you're going to be on the cruise

1472
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
and you have a question that you

1473
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,720
would like us to like answer please

1474
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
send it in now and include

1475
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,720
like JoCo Cruise in the

1476
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,720
subject line so we can go ahead and put together a question

1477
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,720
list for our live shows on

1478
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,720

wondering if it's just too much.

1550
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,720

while other people think it

1558
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
sounds totally awesome. I took my

1559
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
granddaughter to the mall to get her picture

1560
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
taken and the mall pod fairy was

1561
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
short and I you know I'm just gonna say it

1562
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,720
I'm sorry but everyone knows

1563
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,720
the pod fairy is tall.

1564
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
Well I think we should just leave it there.

1565
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,720
