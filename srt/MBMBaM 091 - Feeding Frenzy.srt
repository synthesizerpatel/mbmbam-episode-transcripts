1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,480
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:58,000
But today, in recognition of our musical brothers who've been left out of the Grammy awards today,

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,400
we are going to be honoring, for the majority of today's show,

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,680
we're going to be picking up the categories that they let go of.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Travis, who took home the best new Zydeco of the fourth quarter award?

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
It was Zydeco Jones.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Zydeco Jones. I loved his second album, which was titled?

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,040
Movement in Zydeco.

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
You are bad at this.

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:37,360
I, some of my top Zydeco acts are the, I loved the Louisiana Creoles this year were great.

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,800
What about the Creole Opry? I like that one.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,320
I like the Zydeco Sisters.

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,320
That was pretty good. I like Mojo Johnson and his Timbuktu twins. I love, they had a great year

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,480
with, they came out with a Cupid Shuffle and Lil Bootsy.

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,160
And Three Accordions, One Dream.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, that was really good. They're out of Port Arthur, Texas.

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
They got together while working in an oil refinery.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,440
They studied under Clifton Schneer, who of course is regarded in most circles as the king of Zydeco.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
I am going to miss the Zydeco Polka that Weird Al always treats us to every year,

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,840
combining all the winners into one.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,440
And we're going to let, this year the Grammys let go of best Zydeco, best Tejano album,

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,160
that seems poorly timed, as we are now largely a Hispanic nation, and a Cajun music album, out.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,720
Best contemporary folk, out.

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,880
It seems awful bold and brassy of them to just be like, ah, nobody cares.

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,240
Get out of here, Zydeco. Nobody wants you.

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Maybe if-

31
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,800
That's not real music.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
Yeah. If Katy Perry did Zydeco,

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,040
then maybe it would be the worst thing that anyone could ever hear.

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,280
Maybe it would be unlistenable.

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
It's not even like we're going to announce these awards given earlier.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
We're just not going to do them.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,880
I think it was, I can't believe that they boxed out Best Gregorian Chant 2011.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,560
Yeah.

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
They got tired of Nickel Creek winning it every-

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,200
Every single time.

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,080
Hey, um-

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
How about Best Band with- Best Band with Nickel in it?

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
Best Band with Nickel in it.

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,160
Nickel- Nickelback.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
Nickel Creek.

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,000
Nickel Creek.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
Nickels Jones, who is another Zydeco-

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,880
Tommy Nickels and the Two Cents.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,760
Mm-hmm.

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,320
Yeah.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,280
And Jack Nicklaus.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,840
Yep.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
Golden- Golden Bear.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
Golden Bear things, the golden hits.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
Hey, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,960
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,560
We're actually an advice show in addition to a Zydeco fan cast.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
Um, so let's get into the actual advice, and we'll go-

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
We'll circle back around to more Zydeco chat.

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,520
Uh, I'm a 22-year-old girl.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,600
I've recently broken up with my long-term boyfriend.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,960
We dated since we were in high school.

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,920
We broke up two months ago.

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,320
Our anniversary would have been on Monday, February 13th, the day before Valentine's Day.

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,920
Do you have any sagely advice for what a newly single girl can do on her not-iversary

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
that's from new to the not-iversary?

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,120
Um-

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,620
Is it?

70
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,120
Um-

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,680
Do you know what?

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,240
You can't call-

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,600
The problem is you're calling it an not-iversary instead of what it really is, which is Monday.

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
That is the- that is the truth.

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
You are making a fake-

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
The days are the pits.

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
Any day, if it is a day other than-

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,200
No one's ever said, I had an unexpectedly good St. Patrick's Day.

79
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,240
Every holiday is always either a letdown or on par,

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
but you can have an unexpectedly good Monday.

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Like, I don't know.

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,680
No.

83
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Kind of worked out.

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,400
I went to the Thai house, saw that, uh, that, uh, for the love of the game on K1 cable.

85
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
It was a pretty good Monday.

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
You can't top a not-iversary, though.

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,760
How do you turn a not-iversary into a fucking full-blown rage?

88
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,760
I guess you- see, if it were me, you would start with buying myself an ice cream cake.

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,640
And then end with eating that ice cream cake.

91
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,040
Yeah.

92
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,800
Maybe you should be celebrating your freedom.

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,520
Maybe this is a liber-diversary or something.

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
Because you're out there looking on the prowl again, on the hunt.

95
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,040
Shark- sharks can't stay- sharks can't stay still because they will drown in the-

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,520
some of the plankton in there, in the ocean.

97
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,920
Uh-huh.

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,800
Sharks gotta move-

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
The krill- the krill is so thick.

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
The krill- you gotta shake the krill out your gills.

101
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,000
It's 20-

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
Shake the krill out damn grills.

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,200
Krills.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Shakes- well, your- well, your gills.

105
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,560
Shake the krill out bare gills.

106
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Shake the krill out them gills and get to sharking again.

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,640
You gotta get out there and start swimming forward.

108
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
You can't stop.

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,960
It's time for a new boy.

110
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
All boy's done.

111
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,520
Done ski over.

112
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,640
He's in the rear view.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
You know, now that you said that, I'm gonna throw out a term that you've just inspired me to,

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,440
Justin.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
Feeding frenzy.

116
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh my god.

117
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Frenzy.

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
How do you turn an anniversary into a feeding frenzy?

119
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
You are three gobbles away.

120
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

121
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
Shark- sharpen up the teeth.

122
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Get out there.

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,280
Get your- your pack of ladies together.

124
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,760
Oh, all the single ladies.

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,120
All the single ladies.

126
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Make a shark shack, a murder of sharks.

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah.

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
Just shark pack it.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
Get out to the club.

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,280
You want to hook up before midnight, though, because at midnight, you're still single.

131
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,480
You're just a lonely heart.

132
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,520
But right now, you're a motivated seller.

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,880
And maybe just crush some hearts, you know?

134
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,920
Oh, thank them.

135
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,240
Yeah.

136
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,040
Get the free drinks, bite your eyelashes, and then laugh in their face.

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,840
And then bite them.

138
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
Bite them and their surfboard.

139
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
Bite their surfboard and their legs.

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
What's the problem, officer?

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,920
He look like a seal.

142
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Nom, nom, nom.

143
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm in a feeding frenzy.

144
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,640
There was a drop of blood in the bar.

145
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,560
I could smell it a mile away.

146
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
If you go- if you go on a feeding frenzy, though, you got to be safe and protect it.

147
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,280
Yeah.

148
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,160
And the- and the cop will be like, oh, yeah, feeding frenzy.

149
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
I heard about that on my brother, my brother and me.

150
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
That makes total sense.

151
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
Trying to get it started.

152
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
Feeding frenzy.

153
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,360
It's a thing I heard.

154
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,600
Move along.

155
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,280
Go on ahead.

156
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm pretty drunk.

157
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,600
It's also my nautiversary.

158
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,120
It's my nautiversary from sobriety.

159
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,520
Sorry.

160
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,080
Sorry.

161
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm a cop.

162
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
You're under arrest.

163
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,040
I- I think those are our very good suggestions.

164
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,960
You're welcome.

165
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,040
All this is, of course, coming back to taking a bite of the recovery sandwich.

166
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,200
It's time to get back out there and normally it wouldn't be time, but it's cold.

167
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,400
It's cold outside.

168
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,920
You don't want to be alone.

169
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
I don't know.

170
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,320
I don't- I don't know how people do it.

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
You know, sans snuggles.

172
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,440
It's the- it's the body's most natural way of eating itself.

173
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,640
Yeah.

174
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,520
Yesterday there was a- there was a strange sex marathon on Nat Geo.

175
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
You really telling me you want to watch that alone?

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,280
You can handle that?

177
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,600
Wait.

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,000
Hold on.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,320
Wait.

180
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,560
Nat Geo is like, check out these freaks.

181
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Nat Geo is so dope.

182
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
Okay, here's the lineup on Nat Geo.

183
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,200
First, doomsday preppers.

184
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,240
Where people get ready for the doomsday and you watch them and you are happy you're not them.

185
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
They got undercover police.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
You're happy that you're not them now.

187
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,880
Right, until Quetzalcoatl rears his head out of a dormant volcano.

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
Until they become like the Duke of Las Cruces.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,840
Yeah, number one.

190
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,480
Yeah, I'm the king.

191
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,600
And then they got undercover princes.

192
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,160
They got that.

193
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
They're crushing it with that.

194
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
Is that like the Disney film?

195
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
No, there's like- I mean, it is similar to the plot of a Disney film.

196
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
These princes want a lady who wants them for them.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,920
So they shuck their finery and they get out there and try to meet someone based on their own

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
fairly limited skill set of nothing.

199
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
And this is all on Nat Geo just waiting for you.

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
Nat Geo sounds like their shit is just really messed up.

201
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
But then you said Nat Geo has a show about like-

202
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,160
Bonin?

203
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,600
Fist- fist- well, fisting.

204
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,560
Whoa!

205
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
This is gonna sound like I'm fucking with you.

206
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,200
I watched- I watched an episode of Strange Sex yesterday about a man who's-

207
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
his penis went missing.

208
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,960
He couldn't find his penis.

209
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,320
He had an inverted penis.

210
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,800
Oh, man.

211
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

212
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
And it's because he's had such a chub down there.

213
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,800
And he said- and he actually uttered the line,

214
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,400
I realized for the first time in 15 years, I looked down and I could see my genitals.

215
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,320
How is that a-

216
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,960
Genitals.

217
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,560
How's that a shock?

218
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,720
How's that not like a daily, like, affirmation?

219
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
Like, what the- yep, still there.

220
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
How does your penis go missing?

221
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,600
It went inside- back inside of him because of the panacea there.

222
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
There's so much chub in that region.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
It's basically like-

224
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,600
His pubis?

225
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,760
His pubis swelled to the point where his penis inverted.

226
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,360
Wow, we've just lost every single person that has ever been to our show ever.

227
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,440
All right, let's talk about secrets now because we're the only people under the

228
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,360
people under the thrall of our voices that is-

229
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,080
Let us swap social security numbers.

230
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,680
Is his penis a ghost?

231
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,480
No, yeah, no, his penis saw its shadow.

232
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,880
Six more weeks of sleeping on the couch, Darryl.

233
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,520
Griffin, why don't you rescue us with a yahoo?

234
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,560
Sure, I'll pull us out of this as a penis.

235
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
Like a- like a- like a penis.

236
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,880
Pull it out like an inverted penis, Griffin.

237
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,680
You could do it.

238
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

239
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,160
Thank you, Lisa.

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,280
It's by yahoo answers user David McMillan, who asks,

241
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,360
Is it wrong to call a woman handsome?

242
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,760
I sort of got in trouble for this the other day, but I defended myself.

243
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
Some women could just be described as handsome.

244
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
It doesn't mean that they are a lesbian.

245
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,000
It just means that they are not exactly feminine looking, but they are still attractive.

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
Does anyone know what I mean here?

247
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,400
Can I get an amen?

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,640
Amen.

249
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
Amen, I guess.

250
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
Is the woman a horse?

251
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,200
Because that's cool.

252
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,720
There are, I would say, few objects on this planet that I-

253
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,280
I would reserve the word handsome for.

254
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,360
Do you know what I mean?

255
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,880
Like a saddle?

256
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,680
A saddle or a- or a- oh, those are some handsome slacks.

257
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,160
Something like that.

258
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah, like that's a handsome flower arrangement.

259
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,720
But I don't think it- I don't think you can- I just don't think it.

260
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
Cybill Shepherd is a handsome woman.

261
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
That's a good point, Travis.

262
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Kathy Bates is a handsome woman.

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
Well, let's not go crazy.

264
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,840
But what you- but what you're saying is- is that, like,

265
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,320
hey, you got kind of a Cybill Shepherd thing going on.

266
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,800
That's-

267
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Oh, I don't think in any way it's a compliment.

268
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,320
Well, it does.

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
It kind of makes her sound like a dame, right?

270
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Like- like a- like a handsome broad.

271
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,080
I like your getaway sticks, you handsome broad.

272
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,320
Is Maggie Smith handsome?

273
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
Yeah, Maggie Smith is handsome.

274
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,240
No, she is like a- she's like a- some sort of sea creature.

275
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,080
She's not a handsome woman.

276
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,520
Like, uh, who's a handsome woman?

277
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,640
Still.

278
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,480
Somebody- uh, you know, Diane Keaton is a handsome woman.

279
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
I don't under- I still don't understand the distinction,

280
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
because I would say that she is- she's just- she's just-

281
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
It's- I think it's like- I think it's like saying my granddad would probably want to hit it.

282
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

283
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,840
I think that's what a handsome woman means, right?

284
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,920
It means like she has moxie, she has spunk.

285
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
No, it's like you can appreciate what's going on there.

286
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
It's just not for you.

287
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,240
You know how sometimes, like, old people will say, like, if I were 20 years younger,

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
I think saying something- someone as a handsome woman is saying, like,

289
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
if I were 20 years older, I would hit that.

290
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah, I think that that's true.

291
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,680
That's horrible, though.

292
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,560
Yeah.

293
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:50,880
I know.

294
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,640
I don't know why you would say it to somebody.

295
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,400
It's a terrible thing to say about anyone.

296
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
Yeah, it's not a nice thing to say about a woman.

297
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Although, I mean, like, I- is it- is it-

298
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,560
If Simple Shepherd is listening, I meant it as a compliment.

299
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm a shepherd.

300
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,280
Loved you on Sibyl.

301
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,080
Siby.

302
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,200
Siby, you know I love you.

303
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,920
I didn't mean it.

304
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,640
Sibs.

305
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,480
Travis, if somebody said you were pretty-

306
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,800
I'd take that as a compliment.

307
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
That would treat you- that would treat you well?

308
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,200
Yeah.

309
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,160
I'd take pretty.

310
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,800
If someone said, like, well, there's a beautiful man, like-

311
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,320
They didn't say beautiful, though.

312
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
They said pretty.

313
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,080
There's a pretty man.

314
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,880
Well, I do have my foppish ways about me.

315
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,680
I don't have a problem with that.

316
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,400
But, see, you're- you're- I don't- I don't see- let's just- can we make all-

317
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,880
all, like, pleasant adjectives totally asexual?

318
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,280
What if it was just, like, that is, like, an attractive person?

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,880
Well, or we can just say that anything can be handsome.

320
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,000
Anything can be pretty.

321
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Lovely.

322
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,040
Justin, you-

323
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,520
Lovely?

324
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,240
I haven't told you this lately, but you are just lovely.

325
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
You are divine.

326
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,680
Now, lovely and divine sounds like something you'd say, like, about your-

327
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,520
like, about your best friend who everybody thinks is gay but really isn't gay.

328
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:03,840
Yeah.

329
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,520
Oh, he's a lovely person.

330
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,840
What if-

331
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,960
He's a lovely person.

332
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,040
Travis, you are shapely.

333
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,320
Have I told you that lately?

334
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,120
Thank you, Griffin.

335
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,280
Griffin, I think you are pulchritudinous.

336
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,240
Okay, Travis.

337
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,640
What is-

338
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,280
Deal with it.

339
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,840
What does that mean?

340
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,400
You know what?

341
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,120
You're pretty.

342
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,200
You're painterly, I think.

343
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
You're symmetrical.

344
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Painterly.

345
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,280
Okay.

346
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,840
That's good.

347
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,600
But that's- now we're talking, like, robot.

348
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,120
Yeah.

349
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,280
If you're- if you're- if you- if you say somebody has very Roman features,

350
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
I think that's good, because that is a nice way of saying, like,

351
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
you don't look nice, but maybe, like, a million years ago, back in Rome.

352
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,120
Yeah.

353
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
What's the- which-

354
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,320
Totally stickable.

355
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,160
Remind me, comely or homely?

356
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
Which one's the compliment and which one's offensive?

357
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,880
Did you say com- did you say comely?

358
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,760
A comely wench.

359
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,520
You mean comely, sir.

360
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,160
Excuse me?

361
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,040
How did you pronounce it?

362
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,240
You said it like it was dirty.

363
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,740
Comely.

364
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,920
Kevin, I need a ruling.

365
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,080
Is it comely or comely?

366
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,840
I- both are bad.

367
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,760
Don't Google it.

368
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
I need to know this for real.

369
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,600
I try to excise that word from as many other larger words as I possibly can,

370
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
so I'm gonna go comely.

371
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,940
Yeah.

372
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah.

373
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
Justin, if it makes you feel better, I'm willing to say that someone is a humbly wench.

374
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,080
I- that does not make me feel better at all.

375
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,600
I- I think there is a certain class of- of- of words you use to describe

376
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,720
female attractive appearance that you can only use if you're wearing, like, a black trench coat

377
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
and have a- and have a few swords at home.

378
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Like, I think- I think-

379
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
If you- if you wear a fedora actively, then that's-

380
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,280
Right.

381
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,240
On purpose.

382
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,740
Yeah.

383
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,200
If some- if someone's ever said,

384
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,880
hey, I can see your vest bulge underneath your black trench coat, then- then-

385
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,960
then you can probably use words like comely.

386
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,880
Are those new steampunk goggles?

387
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,960
Those are lovely.

388
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,160
Those are divine.

389
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
I had them polished just for you, Christine.

390
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,520
Please leave your boyfriend.

391
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,760
Please go to Subway with me.

392
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,560
Who is- who is- who are these people who are complimenting people on the street?

393
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
It's me.

394
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
Hey, it's handsome stuff.

395
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,840
I like what- what all you got there.

396
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,280
Hey, handsome stuff, you wanna buy me a bus ticket?

397
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
I like here what you're working with.

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,800
There, text.

399
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,520
Uh, I- yeah, I think handsome could be misconstrued.

400
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,760
It just always seems like it's used as a euphemism.

401
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,480
Like, I've never heard someone say it in a convincing way.

402
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,440
I've never heard- nobody's ever called me handsome without the words little guy following it.

403
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,680
And- and usually- usually in the interrogative, who's my handsome little guy?

404
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,480
Question mark.

405
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,040
I- I've- I've never had it handsome unless it was followed by in context.

406
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,440
Which I-

407
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,760
Mine's usually followed with comparatively.

408
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,080
Yeah.

409
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,320
Yeah.

410
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,480
In the right light.

411
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,240
Um, I guess.

412
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,360
I guess.

413
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,560
For you.

414
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:18,000
Um, there- yeah, I- I think though I would steer away- I would steer clear of handsome.

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
I'm not sure that's gonna- I'm not sure you're gonna win that particularly.

416
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,200
It won't play.

417
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,480
Yeah.

418
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,520
That ball don't got legs.

419
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,800
It don't track.

420
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,680
Uh, hey, I'm looking to buy a diamond engagement ring.

421
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Uh, I would like to get one with a diamond close to one carat,

422
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,680
but a good one that size is currently out of my price range.

423
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,360
You have any tips on getting a better price?

424
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
Or what channels I should go through to get a better deal?

425
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,760
That's from Engaged in Edmonton.

426
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
Travis, would you choose these questions?

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,880
What the fuck?

428
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,640
Like, what- what about me and Griffin makes you think,

429
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,040
I bet those guys got a good line on a diamond.

430
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,800
Well, I figured that with your extensive trading in blood diamonds,

431
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,640
you'd be able to like hook him up with something.

432
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
Steal- I guess theft?

433
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
What the fuck do you- I want the nice thing, but I don't want to pay money to do it.

434
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,040
You mine it out of the ground and you fucking- you kill.

435
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,560
You kill and take.

436
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,200
You would like- yeah, you would like to get one with close to one carat,

437
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,560
but you can't afford that.

438
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,520
Well, let me help you.

439
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
You don't- don't get that big.

440
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Get a smaller one?

441
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
Maybe go smaller.

442
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
Maybe you're the real prize.

443
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,480
All I know- do you have anything about that?

444
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,880
I just know like about- I know a little bit about like purchasing things.

445
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,560
I know how to acquire things with money.

446
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,280
So in that sense, I guess I have- I guess I have a little bit of expertise here.

447
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
If you don't have the money for the thing, then you can't get the thing.

448
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
That's the problem with it.

449
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,040
Unless you get an apprenticeship at the jeweler.

450
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,120
That's good.

451
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,560
Are you talking about a heist?

452
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
No, I was talking about like working for it.

453
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
No, but let's go with heist.

454
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,280
Okay, diamond- diamond heist.

455
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,360
Now you're speaking our language.

456
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
Can you- can you do like a coal?

457
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,440
You press it down?

458
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,680
Like Superman?

459
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,720
No, if you- is that a power that Superman has?

460
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,000
He did it once or twice.

461
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,120
That seems kind of fucked up.

462
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Yeah, doesn't it?

463
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,640
Okay, there's a pawn shop, right?

464
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,360
You can do that?

465
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,920
That's a thing, right?

466
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,320
Oh, you mean like-

467
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,840
You can go on pawn stars.

468
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,560
Go on pawn stars and get one for cheap.

469
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,800
Go on storage wars.

470
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,720
Hope you find one in a storage unit.

471
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,000
That could take a while, but you know, give it a shot.

472
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,080
Um, anybody else, when they hear pawn stars, they think that it just sounds like a New Orleans

473
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,680
southern gentleman saying porn stars?

474
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
Pawn stars!

475
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,600
Uh, this is- this isn't very good.

476
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,040
Nah, that's not very good, goof.

477
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,320
Kind of- kind of climaxed early, but I thought it was okay.

478
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,120
Um, I mean, girls- you know, girls don't really care about the size of diamonds.

479
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,200
If you're going with the size and you don't care about the clarity, you can get- you can

480
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
get cheaper.

481
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,880
Oh, that sounded good, Travis.

482
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,680
That sounded like a real thing.

483
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,640
You sound like a big, fat, muddy-ass diamond.

484
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,080
Yeah, if you're all right with some imperfections in the diamond, then you can get it for a

485
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,640
lot cheaper.

486
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
I got you this ring pop.

487
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,840
It's 450 carats.

488
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,360
You're talking about just the raunchiest, merriliest-

489
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,240
The nastiest, gnarliest, most-

490
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I want a diamond with a fly in the middle.

491
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
Excuse me, waiter.

492
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,480
I want a diamond that I can use to clone dinosaurs.

493
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
You idiot.

494
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,200
You're so dumb.

495
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,160
I want a-

496
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,120
You're stupid.

497
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,840
That doesn't make sense.

498
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,640
You guys are dumb.

499
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
You guys are both stupid.

500
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,440
This guy's dumb.

501
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,520
Oh, I want a diamond the size of a can of soup, but I only have this many.

502
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,240
How many big-

503
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,080
How big a diamond for this many, please?

504
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,560
None.

505
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,160
I wish he'd give us some hard numbers, though, because I bet I could get him a-

506
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,360
I bet I could give him a better deal.

507
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,840
You see that Priceline Negotiator?

508
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,680
Maybe he could help you out.

509
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,640
He's not a real man.

510
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
Yeah, Priceline Negotiator.

511
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,040
You go to their site, go to priceline.com, say, I'm not going to pay a lot for this diamond.

512
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,920
Yeah, and then you, uh, you can pay any price you want.

513
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,160
I'm-

514
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,040
Here's what you do.

515
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,560
You call William Shatner.

516
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,240
You tell him you need a diamond real bad.

517
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,600
Say, I'm flying from Edmonton to Engagement Town, and I need a hotel for life.

518
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,480
That'll probably work out.

519
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,120
This is dumb.

520
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,640
You're dumb.

521
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,720
We don't know anything about this.

522
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
Why do you ask us this?

523
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,240
Ask somebody better.

524
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,800
Maybe a different setting?

525
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,480
Did you think about a crown setting?

526
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,400
Maybe a different setting.

527
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
Hey, what about, what about white gold?

528
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
Uh, so I guess in closing, sorry.

529
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,520
I guess in closing, ask, ask, ask somebody else better.

530
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,080
Or ask us-

531
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,120
Ask somebody better than us.

532
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,000
You either ask us about, like, farting in public, or you ask the diamond podcast,

533
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,400
you ask Jared.com about diamonds, because that's Jared's focal point.

534
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Sometimes the best advice we can give is to tell someone that we're not their best.

535
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,440
Yeah, we're like Macy's in Miracle on 34th Street.

536
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
It's actually, it's honestly so rare that we're able to make that distinction.

537
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,720
I feel like we just really lean into it when it happens.

538
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
Griffin.

539
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,920
How about a-

540
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,240
Give me somebody, give me somebody we can help.

541
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,040
Okay, here's a, here's a good one.

542
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,200
This one was also sent in by Lisa Holofield.

543
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,920
Thank you, Lisa.

544
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ambie, who asks, I am trying to learn boxing.

545
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,200
The basic problem is, when a punch is thrown at me, I close my eyes and don't block.

546
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,600
Please tell me drills to do, because I really want to get over.

547
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,240
It's probably fear, because of which I close my eyes.

548
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,280
Wow.

549
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,320
So he's got one, he punches really good.

550
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,920
Right, the punches are on point.

551
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,280
His punches are like trains with fists on the end of them.

552
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,560
One prob though, one hang up though, is that when he gets punched, he says,

553
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

554
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,920
The way he describes it in the question though,

555
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
makes it sound like he's really casual about it, because he doesn't block.

556
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
He's not ducking away.

557
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,560
He just closes his eyes, like, and just stands there.

558
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,920
If you can't see the fist, then they can't punch you with them or something.

559
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,320
Maybe this should be his thing, right?

560
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,640
Like you, I don't know, man.

561
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
I just kept swinging and he would just close his eyes and take it.

562
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
After like three or four, I felt bad.

563
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,920
I was intimidated.

564
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,440
I felt bad for him.

565
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,680
What is he doing in there, the little crazy little dude?

566
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,800
I kept putting his hands up for him and he would just drop them back down.

567
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,400
He looked like he was thinking really hard about how to punch me back.

568
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,280
And that kind of cerebral maneuvers, it's intimidating.

569
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
He had a strategy.

570
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,840
He's all up in my head, man.

571
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,280
Can you be a good boxer and take, and not, I mean,

572
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,360
maybe he's trying to learn how to take punches.

573
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
You get, so the solution is just have somebody punch you a lot

574
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,080
until you're not afraid.

575
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,680
It's immersion therapy.

576
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,560
Oh, you don't want to fight against callous face Jones.

577
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,120
Yeah, that's the, that's the, that's the, a lot of, a lot of people

578
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
don't realize that that's how you become a great boxer.

579
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,600
If you can arc it so that you become immune to punching before you die.

580
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,160
Yeah, it kills you because they hit some punch something in your brain and break it.

581
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
The trick is to take enough punches so that you're not scared of punches anymore,

582
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,680
but not too many punches so that you forget how to eat.

583
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,920
So that you forget how to chew and swallow food.

584
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,000
That's why, that's why Rocky drinks eggs because he forgot how to eat.

585
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
I just don't go on it.

586
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,560
I took too many punches.

587
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,320
I don't know how to eat to chew to chew.

588
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
That's why I sound like I do when I talk.

589
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
Hey, hey, yo Ziggy.

590
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,280
That was sliced alone.

591
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,680
That was good.

592
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,160
I thought.

593
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,840
Hey guys, I want to take a bunches.

594
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,840
Hey boo boo.

595
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,360
Hey boo boo, I'm a boxer.

596
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,040
I think I'm gonna close my eyes.

597
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,280
I am the law.

598
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,840
Pretty good impressions.

599
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,000
The important thing is not getting punched.

600
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,520
I think maybe if you punch them more.

601
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,800
What if you're, if they're too busy blocking your flurry of punches,

602
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,240
they're not gonna have time to punch you.

603
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,720
That's great.

604
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,600
They're gonna be Tucker.

605
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,680
You're just one big stupid glass cannon.

606
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,520
I would like to take this guy's story and turn it into like the next like Rudy.

607
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,240
Mm-hmm.

608
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,960
We're like the guy goes into the coach and he's like,

609
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,120
I want to be the best boxer.

610
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,760
Train me.

611
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,520
And the coach is like, I see something in you.

612
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,400
Let's do this.

613
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
And they get in the ring.

614
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
And the guy throws the punches.

615
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,480
The coach is like, that was a great punch.

616
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,280
Okay, now block.

617
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,160
Coaches like lays them out in the first punch.

618
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,640
Yeah.

619
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
It's like, hey, hey kid, you shouldn't box anymore.

620
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
And John Favreau comes in the next day.

621
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
He's like, hey, Rudy's dead.

622
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,480
Yeah, he's dead.

623
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,360
He punched him.

624
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,600
He punched him a bunch and he didn't block it.

625
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,320
Closed his eyes.

626
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
So at least he didn't see his death.

627
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,760
He died.

628
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
So that was merciful, I guess.

629
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
It's going to be a closed casket because he got, he did get pretty-

630
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,880
Whoa, whoa.

631
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,040
You punched the front of his face or the back of it.

632
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,080
Come on, coach.

633
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,920
Let me be a boxer.

634
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll do anything to be a pro boxer.

635
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,160
Will you block?

636
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,640
I will not do that.

637
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,840
I will not do this one thing.

638
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,160
The one thing I will not do is block or open my eyes.

639
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,680
Do you dodge?

640
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,040
Well, with my eyes closed, it is hard to see which way to dodge.

641
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,200
Can we agree to that?

642
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,240
Like if you're going to get punched, like you probably don't want your eyes open.

643
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
Because he was there the whole time.

644
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

645
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,000
They call him cornea Jones.

646
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
He punches him right in their open eyeball.

647
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,840
Actually, that's what happens in some pro fights is a person will get punched in their open eye.

648
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,920
And then you go, ow, ow, ow, wait, wait, wait.

649
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,640
And they have to wait.

650
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,280
Time out.

651
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,760
Time out.

652
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,440
It's the gentleman's role of boxing.

653
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,760
Do you know when they cut people in the corners?

654
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,280
What they're doing is cutting their eyelids off.

655
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,880
So they have to keep their eyes open.

656
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,160
A lot of people don't know that.

657
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,040
Why would they do that?

658
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,920
It's a harsh world.

659
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
It is a harsh world.

660
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,080
They also have that thing where they run the dry erase marker over their face to get rid

661
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
of some of the blood that's on there.

662
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,680
And then they make them smell like a bucket full of spit.

663
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
Like smell the spit.

664
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,280
I don't know.

665
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,160
Seems mean.

666
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,680
They fluff a little bit.

667
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,600
Just a little bit.

668
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,520
Hey, I have three best friends in my city.

669
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,560
They're all guys.

670
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm a woman.

671
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
One of these guys is also my boyfriend.

672
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,680
My question is, is it normal and expected that they're all closer to each other than

673
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,200
they are to me?

674
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I have girlfriends that I can talk to and spend time with independently of my other

675
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,920
boyfriend.

676
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,720
So it's not as if I have nowhere to go for advice and venting.

677
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,280
But the fact that you just asked us a question to the evidencing to that to the contrary,

678
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,200
but we'll continue forward.

679
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,840
I just wish I could go to my besties for that.

680
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
What do you think?

681
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Am I expecting too much from my opposite sex friendships?

682
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,920
That's from second favorite.

683
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
Well, I got to think about this for a second.

684
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,320
I mean, I have my harsh reality opinion of it.

685
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,680
No, really?

686
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,400
I know.

687
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,240
But I feel like I mean, just just based on these facts without any other details, I feel

688
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,040
like there's a certain thing that happens, like where if your friends are friends with

689
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,280
your boyfriend, there's a certain amount that they probably have of just wanting to stay

690
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,080
out of tricky relationship stuff all together.

691
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,440
Yeah, because they're his guy friends, you know, so it's a minefield for them.

692
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,920
Minefield for them.

693
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,240
I know that it rubs some people the wrong way when you when you assign any sort of gender

694
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,760
attributes, and I'm not doing that.

695
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,040
We did do that earlier in the episode with the word handsome.

696
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,680
Uh huh.

697
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,520
Yes, that is that was different.

698
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,840
So we only get one pass per.

699
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,440
Candace Bergen is a handsome.

700
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,400
I was trying to think of her earlier.

701
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,240
I try to think of her often, but specifically Murphy Brown.

702
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
A handsome woman.

703
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,440
Is that a talented, award winning journalist?

704
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Once you I think guys and girls can be friends with each other, and I think.

705
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,920
Sure, I don't think that's a problem, but I think once you decided you're going to date

706
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,800
one of them, you're going to date a guy, you have to.

707
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,520
Except that you are changing the dynamic, and part of that is when you have a problem

708
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,560
with the guy, you can't like it's not going to be as cool for you to go to his friends

709
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,440
to complain about it.

710
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,080
It's just not a safe split.

711
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,600
It's not a safe space anymore for for relationship stuff.

712
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,840
I don't mean everything, but I think of it specific to him.

713
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,160
Specific to your boyfriend.

714
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:01,280
I think you gotta go to other girls for that, and I think that even even in the most like

715
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,360
chaste, purely friendship situation, whenever you enter into a relationship, friendships

716
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
with the opposite sex become kind of just a little.

717
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,360
You know, a little weirder in general, I think on both sides because of this idea of like

718
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,600
I don't want to seem improper.

719
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,000
It just for some reason for me, it always got weird every time I've ever dated someone

720
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and also been friends with, you know, and hung out with women and always just felt kind

721
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,720
of weird.

722
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,840
Yeah, you know, it really it and it doesn't have to do with the fact that of genders.

723
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,880
It has everything to do with the fact that they are friends with your with your boyfriend.

724
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,520
So they're not.

725
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,960
They can't be impartial.

726
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,680
They have loyalty to both of you.

727
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,360
It doesn't make them a good sounding board.

728
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,680
I mean, even if you want to be friends with other guys, that's fine.

729
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,240
Just it can't be guys that are also friends, you know, super close to your boyfriend because

730
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,640
they can't be objective and they're going to feel weird about about, you know, hearing

731
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
these complaints and not being able to do anything about it.

732
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,520
Yeah, that wasn't a very funny answer.

733
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,520
I just think you got it.

734
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,840
I don't think it's sexist to say that every lady should have her shark pack and every

735
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,400
dude should have his his his bro pack.

736
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,640
Right.

737
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,720
I is that weird that sometimes you just seek out the the company even briefly of of one

738
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,220
gender?

739
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,120
I mean, I do that.

740
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,800
And like my girlfriend does that.

741
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,720
And all of my friends here in Austin have like there's ladies nighttime and now there's

742
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:34,960
dudes.

743
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,440
Yeah.

744
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,000
And is that I don't think I think that's completely normal.

745
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,560
I think that that's I think that that is is healthy to have, you know, like just I'm not

746
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,520
saying like you can't be friends with the opposite gender, but every so often you want

747
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,680
to be like, hey, let's just like bro out, you know?

748
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,080
Yeah.

749
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,680
Or let's have a feeding frenzy.

750
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,120
Ladies just want to feed, you know?

751
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,320
Yeah.

752
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,440
They try to unhinge your jaws and just eat men whole.

753
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,920
I think you might be misinterpreting it.

754
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,120
I don't think it's that they are closer to each other than they are to you, because I

755
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,760
would fucking hope that your boyfriend's closer to you than he is to his bros.

756
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:20,400
But but I just think that it's sometimes they seek the solace of yeah, of gentlemen.

757
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,760
I it is hard, though, and I and I know that you would like to be able to I know you'd

758
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,880
like to be able to talk to, you know, your your other dude friends about it, but you

759
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
just have to accept that goes with the territory.

760
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,080
Once you start dating somebody and put that into the dynamic, you can't just turn that

761
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,280
off because you'd like their their advice.

762
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,920
It's it's a different it's a different world now.

763
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,800
And I think that you also it's a sticky situation because we've also gotten questions

764
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,640
from the other side where women have complained that they're, quote, just one of the guys.

765
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,000
You know, and like the fact that they still see you as a woman and don't include you in

766
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,320
their bro time is not necessarily a bad thing.

767
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,240
Yeah, it's not as bad as saying bros a lot, which we happen to be doing.

768
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,080
So we'll try to break that.

769
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,320
So he wants to go hang out with his bros keys.

770
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,680
Yeah, you know, if you want to go and out and yeah, is there a better word for men?

771
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,000
Friends like dude pals, dude pals.

772
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,040
OK, dude buddies, dude buddies, air buddies.

773
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,200
But what about just buds with a Z and you say with the Z and that's how you know that

774
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,560
it's in reference to a man.

775
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,160
That's pretty much how I say it about drugs, though.

776
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:39,360
Gentlemen callers can our podcast now just be called three buds, but buds and out in

777
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,080
my newspaper.

778
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,560
There was a story about a guy who did a Mario mural for his kid and they were quoting him

779
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,120
about the about the the the Super Mario Brothers game.

780
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,520
He said, I used to love that when I was a kid.

781
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,960
Mario and Luigi were buddies.

782
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
No, they weren't.

783
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,880
That's no, that's no, that's adorable, though.

784
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,320
When it was actually I would like to point out that they're never in the same place at

785
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,360
the same time.

786
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,280
Yeah, you don't even know that they enjoyed each other's company.

787
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,040
Hey, adults, when you say buddies, it's adorable.

788
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,080
Keep it up.

789
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,120
Keep it up.

790
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,840
You've earned it.

791
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,120
You went without dying for lots of years.

792
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,440
So you have earned the right to say buddies.

793
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,760
Griffin, you know what I've earned the right to do?

794
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,960
Be buddies with money.

795
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,600
Money, buddy, buddy, money, buddies.

796
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,200
And now here's a segment.

797
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,920
Money Buddies.

798
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,440
We are we are launching a journey today, an epic poem that is really a partnership between

799
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:04,000
us and our new friend, Eric Noreen, and his project, his his product, his fucking revolutionary

800
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,240
like revolution or change your life, change your life.

801
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,600
It's called Stack.

802
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,920
Prepare to kick yourself in your own ass for being so stupid for not coming up with this

803
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,240
first.

804
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,200
You're going to get ready to be an idiot because you did not.

805
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,640
You've been an idiot your whole life.

806
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,440
You didn't even know it.

807
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,560
You I want you guys to know that I really feel like you're talking directly to me.

808
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,200
You are a dumb shithead for not thinking of this product.

809
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,400
You stupid asshole.

810
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
Stack is not helping this.

811
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,840
It is.

812
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,040
It is specially created.

813
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,360
It's hard to describe the shape.

814
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,320
You should probably just go to stacksoap.com and you'll see.

815
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,080
But it's a it's created in such a way with that sort of divot.

816
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,760
It's it's pringular.

817
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,440
I would say it's pringular.

818
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,840
It's got a pringular design to divot at the top.

819
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,600
You you wash yourself with the stack soap and then you wear it down to the point that

820
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,040
it fits perfectly into your next bar of stack soap.

821
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,600
What the stack soap the divot has the word stack in it and like letters that stick out

822
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,640
so that it just it adheres to the wet sliver of soap that you have remaining and it forms

823
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,000
a new bar of soap that you whittle down to another sliver and fit into the next thing

824
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,440
of stack soap.

825
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,560
I feel so stupid.

826
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,000
You dumb piece of shit.

827
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,080
Never have a stack.

828
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,840
Never have a soap sliver again.

829
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,080
If you here's the thing, though, we're trying to get this made.

830
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,160
He's trying to get a a copper mold.

831
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,080
That's one of the last last components he needs.

832
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,680
But it's going to cost a little cheddar.

833
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,960
It's going to cost nine grand.

834
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,440
But we're all going to team up to get it made.

835
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,360
So go to go to stacksoap.com and you will find a Kickstarter.

836
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,800
If you get on board, the first thousand people can pledge what they want and they're going

837
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,000
to get six bars of stack soap, whatever they think is fair.

838
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,640
And and that includes shipping.

839
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,440
So don't you know, don't go on just just pledge a buck.

840
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,480
But the first thousand people that do that are going to be able to to pledge what they

841
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,640
want for a bar of stack.

842
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,120
So let's see.

843
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,880
Let's get six bars, six bars.

844
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,640
Let's get on the offensive right now.

845
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,200
Right.

846
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,400
If you're using body wash, you are just moving your funk around, right?

847
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
You're just moving the funk around.

848
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,040
If you don't have a solid lie based product, then you are as dumb as Travis is.

849
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,400
Yeah, you've got to have a stack, a physical, tangible, solid, not a plasma, a solid ass

850
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,920
piece of soapy matter.

851
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,280
No matter how handsome you are, if you're not using soap, you're an idiot.

852
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,480
You're a child.

853
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,440
You're a dirty child.

854
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,280
You're a dirty child, idiot child.

855
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
You're like an idiot, dirt child.

856
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,560
This is the infinite soap bar cycle and you can get on board with it right now.

857
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,320
Go.

858
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,000
This is like ground level.

859
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,200
Like you can get in on the first floor of this and go to stacksoap.com right now.

860
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,320
We're going to be following this.

861
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,360
This is going to be an effort between it's a it's a co production of my brother, my brother

862
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,000
and me and the maximum fun network.

February and a little bit of March is get yourself clean month with stack soap.

864
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,280
We don't have a jingle at this exact moment, Griffin.

865
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,000
I want to make it.

866
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,320
This is this is the longest relationship we've ever had with a promotional partner.

867
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,720
So when I turn it out, I want it to be like a like a Coca-Cola theme song.

868
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,680
You know, Coca-Cola, drink it all day and all night.

869
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,360
You remember that one?

870
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,840
That little ditty from the 40s.

871
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,680
They played it on the radio serials.

872
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,640
Anyway, when I turn this shit out, I want it to be like Space Jam 2.

873
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,200
You know what I mean?

874
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,680
Yeah.

875
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:35,920
Yeah.

876
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,400
Epic.

877
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,040
I want it.

878
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,520
I want it to be like I want it to be in the Grammys.

879
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,560
I like you getting garage band and just lay down some track.

880
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,480
I've been laying down some loops and I've got a few Samba beats that I like.

881
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,080
So we'll see.

882
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,120
We'll see what turns up.

883
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,880
But I promise Stack Soap the best jingle that they've ever heard.

884
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,640
So go to stacksoap.com and while you're getting clean with your new

885
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,360
Stack Soap, you can listen to another great podcast on the Maximum Fun Network,

886
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,240
which you will hear about right now.

887
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Hello there, my name is Graham Clark.

888
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,600
And I'm Dave Shumka.

889
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,440
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

890
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,840
This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to it in your pod.

891
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,280
What's that about, you ask?

892
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,640
Well, who are you to ask?

893
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,840
Who do you think you are?

894
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,760
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

895
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,160
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

896
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,800
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

897
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,160
Sometimes they're Canadian.

898
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,360
Sometimes they're not.

899
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,720
Sometimes they're a ghost.

900
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,000
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

901
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,040
Plus, we're Canadian.

902
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
So you get a tax break.

903
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,760
You can find us on iTunes or online at MaximumFun.org.

904
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,080
Let's come back with a Yahoo answer.

905
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,040
This one was, Jesus, this one was sent in by Lisa Holofield, too.

906
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,640
Thank you so much, Lisa.

907
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,080
Crushin' it, crushin' it, fan of the year.

908
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,440
Can she just have some money?

909
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,820
Yep.

910
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,320
Someone give her some money.

911
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,240
This was asked by Brian, who asks,

912
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,760
is it illegal for me to upload a picture of me with a sword to Facebook?

913
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,640
I want my default pic to be one of me with the sword I got in eighth grade.

914
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,120
If I do not look threatening, is this illegal?

915
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,280
Any ins and outs I need to be aware of?

916
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,120
P.S. I will look civilized.

917
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,680
Call Guinness, because it's the first time a dude has ever looked civilized with a sword.

918
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,560
It's me.

919
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,080
I'm wearing a frock, and this is my gentleman's foil.

920
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,600
How civil.

921
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,880
I'm actually, I'm looking at the Facebook rules right now about posting pictures,

922
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,240
and it says to do it, you have to have a really intense look on your face

923
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,680
and be holding the sword somewhere down around your crotch.

924
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,920
You have to have photoshopped fire, like Dragon Ball Z fire,

925
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,320
on the sword and possibly in your eyes.

926
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,280
And it has to say something above it, like, Destiny.

927
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,360
And you have to make sure that you tastefully trimmed your scraggly beard.

928
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,320
If somebody could photoshop us, pictures of us like that, I will make it my face.

929
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,520
I want nothing but Dragon Ball Z photoshops of us.

930
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,800
There's fire and swords, laser beams, tails.

931
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,400
Maybe he meant Sybilized, which is to look like Sybil Shepherd.

932
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:32,720
I like the idea of Sybilized better, like us in full 1930s military regalia

933
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,920
with an epée in one hand and a tea sandwich in the other.

934
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,600
Very fancy.

935
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,400
Like a gentleman with a sword.

936
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,560
Who gave you one in eighth grade?

937
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,520
Who did that to you?

938
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
Who did that to you?

939
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,880
You're too young for that.

940
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,440
You're too little.

941
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,400
You're just a baby.

942
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,680
Unless it was his sensei.

943
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,360
Yeah, his sword sensei.

944
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,600
Oh, you're saying once he had learned all the strokes and all the stabs.

945
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
What are the cuts?

946
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,560
Cut one.

947
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,640
Left stab.

948
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,520
Leftward cut.

949
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,080
We have it on this show.

950
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,640
We take a pretty hard line against people putting things on their Facebook that aren't them,

951
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,440
such as their dogs and their babies and their dead grandmothers.

952
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,720
That's the one that's killing me, guys.

953
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,520
You gotta stop.

954
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,120
Stop, but I think that if you are the sort of dude

955
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,480
that would put a picture of you with a sword on Facebook,

956
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,760
that's probably pretty good.

957
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,320
Oh, God.

958
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,760
I swear to God.

959
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,160
I thought you said sword of dude.

960
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,920
Like the sword of dude.

961
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,040
I had no idea what it meant.

962
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,520
I don't know.

963
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,080
It's awesome.

964
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,000
Behold the sword of dude.

965
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,680
No, you're the sword of dude.

966
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,920
I'm more interested in this person thinking he's gonna get in trouble

967
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,360
for uploading a picture of him with a sword to Facebook

968
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,560
and then somebody being like,

969
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,880
is he fucking threatening me?

970
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,760
Whoa, oh, God.

971
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,280
In the picture, I am covered in blood.

972
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,680
Oh, God.

973
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,040
I was looking at my newsfeed.

974
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,040
I saw a picture of you with a Final Fantasy replica sword,

975
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,040
and I got spooked because I thought you were-

976
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,400
Put down that buster sword.

977
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,120
Hey, Skylar Zuckerberg.

978
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,600
You knew, you knew this call was coming.

979
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,760
You fucked up.

980
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,560
What is that?

981
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,520
A katana-naka?

982
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,000
Put that down.

983
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,160
I respect your people.

984
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,760
I respect your traditions.

985
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,200
You can't put a sword on my book.

986
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,280
I got a call from Spider-Man.

987
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,640
He said, I got spooked when I loaded my newsfeed.

988
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,120
I saw a picture of his katana.

989
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,200
I saw his epi, and I said, nope.

990
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,360
I closed the window because I was afraid.

991
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,080
Griffin, you have to take me inside the bit

992
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,560
and tell me what Spider-Man is friends with Skylar.

993
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,600
Spider-Man.

994
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,120
Spider-Man is the guy who was his friend in the movie.

995
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,640
Oh, I got you.

996
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,000
Spider-Man was his best bud.

997
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,520
I like to believe that all films share continuity.

998
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,240
I know you guys, you've heard about me.

999
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,480
Shortly after founding Facebook and suing for rights,

1000
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
he was bitten by a spider and became Spider-Man.

1001
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,360
Oh, I get it.

1002
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,600
So that's what that's what spurned him to fight injustice.

1003
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,160
He was like, that's it.

1004
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,200
I'm going to fight villains from now on.

1005
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,640
That's why he's ultimate Spider-Man,

1006
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,760
because he's rich as fuck.

1007
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,560
So when he said, you better lawyer up

1008
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,600
because I'm coming after you,

1009
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,240
what he meant was time to start ducking webs.

1010
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:22,400
Yeah.

1011
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,480
Because I got spiders, spider powers in here.

1012
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,000
Spider blood pumping through my veins,

1013
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,000
which doesn't sound that intimidating

1014
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,880
when you say it like that.

1015
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,360
No.

1016
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,880
You know what is intimidating?

1017
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,200
What?

1018
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,680
A man with a sword.

1019
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,600
That's a real power move.

1020
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,800
Spider-Man with a sword.

1021
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,000
Do you, do you use Facebook for business or just person?

1022
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
No, it's pretty much just personal stuff.

1023
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,360
I haven't got a lot of business traffic through there.

1024
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,120
You should see my LinkedIn page.

1025
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,600
It's, there's a lot of,

1026
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,520
I would say civilized sword picks in there.

1027
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:56,880
It's a-

1028
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,320
I'm available for parties.

1029
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,720
Yeah.

1030
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,280
Yeah.

1031
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,680
I'll spend nunchukus around.

1032
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,920
I got a whole bo staff routine worked out.

1033
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,800
It's pretty sick.

1034
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,240
Now I will be honest.

1035
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,720
I do not know much about venture capital,

1036
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,120
but I do have, I own many swords.

1037
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,360
So-

1038
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm highly motivated.

1039
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,160
Here's a reference letter from my sensei.

1040
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,600
I used to own swords, everybody.

1041
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,480
I still have swords.

1042
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,520
There's nothing wrong with that.

1043
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,920
I'm just not going to like take Facebook.

1044
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,880
It's like, I mean, there's lots of,

1045
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,640
okay, I have a Crock-Pot,

1046
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,000
but if my Facebook picture is me holding a Crock-Pot above my head,

1047
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,320
like, yes, look at it.

1048
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,960
This is me.

1049
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,320
This is me in 2012 with a Crock-Pot.

1050
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,120
It's all about it.

1051
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,120
Like it doesn't matter.

1052
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,760
Like putting it in your Facebook picture is,

1053
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,720
it defines you.

1054
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,640
I mean, it is your, that is your outside message to the world, right?

1055
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,920
Well, I think if you're the kind of person that owns swords,

1056
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,280
then you're the kind of person that owns swords

1057
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,640
and there's no getting around that.

1058
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,920
You know, I have a sword and you guys want to know a secret?

1059
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:07,680
Not.

1060
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,600
Okay, great.

1061
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,800
This is really dicey, but I'm going to go with yes.

1062
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,720
I would never own a gun,

1063
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,280
but I see nothing wrong with keeping a sword by the bed for protection.

1064
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,240
Is this about to get,

1065
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,560
are we about to have an argument about the lethality of swords?

1066
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,920
No, no, no.

1067
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm just saying like, I see nothing.

1068
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,840
I would like to envision a circumstance in which a criminal breaks into my house

1069
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,080
and has a gun and I draw a sword.

1070
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,040
You're telling me you could more easily stab a stranger with a giant sword

1071
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,880
than you could shoot a stranger.

1072
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,200
Like you severed their-

1073
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,560
No, I'm hoping that they're shocked.

1074
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,160
You stab them in the guts and then you see it.

1075
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,360
You see everything.

1076
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,720
You watch their intestines spill out across your Davenport.

1077
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,680
I can do a pretty deep lunge and I feel like it'll be really intimidating.

1078
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,520
That's, Travis, that's the most fucked up thing you've ever said out loud.

1079
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,440
I don't think that's true.

1080
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,360
Why don't you just keep a heavy rock next to the bed, fucking,

1081
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,680
you Lord of the Fly psychopath?

1082
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,960
I keep that under the couch.

1083
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,520
I just want to, I would just like to, I don't want my kids getting hurt,

1084
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,920
but I would like the feeling of crushing a man's skull with my bare hands.

1085
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,680
So I'll just keep a big rock next to my bed.

1086
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,720
Now the floor does open up into a sort of boo-boo box scorpion trap.

1087
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,960
But it's that, I mean, guns, yuck.

1088
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,520
Not for me.

1089
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,080
Not for me, but I do have a table that I lay them on

1090
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,320
and I saw a pinches off until they bleed out on my floor.

1091
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,880
Travis, you do have to do me a favor though.

1092
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,960
If you ever get into this imaginary situation, you gotta tube it for me.

1093
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,960
I gotta see what happens.

1094
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,560
I, seriously, I will make a whole Bravo series about that night you did that dumb thing.

1095
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,840
That's fair.

1096
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,800
Yeah, I, do you, okay.

1097
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,600
If you have the sword and they are like, they see you, okay?

1098
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,160
Describe that very next-

1099
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,080
This is how I picture it going.

1100
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,360
It's a very slow burn down to their gun

1101
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,480
and then they slow burn down to my sword.

1102
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:14,960
Okay.

1103
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,440
And then they drop the gun and just start backing away.

1104
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,760
Okay.

1105
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,280
That's how I hope it pans out.

1106
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,240
You have, why?

1107
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,280
Why would that happen?

1108
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,600
Because otherwise they shoot me in the face.

1109
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,640
Yeah, right.

1110
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,920
I mean, no, definitely.

1111
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,840
I'm pretty well versed in the actual thing that will definitely really happen.

1112
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,200
I'm kind of curious.

1113
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,640
I want you to take me sort of inside and why you think they're gonna see this.

1114
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,920
Well, I also have the true faith that like in an emergency situation,

1115
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,520
I would just immediately be able to have like the-

1116
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,920
The Dragon Ball Z fucking superpowers?

1117
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,120
Yeah, I just feel like Ninja would just come upon me

1118
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,800
and I would just move like a-

1119
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,960
No fucking bullets would come up on you.

1120
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,840
You would be dead.

1121
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,240
Your hope is that maybe the gunman will be superstitious

1122
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,960
about shooting mildly retarded Amish boys.

1123
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,440
I would much rather be shot than stabbed.

1124
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,240
I'm out of here.

1125
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,280
Now, I just want to point out though,

1126
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,080
if you were gonna get shot by someone robbing your house,

1127
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,160
wouldn't you want it to be sword in hand?

1128
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,400
No!

1129
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,240
You don't want to go out like that?

1130
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,800
Like a Ren Faire-ian actor?

1131
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,400
No, I don't want to go out like that.

1132
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,440
I want to go out like a man whose house got robbed with dignity

1133
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,280
while he was in his bedroom.

1134
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,120
I want to go out with a wizard wand

1135
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,280
because I would stand a better fucking chance

1136
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,160
than you would with your goddamn sword.

1137
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,280
What were his last words?

1138
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,240
His last words were,

1139
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,600
Presto, I'm a dipshit.

1140
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,720
Travis's last words were,

1141
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,360
my name is Inigo Montoya.

1142
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:45,760
You kill-

1143
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,080
Opsies!

1144
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,840
That was Travis's last word.

1145
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,280
He was doing the monologue,

1146
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:55,920
but then he said,

1147
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,400
Opsies.

1148
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,280
He said something about the quickening

1149
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:03,920
and then he bled out.

1150
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,960
He was dead as fuck.

1151
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,800
He was really dead

1152
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,920
and I miss him so much.

1153
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,720
He was my brother.

1154
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,880
He was a stupid man,

1155
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,240
but I loved him very much.

1156
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,960
He was great with a sword,

1157
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,920
as long as his enemy was not armed with a gun.

1158
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,920
Or any other weapon

1159
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,040
because swords are bullshit.

1160
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,120
Oh man,

1161
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,880
gotta tube that for me.

1162
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,640
My house,

1163
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,920
where I still live with my parents,

1164
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,400
was recently broken into.

1165
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,520
We had some electronics and jewelry stolen,

1166
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,240
if only,

1167
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,000
if only,

1168
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,360
had been armed with-

1169
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,560
With Sarah Travis McElroy.

1170
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,480
We had a security door installed

1171
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,360
to distort-

1172
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,840
Oh God,

1173
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,640
let me try again.

1174
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,400
We had a security door installed

1175
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,960
to deter any further attempts at theft

1176
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,120
and I believe my parents find that to be enough.

1177
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,400
I, however,

1178
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,240
would prefer to be more proactive

1179
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,560
and aggressive towards future thieves.

1180
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,520
Swords!

1181
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
So what methods would you suggest

1182
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,840
for further fortifying my home?

1183
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,480
A katana rack by the bedroom door.

1184
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,120
Oh, a katana rack.

1185
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,280
That's good because you're-

1186
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,520
It's both stylish and efficient.

1187
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,680
You might be cutting him so many times

1188
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,000
and not being killed for so long

1189
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,360
that you can wear down the edge

1190
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,320
on your first katana.

1191
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,640
So it's good if it's a band of thieves.

1192
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,280
Oh, good.

1193
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:23,520
Yeah,

1194
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,880
cause you might bury your katana

1195
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,760
in one of their chests

1196
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,880
while you're not getting shot.

1197
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,640
Hey, can I have that back?

1198
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,360
Ah, no.

1199
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,360
At least I killed one of you.

1200
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,240
I don't want to distract from my stupidity,

1201
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,160
but I do have the question as to

1202
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,680
what is a security door?

1203
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,040
It's like a-

1204
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,000
Isn't that like a door?

1205
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,160
I mean, yeah,

1206
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,360
but I think it's like metal.

1207
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,400
So you can't get through it.

1208
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,360
There's a retina scanner.

1209
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:47,920
I'm pretty sure.

1210
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,120
And there's a picture of Travis

1211
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,320
with a sword on the front of it.

1212
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,280
Beware of idiots.

1213
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,440
And then it says the words inside

1214
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,880
and then there's an arrow pointing to you.

1215
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,880
Just wait.

1216
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,760
This is inside.

1217
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,960
Stab, stabs and hoys.

1218
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,200
Beware of swordsmen.

1219
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,680
It says, it says,

1220
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,880
beware of swords at the top

1221
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,000
and then at the bottom it says,

1222
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,680
do you really want this on your conscience?

1223
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,400
Go on.

1224
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,760
He's, he's got enough problems.

1225
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,800
He's actually six.

1226
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,840
He has progeria.

1227
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,880
This is my son, Jack.

1228
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,920
He has Jack disease.

1229
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,880
He has Jack disease.

1230
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,840
Thinks he's a knight.

1231
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,200
His shit is fucked.

1232
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,240
Please be careful.

1233
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,080
It's the weird thing now.

1234
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,600
He has a lot of diamonds.

1235
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,160
So if you're in the market for a cheap one,

1236
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,600
he's your guy,

1237
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,560
which is probably why you're breaking in.

1238
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,000
But we'd rather you not.

1239
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,480
So, um, I panic room.

1240
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,440
Yeah, gotta go panic room.

1241
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,920
You get a panic room

1242
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,000
and don't get a half ass panic room.

1243
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,280
That's what I found.

1244
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,280
If you hang a blanket up over your closet,

1245
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,560
that is not a panic room.

1246
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,200
I'm afraid that's a,

1247
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,320
that is a tiny closet

1248
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,840
in which you may very well panic.

1249
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,040
If I knew Travis had a sword in the house,

1250
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,320
no room in my home wouldn't be.

1251
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,520
I would constantly be panicking about it.

1252
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,160
I hope he doesn't get it out today.

1253
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,920
So are we done here?

1254
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,920
Have we helped enough for one week?

1255
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:29,920
I think so.

1256
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,120
Jesus.

1257
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,600
So thank you so much for listening.

1258
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,480
Thank you to everyone

1259
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,760
who's been tweeting about the show.

1260
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,600
Turbo Toaster,

1261
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,120
Real Mike Dempsey,

1262
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,440
Real Nate Miller.

1263
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,400
There's a lot of real people,

1264
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:46,960
which I like.

1265
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,840
DJ Shanty,

1266
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,760
World Champ Dan,

1267
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,720
Infinite Brads,

1268
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,480
Zek Becker,

1269
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,080
Ham Doctors,

1270
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,640
our old friend,

1271
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,600
Craig C,

1272
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,720
Jens Dietrich,

1273
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,600
so many people,

1274
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,240
Fitzy Bear,

1275
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,320
and Casey Fitz,

1276
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,280
who I guess loves us more than her husband now.

1277
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,680
Okay.

1278
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,960
Which is fine.

1279
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,320
Which we're used to that.

1280
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,640
I think secretly in their heart of hearts,

1281
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,120
every wife and every husband

1282
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,440
loves us more than their significant other.

1283
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,120
It's life.

1284
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,000
Nothing to feel bad about,

1285
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,200
but thank you guys so much

1286
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,560
for tweeting about the show.

1287
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,320
Just use the MBM hashtag

1288
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,120
when you do that.

1289
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,760
Hey, don't forget that

1290
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,560
the second My Brother,

1291
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,120
My Brother,

1292
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,560
and Me mixtape

1293
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,920
by our friend Rocky Horror

1294
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,520
is live.

1295
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,840
What's the best way of getting that?

1296
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,320
I think iTunes.

1297
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,600
If you search Hell House,

1298
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,400
it's a podcast on iTunes

1299
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,880
and it's the February episode.

1300
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,560
Oh, well, there you go.

1301
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,840
That's a fine way of getting it.

1302
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,840
You can also go to myspace.com

1303
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,120
forward slash Rocky Horror-fied

1304
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,440
to learn more about our friend.

1305
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,880
I don't know if he's still using that or not,

1306
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,200
but he's also Rocky Horror on Twitter.

1307
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,160
He's fine in that way.

1308
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,520
You probably just ask him.

1309
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,720
RH Club Music.

1310
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,440
That's his website.

1311
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,280
RHclubmusic.com

1312
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,880
So go there and go get the second

1313
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,520
My Brother, My Brother,

1314
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,800
and Me mixtape

1315
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,320
and support him.

1316
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,960
Support all the other Maximum Fun podcasts.

1317
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,640
Please do us a favor, guys.

1318
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,440
This week, go to the Maximum Fun forum

1319
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,280
and just talk about us.

1320
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,120
Talk about this episode.

1321
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,000
We'll put a thread up

1322
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,160
and I promise this week

1323
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,840
I'll be better about being in there

1324
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,800
and talking to people.

1325
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,160
So if you want to come by,

1326
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,280
tell us what you thought, talk.

1327
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,800
We will all go in there

1328
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,160
and chat people up this week.

1329
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,600
So find that thread and comment on it

1330
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,960
because the other guys get...

1331
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,640
They talk about their show and...

1332
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,920
They're so popular.

1333
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,600
They're more powerful than ever.

1334
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,000
And I just want a little taste of that.

1335
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,640
So make sure that whatever you do,

1336
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,240
you go to Stacksoap.com

1337
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,040
and you check it out.

1338
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,840
Buy some Stacksoap.

1339
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,880
And you tell them we sent you.

1340
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,800
I want to thank John Roderick

1341
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,840
and The Long Winters

1342
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,960
for the use of our theme song

1343
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,160
It's a Departure off the album

1344
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,360
Putting the Days to Bed.

1345
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,200
I saw a lot of people on Twitter

1346
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,160
saying they bought it

1347
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,160
and that made me smile

1348
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,200
a little bit in my heart

1349
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,360
because it's a good album.

1350
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,720
It's a great band.

1351
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,800
And sometimes I just like to think

1352
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,920
that I'm sitting under the same big white moon

1353
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,120
just listening to the same tunes

1354
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,560
as somebody else in the world, you know?

1355
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,080
Yeah, that's good stuff.

1356
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,320
Forming a lunar music connection.

1357
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,520
That's beautiful, Griffin.

1358
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,800
You're a beautiful man.

1359
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,360
So that's it.

1360
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,320
That's our show.

1361
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,760
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.

1362
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,920
Yeah, find somebody special you love

1363
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,960
and just squeeze them.

1364
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,440
Squeeze them.

1365
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,680
And keep listening.

1366
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,280
Go subscribe on iTunes and rate us

1367
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,120
and retweet the tweet about this show

1368
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,400
and we'll see you next week.

1369
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,640
Go and put us on your Facebook if you want.

1370
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,040
I don't know.

1371
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,880
Something.

1372
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,000
But thanks for listening.

1373
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,480
We love you.

1374
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,120
Thanks, everyone.

1375
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,600
This final Yahoo was sent in by Gali Ayali.

1376
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,240
Thank you, Gali.

1377
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,720
It's by Yahoo Answer's user, Turn, who asks,

1378
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,560
would Christianity be as popular as it is today

1379
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,120
if the Jesus was depicted more like Danny DeVito?

1380
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,520
I'm Justin McElroy.

1381
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,560
I'm Travis McElroy.

1382
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1383
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,480
This is with my brother.

1384
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,120
My brother and me.

1385
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,920
Kiss your dad.

1386
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:18,640
It's way out of the way.

1387
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,320
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1388
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,360
Keep your heart.

1389
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,520
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1390
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,560
Keep your heart.

1391
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,840
Man, these girls are smart.

1392
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,600
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

1393
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:42,480
Three Stacks, Three Stacks, Three Stacks, Three Stacks.
