1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,940
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,820
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,300
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:26,500
Hello governor. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet grown-up brother Griffin McElroy

11
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,860
We're back in the saddle again

12
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,660
Back states. I had this realization

13
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,500
Yes

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,340
That this was well we were on our hiatus. So we're the last episode we recorded would have been

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,220
like

16
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,020
October 13th, who can say that is the longest time I

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,980
Have gone without recording an episode of my brother my brother and me

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
since I was a

19
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,020
30-year-old man since I was

20
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,560
Sorry 29 years old. Yes, since I was 29. It's the longest I've ever gotten

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,380
Gone with that. You're only 30. You're only 33 now nominal man. And what I realized is I

22
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,300
I had been contextualizing bad stuff that happened to me in my life

23
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,860
With like well, at least I'll be able to tell this story on the podcast

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,980
Yeah, I see how when things happen guys

25
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,020
Since we record our last episode, I spent two straight calendar days doing nothing

26
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:39,340
But making 15 gallons of chili and then serving 30 gallons of chili now. Wait, hold on

27
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,620
Sorry, that's not kind of loaves and fishes shit. Is that Justin you made 15 and then there were 30

28
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,020
He cut it

29
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,220
Water some water and some wood shavings

30
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:02,260
Um, okay you my wife this is how long it's been my wife has forgotten

31
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,620
This is just the sacred time

32
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,540
I bet yeah

33
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,220
I had some people also making chili Mary made like 15 gallons of chili and then I I served 30 gallons guys

34
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,260
15 gallons of chili is so gross

35
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,700
Yeah, and I feel like it's probably the worst with chili

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,060
There's probably other foods, but like I always have these giant freezer bags and I would just like schlurp

37
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,620
That's not the best way to move

38
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,500
And then I'd have this big vat of chili that I'm stirring all day

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I'm stirring this frozen chili and then I'll take it over to the serving pot

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:04:02,500
And then these people would watch me and I would beg them like first off take a step back because you were in the chili splash zone and then I said please don't watch this when you see this amount of food it's hugely appetizing and then I had to schlurp this hot boiling chili into a big pot

41
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:12,100
That draws too much attention to what a shared experience that is and like feeding pigs that are trough, right? It's just like the comparison is too obvious at that point

42
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:19,500
I wouldn't talk about this on a more politically minded podcast, but I think here I'm in safe company. Our booth was the Democrat

43
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:26,860
Like County Democrats and then our booth is directly positioned across from the County Republicans. I mean direct

44
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,660
Oh, that's nice

45
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:36,620
And these dudes brought two full-size cardboard standups of my man DJ D

46
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,620
My man DJ Trump was watching and presiding over the chili festivities over at their booth

47
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Known chili aficionado

48
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,620
They didn't affix Donald

49
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,620
He was thinking it was a windy day

50
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620
They didn't, hold on, oh no

51
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,620
So Donald would just go flying

52
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
He flat Stanley'd around everywhere

53
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,620
That's fun

54
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,620
He'd just go flying away, it was great

55
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:10,620
Can I ask a question? Did they at least hang a sign on DJ Trump that said like yum yum chili time or yum yum I love chili

56
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Just standing like a gargoyle in silent approval of the chili

57
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,620
Bad president, good chili eater boy

58
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:24,620
We started serving at 11 and they were done by 12 and it turned out they had only brought one pot of chili

59
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,620
New

60
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,620
And it's like guys, you brought one pot of chili

61
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,620
That's the same way they think about politics

62
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,620
Yes thank you, thank you Travis

63
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,620
They're like one pot

64
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,620
They brought one pot of chili and two Donald Trumps

65
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,620
Listen, I don't want to tell you your business but

66
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Maybe half the Trumps twice the chili

67
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,620
Then one of the dudes came over to our booth and was like do you have a cup

68
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,620
He said do you have a cup and luckily another candidate had provided cups with his logo on them

69
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,620
So I gave him one and he said thanks I got to skim all this grease off the top

70
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,620
It's like boy that sounds good

71
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,620
That sounds like good stuff right there

72
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,620
Seems like you guys really poured your heart and soul into this chili

73
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,620
I was hoping that you were going to say like they came over and they're like hey guys

74
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,620
Could we have some of your chili to give away

75
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,620
You seem to have a lot of chili like the ants in that one story

76
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,620
And we're like the grasshoppers in that story

77
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,620
And if you could give us some of your chili to give to potential voters and say that we made it

78
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,620
That would just be great

79
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,620
Yeah I've had a while, I drove a truck in a parade

80
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Oh Justin

81
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
Yeah it was like the whole

82
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,620
I mean I went to a castle and stuff but no go on about your chili and your car in a parade

83
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,620
The thing is we know all about your castle Travis

84
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,620
I went to like three castles dude

85
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Like three castles

86
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
Were they all really different

87
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,620
No they were basically like big stone buildings

88
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,620
Yeah sure

89
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,620
It never really got wild with the architecture

90
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Like I walk around my neighborhood now and I'm like that building looks different

91
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,620
Oh look that's like a mid-century monument

92
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,620
And like castles man they pretty much did just like squared off stone buildings

93
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,620
How were the buttresses though

94
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,620
Flying

95
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
Wow and the battle men

96
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,620
Oh yeah it was there

97
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
The portcullis forget about it

98
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,620
What about the Bailey

99
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,620
The Bailey it was old

100
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,620
It was one old Bailey

101
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,620
Yeah it's been a while

102
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,620
I've been thinking a lot about elevating my brand in the last two weeks

103
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,620
Oh okay

104
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Like and this is true I think for all of us

105
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,620
And I've been meaning to talk to you guys about this for a while

106
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,620
So maybe this isn't the show but

107
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,620
I think we're grown up adult men

108
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,620
I think we're grown up people

109
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,620
And there's a vibe of

110
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,620
Specifically me I think because I have put toys in my mouth before

111
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,620
That I'm like some sort of boy still

112
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,620
But I like I have a mortgage and two children

113
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,620
And so I've been thinking about like having my brand instead be like

114
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Grown up responsible

115
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,620
Because it's all true it's just not the face

116
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,620
That it's not the public facing

117
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
It's also not as funny or interesting

118
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,620
It's like well maybe not Travis but

119
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,620
It's real and I think people want real shit now

120
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,620
So I'm like Janus flipping the mask around

121
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,620
Oh and now the guy on Grey Brays

122
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
Griffin has two faces

123
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,620
And so now the goofball who eats toys

124
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
And bananas

125
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Talks about like toilet humor and stuff like that

126
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
Like he's in the back now

127
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
And then up front is

128
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Grown up Griffin McElroy

129
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,620
I care deeply about grown up stuff

130
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Can you give me an example of something that you care more about than you did

131
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,620
I mean just publicly care more about

132
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Publicly I care more about than two weeks ago?

133
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Yeah part of this new rebrand

134
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
The new Griffin experience

135
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,620
Like if you were going to say now I care about blank instead of Pokemon

136
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Yeah I would say sort of like

137
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,620
Moisturizing

138
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
I'm huge on that shit now

139
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,620
I realized that I wasn't wet enough

140
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
Ever basically

141
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Have you gone into serums?

142
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Serums I do

143
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,620
I have a salve

144
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,620
I have an ungent that I apply

145
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
On every full moon

146
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,620
And that really is what keeps me going

147
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
There's a lot a lot

148
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,620
A lot of placenta in that one

149
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,620
But it keeps it tight

150
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
And very very very damp

151
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Wait are you using plenty of centa?

152
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
Cause I've been using plenty of centa

153
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,620
I've been using plenty of centa since the day I turned 29 years old

154
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Yeah I can tell

155
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
Cause that's when things really start to drop off

156
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,620
But the plenty of centa tightens, dampens

157
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
Revives, revitalizes

158
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,620
And even now I can tell I'm getting silly again

159
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,620
You know what I mean?

160
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,620
It's work, it's work to elevate your brand

161
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
But like you know

162
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Do you guys know what I'm saying?

163
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,620
I feel out on a branch right now

164
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,620
No I feel like my brand is solid

165
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,620
And everybody is just really in favor of it

166
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,620
I don't feel like there's any holes in my brand

167
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,620
People often lift me up and say like

168
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
Hey Travis I notice that like

169
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
You seem to be like the best

170
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
And like most adjusted of the three

171
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
And the most like just completely

172
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
I think the word is neuro virgin

173
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,620
I think is what it is

174
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
You're just a real neuro virgin guy

175
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,620
Yeah that's what they definitely say

176
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Yeah yeah yeah

177
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,620
Justin anything you want to say about your brand?

178
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
How's your brand Juice?

179
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Mine's pretty well fucked at this point

180
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
You know what I mean?

181
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,620
I've done enough stuff where

182
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,620
I don't know that I have much of a brand anymore

183
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,620
I feel like I've kind of ruined my

184
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
You know what I think it was?

185
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
What was it Juice?

186
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
It was becoming a notary public

187
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Yeah you think that's

188
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Oh Juice that's an inspiration for me

189
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
For me that's like

190
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Once I hit that point

191
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,620
I'm like once I'm a notary public

192
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
And a sommelier

193
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,620
Then I'm for real

194
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,620
Done I have put my childish things

195
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Way the fuck behind me now

196
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,620
Because I can sign government documents and shit

197
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,620
But I think if I may

198
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,620
In terms of what Justin is saying to us

199
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Griffin what you're talking about is like a redirection

200
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Of your brand and what I think Justin is saying is

201
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,620
His brand became so dispersed

202
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,620
Between everything that he's doing all at once

203
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,620
That you cannot

204
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,620
Pin down one thing about Justin

205
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,620
It's like oh do you mean the guy

206
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
Who like is a notary public

207
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
And is Count Donut

208
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Like those two things together

209
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Like Janus the mask it flips Travis

210
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
Yes but it's like if his mask had

211
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,620
Like 162 faces

212
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,620
I think is the problem

213
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
You know what it is? I'm a modern renaissance man

214
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
That's exactly it

215
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,620
That's a good brand

216
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,620
Way up there

217
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Extremely elevated

218
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
I like to think that my brand is like

219
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,620
Just lazy cult leader

220
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,620
Who can do it but who can be bothered

221
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
That's kind of what I'm going for

222
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,620
The beard has been bad for my brand too

223
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,620
I think so in a major way

224
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,620
Okay good I just want to make sure

225
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,620
Good for your face

226
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,620
You know what

227
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
It has allowed me to sort of

228
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,620
Insert myself

229
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Into certain dad circles that I would not

230
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Be welcomed into

231
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,620
Because while they might be able to

232
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Talk about sports and stuff

233
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,620
If I see one of them's got a beard

234
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm in

235
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,620
You want to talk about beards? Of course you do

236
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,620
That's all you think about

237
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Oh just me? Okay good good

238
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
It's way cheaper than buying an ebike

239
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Like I had to do to fit in with the

240
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,620
Cool city dads here in DC

241
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,620
Who do fucking wheelies and stunts

242
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,620
I don't get dads

243
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Now we're not even doing the show anymore

244
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,620
We haven't talked in like half a month

245
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
What I don't get

246
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,620
Because I realized this recently

247
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,620
If you're a full blown dad joke dad

248
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,620
You gotta dye your hair

249
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,620
To a different color because the dad jokes

250
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,620
The number of people were like

251
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
I love your hair and I'm like thanks

252
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,620
I love it too but I hate ruining pillowcases

253
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
The number of like just straight up

254
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,620
That's not so much a dad joke as much as it is

255
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,620
That's not so much a dad joke as much as it is

256
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
Just like a thing that is true and I think

257
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,620
Annoying about hair color

258
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,620
I'll give you

259
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,620
I did a pumpkin carving contest

260
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
That I was the MC for

261
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,620
Man Justin your life

262
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,620
Has just gotten off the

263
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,620
Is this season two of your life

264
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,620
And they're just like we gotta ramp up the vids

265
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,620
This does feel like that break in Battlestar

266
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,620
Where they come back three years later

267
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,620
And it was like this is the mirror

268
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,620
Why

269
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,620
Thank you Travis

270
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,620
I had a pumpkin suit

271
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,620
On like

272
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Mr. Pumpkins did

273
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
But it wasn't a David Pumpkins costume

274
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
It was just a pumpkin suit

275
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
And people would be like I love your costume

276
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,620
Thanks I had a wedding earlier today

277
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,620
Oh that's good

278
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,620
That's really good stuff Juice

279
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,620
I like that

280
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
Should we do the questions

281
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,620
I got a lot of like

282
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,620
I got some Munch stuff

283
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Munch related stuff to talk about

284
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
I'm excited

285
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Is it too late to change the name of the bit to Munch stuff

286
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,620
I just like the way

287
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,620
It's uncomfortable in my mouth

288
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
As long as we're elevating the brand

289
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
This is Justin McElroy's Munch My Stuff

290
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Munch My Stuff

291
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
It can be like an old

292
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Playstation video game intro

293
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,620
Munch My Stuff

294
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
And if it's a thing that

295
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,620
Makes you really mad you can say like

296
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
This house my munch

297
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
This really munches my stuff

298
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,620
Oh yeah yeah yeah

299
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,620
So let's do a question

300
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,620
I just had a baby last month

301
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
And all my friends and family say

302
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
He's adorable I obviously think so too

303
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,620
However due to all the baby hormones

304
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,620
I'm not sure my judgement can be trusted

305
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,620
What if I'm just surrounded by liars

306
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
How can I tell if my baby is really cute

307
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Or if people are just lying to me

308
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,620
And that's from Cute Fuse in Chicago

309
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Travis was there an image attached

310
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,620
Well no they specifically said

311
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,620
They didn't want us to like

312
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Be biased by an image

313
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,620
Because this isn't about our judgement

314
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,620
On whether the baby is cute or not

315
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,620
Because how would they know to trust us

316
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,620
This is about how can they trust us

317
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,620
They should know that I don't care

318
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,620
That's also a good point

319
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,620
I want most folks to know that when you ask my opinion

320
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,620
On most things and you're not

321
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,620
An immediate family member of mine

322
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,620
You're gonna get the gosh darn honest truth

323
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,620
Because

324
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,620
I mean you need to be mirrored

325
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Don't we all need to be mirrored

326
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
That's an interesting point Griffin

327
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Because I would have said I would lie to strangers

328
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
And be honest with my family

329
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
No come on

330
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
No because I get to see you guys like all the time

331
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,620
And we work together like all the time

332
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,620
And if I say like a bad thing to you

333
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
About you that I felt for a long time

334
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,620
Then like uh oh

335
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
Next recording time uh oh

336
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
But if I see a stranger

337
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
With a busted looking baby

338
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
Then like you know

339
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
I can let them know that and then they can take the necessary

340
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Steps to beautify

341
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,620
That baby

342
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Step up the game get a flipper in there

343
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Hair extension something

344
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Listen people lie

345
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,620
You know who doesn't lie

346
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Is animals

347
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
If your animals are reacting to your baby like

348
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
Like a Disney princess birds landing on their shoulder

349
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Dogs wanna lick their faces

350
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,620
I think it's safe to say that's a cute baby

351
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Cute is a human reaction though

352
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,620
Like we don't

353
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
If animals don't have like cute

354
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Instincts

355
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Excuse me sir

356
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Like your baby's cute for a baby cat

357
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
But not cute for a human

358
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Yeah that's fair

359
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,620
Well then why are dogs and cats always putting on

360
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,620
Cute outfits huh if they don't have like cute instincts huh

361
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Think about that Justin

362
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,620
Actually I'm hoisted by my own pertard on that

363
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,620
Thank you

364
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,620
I think

365
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,620
All babies are

366
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Cute like

367
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
No no well hold on even the ones that

368
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Even the ones that aren't

369
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
Like

370
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,620
Traditionally

371
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Handsome babies

372
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,620
They're still like they're really

373
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,620
Really little and they can't do

374
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,620
Anything right

375
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,620
And that part's great I agree that that's great

376
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Their vulnerability definitely wins me over

377
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,620
They're so little and they fuck up

378
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
Non stop and they

379
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Just like piss and shit

380
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,620
Like whenever they want to

381
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
That's like

382
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
That's big cutie behavior if you ask me

383
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,620
And frankly for me and listen I might be in the minority

384
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,620
Here but I like me a Wallace

385
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,620
Sean looking baby you know what I mean

386
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,620
It's ideal for me

387
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Give me a baby with a tonsure

388
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Oh yeah

389
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Just a little

390
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Shiny fontanelle

391
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Sometimes you see a baby

392
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Trying too hard and it's like yeah man

393
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
I get it you're conventionally

394
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Attractive for a baby

395
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,620
Alright okay

396
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,620
I'm gonna blow this one wide open

397
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
You can't trust people

398
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
To tell you the honest truth about

399
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,620
Your baby there is only one force

400
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
That we can turn to at times like this

401
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
It's capitalism

402
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Here's what I want you to do I need you to take that baby

403
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,620
To Los Angeles, California

404
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
And you are gonna put your money

405
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Where your mouth is and you're gonna start

406
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Pushing that baby

407
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,620
You need to become a baby agent

408
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,620
I recommend baby Joel Begley

409
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,620
He's just like our agent but a baby

410
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,620
And go to him and say

411
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,620
I gotta take my shot

412
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,620
And then you just start cranking it

413
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
If that baby's really cute

414
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,620
You're gonna start booking

415
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,620
And that is the only thing you can trust

416
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Is your baby booking

417
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,620
Yep because this is also a good chance

418
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Listen your baby might be cute right

419
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Being cute is easy but

420
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,620
This is also a good chance to figure out is your baby driven

421
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Because it's like Baby Rock said

422
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
It's about drive

423
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
It's about drive

424
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
It's about power

425
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,620
When you feel hungry

426
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,620
With the vowel

427
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Wait for the inevitable

428
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Full house reboot

429
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
When they open the roll up for

430
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
You know baby

431
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Like Michelle would probably be a dinosaur

432
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Or something like whatever

433
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,620
And then you come for that

434
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Crown and let's see how cute your baby is

435
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Let's see how cute

436
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,620
The baby auditions for fullest house

437
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Are going to be

438
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
It's going to be the hunger games

439
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
I have quintuplets they can each work 15 minutes

440
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Swamp them out as needed

441
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
You know what we can go through them

442
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Work one so bad

443
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
You can keep one

444
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Keep one that's yours

445
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,620
We have a PA who runs in and swaps

446
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,620
The baby out mid scene

447
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Mid scene

448
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
No cuts

449
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
We have one of these quintuplets we only use for lighting

450
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
So we just put the baby there

451
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
So we don't have to get one of the really choice babies

452
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
To stand out

453
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,620
Yeah we got a close up baby

454
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
We got a back of the headshot baby

455
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
My name is Derek

456
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,620
I thought I was working with Skylar today

457
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,620
Derek I'm just running your lines

458
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
They're going to shoot me from behind the head

459
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
I look just like beautiful Skylar

460
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
I'm here for the two shots

461
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Don't worry about it

462
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Hey let's bang through this

463
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Okay it's martini o'clock

464
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Let's see we got some ADR here

465
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,620
Okay

466
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,620
Let me take that again

467
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,620
That didn't feel natural

468
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,620
I'm a mocap for my brother

469
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Derek

470
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Please ignore all the white balls glued to my face

471
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,620
It's hard for me to because I'm a baby and what not

472
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
I'm just going to swing at this tennis ball

473
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Hang in front of me

474
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Pretend it's I don't know a fun toy

475
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,620
That a beautiful baby would get

476
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,620
And I did eat it

477
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,620
One of the balls

478
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Please call my mommy and my doctor

479
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Apologies to Robert Zemeckis that we have

480
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
Backed into

481
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Baby Herman from

482
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,620
Frame Roger Rabbit just back character

483
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,620
Again

484
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,620
Hey can we go to the wizards

485
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,620
House

486
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,620
This one was sent in by Zach

487
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
I want to knock first

488
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
Knock knock knock

489
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
Well the door just swung open

490
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
And a bat flew out

491
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
And the bat is the wizard

492
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
This is the wiki how it's how to blow a

493
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,620
Kiss how to blow a kiss

494
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Just because it's Halloween it doesn't mean

495
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,620
We can't have a little

496
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Valentine's Day in here don't you think

497
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
I think Halloween is like couples costumes

498
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
And group costumes and

499
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Friends becoming lovers

500
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Lovers becoming wolves

501
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Blowing a kiss is a great way to show affection for

502
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,620
Someone in a light hearted way

503
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
Remember to lock eyes with the person while blowing

504
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,620
Them a kiss always choose an appropriate

505
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Time to blow kisses and avoid making

506
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
This gesture to anyone who might not like it which

507
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,620
I will say statistically

508
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Speaking is

509
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,620
Everyone

510
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620
If you were to take the statistics

511
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,620
Of the human population which I think is like

512
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
8 some billion

513
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
Right and then you take

514
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Out of that number

515
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
The number of people that it's okay

516
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
For you to blow a kiss to it is so

517
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,620
Statistically insignificant that

518
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,620
It is zero

519
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,620
For all intents and purposes

520
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,620
It's the lottery ticket of human interaction

521
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,620
They're just like once in a while once in a

522
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
Great while it might hit

523
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,620
A little bit and that's probably because the person thought

524
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
You were someone else that kind of looks like

525
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
You I blew a kiss

526
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,620
I blew a kiss to my baby today because he clocked

527
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,620
Me while I was taking Henry to school

528
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
And he was at the window

529
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,620
And I gave him a little and then I

530
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,620
Thought like was that right

531
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,620
Yeah

532
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Did I do that?

533
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
What kind of look did he give back to you?

534
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,620
I mean he smiled he loves

535
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,620
He really is a big fan of me

536
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
Was it a smile like oh dad that wasn't

537
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
The time for that yeah it was pretty fucking

538
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,620
Condescending actually now that I'm thinking about it

539
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,620
So anyway making the gesture

540
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
I'm hung up though on the

541
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,620
Lighthearted gesture and I'm wondering

542
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
If there's like a way that one could

543
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,620
Dramatically blow a kiss

544
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Like either in a threatening way

545
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
Or like this means something kind of

546
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,620
You know like when you see in like mafia movies and they get that

547
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,620
Like kiss of death could you do that

548
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
With blowing a kiss where it's just like hey you

549
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,620
Mwah

550
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
Oh no it's the black spot

551
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,620
What? I don't think that gets it done

552
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,620
I don't think this is a lighthearted if you take

553
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
Lighthearted at face value to mean like something that's just

554
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
Kind of like woo playful and a

555
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,620
Little poof a little poof of smoke

556
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
Blowing a kiss is not

557
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
That because I'm going to be thinking about that all day

558
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
If someone does that to me but let's make sure

559
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
We're doing it right please wait until

560
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
You are a short distance away from the person

561
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Blowing a kiss is a nonverbal show of affection

562
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
That works best when you're a short distance away from

563
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
Someone e.g. across the room if you blow

564
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
Someone a kiss at close proximity

565
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,620
It may seem odd and unnecessary

566
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,620
That's true some

567
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,620
Some close quarters combat

568
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,620
But what's the farthest that's such a vague

569
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,620
That's a great that's the next

570
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
Question is like I feel like I could

571
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
360 no scope my baby

572
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,620
With a

573
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,620
Remote smoocher like

574
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
From across like a crowded theater

575
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
And I feel like I have done that

576
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
I think one end of an end zone to end zone of a football

577
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Field clear line of sight

578
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
I could get them

579
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
The line of sight is important

580
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
It can't be full of people right because then

581
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Unless I can stand up like on one of those bandstands

582
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
That like you know that the drum

583
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
Line leaders use and stuff like if I could get that

584
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
I think I could get them into this you don't want it to hit

585
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Someone else no god no

586
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
Are you kidding me yeah in this

587
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,620
Economy this one's important

588
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,620
Lock eyes with the person you're blowing a kiss to making

589
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
Direct eye contact with blowing a kiss let's the person

590
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
Know you're sending it to them

591
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,620
Look at the person until they look back at you and

592
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Smile when they meet your gaze hold that eye contact

593
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
While you blow them a kiss if they break

594
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
Eye contact before you make the gesture wait until they

595
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,620
Look back at you to try again

596
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,620
In front of your mouth like yeah

597
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,620
It's like a oh so it's like

598
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,620
Um it's like tipping at the

599
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,620
Deli you gotta wait

600
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,620
They have to wait until they see they gotta

601
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,620
Wait till they're looking like hello here you go yeah

602
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Um

603
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620
I can't think of anything worse

604
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
Than somebody leaving you

605
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Hanging on a kiss blow

606
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,620
That's gotta be a tough that's gotta be a

607
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,620
Tough one to just turn away

608
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,620
In the middle like I'm like

609
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,620
And they turn away in the middle

610
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Of it and then it's like someone else

611
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,620
Sees me blowing a kiss to

612
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
Nobody to a ghost well it's

613
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
Just like playing catch with someone without that eye

614
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
Contact you blow the kiss when they're not

615
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
Looking hits them right inside of the head they're down

616
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
I mean they're unconscious

617
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,620
I just had a freaking grand idea

618
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
If you're listening to this show

619
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
And you see us in the real

620
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
World

621
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,620
Just blow us a sweet kiss

622
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
Wow that's interesting if you blow us a

623
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
Big bold move and I clock

624
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
It no it's not bold

625
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Well both of you do include your two brothers

626
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
Who didn't get a vote in this new idea

627
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
Yeah I feel like and this is one of those

628
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,620
Things that is like the secret on the

629
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,620
Show but for bad but for bad

630
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Like if there was a secret that was

631
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,620
For bad that was like when you say

632
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
It the bad thing is going to happen now

633
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
It's like the it's like the

634
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
That's what you've done

635
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
I mean that don't just start indiscriminately

636
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
But I'm like I'm saying

637
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
Here's my consent to just like blowing

638
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Me a kiss anytime you see me and I'll

639
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
I'll know your whole story

640
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Yeah I'll get it and then just be like

641
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
You'll be completely comfortable knowing that

642
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
I've just like I caught it with my hand

643
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
I smooshed it on my cheek thank you so much

644
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
Now here's what I will say Justin from

645
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
That gesture it's just occurred to me

646
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
That there is not a I guess maybe a thumbs

647
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,620
Up but like blowing a kiss seems

648
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,620
Intimate in a way of like kissing

649
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,620
On the cheek would be as opposed to like

650
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
A high five can we long distance high

651
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,620
Five as a thing to replace

652
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Look at yourself do it again Travis

653
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,620
Oh yeah no I did it no I did it

654
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,620
And I felt it no I'm not doing it

655
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
Again ever again in my life

656
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,620
High five is bad

657
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,620
Bad bad bad

658
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
Historically speaking while you're driving

659
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
Historically speaking not great

660
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
Not a great look

661
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
How do you guys receive a

662
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
Kiss blow you catch it you put in your

663
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Pocket

664
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
See I like to I like to make my

665
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,620
Kiss bust up because when they blow me a kiss

666
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
I'll grab it out of the air and I'll fucking eat it

667
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,620
Oh that's a good one

668
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
It's a sweet little candy

669
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,620
Yeah it's like no I get like I'm like a beast

670
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
I'm like

671
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
It's filling me up good

672
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,620
Kiss your palm slowly bring the palm

673
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,620
To your hand to your mouth touch your palm with your lips

674
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,620
I don't think that's right it's

675
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Fingertips it's not palm

676
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
For me this is where I got

677
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
Fucked up when I blew a kiss to Gus today

678
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Is I did it very

679
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,620
Very much on the fingertips

680
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
I rolled it off there I rolled it

681
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Oh now that's it oh

682
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,620
Griffin I'm sure we'll get to this but when

683
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,620
I hear blow kiss

684
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,620
Well I don't blow I'm sure there are people

685
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,620
Who and

686
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,620
And like waft it off

687
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,620
If you don't send it on its merry way

688
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Yeah how the kiss is supposed to get to them

689
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,620
I'm sending it

690
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
People are gonna think you got some delicious marinara on there

691
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,620
I'm sending it right

692
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
With my energy but I'm not blowing

693
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,620
Travis oh that's interesting

694
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
If you look at your kiss

695
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I know Justin

696
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
I know Justin I can feel it too

697
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
Historically

698
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,620
The way you're doing your hand with flinging your kisses

699
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
Looks bad historically

700
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
That's why I'm doing it backhanded now instead of

701
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Maybe throw him a grounder

702
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,620
Travis you know what I mean

703
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,620
A slider right between your

704
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Arms

705
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
I'll put it in a little envelope

706
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
And I'll seal it and I'll put it in an imaginary

707
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
And then they can open it and it's safe

708
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,620
That way

709
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Position your hand after kissing your palm place your hand flat under your mouth

710
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
We know this one you gotta have a stable firing

711
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,620
Platform but here's step 5

712
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
Blow away the imaginary kiss

713
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,620
This motion will signify you blowing the kiss to its intended target

714
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Do this gesture slowly

715
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,620
To create emphasis

716
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,620
I think that's the thing

717
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
That's most threatening because if I was

718
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,620
Close to that person right and we have

719
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,620
A relationship like physically or emotionally

720
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Both

721
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,620
You know if it was someone where we had a relationship

722
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
Where we kiss each other on a regular basis

723
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
I would feel comfortable kissing them

724
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
What I would not do is kiss them and then

725
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
Blow against their lips to cement

726
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
That kiss in there

727
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
Like a kiss on the cheek so like

728
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
I'm sending the kiss

729
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
You know that that's not

730
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
My kiss is like a butterfly

731
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,620
It flies on its own me blowing on it

732
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
It's just gonna fuck up its trajectory

733
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,620
That's crazy

734
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,620
Your kiss can't fly on its own

735
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,620
My kiss is a fucking butterfly

736
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,620
I don't know about you guys lead balloon

737
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Kisses sorry your kisses suck

738
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
Be mindful about your cultural

739
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Surroundings this is good

740
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
I think in general

741
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,620
Hey all wiki however step 1

742
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Step 1 keep your grades up

743
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,620
Step 2 be mindful of your cultural

744
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,620
Surroundings

745
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
Blowing your kiss is a gesture

746
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
That's well understood in North American culture but not necessarily

747
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,620
In others in Brazil for instance

748
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,620
The gesture of bringing your fingers to your mouth

749
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
As you kiss them signifies the enjoyment

750
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,620
Of a meal and not a sign of affection

751
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,620
This to me seems like

752
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,620
That's still okay like

753
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
If you're in Brazil and you blow someone a kiss

754
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
Someone will look at you and be like

755
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
They must have eaten something very delicious

756
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,620
Lately that's not so bad

757
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,620
If it was like

758
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
You wish that their you know

759
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,620
That their whole family was sick

760
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Or something like that like that's what this

761
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
This is a cursing this is a cursing gesture

762
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,620
And I think as we've established earlier

763
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,620
On in this segment there's definitely

764
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Some gestures you could make that are universally

765
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Unpleasant right that everyone's like

766
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
There's no confusing that for anything else

767
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Choose an appropriate time and place

768
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Yeah I mean don't get

769
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Not a funeral

770
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,620
Blowing a kiss is often

771
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,620
Seen as a flirtatious gesture

772
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
Which can be problematic in the workplace

773
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,620
Yes in fact I would say

774
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
It can be problematic in a

775
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Workplace any workplace

776
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
Any workplace you don't have to work

777
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
At the workplace if you are at the workplace

778
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,620
Then it's not good

779
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,620
And also the place what's the name

780
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,620
Of the thing that connects all the workplaces

781
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Outside the world don't

782
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Do it there either cause that one can also

783
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620
Like somebody might be working nearby

784
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,620
The only place not to do it is

785
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,620
Well I mean unless I'm there

786
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Which I've already consented to blow all

787
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,620
The kisses you like other than that

788
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,620
Just like not inside a

789
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Workplace and not outside a workplace

790
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Other than that those two

791
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Situations

792
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
I think there's two people

793
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
I can think of that I would feel comfortable doing this to

794
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
And neither of them

795
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,620
Are you guys or my wife

796
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
So my friends Bob and Bradberry

797
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
I think Bob and Bradberry we could be like hey buddy what's up

798
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,620
How's it going like and be very comfortable

799
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
It's cool

800
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,620
Like it's a cool thing

801
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
That would be like a cool feeling very

802
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,620
Hip way to do it I would not make a

803
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,620
Show of it I think there's something in the show

804
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Like mwah

805
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Right where it's just like you fucking

806
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,620
But if you're just like hey man stay classy

807
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
Or whatever I think I could pull that off I think I could

808
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Do that I do it to my little stinkers

809
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,620
That's it oh yeah yep

810
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,620
I've started doing this thing and it

811
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,620
Like it makes me feel

812
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
Once again like a cool dad

813
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
Where like I'll make a drugs

814
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,620
They're awesome and I put my hat on back once I talk

815
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,620
To my kids look how great they are it works great

816
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
Hey kids let's talk about drugs

817
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,620
Have you tried it you know

818
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,620
You got any know where I can get them

819
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Sure I will make a joke

820
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Like for my three year old like maybe

821
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,620
For lunch we should have a bowl of farts and

822
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,620
Dot last but I wink at BB

823
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,620
As if to say like you know we wouldn't

824
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,620
Really eat farts and she like looks at me

825
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,620
And nods and I'm like yeah man we're cool

826
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,620
I want to bring back the wink

827
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Is that something that we can like reincorporate

828
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
No for sure not

829
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,620
No damn it I thought

830
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,620
We could but you know what you guys are right

831
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
And also

832
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,620
The last tip here is make sure the person

833
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Won't be uncomfortable which like

834
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Should have been first of all the first

835
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,620
Tip also impossible also

836
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,620
I would just err on the side of caution

837
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Which is to say don't blow a kiss

838
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
Unless it's to one of your little stinkers

839
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
Or to a dog

840
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Or someone you have told I'm going

841
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,620
To blow a kiss at you is that

842
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
Do you mind then that

843
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Could be okay right I think you would

844
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Have to you would have to phrase it like

845
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
At some point I would like to try to blow

846
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,620
A kiss at you that's cool and I'm totally

847
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Fine if we do it and then

848
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,620
You're like never do that again are

849
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
You willing to try this exchange

850
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,620
At least once to see how we both feel

851
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,620
I don't know that I couldn't give blanket

852
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Consent to it like Justin has

853
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
As we are introducing this into

854
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,620
This sort of like social consciousness

855
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
Of our

856
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Cultural surroundings

857
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
We have an opportunity here to

858
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Kind of like set the rules because we are

859
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,620
On the cutting edge we're pioneers

860
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,620
So like first order of business

861
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,620
For me we've discussed

862
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
Technique right like get to the fingers

863
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
You gotta blow

864
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,620
Stable firing platform all that stuff

865
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Yeah absolutely big thing for me

866
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,620
Sound is

867
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,620
Necessary is it

868
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Is it creepier for me to go

869
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,620
Or is it creepier for me to go

870
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,620
I think silent

871
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,620
Is weird well but see then we're getting

872
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,620
Into sign language that is

873
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Thank you

874
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
And I think it's an inch

875
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
Lower with the fingers and no sound

876
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Right the only way to make it clear

877
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,620
That what I'm saying is I'm kissing you

878
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
And I'm blowing it at your face is like

879
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Okay and then the receiving

880
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
End of it I think just a nod

881
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,620
Just like

882
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Or a gentle touch of the cheek

883
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
Like a breeze well no no no no no

884
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,620
Because I don't know because I wouldn't

885
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,620
Kiss you on the cheek do you know what I mean

886
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,620
Like I wouldn't kiss you on the cheek I'm your brother

887
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,620
No I wouldn't kiss

888
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,620
I wouldn't kiss you hairy boys on your hairy cheeks

889
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,620
Oh it's lovely it's like

890
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Nuzzling a big bear it's not lovely

891
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
I'm not gonna kiss you guys hairy cheeks

892
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Stop it oh boy stop it

893
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
So like I don't wanna address

894
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,620
I don't want it to be I don't want it to land

895
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,620
On me like I don't wanna

896
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,620
I don't want it to land

897
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,620
On me and me be the one that put it there

898
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
Do you know what I mean so just a

899
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,620
A new look and like a

900
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Like just curl your fingers

901
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
And a nod like I want something of like it's been

902
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,620
Oh that's cool that can be like a

903
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,620
Cool gesture of just like you

904
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Sort of like your David Bowie

905
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
With the oar oh yeah I've welcomed

906
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,620
This I've got the kiss now

907
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,620
And you can kind of like play with it and roll it around

908
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,620
Your fingers like a coin oh

909
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,620
Yeah do tricks with the kiss

910
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Oh I like that just a catch and a

911
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Nod what do you think Justin's thinking about

912
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
I don't know man David Bowie

913
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,620
No you find the guys

914
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,620
There's contact juggling that's settled

915
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,620
On blowing kisses that's all done

916
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,620
We've weighed in on that and I think it's time to

917
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Treat ourselves with a quick trip

918
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
To the money zone

919
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Can I tell you guys something messed up

920
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
The whole time I was in the UK

921
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
I didn't receive one letter

922
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
No one sent me any letters

923
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
As I bounced from castle to castle

924
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Just cleansing them of

925
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Every wrongdoing that's ever been done there

926
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
I didn't receive one stinking

927
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Letter from either of you were you sending them

928
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
No

929
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,620
You know I was going to

930
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,620
But I actually don't have the time to go to the

931
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
Post office right now oh

932
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Justin you idiot

933
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
That's the only place where stamps are so

934
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Sorry Justin

935
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,620
Idiot is a word

936
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,620
They use over in the UK

937
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,620
To mean like somebody who doesn't know something

938
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
You might not have heard it before

939
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
And because you don't know about stamps.com

940
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620

00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620

Do you just take a picture of the stamps on the screen

947
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
With your phone and then no Justin

948

992
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,620
Doing it but I do not

993
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,620
I am not convinced stamps.com

994
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,620
That your service is going to

995
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,620
Make my evenings any

996
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Any quieter oh

997
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
So griffin actually it's buried deep in the

998
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
Contracts so be careful that's why it's important you read everything

999
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,620
Yeah when you sign up with

1000
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Stamps.com it does require at least one

1001
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Night a week you watch a quiet place and

1002
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,620
Act it out oh wow

1003
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,620
And not make any sound now I've never

1004
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
Seen a quiet place except that I know that people

1005
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,620
Are really quiet in it and I think Jim from

1006
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,620
The office is in there pulling faces constantly

1007
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Yeah and you could also

1008
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,620
Probably just get by watching the office on mute

1009
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
If that's what you wanted to do instead

1010
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,620
They don't have any way of checking up on you

1011
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,620
That's what I found out

1012
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,620
You guys see a quiet place

1013
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,620
What's it about I have not

1014
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Seen that one yet um

1015
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Yeah it's one of those movies where you have to

1016
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,620
Pay the dead kid tax at the top

1017
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
Of it in order to enjoy the rest of the film

1018
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,620
Yeah I wish there was a website

1019
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,620
Just for that there's one about whether dogs

1020
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,620
Die I really like that

1021
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,620
Because that could really soil a film for me

1022
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,620
Yeah like I don't have a dog

1023
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
Yeah right yeah

1024
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,620
For sure you know what I do

1025
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
Have what do you have a fresh

1026
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,620

All the time yeah how do I

1028
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,620
Do it a lot of people ask me what's my secret

1029

My favorite thing Justin oh I love this

Happens from time to time where I'll get some

1053
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,620
From Citrix and it's something I would not have

1054
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,620
Picked out in a store yeah but I put it

1055
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,620

Never would have known this is my thing

1058
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,620
But my stylist is like geared it towards

1059
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
Me and push that a little bit and

1060
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,620
I'm like yeah this is a new style that I love

1061
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,620
My wardrobe needs have changed and so I

1062
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,620
Drop back on my stitch fix

1063
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,620
To like a like quarterly

1064
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,620
Fix which works for me

1065
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,620
And my schedule but

1066
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Also like I find that I've learned how to dress

1067
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,620
Myself because of stitch fix

1068
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,620
And the many many many clothes they

1069
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Have sent my way getting an adult in the room

1070
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
To say hey hey is what you should

1071
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
Do yeah and that's also

1072
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
Nice to have an adult here to teach you how

1073
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Like the buttons work because

1074
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
I can't figure out is this a hook and eye

1075
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
Situation what are we doing

1076
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,620
Yeah and my stylist walks me through

1077
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,620
Dressing myself and it's very lovely

1078
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,620
When you reach for something that you think will look

1079
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,620
Good on you but nobody else does

1080
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
Stitch fix is at the store when you don't have any help

1081
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Stitch fix is like the hand that reaches out

1082
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,620
And smacks your hand and says no that's not

1083
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,620
For you this isn't that's not yours

1084
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,620
And it's the only rough

1085
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
Part was when stitch fix kicked in the door to my house

1086
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,620
And took away all my cargo

1087
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,620
Shorts and graphic tees with Stewie Griffin

1088
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,620
On them and you said

1089
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
Stuff in those in those cargo shorts

1090
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,620
And in the Stewie t-shirts

1091
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
Because they have pockets and I kept

All my beyblades in those and

1093
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
In the Stewie Griffin t-shirts

Just kidding

1115
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,620

Our comedy podcast Jordan Jesse Go

00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,620
15th anniversary

1132
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
It was a couple months ago but we forgot

1133
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
Uh yeah completely. Our

1134
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
Silly show is 15

1135
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
Years old. That makes it old enough to

1136
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,620
Get its learners permanent. And

1137
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,620
Almost old enough to get the talk

1138
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,620
Wow I hope you got the talk before then

1139
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,620
A lot of things have changed in 15

1140
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,620
Years. Our show's not one of them

1141
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,620
We're never changing and

1142
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,620
You can't make us

1143
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,620

1158
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
I don't wanna do a story

1159
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,620
About this but the McRib is guys on its

1160
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,620
Farewell tour. No

00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,620
Yeah it's back for one brief

1162
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,620
Moment and

1163
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
And I'm like why now

1164
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,620
You know what I mean like why now and are you

1165
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,620
Really gonna get rid of it

1166
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
Right now and then I

1167
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,620
Do you guys ever wonder where it goes when it's not here

1168
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,620
I think about that all the time

1169
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,620
Back to pigs

1170
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,620
The pigs get them

1171
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,620
Pigs get to keep them

1172
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Keep your ribs

1173
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,620
We don't need them

1174
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
These are yours no

1175
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Oh no the clown is here for our ribs

1176
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,620

1177
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,620

00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,620
Keep your ribs today

1179
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,620
So I just wanted to tell you guys real quick

1180
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,620
What's happening out in the world

1181
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Firehouse has released the prime

1182
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,620
Rib steak sub

1183
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,620
That's where they go

1184
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,620
The five star flavor

1185
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,620
This five star flavor comes from

1186
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,620
Being seared and then cooked to perfection

1187
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,620
Via sous vide

1188
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,620
I know they use

1189
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,620
Wait isn't this a fast casual

1190
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,620
Restaurant yes they

1191
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,620
Sous vide them and then let it sit

1192
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,620
Just kick it here for four hours

1193
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,620
While we bake your sandwich

1194
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,620
I'm sure they started before the customer gets there

1195
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,620
Griffin I don't think it's sous vide to order

1196
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,620
Yeah it's fair

1197
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,620
Now why sous vide

1198
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,620
Well let's check in with Berthelon

1199
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,620
A Michelin star trained

1200
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,620
Chef and a matre

1201
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,620
Cousineur de France

1202
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,620
Who's been a pioneer in sous vide since

1203
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,620
1989 Chef

1204
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,620
Gerard

1205
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,620
Hello is this Chef Gerard

1206
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,620
Berthelon

1207
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,620
It's Firehouse Subs

1208
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,620
You want to cook up a lot of these sloppy boys

1209
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,620
Or what

1210
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,620
Absolutely

1211
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,620
He says water is the best medium

1212
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,620
To transfer heat because of how precise

1213
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,620
It allows you to be

1214
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,620
By searing Firehouse Subs prime rib to capture

1215
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,620
Flavor and then cooking it for 12 hours

1216
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,620
Sous vide

1217
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,620
Guests receive an incredibly tender and flavorful piece of

1218
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,620
Beef just as good as they would get in any

1219
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,620
Steakhouse in the world

1220
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,620
Berthelon drunk on his own

1221
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,620
Now I also

1222
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,620
Say Firehouse Subs I don't know how much

1223
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,620
You paid this man to say this I could have told

1224
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,620
You the same thing for like 50 bucks

1225
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,620
I would have done it I've been sous vide eating

1226
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,620
For like six years now I could have told you the same

1227
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,620
It's good the water keeps it up real good

1228
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,620
Yeah it's pretty good

1229
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,620
I don't know I've been in the back

1230
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,620
Room of plenty of fast casual restaurants

1231
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,620
Enough to know that it's going to be

1232
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,620
Sort of a spooky thing to have back

1233
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,620
There it's going to just have like this

1234
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,620
Specimen floating in a fucking

1235
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,620
Bacta tank just like

1236
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,620
Waiting for you to just sear it

1237
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,620
And slice it up I think

1238
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,620
That that would give a sort of but it's Halloween

1239
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,620
It's Halloween

1240
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,620
Now see I thought you were going to say a spooky thing

1241
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,620
Because basically you just have a

1242
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,620
Vat of scalding hot liquid

1243
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,620
Sitting around for people

1244
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,620
Who are maybe at best phoning it

1245
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,620
In yeah I mean they're probably keeping that bad boy

1246
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,620
Like what 129, 130

1247
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,620
Still I wouldn't want that on my

1248
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,620
It wouldn't feel good but it's not scalding

1249
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,620
So that was

1250
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,620
The story that I noticed like

1251
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,620
Because I was thinking a lot about

1252
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,620
Like meat

1253
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,620
Yeah

1254
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,620
So I noticed that one that steak and cheese

1255
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,620
Sandwich that they

1256
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,620
Are doing the prime rib steak sub

1257
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,620
And then I noticed this is always

1258
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,620
In the same week Roy Roger

1259
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,620
Says they're bringing back the steak and cheese

1260
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,620
Sandwich Oh wow

1261
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,620
Steak and cheese

1262
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,620
Features thin slices of beef steak with American

1263
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,620
Cheese and grilled onions on a delicious six inch

1264
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,620
Roll Yeah Roy Rogers

00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,620

00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,620
Festive season has been rung in by the

1274
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,620
Steak and cheese sandwich for Roy Rogers

1275
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
Quote the steak and cheese is always

1276
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,620
A fan favorite we're happy to bring it back

1277
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,620
For our royalists you know

1278
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,620
Customer that's the senior director

1279
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,620
That feels like that's something else that feels like

1280
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,620
That word means something else

1281
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,620
That's what it means it's people that love Roy Rogers

1282
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,620
We know customers will love the addition

1283
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,620
Of our new mozzarella sticks and marinara dipping sauce

1284
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,620
As well they pair great as a side or

1285
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,620
As a snack on the go

1286
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,620
I got a lot of errands to run

1287
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,620
Today give me some

1288
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,620
If you're a fast casual restaurant

1289
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,620
And you announce something that has existed

1290
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,620
For 500 years I think

1291
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,620
It should just be I think the

1292
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,620
Press statement should just be like

1293
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,620
One to two sentences hey

1294
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Guys it's us Roy Rogers we

1295
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,620
Do mozzarella sticks now

1296
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,620
You probably thought we already did come have

1297
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,620
Them yeah we get that it seems like something

1298
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,620
We would have done before now I like the

1299
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,620
They just casually threw in there

1300
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,620
A scenario they would imagine like

1301
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,620
I have one last present tucked behind

1302
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,620
The tree let's see what it is

1303
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,620

And reminds us of home

Limited time offerings do just that and are

1312
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,620
Delicious additions to the menu

For this holiday season

1318
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,620
Okay so we really are and then

1319
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,620
Then I just

1320
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,620
Drive on over by Quizno's

1321
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,620
Press release outlet no way

1322
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,620
Quizno's prime rib sub makes

1323
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,620
Their long awaited return

1324
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,620
Announced the same week as these

1325
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,620
Other stories

1326
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,620
Is it okay is this all connected

1327
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,620
To the McRib retirement this is what I don't

1328
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,620
I can't figure out

1329
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,620
They are searching this is guys

1330
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,620
This is house of the dragon haven't seen it

1331
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,620
But I think this is what it is where they're searching

1332
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,620
They're vying

1333
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,620
Politicking to discover the heir apparent

1334
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,620
To the McRib kingdom

1335
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,620
And this is thrilling

1336
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,620
For me this is super exciting

1337
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,620
Three years after its last appearance

1338
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,620
The popular prime rib subs are back

1339
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,620
For guests to indulge

1340
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,620
In the comforting and satisfying flavors

1341
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,620
Of slow roasted prime rib

1342
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,620
As the holiday season draws near

1343
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,620
Are you shitting me

1344
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,620
Are both of you all trying to be like the perfect

1345
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,620
Holiday food

1346
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,620
A messy cheese steak sandwich

1347
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,620
Okay so this I looked it up right because

1348
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,620
It stuck in my mind

1349
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,620
Prime rib is like a

1350
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,620
Thing that for like

1351
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,620
Many is like a traditional

1352
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,620
Christmas dinner thing right

1353
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,620
But this isn't that

1354
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,620
This is a steak hoagie

1355
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,620
It's not that

1356
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,620
It may be bursting with

1357
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,620
With flavor and dry rub with

1358
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,620
Black pepper garlic and salt

1359
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,620
Don't brag about putting salt

1360
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,620
On it

1361
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,620
Three of the most basic

1362
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,620
Things you can put on something

1363
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,620
Salt pepper and garlic

1364
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,620
Listing salt is an admission that you didn't put

1365
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,620
Any other flavors on it

1366
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,620
You would have said anything other than salt

1367
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,620
And get this we cooked it

1368
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,620
Like how cool man

1369
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,620
It's got a creamy horseradish sauce

1370
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,620
The prime Italian is made with slow roasted prime rib

1371
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,620
Provolone cheese

1372
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,620
Sauteed onions

1373
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,620
The

1374
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,620
Giardiniera

1375
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,620
It's the pepper

1376
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,620
It's like the

1377
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,620
Green peppers

1378
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,620
For many

1379
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,620
This is a quote that is in a different

1380
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,620
Press release than the last one

1381
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,620
For many

1382
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,620
The holiday season is an ideal time

1383
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,620
To cozy up with indulgent foods

1384
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,620
And get together with family

1385
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,620
Surrounding themselves with comfort and familiarity

1386
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,620
Says Mike Geisman

1387
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,620
Vice president of culinary innovation

1388
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,620
We invite our guests to experience

1389
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,620
Those same feelings

1390
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,620
At Quiznos

1391
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,620
Travis that's the next

1392
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,620
Experience those same feelings when they walk into a Quiznos

1393
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,620
If you experience the feeling of

1394
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,620
Being home when you walk into a Quiznos

1395
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,620
That's not good

1396
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,620
That's bad

1397
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,620
I feel comforted and surrounded by family

1398
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,620
At this Quiznos

1399
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,620
If you work at the Quiznos and it's like

1400
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,620
These are my people

1401
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,620
That's fine

1402
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,620
I would say even that's not great

1403
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,620
You should know it's a

1404
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,620
Found families are huge with us

1405
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,620
And maybe your family is at Quiznos

1406
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,620
That's fantastic

1407
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,620
I'm saying if you eat a sandwich and you're like

1408
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,620
I'm home

1409
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,620
That's probably less than great

1410
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,620
Especially as more and more Quiznos

1411
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,620
Across the country are closing

1412
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,620
And you're like

1413
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,620
Chasing your home from state

1414
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,620
Yeah my home

1415
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,620
My home in Huntington on 4th Avenue

1416
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,620
My home

1417
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,620
Is now a place where

1418
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,620
People go to drink wine

1419
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,620
And paint things

1420
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,620
That's in my house

1421
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,620
In your house and they didn't even ask you

1422
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,620
They are what is it paint and sip

1423
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,620
Maybe I don't know

1424
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,620
Yeah

1425
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,620
I guess

1426
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,620
It's true what they say

1427
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,620
That the supply chain is really

1428
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,620
Just dictating all this stuff

1429
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,620
It's clearly somebody backed up

1430
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,620
Too many

1431
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,620
We got a lot of rib

1432
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,620
We got a lot of beefs

1433
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,620
We got some thin slices of shit

1434
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,620
Tell them it's for Christmas

1435
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,620
Tell them it's a Christmas

1436
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,620
Delight

1437
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,620
My money's on Quiznos

1438
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,620
I think it would be fun if Roy Rogers won

1439
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,620
Like if Roy Rogers became

1440
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,620
The big one

1441
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,620
In the rib skirmishes

1442
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,620
Yeah

1443
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,620
The rib crisis

1444
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,620
Of 2022, 2023

1445
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,620
Because let's be honest

1446
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,620
We're not going to whip this thing in the next two months

1447
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,620
No, no, no

1448
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,620
Do you want another question?

1449
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,620
Yeah

1450
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,620
Hi brothers, I'm faced with a moral quandary

1451
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,620
You've come to the right place

1452
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,620
Our school is holding elections for student council

1453
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,620
The two of my friends are running

1454
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,620
I've already voted for them

1455
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,620
But this morning on the quad

1456
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,620
There was a guy who was campaigning by handing out mini gourds

1457
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,620
In a massive burlap sack

1458
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,620
To people who promised to vote for him

1459
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,620
The gourds are really cute and I want to have one

1460
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,620
Is it morally right

1461
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,620
To lie to this poor man

1462
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,620
Just for a free calabash squash?

1463
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,620
And that's from squash squanderer in New York

1464
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,620
Can I just say

1465
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,620
It feels like a long way to go

1466
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,620
To get a vote

1467
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,620
When you could just like buy a bag of like

1468
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,620
Mixed mini chocolate bars

1469
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,620
Especially now

1470
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,620
During a Halloween season

1471
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,620
I love candy

1472
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,620
Where are you getting so many gourds

1473
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,620
That you can hand them out as a favor

1474
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,620
It seems like a huge expense

1475
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,620
You know I'm in

1476
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,620
Politics country now

1477
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,620
Where it all happens

1478
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,620
Yeah

1479
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,620
And I will say that a lot

1480
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,620
Like a surprising amount of stuff

1481
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,620
Here

1482
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,620
Is like a lot of the political

1483
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,620
Processes are lubricated with like

1484
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,620
Fun sized Mr. Good bars

1485
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,620
Crackles

1486
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,620
Hershey's with almond

1487
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,620
That greases a lot of the wheels

1488
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,620
Cause they can't get enough of this stuff

1489
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,620
Well and the secret is

1490
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,620
You do a special dark and a good bar

1491
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,620
At the same time

1492
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,620
Oh fuck off that's too much

1493
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,620
This is a crime

1494
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,620
What this person is doing is a crime

1495
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,620
Oh right Justin

1496
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,620
Justin's been like Toby Zigglering around

1497
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,620
For a while now

1498
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,620
And he thinks he's Mr. Politics and Ethics

1499
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,620
If I can pay people for votes

1500
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,620
Yeah

1501
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,620
Okay listen if it was legal

1502
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,620
You can't do this it's a crime now that being said

1503
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,620
Hand out gourds

1504
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,620
You don't want to be mixed up

1505
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,620
In this endeavor you can't pay people

1506
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,620
For votes that said

1507
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,620
If they got Adela Khan over there

1508
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,620
Let me come by

1509
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,620
I can't get I don't have a trader

1510
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,620
Ricks a trader no

1511
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,620
That's the werewolves in London

1512
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,620
Trader Sam's nope

1513
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,620
You'll get there

1514
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,620
Trader Joe's I don't have a Trader Joe's around here

1515
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,620
I don't have a Jungle Jim's you know what I mean

1516
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,620
I gotta get my Delicata when people go out of town

1517
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,620
They're like can I get you a souvenir

1518
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,620
Bring you back some Delicata squash

1519
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,620
Dude you can eat the rind thank you

1520
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,620
But Justin I'm sorry

1521
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,620
Oh yeah constantly

1522
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,620
Constantly man at this point

1523
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,620
I'm more Delicata squash than I am man

1524
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,620
But here's the question Justin in your mind

1525
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,620
Paying someone a tiny decadent

1526
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,620
Seasonal Gourd is paying them for votes

1527
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,620
In what

1528
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,620
In what world can you use

1529
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,620
A tiny decorative Gourd as currency

1530
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,620
And please point me in the direction

1531
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,620
Of that world cause I'm a very rich man

1532
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,620
Pumpkin town

1533
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,620
Good point yeah I didn't think about that

1534
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,620
You can't you don't want to get

1535
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,620
Mixed up in this business this is dark stuff

1536
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,620
I'll say but it sounds like

1537
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,620
To me you have two friends

1538
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,620
Running for

1539
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,620
Student council competing

1540
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,620
It sounds like against each other

1541
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,620
They said they already voted for them

1542
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,620
Well fraud clearly

1543
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,620
They might be different positions

1544
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,620
Oh that's another good point

1545
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,620
Yeah maybe it's not fraud

1546
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,620
But regardless you can feign ignorance

1547
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,620
And be like sorry I thought you guys were competing

1548
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,620
Against each other and I could not choose

1549
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,620
And I got this cutie little Gourd

1550
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,620
This sweet little squash outside

1551
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,620
And I told the guy I'd vote for him

1552
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,620
Cause I couldn't pick between you two it's not fair

1553
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,620
So I voted third party

1554
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,620
For this one

1555
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,620
Cause here's the beautiful thing I don't know if you guys know this

1556
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,620
You can tell anybody you're voting for anything

1557
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,620
They can't check

1558
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,620
You can be like I'll definitely

1559
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,620
Vote for you and unless that guy loses

1560
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,620
By like one vote and then breaks

1561
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
Into like the student council offices

1562
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,620
Or whatever it goes through each

1563
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,620
Thing and it's like wait a minute it was Todd

1564
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,620
Todd took one of my gourds and they didn't vote for me

1565
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,620
I'm going to ruin Todd's life

1566
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,620
Maybe maybe that might happen

1567
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,620
In my new YA novel that I'm working

1568
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,620
On please don't copy this concept

1569
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,620
I've said it out loud everybody forget what I said

1570
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,620
Forget what I said this is mine

1571
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,620
I mean it is Kevin Costner's swing vote

1572
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,620
And that's fun that you reinvented

1573
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,620
That film this time for a reboot

1574
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,620
I'm calling mine Gourd to death

1575
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,620
Yeah thank you

1576
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,620
Get out of sploom house that was good stuff

1577
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,620
Speaking of like the

1578
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,620
Politics thing

1579
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,620
Did you all see

1580
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,620
That god

1581
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,620
I'm so delighted did you guys see the attack ad

1582
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,620
Hell yeah I did dude Griffin did you see it

1583
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,620
Oh yeah I saw the attack ad

1584
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,620
I got sent it

1585
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,620
They made a lot of good points

1586
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,620
They made a lot of good points

1587
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,620
I don't want to talk too much about it but I do want to say

1588
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,620
The front of it is just this

1589
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,620
Picture of gas prices with Joe Biden

1590
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,620
Like good gas prices

1591
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,620
And Sidney's like I love it

1592
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,620
I had no idea

1593
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,620
I've known Sidney now for decades

1594
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,620
I had no idea she had such influence over

1595
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,620
The national gas

1596
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,620
Prices no idea

1597
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,620
Here's what I wanted to

1598
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,620
Say though is that this mailer does

1599
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,620
Include the phrase

1600
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,620
That is on a political mailer

1601
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,620
In the world the Biden

1602
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,620
Slash McElroy agenda

1603
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,620
The Biden McElroy agenda

1604
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,620
That's really really

1605
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,620
Really strong

1606
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,620
That's not something we made up for this show

1607
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,620
That was like the Biden McElroy agenda

1608
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,620
Very very good

1609
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,620
The only way that that makes sense

1610
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,620
Is if it's like the Biden slash McElroy agenda

1611
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,620
And then underneath it in bullet points is

1612
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,620
Leaving a ticket at will call

1613
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,620
At every live show they've ever done

1614
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,620
In Washington DC for Joe Biden

1615
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,620
Hoping he'll show up

1616
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,620
That's the only McElroy slash Biden agenda

1617
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,620
I know of that exists

1618
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,620
On this planet

1619
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,620
Do you know how bad you have to

1620
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,620
Be at your job

1621
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,620
Because of who Sidney is

1622
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,620
Married to to not be

1623
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,620
Able to cook up a very very

1624
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,620
Very very very

1625
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,620
Very bad mailer

1626
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,620
The possibilities

1627
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,620
Are endless

1628
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,620
We love Sidney you love Sidney

1629
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,620
Everybody loves Sidney

1630
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,620
This clown

1631
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,620
This absolute degenerate

1632
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,620
You see this guy in the pumpkin suit

1633
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,620
Who said he just came from a wedding

1634
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,620
He's like right there with her

1635
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,620
You see this man in a chili suit

1636
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,620
In a pumpkin suit who's got chili

1637
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,620
All over his hands and face

1638
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,620
That's in the last week

1639
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,620
We're not even getting like

1640
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,620
Scrolling out of his Google calendar page

1641
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,620
To find these embarrassing things

1642
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,620
That's a choice Sidney made once

1643
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,620
A while ago it's been stuck with

1644
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,620
Every other choice has been great

1645
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,620
But she did this one time

1646
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,620
Choose this guy are you sure

1647
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,620
Are you sure

1648
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,620
There's gotta be something fundamentally funny

1649
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,620
Oh gosh politics is fun

1650
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,620
Thank you so much for listening to our

1699
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,620
With Brennan Lee Mulligan

1700
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,620
DMing Dad Lance 2

1701
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,620
Y'all I could not

1702
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,620
Be more excited for that fucking live show

1703
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,620
Come out to it

1704
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,620
If you live within driving distance

1705
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,620
Of this show I guarantee you

1706
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,620
It's going to be a gosh dang barn burner

1707
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,620
The last one was a hoot

1708
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,620
I did a thing with Roll20Con

1709
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,620
Playing with Brennan

1710
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,620
And a bunch of other folks including Abria

1711
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,620
And it was great but when I was there

1712
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,620
I was talking to Brennan about the show and I was like

1713
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,620
Yeah I'm thinking maybe new characters

1714
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,620
And the look on his face was like you guys aren't going to be the same characters

1715
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,620
But I love those characters

1716
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,620
I'm going to be the same characters

1717
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,620
I had forgotten that he remembered

1718
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,620
Until he said you're not going to be Guy Ferrari again

1719
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,620
I was like fuck that's good yeah I'll be Guy Ferrari

1720
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,620
It's going to be great

1721
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,620
Speaking of Abria we've rescheduled our shows

1722
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,620
For San Jose and Denver they've been postponed

1723
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,620
But now they will be April

1724
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,620

1725
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,620
Adventure Zone with Abria

1726
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,620
Who just a taste of that

1727
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,620
When we did Spirit Breakers for Halloween

1728
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,620
Abria is an absolute joy and brings out

1729
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,620
The best in us I would say

1730
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,620
April 28th we're going to do My Brother My Brother and Me

1731
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,620
In San Jose and then April 29th

1732
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,620
We're going to be doing My Brother My Brother and Me

1733
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,620
In Denver all existing tickets will be

1734
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,620
Honored for the new dates if you can't attend

1735
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,620
The rescheduled dates you can request a refund

1736
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,620
At the point of purchase and if you don't have tickets

1737
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,620
But want to go now that we have new dates

1738
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,620
Tickets are on sale now mask and proof

Pre-order the Taz 11th hour

Pre-order it now at The Adventure Zone

1749
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,620
Comic.com And I just

1750
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,620
Wanted to say one more thing about that Detroit Live

1751
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,620
Show that is going to be on

1752
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,620
November 11th which as

1753
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,620
You all know is the 14th anniversary

1754
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,620
Of the release of Star Wars the Clone Wars

1755
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,620
Lightsaber now on the Wii

1756
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,620
Yeah I feel like

1757
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,620
A themed Star Wars

1758
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,620
Episode only makes sense to celebrate

1759
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,620
That release and we can

1760
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,620
Say that because they pay us no matter if

1761
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,620
People come or not like we obviously prefer

1762
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,620
If people come but if nobody

1763
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,620
Shows up then we can kind of like

1764
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,620
Griffin's right but only

1765
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,620
In this very limited scope where like

1766
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,620
That trick works once

1767
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,620
And then they don't do any more

1768
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,620
After that so please do come. We will not be doing

1769
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,620
I guarantee you we won't be doing a Star Wars show

1770
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,620
I won't mention Star Wars up there

1771
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,620
But it'll be in Justin's mind you would feel

1772
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,620
It you'll feel it he'll be in full cosplay

1773
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,620
Hey yeah thanks what if

1774
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,620
Holy shit what if we were in full cosplay

1775
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,620
But did not mention it. Okay

1776
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,620
That's fine. Anyway thanks to Montaigne

1777
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,620

1778
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,620

But especially Montaigne's art cause it's

1783
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,620
Very good. That's it

1784
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,620
That's it for the show

1785
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,620
Thank you so much for listening

1786
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:58,620
Griffin can you inspire us

1787
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,620
For like any quotes that you want to

1788
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,620
Like

1789
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,620
You're looking very thoughtful. Don't give up

1790
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,620
Unless

1791
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,620
Don't give up unless

1792
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,620
No

1793
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,620
Keep on pushing

1794
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,620
What's the thing that the guy

1795
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,620
That one of the presidents said where he's like if you're going through

1796
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,620
Hell don't stop

1797
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,620
If you're going through hell don't stop

1798
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,620
Can't be it

1799
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,620
I think it was

1800
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,620
I think it was Benjamin Franklin

1801
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,620
Who said if you're going through hell don't stop

1802
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,620
My name is Justin McElroy

1803
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,620
I'm Travis McElroy

1804
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,620
I'm Griffin McElroy

1805
01:05:38,620 --> 01:06:06,620
I'm Travis McElroy

1806
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,620
What's

1807
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:38,620
What's the thing
