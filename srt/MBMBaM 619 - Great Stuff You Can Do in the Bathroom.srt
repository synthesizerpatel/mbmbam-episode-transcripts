1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,260
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,380
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin

9
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:24,180
McElroy, I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy, and I'm the sweet baby brother Griffin Andrew McElroy

10
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,100
Let me just get ahead of it. Let me get ahead of it. I watched the first episode

11
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,380
First episode

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:39,540
It was harrowing is the word I would use I was made certain assurances that we would not need to talk about man

13
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:39,860
No

14
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:47,640
But I also don't want people now what I've run into because of the blast on which I was put that yeah in

15
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,260
in my life

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,700
Social media in streaming and everything I've done if I mentioned in your bedroom in my bedroom

17
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,900
My wife my children my dog your professional when I'm talking to my priest

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,760
My spiritual guidance my yogi when I'm talking to my yogi bear when I'm talking to them

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,140
You gotta watch the movie boo-boo and I say I've done I did this today

20
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:18,220
They're like you should have been watching Man vs. B. And I'm like, okay, I did it now. I did it now never again

21
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
So here's the issue Travis you're getting

22
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,860
Man vs. B 1.1

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,100
There were a lot of complaints registered toward Netflix with some of the gratuitous

24
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,700
male and B nudity

25
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,960
Yeah in the original cut and so as they are want to do

26
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,260
What with this streaming era and the death of art they went in and just took all that stuff out

27
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,420
So, you know how the episodes are like 20 minutes long

28
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,140
Yeah

29
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,900
They used to be like 35 40 and you were getting a good 15 to 20 minutes of man and be nudity

30
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,580
well, I actually anticipated that because I know of

31
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,020
Netflix's rampant censorship and you know, I actually watched it in 90-second chunks on daily motion

32
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:13,540
Yeah, I found a playlist and I just watched it that way now there were a couple chunks missing which frankly made it incoherent

33
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,860
But other than that, obviously I dipped into daily motion for those clips for my own

34
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,180
Purposes. Yeah, and my net nanny was like, yeah, well you can we'll let this one go

35
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,260
They're like, it's they were like, it's mr. Bean like there's no erotic

36
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,780
Value it auto blurt out the bees

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Huge ding along. Yeah

38
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,500
Which is understandable, but they were like, it's mr. Bean's dick and his balls in butthole

39
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,140
It's educational and it's edge. It serves an educational

40
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,580
Yes at that now see that's what I actually noticed Griffin that my net nanny was a little too lenient as well

41
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,180
Which is why I hired a real-life nanny to stand over my shoulder while I looked at stuff

42
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,500
Specifically man versus being I got a Mary Poppins ask like no. No, no, mr. Bean's dick today master Travis

43
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,460
Watching it too much apparently and it was affecting my relationship with my kids

44
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,420
Yeah, she said you must go outside and get some vitamin D and I said I get all the vitamin D

45
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,420
I

46
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,340
Just want them to release the Snyder cut of man versus I

47
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,100
mean

48
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:33,380
Greg Snyder who was the on-set intimacy consultant for being the man in the be any time that there was

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:42,140
Exposure happening like the scene where the bee climbs inside of his his mr. Bean's penis. Yeah

50
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,040
Um, I want to see he worked hard on that like, yeah

51
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,540
both of them through that and it was probably pretty painful and

52
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,260
Humiliating and it's wild to me that they made such a progressive step to hire an intimacy coordinator

53
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,060
Which everyone should do but then also the rest of it exists. And so that was that was difficult to me

54
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
I watched the Snyder cut of

55
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,780
Of Justice League, okay. My big thing there was fucking funny

56
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,660
Yeah, raise your asses everyone. There is just so many scenes of people eating chips that it got

57
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,660
Snyder's is a chip brand which I think might only manufacture chips in

58
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,600
They use peanut oil nice

59
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,980
Enough said

60
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,060
Said they're

61
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,700
Appreciate that. Um, this is an advice show

62
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
obviously where we

63
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,460
Take your questions and turn them alchemy like into wisdom. I feel like it's been a

64
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,820
150 years since we've recorded one of these. Well, we should also note that Griffin Griffin decided to move

65
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
Yeah

66
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,980
Like yesterday just real hair up my ass sort of stuff where I was like, I'm gonna uproot my entire family and

67
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,420
relocate to the to the beast. Well, most of your family you're having them

68
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,180
Compete to see right he left behind it to make a new life in Austin

69
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,900
You don't want to see it all that territory is you know

70
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,260
So you you want to leave a man in Kamchatka as it were it is kind of our southern

71
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,520
HQ Griffin, which I am I I feel like I covered the Midwest HQ for a while. Yeah

72
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,440
um and and now I feel like you're kind of encroaching a bit on my territory, which I'm not wild about I

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,680
Appreciate that we can finally make it permanent our

74
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,700
Absolute denial of other time zones. Yes. Yeah, if you don't know about this this little fact of ours

75
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,800
We have people on on our our team all throughout the country

76
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,560
And if any of them mention any time zones other than Eastern Standard Time, we refuse to acknowledge like we can't process it

77
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,960
Yeah

78
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,280
I asked me again in the in a real time zone because if you talk about another one and we've been doing this with Griffin

79
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,400
Yeah, Griffin has had to pretend that he does not live outside the Eastern Time Zone

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,820
Occasionally, I'll be like, oh we can start at 11 and I'm like, it's already 11 already 11. What are you talking about?

81
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,540
Uh, yeah, we're like flat earthers, but for like a very specific sort of latitude range

82
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,900
Yeah, and I'm just saying like daylight savings time who's saving it and give me some back. You know what I mean?

83
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,980
I want some of that some of Travis's whole deal. That's my thing about let's do let's do questions

84
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,980
It's gonna be a while before I do questions again, and I mean we are about to do like three live shows in a row

85
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,020
But that's how you're right. We're about to be doing too many questions, but still my hunger must be sated

86
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,500
Yeah, whenever I go to someone else's house, even my best friends. I hate staying the night. Yeah. Yeah

87
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,380
Yeah, it's not yeah, your stuff's not there. Yeah, your stuff's not there. It's not where your bed is

88
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,780
That's not the air you like. I am not able to sleep always in a cold sweat and wake up feeling gross

89
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,380
I'm happy to be with my friends. So what can I do enjoy waking up within the next morning?

90
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,060
That's from anxiously awake in Alabama

91
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,660
You can't you can go home and then come back before they wake up and then you're like whoa right there

92
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,980
Oh, I was here the whole time to you guys that there's that

93
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,380
sleepover the the sort of like logistics of sleepovers that math changes once you are sort of

94
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,460
Independent and can drive because I would much rather I'll kick it with you until the wee hours

95
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,360
And then when it's time for sleeping in a bed, I have my own that I have been sort of

96
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
nestling into

97
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,400
Fucking hard for a long time now

98
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,080
And that is no curious. What about the dangers of driving in the evening? Oh, what time do you go to bed?

99
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Just think cuz I'm heading home at like nine o'clock

100
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Yeah, the wee hours so I was I meant nine to nine thirty

101
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,240
That's when I come home and me and Rachel play we together

102
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,040
We play we play competitive very competitive boom blocks till we work up a nice sweat and then we instantly go to sleep

103
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
the

104
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,480
amount of props I need to sleep when I travel is

105
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,280
Truly, I mean it's truly toddler level. It's like we need I need I need the log pillow. I need my wrist

106
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,600
brace for my carpal tunnel syndrome, I need my

107
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,160
special

108
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:36,480
Eyemask that has the headphones built into it. So I whoa, whoa everyone back off. He's married. No, no, no, no. No, right. I

109
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Can't believe that the fact that there is no

110
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,840
sort of like well-known my bim bam mythos about your log pillow, which is a

111
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
What a bean filled?

112
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,040
Micra what do you call that micro fill like a it's like a beanbag being filled with Justin's for him and then

113
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,680
he carries it like but like draped over a

114
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,520
Usually a strap of his backpack turning it into the brawniest

115
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,840
Nutsack that you have ever seen and he walks through the air every airport like that

116
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,200
And there's kids around and they then they seen it. Yeah, I mean, yeah

117
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
What do you want me to say here?

118
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,600
Um, you introduced this topic by the way, we didn't make you bring up the log pillow you brought a bill

119
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,640
Yeah, I mean I have probs. I'm just saying I have props and if I don't have my can't sleep

120
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,040
I've tried other things I've in in hotel rooms. I've gotten desperate and wadded up towels into kind of a long shape

121
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,600
We've all been there. We've all been there wadded up a hoodie, you know to try to make it no

122
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,160
It's not just bedroom prop when I'm away from my favorite toilet

123
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,960
My toilet buddy that I know like I know yeah, I know how he works

124
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,520
I know I know where I know where I like to look for the tough moments

125
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,920
You know what?

126
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,360
I mean, like I know the point on the wall that I'm making eye contact with but I'm struggling like I know

127
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,200
You know where you've etched your Vince Lombardi quotes

128
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,640
I was getting tough. I know exactly and I know where the tally marks are for every successful completion

129
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,240
You know what I mean? Yeah, by the way, I was at your house the other day and there's only six

130
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah, man. Why do you think I need so many motivational quotes?

131
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,120
It's tough out there. I don't eat fiber. Yeah

132
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I just eat cheese

133
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,680
Yeah, get a good night's sleep with someone else's house

134
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,400
There is a certain point of like there's a reason why I think maybe oh I have a rectangle pillow. Yes

135
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Well, yeah, yeah cube. Oh

136
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,520
Wait, what? Yeah, it's a pillow cube and I can't sleep without that either. It's a cube shaped pillow. Where does it go?

137
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,020
Where does the cube go?

138
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,320
Well

139
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,440
Supporting this beautiful thinker right here. Okay, right underneath the old knock. Yeah, let's go

140
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
I yeah, I've searched high and low. Do you know how many pillows?

141
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,280
I've I've had to shove down on my garbage disposal because they didn't give my head the support it crave

142
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,760
Like as a punishment what like as a punishment for them disappointing. I mean, it's a sack. It's a sacrifice

143
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Oh, I see. Yeah, I see but I think that I can't remember the last time

144
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,400
Like I think 24 was maybe the last time I slept at a friend's house

145
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,400
Because I was too drunk to drive so I simply slept on his couch

146
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,380
But it was not like a planned thing where I looked at my friend Bradbury and said and I'll bring my jammies

147
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,780
Like I just don't and I think the reason is not like oh, it's weird to sleep at a friend's house when you get older

148
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,140
It's like oh no, this isn't like fun to get away from my parents and my house. This is like, oh no

149
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:57,740
Everything I know is back there. That's where I'm truly me and I can take off this mask that I wear for others

150
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,620
Hey, can we approach the wizard? Yeah. Yeah. I like that. Thank you. The other

151
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,180
Was close. He's bitey the other wizard Ben can't sent this in. Thank you, Ben. Um, this is a this is one

152
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,060
That's again very useful

153

159
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,180
It's not

160
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,860
It is as old as time itself. What's up?

161
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,660
You might was up you might have heard it thrown around so often that it's hard to come up with a fresh and creative answer

162
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Yes in 1999

163
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,420
Uh, don't worry though. We've got you covered with tons of examples that show how to have some fun with this common question

164
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,200
Read on and try them out to respond to wassup in a way that will breathe new life into your conversation

165
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,980
Hey, have you talked to mark lately? Yeah, it's good. It's good to talk to him now. It feels

166
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,100
Revitalizing yeah, just the way that his mind works. It really excites me

167
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:28,160
Well his responses to my mundane inane questions are a breath of fresh air and this otherwise empty landscape on which I live

168
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,500
So here's one way to respond to wassup of 13 after seeing you my mood

169
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,160
Anyone?

170
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,540
Compliment anyone who could use an extra boost of confidence

171
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,940
This is a great reply for everyone in your life from a friend to acquaintance

172
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,220
It's an especially effective answer if the person is shy or isn't used to the attention

173
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,820
Fuck here's some more examples in this vein now that you're talking to me my happiness now

174
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,260
It's that's weirder though because now that's starting to trend into the way an alien would say it

175
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,340
After this conversation that we had with our mouths

176
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,420
My endorphins like oh no. No, hold on

177
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,480
With you in the room my energy level after after learning you went to Spain my curiosity

178
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,400
Is up another way

179
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,120
Someone hits you with a wassup you hit him with a I don't have any complaints

180
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,640
Stay upbeat if you want to charm a stranger with your optimism

181
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,960
If you want to build rapport with someone or leave them in a with a wonderful first impression be really cheerful and smile other options

182
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:40,840
I'm a happy camper life's been treating me really well. That's a serious darkness. There's a darkness behind those no complaints here

183
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,200
I mean everything's looking up. I've made a lot of progress lately with what?

184
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,240
Mm-hmm. Hey, I think we live in a time a current

185
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,120
I won't go deep into it folks, but if you have no complaints, that's no complaints

186
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:04,080
If you can say nothing but good news on my end. I'm very grateful. All right, asshole. Yeah should be there is

187
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,440
Objectively bad news out there and you saying that it doesn't impact you at all is is is

188
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,640
Monstrous, and I hey listen, there's enough bad news to go around. It doesn't matter what side of any issue you're on

189
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,080
Nobody's got it all good right now. How about this wassup?

190
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,120
Hopefully not my rent get creative at a party and point out what you don't want to go up

191
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,600
Hopefully not my dick while people are around that would be inappropriate

192
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,440
Not the time for that. It better not be my cholesterol levels. I've been eating healthy dot-dot-dot not my student loans

193
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,520
I just have to keep making my payments with any luck not my grocery bill. I'm not buying name-brands anymore

194
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
I would turn heel and walk

195
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,920
Out of there would be gone from my yeah awareness

196
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,560
In a perfect world my salary make your bestie laugh with a sassy response

197
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,960
That's that is sassy. Yeah, I say that's sassy

198
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,320
Okay, you know what actually on that one if I walked up to my best friend Hank Mardukas and I said what's up?

199
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,240
And he said hopefully my salary I would high-five him three times for sure

200
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,160
That's sassy and fun solid response. And this is the obligatory. What's up? If life was fair my grades

201
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
My energy grades up. Yeah

202
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,600
My energy levels if I had my way a lot of concern about my energy about my fate on now

203
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,280
I want to go back though because I like if life was fair

204
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,000
my grace because that one means is like I'm putting in the fucking work and

205
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,960
Mr. Fucking Johnson is being a real asshole cuz I did that assignment

206
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,360
He knows I did and yet he's still giving me a see life's not fair me. My atheist teacher gave me an F

207
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,600
It's because I love our troops so much

208
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,320
How

209
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,800
Much what's up? How much time do you have do this one? No, don't do that one

210
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,680
Can you sticker it does say play around with anyone easy to fool like an unsuspecting relative. So it's like

211
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,920
Punk them by hinting at some deep

212
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,560
Trouble in your life that you do need assistance with can you stick around for a bit?

213
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,520
I'll need at least 20 minutes. How long is your attention span? I'm in the mood to overshare. Okay

214
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,600
Let me tell you my life story. Just joking Wow. Hey any one of those

215
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,760
I actually would appreciate it because it would be shorthand for like, oh, okay. I don't want to know you

216
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,040
I don't want to talk to you. I'm gonna overshare. Oh, thank you for the warning. I'll be over here at the Cheeto Bowl

217
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,240
I love it. Some of you know like I've asked you not to be like this

218
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,520
Yeah, we we incur we encounter each other in social situations. I've asked you not to be like this

219
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,320
I think it's also not oversharing. I asked you how you are and I it's I guess it depends on if you're like

220
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
What's up, man? And he's like

221
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,720
Or if you're just like hey, what's up with you? And he's like I want to overshare. I'm like, yeah, I I did just ask

222
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,680
Like I would up with you. I would take literally any response

223
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Other than this one number six on the list. What's up our time on earth? So let's make the most of it. What?

224
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,760
Oh, no, shake things up and motivate whoever is talking to you if they're on autopilot and asking a basic question

225
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,720
See if you can inspire them and tell them to live every moment. Like it's their last don't what's up?

226
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,320
Our chances to waste another moment. Let's go

227
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,640
Now that one though is confusing verbiage. What's up? Our chances to wait. Sorry

228
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,920
Run out of chances. Some of us are out here barely coping with existential dread as it is

229
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,620
Well, yeah, I see you at a party and I say what's up and you're like art

230
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm in a spiral now. Thank you actually true either. It's like we're both here like what are you talking about?

231
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,560
What do you know that what do you know Matt Damon in that?

232
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,560
Kevin Smith movie and you're like your time is up on earth. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah

233
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,120
Matt Damon gets a gun out. It's like fuck. Do you guys remember the Bitcoin commercial where he was like?

234
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,000
Get bitcoins and he pulled out two guns and I was like, whoa, I was like, are you gonna hurt me?

235
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,840
And he was like, no, you can just look cool. Like me Jason Bourne. These are my new bitcoins. They're guns

236
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,240
I need to test them the real quick. You guys gotta let me know if this works. Okay. Okay, can you let me know?

237
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
This works. Yeah

238
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,840
Yeah, I remember him yeah, I like I liked him from

239
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:34,160
Yeah, you have to comment on it in order for it to be fair you

240
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,560
Hold on wait Travis. You can't talk over that. What was it? Go ahead juice. You'll get a taco bear. Oh, yeah

241
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,520
What sound what are you on? Is it just like classic?

242
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,940
Okay, yeah, these are some of the most sort of like low quality

243
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,820
Little bit right. Do you have the Dell guy? He's funny. What do you have the Dell guy? It's got to be in there

244
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Now that's Intel Intel. Yeah, that's not it. Okay, so there's a lot more of these what's up? Who paid you to ask me?

245
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,780
Feel like you're not dialed anymore

246
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,340
I'm back. I'm back. I'm back pretend to be suspicious to put on a show for your friends have the secret agents found me

247
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,380
What have you told them? Hey, that's not cool of you to ask

248
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,460
You know, I'm on the run. I'm not sure how to answer that. Do you have a wire on you? Oh my that's a good one

249
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,420
If someone asked me in a party what's up and I say why are you asking are you wearing a wire?

250
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,620
That is a good way to like kid on the square to gauge of your friends an arc. Yeah

251
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,860
As somebody who has trouble with social situations

252
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,060
Yeah, especially like these sort of conversational things

253
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:50,000
I think it should be illegal for the internet to publish a list of memorizable responses

254
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,660
Yeah to

255
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,180
Banal questions because that's not that's not right

256
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,580
Like I know I know that is memorizing answers that are supposed to be witty. That's not good

257
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
You don't want to do that

258
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,580
This list should be one thing long and it should be not much you not much that is okay

259
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,980
I'll go ahead and spoil number 13 is not much you which is I think the only acceptable way

260
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:21,860
That's the only one it should be. How's your day? Great you what's up? Not much you. Hey, how's your weekend?

261
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,740
Pretty good. It should like three words max should be your response to a thing. I I don't want a monologue

262
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:36,900
I'm a human being who's bad at small talk and I had to say something because we locked eyes and we're sharing a physical space

263
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,300
Right. So I said hey, what's up? That's you know

264
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:46,500
Sorry, the conceit of this bit is that it's not that rarely the things that the wizard sends us are good

265
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:54,900
Yes, but now it's a thing where I'm imagining myself actually being in my physical meat body and someone saying one of these things

266
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,860
To me and having to like roll out of the room as quickly as possible

267
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,100
Maybe you can maybe this will be better for you guys not me because like I'm a

268
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,180
Good like cool confident popular. Yeah. Yeah guys, but like if someone says what's up

269
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,920
You could say when you ask that question my anxiety levels. Yeah. Oh, that's okay. Can I say?

270
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,020
There is a delivery you can put on that or it would work. I think that one that one I could

271
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,120
Yeah, that could work. Yeah, don't now that you have asked me such a banal question. My anxiety currently

272
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:37,340
Is up now and then if you really want it, I don't know that these three they escalate it with each additional one under this suggestion

273
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,240
With my blood pressure. What a loaded question moving on

274
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
No, not at all yikes

275
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,160
Yikes my discomfort. That's way too hard to answer. What's up? Oh, I didn't expect the test

276
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,580
Oh, okay. What if someone said what's up? And you just look like yikes

277
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,160
Whoa, that would be a good way of answer

278
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,680
Much when I go shopping and I'm buying a bunch of groceries and the checkout person says oh playing on a fun weekend

279
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,640
Cuz maybe there's like two bottles of wine in there. I think a good response now is like well not now

280
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,800
Now I'm gonna be thinking about this moment for the rest of the weekend because I'm worried about too many

281
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,300
I don't know hot dogs wrapped in pastry or whatever

282
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:27,400
No, you ever analyze whenever you buy like like I get my I get my my looker at CVS

283
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,080
Yeah, and like a glassy jet. Yeah, I end up a lot of times getting like

284
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,720
liquor and toilet paper or liquor and

285
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,040
Hemorrhoid cream it's like yeah, these two it is gonna be a pretty wild weekend

286
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,000
It's gonna get pretty silly, but then I'm gonna bring it down and think about motivational quotes from Vince Lombardi

287
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,040
I got this Gatorade. I'll play it out cuz I your boys bad with with moderation. Yeah, where do you keep the PD light too?

288
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,200
Bad with moderation good with preparation, so I went ahead and got me some

289
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,520
Preparation age some raw. Hey, can I get sexy real quick? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks

290
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:13,520
What's up? My hopes because you swiped right on me. Oh, no right the good one or which one is the good one?

291
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
I will never know with enough confidence

292
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,280
Yeah, you could also if you want to keep being really flirty and spark up a romance with a new crush

293
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:27,320
You can say my heart rate now that you're giving me the time of day my level of attraction your IG hypnotized me

294
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
What's up? What's up? Imagine?

295
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,840
Imagine I can't traction is up

296
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
See my lady

297
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,640
Humans I want to say that my attraction is up to you

298
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,020
I'm definitely not a lizard that has gained access to a keyboard

299
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,560
What's up? My pulse your pics and your bio are so spellbinding

300
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:01,800
These are texts these are text mess. We're texting now. We're yeah, we're texting now. We've been texting and then there's some asshole

301
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,080
Responses the next two subjects are all asshole

302
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:12,280
Um, what's up? The opposite of down nice a two-letter preposition. You're welcome for the grammar lesson. Not that

303
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,720
Honestly go just fall in a well, what's up a super cute movie that made me cry check it out

304
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
Thank you that that would be good. I don't know that I would respond

305
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,880
I don't I don't think I would call up a cute movie. What's up? Come on, you know that the sky

306
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,520
Um, what are you getting part birds planes and on a good day UFOs?

307
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,400
Is that a good day when they finally do?

308
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,800
Get tired of tolerating us and they come and they zap

309
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,980
You know, they zap us into dust with their big tripod ships probably I think you could do

310
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,840
There could be a sincere delivery of come on, you know this you can do this. You got this. I believe in you

311
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
What's up

312
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
I'm not gonna do the rest. But the last one is

313
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
Not much

314
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,560
nothing not much just that's the only correct answer to that question because it's

315
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
All they're looking for if they really wanted some detail about how you found their picks and bio spellbinding

316
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,100
They would have said like what what do you think? What is it about me that spellbinding? Yeah

317
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
exactly

318
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,320
Just a keen play the beer joke again

319
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,560
what

320
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,040
What the joke the beers the beer the beer joke from the commercial? Oh

321
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,560
It's too late now. No all the moment is past

322
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Yeah, well dad

323
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
You're my dad

324
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
And I love you man

325
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
That one that one

326
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,560
Wow, what was that? I love I love you, man. That was not as big of a hit back in the day

327
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,120
I'm out a little bit. I'm out in the boneyard a little yeah, I went to the bathroom

328
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:04,720
At a local grocery store and I was about to leave my stall and someone came in crying and started to give themselves a pep

329
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,760
Talk in the mirror. I don't know if they know I'm with me

330
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,880
But I would like to leave is it acceptable to go wash my hands next to them as they have their moment

331
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
That was from bathroom boohoo, buddy

332
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Are you an older person

333
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,900
Who can provide a sort of sagacious?

334
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,400
Little little little bit a little monologue for them

335
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,640
Yeah

336
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,960
Or an older person that could pretend you're them from the future who just came back to tell him that everything is gonna work out

337
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,520
Just fine. Yeah, that one might be tough depending on like

338
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,560
If you look nothing like them at all at all, I don't know what what the future holds driven

339
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah, maybe carry around like a cyber mask with you everywhere you go and that's great. You're in the stall

340
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,280
You're in the bathroom and you hear somebody crying out in the sink area the hand-washing zone

341
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
And you're like, okay

342
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Hold on and you pull on the sort of like lycra suit and cyber mask and then you walk out of the stall like

343
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,920
It helps if you have some like DJ equipment with you

344
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,320
Yeah

345
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,680
I got some a machine and a light show and you can be like contain your moisture

346
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:16,320
Ever and they're like whoa what and you're like, yeah, I'm you from the future. I'm a robot cyber DJ

347
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,960
I guess if this is the case you don't have to be an older person. Yeah, anyone could do that

348
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,160
Anyone could be that with a little forethought anyone can do that and you could say like I am you from the future

349
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:35,080
I do look younger than you but that's because that's time dilation. So good. So that and that's Einstein said that I

350
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,720
I feel like if I went out there when they're in the middle of their of their

351
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:47,680
Challenging episode that might be a little too disorienting cuz like imagine if one of your favorite podcasters just appeared out of nowhere

352
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,040
Justin McElroy is in this bathroom and I'd be like

353
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,360
Guilty as charged. Well, that's how can you say?

354
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,560
Well, your friends paid for what we're calling a real-life cameo and so I I'm here waiting for you to come in

355
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,080
So I could tell you hey, man, everything's gonna be okay, and make sure to check out trolls world tour

356
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,600
Residuals on that one baby, you guys would not believe do you buy that on we're gonna need you to buy a physical copy

357
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,480
But I know that that's not cool these days, but they have them here at the store

358
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,920
I just saw a big display of them by the front. Hey real-life sidebar

359
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
if I

360
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
had known

361
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,020
That when you do parts in a movie, they keep sending you money for no reason

362
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,180
Yeah, I would have tried to be in movies long ago

363
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
We're not putting in a hot tub with this

364
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,040
This is a very small bit of money, but it does come for no reason for no reason

365
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:02,820
And it's just a little surprise letter from our friends at DreamWorks. Hey guys, here's 20 bucks. Thanks Wow 20

366
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:11,080
Love that if I was getting $20 checks from trolls world tour, I'd be I'd be a happy young guy

367
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,400
If you went to babysit and on top of the money, they were paying you a babysit

368
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,440
They said here's some money to order a pizza if you want and you're like

369
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:26,160
Well, hey, and we'll keep sending you pizza money every few months for no reason for the rest of your life

370
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,960
It's the closest I've come to that feeling of completing the the paper from book it to get a free personal

371
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,880
In my adult life, that's what residuals are

372
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,920
But I know I'm not sure I understood that reference which makes me think that none of our list pizza

373
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:49,800
Hot book it you pizza help book it you read enough books or get good grades or something you get free pizza free personal pan pizzas

374
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,460
I think it's a real nice moment for human connection. Some of the times I've had in my life that I felt like you know

375
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,680
The hand of any sort of like divine forces or whatever is when I've been there when somebody else is upset

376
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,400
That's great because it doesn't have to be about you for a little bit. You can chill your own problems

377
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,920
Be like hey, let's talk. Let's talk through it. If you feel like it. If not, I'm gonna wash my hands. I'm gonna leave

378
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,480
But right now I'm open book baby. Let's go through it. I'm a stranger who better?

379
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,840
Yeah

380
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,560
This is actually one of those rare times where pretending like it's not happening is what makes it awkward

381
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,680
Like if you just walk out and like eyes forward wash your hands and dry your hands eyes forward and walk out silently

382
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,920
Yeah, now whatever rough time that person's going through they are both embarrassed and isolated where if you come out and like hey

383
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,800
You know you got this or it gets better or whatever and then walk out made it or we all

384
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,400
Agree that being there for someone in their time of need is a very good feeling

385
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,760
So whatever they're giving you from out there in sync zone you walk out of that stall

386
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,000
And you take it you take it up a level escalate

387
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,680
Your life is worse if they're well, you don't have to say that obviously that's not the right thing to do

388
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,600
but if they're giving you like

389
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
You come at them with like

390
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Like and you're way more

391
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,120
And then they look at you and they're like wow

392
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,360
Wow, it could be a lot worse. What's going on with you? And then you're gonna have to lie

393
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,440
I'm you know say like, you know, I I just watched up on my phone on the toilet

394
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,880
You could also just walk out covered in blood since they're like, oh no not again

395
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,120
And now you've distracted them from what I've been on such short notice though. Well with a little bit of preparation

396
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,960
It's right there with your in your bag next to your DJ equipment and your cyber helmet. You're coming out on top

397
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,920
What does this situation call for? What are they crying about? Oh, they got fired. Mm-hmm

398
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,400
Is that a blood situation or I'm you from the future?

399
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:56,640
Oh, you also rip a big one and that's that's a bathroom joke that like everyone really yeah

400
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,080
Griffin I actually think that may be the best advice is if you just like

401
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,400
Simulate a gigantic beaver. There is no time that I've ever heard that in my life that I have not busted up

402
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:18,560
A hundred. Yeah, I was in the Buc-ee's restroom with Henry helping him do his thing when someone made a break

403
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,480
Someone someone made a rude noise in an adjacent stall and Henry just started laughing

404
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,720
Yeah, and I had to look at him and be like you can't do that. This is a special place

405
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,400
This is a special place where you do that without judgment from five-year-olds

406
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,840
It's the closest the everyday person gets diplomatic immunity. Yeah

407
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:45,440
Please but I think if you do it when someone's crying they know it's like for their benefit and they'll be like, thank you

408
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,640
So that should work too. A lot of great stuff you can do in the bathroom. It's a funny room

409
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,600
Yeah, we don't talk about this enough. Why don't more people make bathroom jokes? I don't know

410
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,360
Let's take a quick break and then we'll come back with lots more content it to the money zone

411
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:09,280
Okay, I guess the money zone is content right? Yeah, it's all content baby. It's all content. This is content

412
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Listen, they're paying by the minute. That's all I know

413
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
What's to say about

414
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,960
Squarespace that hasn't been said before

415
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:32,880
Huh? Does anyone know? I mean nothing but they are continuing to pay us to say the same things

416
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,200
Again, so let's respect that. Did you guys know you might not know this

417
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,400
But there are people out there who don't have websites

418
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,160
Yeah, what? Yeah. Can you imagine? Yes, right? What? Okay

419
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,360
But I'm trying to make it like I'm like what why would you cuz Squarespace helps you build your own website where you can like

420
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,800
Showcase, you know your work or like sell things or like blog and publish content all that stuff and some people

421
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,040
Don't do that

422
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:10,960
Yeah, why what are they afraid of right? Are they afraid of cyber ghosts? Of course, of course

423
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,800
We all are but good news and Squarespace doesn't want me to tell you this but all their stuff is blessed by cyber priests

424
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
cyber ghost free

425
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
100% guaranteed or your money back

426
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,320
Yeah, I said it. I said it and then are you gonna say any of the other things that they want us to say?

427
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,640
No, add copy. Are you just gonna talk mostly about sort of cyber priests?

428
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,520
No, listen

429
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,640
Everybody knows about all their cool stuff right member areas where you can unlock a new revenue stream for your business and free up time

430
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,320
And you get you all by selling access to gated content like video tutorials and online courses or like sell your products

431
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,160
Or like, you know, you can sell physical or digital but all that stuff right but the main worry

432
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,760
Yeah, cyber ghosts. I do think I'm not a hundred percent sure that

433
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,800
ghosts are

434
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,880
the

435
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,920
Main sort of prey for priests. I have always cyber race

436
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah, cyber priests. I think that I feel like like demons and imps are there a more their thing?

437
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,640
But like if you have a ghost in your house, typically you don't

438
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
That's not like priest

439
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,040
You're showing your whole ass on this one. Of course cyber ghost is a wide branching like turn umbrella

440
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,720
Right, it covers stuff like cyber demons and cyber imps and cyber devils

441
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,840
And I've warned you multiple times about opening the door to allow Travis to enrich his own mythology

442
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,240
Like, you know, you know what you've done

443
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,060
And so it's just a shorthand to say cyber ghosts and you know

444
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,520
What the fuck the square in the space is a box. They put the ghosts into yes

445
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Now don't open that cyber box. If you don't cyber box shit. Listen, it's a big Twinkie. We all know that right?

446

Do you have werewolves problems?

458
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,440
Is that a problem with werewolves or a problem werewolves have?

459
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,120
Every time you go out to eat with your family and kids do werewolves come to try to eat your family and kids?

460
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,280
well good news door dash is here and they aren't scared of

461
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,360
Monsters and they will bring food to right to your house from the restaurants you yeah

462
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,240
What precautions are they taking to make sure my food makes it to be unmolested by werewolves?

463
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
they have

464
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
silver katanas

465
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,680
Every Dasher has a silver katana. Are they trained? No

466
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Oh, no

467
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
But they I mean they're good

468
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,840
The katana industry doesn't want you to know you're actually more likely to be killed by katana in your home, right?

469
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,560
That's what they don't tell you

470
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,920
But they you know, the hit rate is pretty good

471
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:53,080

479
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,880
Yeah, they know you're right Travis. Whatever you're about to say is more important than the personal testimony

480
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,320
I was about to deliver for the company that has paid us money to deliver such a personal testimony

481
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,600
What happens podcast go ahead Travis with your question?

482
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:51,440
What happens if the door dasher fails to fend off the werewolf the werewolf kills the door shot and then appears at my home?

483
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,160
Yeah, tending to be the door dasher. What do I well, let me say first of all the stuff still gets to my house

484
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:05,380
That's door. Dash. They will always deliver even if they have been horrifically mauled by a werewolf. Yeah

485
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:11,460
Um, it's personally if I might give a personal testimony. It's why I like to leave it at the door option

486
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,460
Yeah, even if it is a werewolf. I'm like, okay, just leave it there

487
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,900
Okay, I'll get it when you drive away or you know leap over the fence and run off howling into the night

And he's like, are you sure?

505
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,060
Oh my god

I want to Munch Squad!

513
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,860
Welcome to Munch Squad's podcast is a podcast profiling the latest Garry's brand eating.

514
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,940
KFC released finger sporks, and I'm not going to talk about it.

515
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,860
Please? Will you please at least tell me what it is?

516
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,700
It's a spork goes in your finger to encourage you to make all their food finger looking good.

517
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,660
Now you can eat your corn with the finger spork.

518
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,580
Does this does the spork?

519
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,100
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

520
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,540
No, no, but I do want to talk about it.

521
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,340
So does the spoon come up from the finger or do you like where do you scoop?

522
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,020
You wear it on your finger.

523
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,700
Right, but are you talking about?

524
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,220
You can wear it either way, Griffin.

525
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,460
It's not, I don't, I can't imagine that it's like an intricate mounting process.

526
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,580
Can I put on five finger sporks and then just pick up my potatoes like that and just go blop blop blop blop blop.

527
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,220
Yep.

528
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,180
Okay, cool.

529
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,620
It's all good stuff.

530
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,660
It's all good.

531
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,780
It's like, you know, just like finger looking.

532
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,420
It's just if you didn't want to talk about it, I don't know why you would.

533
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,140
I'm just telling you that because I'm tired of people trying to bait me.

534
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:51,900
Yeah, if he's like, like anybody could do a hilarious run about that.

535
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,620
But you know what I mean?

536
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,540
Like we just did like three of them.

537
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,580
We just did great.

538
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:01,260
And I'm really torn though between these two stories because one's wilder, but what?

539
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,620
Okay, we're going to talk about Subway.

540
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,140
Subway has launched its most significant menu change in 57 years.

541
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,460
Okay.

542
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,420
It's the Subway series.

543
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:12,940
Okay.

544
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,020
Doesn't sound that significant yet.

545
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,540
Okay, so here's what they've done.

546
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,700
Have they made their shops not stink like the worst stink you ever did?

547
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,220
Are they done ruining combination gas stations and Subways?

548
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,180
It's the biggest menu update in the entire history of the franchise.

549
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,860
It tested hundreds of recipes to come up with the Subway series.

550
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,860
12 new signature sandwiches that can be ordered by name or by number.

551
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:41,820
Wow.

552
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,740
It's a whole new way to Subway.

553
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,780
Yeah, they're stealing it from Jimmy John's 10 years ago.

554
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,420
Listen, this is going to absolutely freak you out,

555
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,740
but you can now walk into a Subway and say the name of a sandwich

556
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,140
and they'll just give it to you.

557
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,860
No problem.

558
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,020
How did it work before?

559
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,420
Before you had to be like,

560
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:09,180
okay, so take some yeast and sugar and flour and mix it up and then wait.

561
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:09,740
I don't know.

562
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:16,540
But now, you know how you've left a Subway feeling like you just did long form algebra?

563
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,540
You're like, why was that so tough?

564
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,140
Why did they make it so hard?

565
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,540
Why did I have to make eye contact with the person

566
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,740
as their hand hovered over the vegetables and I said, no, no.

567
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,540
Now you can just say, give me the boss.

568
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,940
Yeah, I can just throw myself through the front window of the Subway

569
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,340
and tuck and roll and just yell, eight.

570
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,020
Give me the great garlic.

571
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,300
They say here, the series lineup isn't a swap in ordering options.

572
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,700
Customers can still walk the line and customize their own choices.

573
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,260
Hell yeah.

574
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,780
So in case you were worried that they would say no,

575
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,340
you have to have lettuce or you'll go to jail.

576
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,100
Don't worry, you still can get it without lice.

577
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,780
In tests, the brand found the series to be easier for guests and employees.

578
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,260
No.

579
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,460
This is a quote.

580
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,380
In fact, in Fort Myers, after just a few weeks,

581
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:14,060
the franchisee reported guests are coming in and ordering the Subway series by number

582
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,900
or asking the great garlic by name.

583
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:24,620
Imagine after just a few weeks, people relented to this new Subway system

584
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:31,260
and said, fine, I'll just have a great garlic and I won't try to make it my way.

585
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,580
I just want to say, as I worked at a Jimmy John's where this is the system,

586
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,380
you have the numbers and you have the names.

587
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,340
What you are now doing is requiring, let's just say it,

588
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,140
like underpaid, everybody in this country is underpaid at this point,

589
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,660
underpaid sandwich makers, like having to memorize,

590
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,340
artists, thank you, memorize, and hey, thank you, artists.

591
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,460
And you know what you're doing?

592
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,900
You're making it sandwich by number.

593
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:04,060
You're taking away the artistry and you're saying you have to memorize the name

594
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:09,100
so that when I say like, give me, I don't know, the big meaty boy,

595
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,540
and they're like, oh, what's on that?

596
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,340
The boss.

597
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,860
That's what you meant to say.

598
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,340
Sure.

599
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,380
Give me the boss.

600
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,540
I don't think I'm going to go into Subway and order the Mexicali.

601
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,820
I don't think I will.

602
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,780
I don't think I'll do that.

603
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,020
I think I'll just order whatever I feel like.

604
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,580
And then if you want to put a label on it, you go for it.

605
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,860
You call it the Subway.

606
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,260
You go for it. You call it the Justin if you need to.

607
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,820
Well, I just know if I commissioned something from an artist,

608
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,940
I just say like, I want a landscape, right?

609
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,900
And I let them do it.

610
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,340
I'm not going to say like, hey, this is what I want it to look like exactly, right?

611
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,940
Then that's not art.

612
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,380
Yeah, I'm not the artist.

613
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:42,860
You are.

614
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,900
You're the artist.

615
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,140
As long as it looks like a car just drove over it,

616
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,860
then it's the Subway sandwich that I know and love.

617
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,740
Here's a revolution.

618
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,100
Here's what you do Subway.

619
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,940
I'm going to fill out a questionnaire that has nothing to do with sandwich toppings.

620
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,980
Then the artist is going to read through that and get a vibe from me personally.

621
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,420
You'll be like, oh, Travis likes a cool fall day.

622
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,420
I know exactly what kind of sandwich he wants.

623
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,620
Surprise me.

624
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,300
Like a mixologist.

625
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,580
Surprise me.

626
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,220
A simple hundred question questionnaire that I answer it

627
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,060
and then you give me the sandwich.

628
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,980
Filled out days in advance.

629
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,260
I'm going to come in on Thursday,

630
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,460
so I'm going to fill out this questionnaire on Monday to give you some time.

631
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,620
An incredibly inappropriately intrusive 100 question question.

632
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,060
Oh, yeah, it's very-

633
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:30,700
Why do you need to know my sexual history in order to make me a roast of beef?

634
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,620
I'm actually sorry, but I do need to-

635
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,500
It's been too long since I've done a Munch Squad

636
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,660
and I need to tell you about this other one too.

637
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,220
It's Hardee's and it is maybe-

638
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:48,060
This may be the worst, laziest, terrible promotion I've ever heard of in my life.

639
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,460
Hardee's is partnering with NASCAR legend Richard Petty

640
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,860
to promote Chicken Platform.

641
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,260
What?

642
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,060
To promote Chicken Platform.

643
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,060
To promote Chicken Platform.

644
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,060
Hardee's is collaborating with one of the hottest drivers in history.

645
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,300
Sexy as fuck.

646
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,860
Let me see that.

647
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,780
Fucking sexy ass Richard Petty.

648
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,060
Let me check out old Dick Petty.

649
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:15,660
One of his most popular menu offerings, the hand-breaded Chicken Platform.

650
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,220
That can't be the name of it.

651
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,820
This month, NASCAR Hall of Famer seven-time NASCAR champion.

652
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,020
Come on, say it with me, guys.

653
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,820
You know it.

654
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,300
Seven-time Daytona 500 winner and devoted Hardee's fan.

655
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,980
Richard Petty will be in his home state of North Carolina

656
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,220
to give consumers the bird surprising restaurant goers

657
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,060
with hand-breaded chicken sandwiches.

658
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,860
What is Chicken Platform?

659
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,540
Oh, is it Chicken Platform?

660
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,300
You know, hand-breaded Chicken Platform?

661
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,180
No, but-

662
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,100
It's the idea of hand-breaded chicken sandwiches, I think.

663
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:49,900
Okay.

664
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,420
So like a platform, like a political platform or like some planks of wood?

665
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,660
It's actually closer to that than you would think, Trav.

666
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,060
Yeah.

667
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:00,380
I think Hardee, Hardee, where's my, where's my Dick Petty?

668
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,420
Hardee's has always had a special place in my heart

669
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,580
because it feels like a bite of home.

670
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,300
Vroom, vroom.

671
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,220
This seems like an apropos moment to reveal I live in a Hardee's now.

672
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,260
I live in a giant chicken like that James fellow except it's out of a beach, you see.

673
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,660
I live in an assisted living Hardee's.

674
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,020
Vroom, vroom.

675
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,820
They help me with my dressings and some of my various household tasks

676
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:32,140
and they keep me absolutely slathered in hand-breaded chicken platform.

677
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,420
I'm pretty sure that Hardee's could be more accurately qualified

678
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,820
as a sort of hospice facility.

679
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,900
Ha-spice.

680
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,420
I have been a true fan of Hardee's,

681
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,620
not like some of these fake Hardee's girls you'll hear about.

682
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,580
Oh, you like Hardee's, huh?

683
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,660
Name four Hardee's members in the chicken platform.

684
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,780
Teaming up to celebrate this delicious hand-breaded chicken sandwich is a real treat for me.

685
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,580
Plus, I'm looking forward to joining Hardee's.

686
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:11,180
I'm in giving the bird a whole new meaning and surprising some deserving fans here in

687
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,020
North Carolina this summer.

688
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,100
Plus, they said I could have a free sandwich.

689
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,900
Petty is popping up at a Hardee's location in the Charlotte, North Carolina area.

690
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,580
There can't be more than 30 to give eligible guests a surprise hand delivery.

691
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,220
What makes you ineligible to get Richard Petty to hand deliver you a sandwich?

692
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,300
Oh, I don't eat chicken.

693
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,180
Oh, fuck.

694
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:33,900
Oh, fuck.

695
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,620
Okay, my bad.

696
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,500
Well, the hand-breaded chicken platform launched last summer in the midst of the chicken wars

697
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,460
and featured that which the fact that they're using the past tense means that there was

698
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,020
an armistice declared that I am not familiar with.

699
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,420
As far as I know, these wars are still raging out there.

700
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:57,580
This summer, these three craveable builds are back in the spotlight and are the ultimate

701
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,340
cluck bait.

702
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,060
Nope.

703
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,020
The ultimate what?

704
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:06,540
The ultimate cluck bait, cluck bait.

705
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,260
What is it?

706
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,300
It's like click bait?

707
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,300
No, it's like cuck bait.

708
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,860
I don't think that's it, Justin.

709
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,100
I think Travis might actually be right on this one.

710
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:21,500
Each big juicy and crispy piece of 100 premium white meat chicken is hand-breaded, on-site,

711
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,700
and now comes with a very small percentage chance that Richard Petty will give it to you, I guess.

712
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:35,180
It's just, Richard Petty has been a fan favorite for years and has always brought that extra

713
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:40,140
flavor to the track like no one else can, just like our hand-breaded chicken.

714
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,500
You know.

715
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:41,980
What?

716
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,380
It brings extra flavor to the track.

717
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,500
I've lost my way.

718
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,660
I know I kind of rambled on there at the end, but you basically get what I was going for.

719
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:58,060
But we really value the authenticity of this partnership because Petty is an organic fan.

720
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,380
Yeah, not like some Bieber's.

721
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:01,660
Not like.

722
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:10,540
It's just, what they're saying to you now is, this announcement is that if you order

723
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:16,620
the chicken sandwich platform through the app or the drive-thru, maybe Richard Petty

724
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,500
will give it to you.

725
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,060
Oh, guys.

726
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,460
Which is not a chance that I'd allow for yet, but I guess I do always kind of assume that

727
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,460
maybe Richard Petty will hand my food to me.

728
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:30,620
Wouldn't that be an amazing turn though if this time Richard Petty is helping the person

729
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,580
in the vehicle.

730
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,660
He's your chicken pit crew.

731
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,220
This time, he's never been on that side before.

732
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,540
He's always been the one in, because I assume now part of the pit crew duties for Richard

733
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:44,940
Petty was handing him a chicken sandwich from Hardee's every time he stopped in every race.

734
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:51,740
I think that Hardee's is trying to throw shade at the KFC Jack Harlow collab by saying,

735
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,420
oh, it's not real shit.

736
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,300
Like, what us and Dick have is real.

737
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,980
This is real.

738
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,340
He's a real American.

739
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:07,180
I feel like this is a bad campaign because the very last thing that I want is to be at

740
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:13,900
a chicken platform restaurant and order some food and then a celebrity that I do not know

741
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:20,460
who it is, hands it to me and gives me a knowing smile like, vroom, vroom, order up.

742
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,340
And I'll be like, thank you, mustache.

743
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,180
Thank you, mustache gentleman.

744
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,740
Thank you, 85-year-old Hardee's employee.

745
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,860
Very much appreciate.

746
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,820
I like your hat.

747
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,780
I didn't know that that was-

748
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,580
I like your hat too.

749
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,940
What's your name?

750
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,540
Let me check out your name tag, as I always do because I'm a father of two.

751
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,540
Richard, thank you very much.

752
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,140
Richard, I appreciate you.

753
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,860
Because my brain would, honest to God, kick into.

754
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,220
He's looking at me pretty hard.

755
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,980
Does he listen to my brother, my brother and me?

756
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:51,980
This is, when they say eligible guests, I think they are talking about like checking

757
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,300
the date on your driver's license because Richard Petty has, I looked it up real quick.

758
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,340
He is an 85-year-old man that has not driven professionally for 30 years.

759
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:06,540
His last ride, it was in 1992 professionally.

760
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:11,740
The Wikipedia says he was in his twilight years as of 1980.

761
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:18,620
Like you have to, as they're coming through, like, and one other question, no reason,

762
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,260
but do you know who Richard Petty is?

763
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,020
Okay, go on in, go on in.

764
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,580
Go on in.

765
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:23,820
Yeah.

766
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,700
On site though, do you know Richard Petty?

767
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,180
If you saw this man, would you recognize him?

768
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,420
They hold up a picture, like a headshot.

769
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,180
He's standing back in the kitchen, just holding the bag, just like looking like,

770
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,660
do they know me?

771
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:37,900
No.

772
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,780
Oh, okay.

773
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,220
Listen, this is-

774
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,420
Hey, Richard, while you wait, if you could sweep up back there.

775
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,460
That would be great.

776
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,260
Our pop culture is increasingly stratified.

777
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,380
We have no monoculture to hold us together anymore.

778
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,220
I have the narrowest possible sliver of celebrity.

779
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:58,940
More people would know me as the guy who uploaded the berries and cream sound than

780
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,940
for my entire professional career.

781
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,820
You would have to like bring in the people that it would be exciting for me.

782
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,260
There's like 30 people that would be excited at a Hardee's to have me behind

783
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,780
the drive-through.

784
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:10,940
Yeah.

785
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,260
I'm not against that though.

786
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:17,100
If somebody wants to fly some people out to be excited by the three of us handing them

787
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,100
a sandwich, yeah, I'd do it.

788
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,460
Hardee Hardee's with the McElroy brothers, and you can have that, Hardee's.

789
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,740
You can use that.

790
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,300
That's for free.

791
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,260
I mean, it will, I mean-

792
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:27,900
No, I want to get paid.

793
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,740
Wipe like six figures, but yeah, sure.

794
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,420
The idea is free.

795
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,060
The execution will be quite expensive.

796
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,900
Hey, Justin, will you read this third question real quick?

797
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,860
Because I think that we can nail it down really fast.

798
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,660
Oh, okay, sure.

799
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,020
I collect VHS tapes.

800
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:45,340
Not too long ago, I acquired a big bad Beatleburg's VHS tape that did not have a case.

801
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,300
Needless to say, I rushed home to watch the tape, but when it started, it had a message

802
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,020
that ran across the top of the screen saying that it was a preview copy.

803
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,380
And if I purchase this tape, I need to call the number on the screen to report it to Fox

804
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,020
Video.

805
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,700
My question is, am I good?

806
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,820
Do I need to report this?

807
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,260
Has too much time passed?

808
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,580
If I do report it, will they take this tape from me?

809
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,620
That's for mystified in Mississippi.

810
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,500
You can't report it.

811
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,180
In fact, you should, you need to hide it.

812
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,020
Yeah, that's contraband.

813
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,020
They won't take the tape from you.

814
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,660
They will take you from your home.

815
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,020
And you will not be seen again.

816
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,020
You know too much.

817
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,860
You know the uncorrected big bad Beatleburg's episodes.

818
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,820
Like before they edited out all the racy stuff.

819
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,340
Like you can't be allowed to say the song.

820
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:35,820
And by racy, you mean racist because the genie character was way more explicitly

821
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,700
problematic and challenging in the original cut.

822
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,140
And also, can I just say, now you've implicated us in this.

823
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,260
You put us at risk.

824
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:50,540
And now we're going to have to go on tour just until the heat dies down at this point.

825
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,820
Where should we go, Trav?

826
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,020
Oh, that's such a good question.

827
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,380
I was thinking maybe like Salt Lake City.

828
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,420
They'll never look for us there.

829
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,020
And then to Portland.

830
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,940
And then we can blend in with people.

831
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,780
I'm as surprised to find us there as anybody.

832
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,620
I'm as surprised to find us there as anyone.

833
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,860
San Diego Comic Con will be a good place to blend in.

834
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,460
We'll do some Deadpool cosplay.

835
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,300
No one will ever find us.

836
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,580
Unless you buy tickets at, you know, macro.family or you go to bit.ly slash McRoy Tours.

837
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,060
Then you might be able to find us at those places.

838
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,420
Salt Lake City is like, I guess, the only place they could really nab us

839
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,340
because that's the only show that's not sold out.

840
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,660
Thank you, Portland and San Diego.

841
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,140
We're back, baby.

842
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,900
Yay. November.

843
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,060
We're also going to be in my new hometown of Washington, D.C., Detroit, and Cincinnati.

844
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,780
My hometown.

845
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,700
Justin, you got to move to Detroit real quick.

846
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,820
You can move back.

847
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,300
If you have questions-

848
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,260
They won't have me there.

849
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:39,900
Oh, yeah.

850
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,180
Not after the Star Wars thing.

851
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,740
Email us questions at nbmbam at maximumfun.org

852
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,780
with the city of the tour stop in the subject line

853
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,260
so we can build up those question lists.

854
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,580
You got to wear a mask and have proof of full vaccination

855
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,820
or a negative COVID test within 72 hours of the event.

856
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,140
Start, if you want, if you want to ride with me at these shows.

857
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:00,940
Yeah, no scrubs.

858
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,460
And a reminder, with Gryffindor moving,

859
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,820
we're going to have a couple of live episodes in a row there

860
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,700
while he gets settled in and can set up equipment and all that stuff.

861
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,740
Please understand.

862
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,900
Please, your understanding is needed, please.

863
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,420
Over at the merch store,

864
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,900
we got the Approach the Wizard shirt designed by Dina Wagner

865
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,940
and 10% of all merch proceeds this month

866
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,060
go to the Trans Youth Equality Foundation.

867
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,700
You can find all that stuff at mcrormerch.com

868
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,380
and pre-orders for Taz 11th Hour are now open.

869
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,940
It comes out February 21st, 2023.

870
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,460
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com to pre-order.

871
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,220
Thank you to Montaigne for the use for a theme song.

872
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,420
My life is better with you.

873
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,460
It's a track that will get that booty slapping.

874
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,260
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

875
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,580
It's also worth noting

876
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,220
we're going to be doing some panels and stuff

877
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,060
as well at San Diego Comic Con.

878
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,180
I know dad and I are doing one Sunday morning at 10 a.m.

879
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,020
all about influencing the next generation of nerds.

880
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,260
And it's gonna be with Bria Ingar

881
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,820
and B. Dave Walters and Johnny Stanton.

882
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,740
It's gonna be super fun and very, I don't know, good.

883
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,500
And you'll like it or else.

884
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,100
Fun and good.

885
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:11,820
Yeah, fun and good.

886
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,100
We'll tweet out those locations

887
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,700
and post the schedule and everything

888
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,660
so you can find us at all those

889
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,100
because we're doing a Taz panel too.

890
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,820
It's gonna be great.

891
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,700
We'll see you there.

892
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,420
Oh my gosh.

893
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,780
Oh my gosh.

894
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,100
I've been working on my James Spader impression

895
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,540
and I would love to try it out if I could.

896
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,260
I mean, we can go Amp versus Amp, Spader versus Spader

897
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,020
and Justin can be in it.

898
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:31,740
Oh, that'd be great.

899
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

900
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,780
One issue is I don't know who that is.

901
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,060
Oh, James Spader?

902
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,460
Yeah, so my impression will be based

903
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,380
largely off of whatever you do, Travis.

904
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,460
Okay, let me zoom in.

905
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,860
Wait, you don't know who James Spader is?

906
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,980
I know the name.

907
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,260
Is that Cyclops?

908
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,380
No, Boston Legal?

909
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,460
No, James Hay-

910
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,980
Okay, you're thinking of James Marsden.

911
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,060
Okay, this does get confusing.

912
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,900
Okay, let's talk about it real quick.

913
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,460
Okay.

914
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,700
James Marster's foot guy.

915
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,300
James Marsden, Sonic's friend.

916
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,420
And maybe potential foot guy.

917
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,140
We cannot confirm or deny.

918
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,900
James Harden, famously bearded basketball player.

919
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,260
It gets confusing.

920
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,100
James Spader, none of those three.

921
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,140
None of those.

922
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,300
Okay, this gives me a lot to go on.

923
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,900
Weird boss on The Office.

924
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,380
He was-

925
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,500
Don't tell me who it is.

926
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,660
Okay, that's the deal.

927
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,380
Either you take it or you leave it.

928
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,300
Then let me try it now.

929
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,340
Okay, okay.

930
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,740
I said, I'm the weird boss on this show.

931
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,740
I don't know which one.

932
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:44,860
And you're gonna listen to me now, James Spader.

933
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,220
Okay, now tell them I'm gonna put you on my blacklist.

934
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,020
I'm gonna put you-

935
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,060
Oh, is that who it is?

936
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:50,460
Yeah.

937
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,100
Oh, okay.

938
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,300
God, I love blacklists.

939
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:53,680
Clearly.

940
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:58,460
Now, now, now I'm gonna put you on my blacklist.

941
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,020
You gotta-

942
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,980
You're like, you have Kareen in the Goldblum.

943
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:02,860
You're right, you're right, you're right.

944
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,580
It's surprisingly close.

945
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:05,820
Yeah.

946
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,260
Is it surprisingly close?

947
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,540
Yeah, there's a thin barrier between Spader and Goldblum.

948
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,140
My name is Justin McElroy.

949
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,420
I'm Travis McElroy.

950
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,460
