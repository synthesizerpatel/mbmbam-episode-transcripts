1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:51,760
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, the official comedy advice cast

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:00,880
of the Avengers in theaters near you May 4th 3D and not. Actually, we legally have to retitle

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,440
the show My Brother, My Brother, Iron Man and Me and Thor and Loki and Hulk is there,

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,680
he's up in the mix. Hulk and She-Hulk. Is She-Hulk in the show? I assume She-Hulk is in it.

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,520
No spoilers. And Vision. Vision's there. Guys, who's your favorite Avenger in the movie The

10
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,800
Avengers? Which scene or Avenger is your favorite? Jarvis. Okay, Jarvis. You mean Iron Man's

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:35,760
electronic butler? Yeah. I'm a big Paul Bettany fan. James Bond? Okay. Griffin, do you know anything

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:44,560
about the Avengers? I like Wolfman. Who's the guy who's always fighting Dracula? Jolly Green Giant.

13
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,440
Is he a comic book? The guy who's fighting Dracula? Yeah. The guy who fights Dracula?

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:57,760
The Mummy? Yeah. My favorite Avenger has to be Iron Man. X-Men. My favorite Avenger is the X-Men

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,920
because this is the official show. I do wish they had sent us a screener of some sort,

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:13,520
maybe to do a little pre-pro beforehand because the only Avenger I know is Ra, the sun god. Yep.

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,840
And he is an Avenger. Are there any others in the group, on the team? I think for a while,

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:31,920
the guy from the Fantastic Four was one. Lou Reed Richards. What about Mega Man? I think Mega Man

19
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,400
with Kid Icarus. Are any of these things? And Simon Belmont. Our dad is listening. Our dad,

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,440
former comic book writer and comic book collector Clint McElroy is listening to this and tearing

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,080
his fucking hair out right now in grief. He's snapping his iPhone across his knee,

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:58,560
throwing it through a window like Bruce Banner's alter identity. The thing. The thing. The hide,

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,280
Mr. Hide. The hulking mask. The hulking mask of strength. The big guy. The big guy.

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,040
When we're not watching the Avengers. Which is apparently all the time.

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,240
May 4th, theater near you, 3D official comedy podcast, co-branding, brand partnership,

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,400
brand synergy. When I watched the Avengers. How much of that one billion dollar opening

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,000
weekend did we get? What we got was a free 12 pack of Diet Dr. Pepper with the Avengers logo

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
on every single can. Sorry. It's gonna be collectible someday. Are we talking about

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,400
DDP or are we talking DCDP? No, this is straight up DDP. No cherries up in this bitch. Just throw

30
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,040
it away. Get some grenadine or throw it away. Grenadine. Unless you got like sugar free grenadine,

31
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,560
you're going to defeat the purpose. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, Iron Man. I'm

32
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,520
your middle brother, Travis McElroy, Wonder Man. I am Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother,

33
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:11,440
Young Brother Man. My 25 year old friend. Octopus Man. Octopus Man. Bubble Man. Bubble Man. Leaf Man.

34
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,360
Well, back in the Mega Man. Okay, Leaf Garrett, the Avenger. My 25 year old friend won't grow up.

35
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,280
I've tried to impart wisdom and encourage her to pack her bags and move, but she won't do that

36
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,560
without her parents approval either. Help me, brothers. Can I help her stand on her own two

37
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,560
feet? That's from Conflicted Comrade. Additional details on this one. She goes on to explain

38
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,520
things like when her friend was looking to buy a new car, they had everything worked out,

39
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,520
but her parents did not like the car, so she did not buy it and continues to drive their old

40
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,400
minivan and things along that line. So she basically runs all of her life decisions by

41
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,720
her parents. And then she still and she also like still has curfew. Oh, no. Whoa. Yeah. And has to

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,400
like check in every half hour. She lives with her folks from what I could tell from the email. Yes,

43
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,920
I get that would be weird if you had a curfew and you didn't live with your parents.

44
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,640
Like, are you in your apartment? It's 11 o'clock. I'll flick my lights on and off so you can see.

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,760
I think that anybody who has given over the locus of control to their parents like that,

46
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,760
like, well, whatever they say is the way it goes. That's going to be real hard to shake unless

47
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,840
you're willing to take those reins. Yeah. You've got to be the one running your friend's life.

48
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
You've got to become your friend's life coach. You've got to help. Yeah, you've got to life

49
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,160
coach him. You've got to you've got to be there. Joel Austin can just walk them through some of

50
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,440
the big choices. Can I just say, like, I don't know that this is helpful, but I never saw this

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,920
before. Fair enough. I kind of see the appeal of it. Not necessarily the parents, but having some

52
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:59,360
kind of like safety net outside of my head conscience that just was with me that I could go,

53
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,080
man, I kind of want to buy, you know, this new thing. What do you think? No. Okay. You know,

54
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,280
it takes all the onus of responsibility off of you. I scoffed at the idea of a bedtime,

55
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,200
but that wouldn't be the worst thing. Like, if I don't go to bed by 1030, I am totally useless

56
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,320
the next day. So some sort of authority figure. What's up? Were you giggling at the fact that

57
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,360
I need to go to bed by 1030? Yeah, I guess. I went to bed at 1130 last night and I needed

58
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:37,120
to have a five hour energy drink at one PM today. Griffin doesn't get his full 12 hours.

59
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,760
He just don't even bother. Griffin, I went to bed at 430 last night and then I woke up at 930

60
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,160
and I'm going to be very funny for the next hour. Why were you out until you're fucking 38 years

61
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,600
old? You're old as shit. What were you doing? Well, I don't know. Sometimes I just like to

62
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,920
party. Justin, since I've moved away from Huntington, from time to time, whenever you

63
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,320
text me at like, you know, two o'clock in the morning and you're clearly drunk on the town,

64
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,840
sometimes I just like to picture you, you know, in a werewolf movies when the guy wakes up in

65
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,320
the woods and he's like covered in mud and he's naked and real confused. That's how I always

66
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,120
imagine you the next morning. It's pretty much like that except I have a candy pacifier around

67
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,680
my neck. Pants hung low around your knees. You're asleep outside of Stumbler's too, still stumbling.

68
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,840
Hey, everybody, that's a real bar in Huntington. Come on out. Catch the fever. Catch the fever.

69
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:46,000
Stumbler's too, still stumbling. If you had a grown folk telling you not to do these things,

70
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,800
don't you think your life would be a little bit better? Yeah, because I miss being able to get

71
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
mad at somebody who makes me do things still. That you want to do secretly. Yeah, right.

72
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,400
Oh, I can't come out. Guys, I'd love to come out and just really see the new band, but man,

73
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,000
the rents. Oh no, I gotta call my daddy. Oh, he said no, guys. Oh man, hold on, it's my dad mate.

74
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,880
Oh, that's what I call my dad because he's, yeah, we split the rent. He covers a lot of it.

75
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:29,040
God, this is why there gets a certain point of messed up where if the parents aren't going to

76
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,360
let go of it and the parents aren't going to push this person out, I'm not sure-

77
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:41,280
It'll ever happen? No, I don't think it's that person. To conflicted comrade, I don't think you

78
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,880
want to be the thing that does this. No, you can't. Not unless the parents have to be a willing

79
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,800
participant in it, especially if the friend is unwilling to. You can't wrench them out. I mean,

80
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,360
you're talking about creating an entirely separate support system that this person

81
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,720
may not even want. That's too big for you. It's too much heat. You don't want that heat.

82
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,960
You can't handle that heat. Also, if your friend's not pushing back against her parents,

83
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,960
maybe she's not upset about the situation. You're looking at this and it's weird to you, but-

84
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,080
Right. We do all know these people. You know people who are 60 years old and still,

85
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,400
maybe not 60, but 40, 50, doting on their parents and completely unable to do anything without

86
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,000
the input of their parents. That's how these people get that way. I know it's your friend.

87
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,040
It's sad to think about, but believe me when I say this is why parenting is the biggest thing

88
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,400
because you can totally do that to somebody and there's very little that can be done.

89
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,960
Gotta have some kids. Yeah, and then boot them right out at 18. Go to college. Enjoy the world.

90
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,560
Experience things. Call me once a week. Not too much. Not too much. I'll turn your room into a

91
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
playroom. Turn your room into a playroom. Maybe there's a window where you gotta get out because

92
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,000
to me there was, this is gonna sound terrible, there was no day in my life that I can remember

93
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,840
being as exciting as being 19 and moving into my first apartment, living by myself. That's such a

94
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,960
fucking insane sea change. Everything in your life changes at that point. I think that that

95
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,120
kind of change is exciting when you're a fresh face 19 year old, but when maybe even like 25

96
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,480
it's absolutely terrifying. It's not too late, but it's terrifying. It is scary and it's a little

97
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,080
embarrassing I would imagine to be like, how do you get electricity? How do you get water? How do

98
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:51,280
any of those things? When I was 19 I was just calling the mayor. Hey dog, I don't know how

99
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,080
to get these things. Can you please help me? Can you bring me some water please? I'm so thirsty.

100
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:03,280
I'm a citizen. Please come help me, but at 25 it's gonna be a tough hole to dig out of.

101
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,520
I don't know and I don't think that unless your friend is frustrated with their situation

102
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,440
you can't help her out of it, but also make her frustrated with it. Well the thing is it's like

103
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,000
any responsibility. You could look at someone over and over again and say you need to be more

104
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,160
responsible, but until they make that decision for themselves it's not going to sink in. It's

105
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,280
not really something you can explain to somebody and make them want to do. They have to come to

106
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,360
the realization themselves. If you're whole hog about this and you are serious about it to the

107
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,680
point where you want to get like wicked deep involved, you really have only one option.

108
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,840
Just talk to her parents. Don't do that. You're right. You're totally right. Justin, you're

109
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,720
totally right that that's the only right to her mom mom and dad dad and say listen listen you two

that t-shirt says i heart judges okay but that's that's gonna probably not gonna do it because i

131
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,400
think i don't think you can wear any shirt that says i heart anything on it and then i heart

half am i good what's that smell it's not weed i promise to what extent does the color of belt

139
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,000
that this person has all the difference in the world okay it for for i mean either way you chop

140
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,880
it if he's got a white belt he's not going to a intimidate the judge or be impressive with the

141
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,320
with the amount of time that he has spent in karate chopping class you can get the white belt

142
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,960
blue belt brown belt yellow belt all within like a week and a half if you pay and if you slip a few

143
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,200
you know extra hundos to your uh to your sensei to your senpai um from what from what i've seen

144
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,560
there if you were to graph my uh respect for people in the martial arts it's a pretty steady

145
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,800
curve up until you hit black belt and then it it branches pretty radically in two different

146
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,960
directions where on the one hand i am for some of those people i am like wow really odd by the

147
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,240
dedication to your craft and then the other people it's like just put on just get a job

148
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,320
just put on a suit and learn how to play lacrosse and please get your life together it distracts

149
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,840
me it's one of those things that in my life if someone were to say to me oh yeah i have a black

150
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:19,360
belt the next two words out of my mouth are prove it yeah i don't i don't know what that entails i

151
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,520
don't know if that's like chop through this wall or fight me or what it is but there's something

152
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,560
about someone making that statement where i'm like oh yeah prove it but i think a black belt

153
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,160
drop that horse in half a black belt is really a only a value add to a person when nobody knows

154
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,240
that they have it right like if i got a black belt i wouldn't tell fucking i would go take my classes

155
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:50,160
in another state so so that people what classes oh karate karate classes um and then when i came

156
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,520
back and like if shit came down and i like did a chop and a kick and a man died then people were

157
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,160
like what i'd be like oh don't worry about it i would never ever admit the fact that i have a

158
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,320
jacket to the side and show them just a little like glimpse of black belt because if i ever

159
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,160
said the word out loud to somebody oh i have a black belt they're gonna make all kinds of wild

160
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,600
assumptions about me right which are probably all going to be they're gonna be very true uh but i

161
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,400
would rather not be be subject to that do you think that when you get the black belt itself

162
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:30,320
you it's reversible in case you want to wear brown shoes idiot so this is what this is your outfit

163
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,680
okay you come into court you're wearing brown black dress shoes a black belt and you have

164
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,440
a tie and you go to the judge and you say am i good as you can see i'm in my formal ghee

165
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,600
am i good now this is my dress key am i good i have a funeral to go to i'm gonna karate

166
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,880
chop the coffin in half i can't believe you'd hold a karate master here you don't know that

167
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,280
the lightning you're bottling up here you can't put me in a cell i will not be responsible for

168
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,080
the damage i do if you lock me in a cell with another person i whittle their bones down and

169
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,720
make a key like i can't i can't be responsible i don't know that karate is the kind of thing

170
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,520
that you can do if you're high on that sweet sweet dojo if you're if you're rocking dojo

171
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,200
in the dojo like you're i don't think that your skills are going to be like as as as high as you

172
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:38,960
want them to be no like three three puns intended uh yes yes and no to the outside observer you

173
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,160
will be very bad at karate yeah to your own perception oh my god you'll be on a fucking

174
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,960
kung fu other playing kill bill style fucking body parallel flat to the ground doing a you against

175
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,280
the crazy 88s just losing your mind chopping off limbs mortal combat fly through the air bicycle

176
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,040
kick like you're just laying on the ground and rolling rolling about you're listening to 311

177
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,640
and you're eating starburst i just i just had a point wait hold on i just realized something

178
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,400
thinking about this question that has blown my mind so hard that i have to ask it what's that

179
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:20,080
okay is it possible that this person asking this question owns a karate outfit but does not in fact

180
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,680
do karate oh i thought that was implied okay great um but that's a that's a oh god what a

181
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,120
risky maneuver because if you go to court you're gonna be high and the judge is like obviously the

182
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:41,120
judge and you're wearing your kimpogi and he's like pardon like i don't worry about it i do karate

183
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,920
i don't just sit around and chill with my boys and listen to 311 then the judge is going to be

184
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,080
like okay well to prove that chop all these boards and kick this man and then what are

185
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,400
you gonna do you're gonna hurt your hand you're gonna hurt your hand you're gonna embarrass

186
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,120
yourself in front of the man and there's a bigger risk what's that there's a bigger risk that this

187
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,680
judge is secretly a vampire hunter he'll see your skills and say we've been looking for someone like

188
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,360
you yeah come into the secret office behind my office the tinier office under my office the tiny

189
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,160
office under my office that opens into a large cavernous office where there's a network of agents

190
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,640
uh monitoring the vampire menace so that's one of the worries you just need to pass this urine test

232
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
unplug that computer and set it on fire because the authorities are on their way to your residence

233
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,520
you're gonna end up in dog dick limbo and you're never gonna get out now i now as i was saying

234
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:20,880
that's 15 for one 25 for a couple how would i hear your tickets oh god thank you for coming to

235
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:32,720
prom you don't you don't want to go to prom is there any way is okay i mean if you fully lean

236
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,400
into it and go like powder blue ruffled tuxedo and talk about how much better prom was in your day

237
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,160
if you absolutely have to put your dick in that shark's mouth like what's the best way to do it

238
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,080
the only way you can do it and i've seen you've seen this maneuver in so many films and you do

239
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,840
have to pull it off you have to become the star of the prom oh my god like you gotta do life it

240
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,960
up you've got a teen wolf right you've got to become the life of the prom if anybody there

241
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:14,800
expects that you this tall bearded grandpa is there and trying to like keep it discreet oh it's

242
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:21,120
it's the assumptions fly your flag yeah because here's the thing here's the main point numerically

243
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,960
18 and 20 not that different realistically worlds apart well well i mean i'm just saying like you

244
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,840
could look at it on paper and say like what's so weird it's only been two years yeah since he's

245
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,440
been out of high school but there's a there's a door there you can't go back through sure um and

246
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,760
that's not to say that you're you're like something's weird about your relationship

247
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,440
oh no no no no because when you date a college person when you're in high school

248
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,040
then you you you like bought you gain those levels right is that how that works yeah you

249
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,880
gain experience yeah i just i don't understand why you would want to go into relationship debt

250
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,440
trying to convince this girl to go to a school dance she doesn't want to go this woman

251
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:11,200
not relationship debt and like real debt you cost a lot of money what if she orders the

252
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,040
fucking samurai play the hibachi that's 35 you're not gonna get back

253
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,840
right down to her gullet she'll of course she'll only eat the scallops

254
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,480
i say she's too full yeah what if what do you do with the box you leave it in the limo

255
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,840
what what do they do if the hibachi master throws a temporary shrimp at her she doesn't catch it

256
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:38,640
what's oh no oh god oh god my my face skin take me to the hospital i'm in high school i don't have

59 series how many was it actually it was it was in the amalgam and tempura face combined with

268
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,040
super boy i remember that you often discuss why a customer should not ask out an employee

269
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,600
but you never talk about the reverse can an employee of a restaurant ask out a customer

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:05,280
gave her a check oh god then oh god the next part please okay i got her name off the receipt oh no

278
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:14,480
no facebook break wait no wait travis i know you got her name off the receipt and then you

279
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,480
message her on facebook yes yes long story short i mean she said yes to a date so we did go out on

280
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,720
a date so hold on when i said travis we should do an advice show how was your response on oh no i

281
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,400
could never do that oh no i made the worst decision ever oh no i i couldn't do that again

282
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,920
oh no i i couldn't do that and keep and have a straight face i'm sorry it's like when you get

283
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,840
caught drunk driving and so you can never be president you it's like that travis when travis

284
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,920
did she can learn from my failure did she give you any indication in the restaurant she was

285
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,880
also craving your wave in a yes okay yes so it's not like it wasn't technically stalking

286
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,000
no there was mutual flirting to the point like where she came over and was talking to me

287
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
like left her group of friends and stuff i was talking to me i just was too nervous to do it and

288
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,080
she was like man i sure wish you'd just crib my identity could you take that for me thanks

289
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,160
did she give you any hint that she wanted to be clumbed that hard

290
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,840
but here's the thing though you can't knock it because she agreed to go on a date with me oh i

291
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,560
can i can i've been your brother for 28 years i can knock it don't do it it's one of the sketchiest

292
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,480
things i've ever done but i gotta say but it worked out like if it hadn't worked out

293
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,040
yeah i mean it would be a lot harder to criticize three of us like together if you add all of our

294
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:49,120
game up you'd get like seven and but the scale goes up to like a billion so um and i i'm pretty

295
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,240
sure you're bringing six of those points so right um i got i mean that's good game that's pretty

296
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:01,920
good game that's not bad well it's it's borderline illegal game but it's not what i did no it's not

297
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:08,400
the worst uh and then i did buy a bunch of stuff with her credit okay but that was after it didn't

298
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,480
work out um we only went on one day she turned out not to be very interesting okay yeah oh man

299
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,880
yeah i'm i don't know what's more concerning to me the people who are just going to

300
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,120
realize what a ruse it's been they've been taking advice from travis for these years

301
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,360
or the people who are sitting at home saying oh good one i like that thanks thanks t-dog

302
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,680
listen you know my methods no you know i'm not gonna defend myself it's one of the sketchiest

303
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,360
things i've ever done at the time i thought it was kind of oh god in a lonely way romantic it's not

304
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,440
it's not if if you can't ask the person out there and there don't do it the biggest problem with

305
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:59,040
romance is that it's often in every way except like the line between that and creepsneak is like

306
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:06,400
so thin right if there's a guy outside your window and a trench coat and he's holding something up

307
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,400
there are literally one thing that is a boombox it could be and then a million other things that

308
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,760
it could be that's how thin that line is yeah you can have one thing in your hand that's romantic

309
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,600
or you can have a million things where if you're standing outside someone's window

310
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,760
in a trench coat holding something aloft it's the worst it's the pit it's also like it's a

311
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,280
really dangerous game it's i mean it's it's thinner than that isn't it like if you're

312
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,720
holding up a boombox there's really one song that you can be playing on that jukebox and if you have

313
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,200
like cnc music factory gonna make you sweat busting outside of somebody's window where

314
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,600
they're sitting next to the window like working on the macbook and their husband's in the other

315
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:54,000
yeah christine yeah open your window if you like pina coladas this is insane composting am i good

316
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:01,760
christine am i good here's the takeaway uh people listening at home that thought for even a half of

317
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,240
a second that what i did was a good idea um for the one time that it worked out there are 99 other

318
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,240
times that she could have called my boss you did this 90 other times no no no no to the same person

319
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,360
no i'm saying that there was a 99 probably 99.9 chance oh yeah that she could call my boss

320
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,920
and be like uh one of your employees totally creeped my name off of my receipt yeah you

321
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,960
definitely threaded the needle on this one yes so don't do it you know if travis had gotten fired

322
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:51,520
you know what he wouldn't needed more of therapy well money zone our first driver money zone this

323
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,320
week is a little thing called mob rules travis what can you tell me about them mob rules is

324
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,480
uh an independent game company and right now they're working on a project called haunts the

325
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,000
manse macabre and it's a really cool idea basically the idea is you can either be

326
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,640
the haunt the denizens haunting the mansion or you can be the intruders that are coming in to

327
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,560
investigate the mansion you can play from either side you can play single player you can play

328
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,600
multiplayer and it's online but the coolest thing about the company is that they are completely

329
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,080
transparent so basically they're really up front with their business model they make all their

330
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,120
budgets sales schedule expenses everything's public so you know what's going on so basically

331
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,000
the deal is they want your help getting their game finished so they're promoting a kickstarter

332
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,400
and you can go check it out it's mob rules games dot square space dot com and you can go and check

333
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,480

334
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,000
is great and they seem like really cool guys and they're giving out they're giving out free

335
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,240
downloads of the game for every five dollars that you give to the kickstarter so there's some good

336
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,360
bonuses so if you donate you know 50 bucks you get 10 codes to download the game and you can spread

337
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,880
those out amongst your friends or they even encourage in the video they encourage you to

338
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,880
sell them for profit so take the code and then sell it for seven dollars and make two dollars

339
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,440
off of every code but they need you know they've already raised 40 000 and you just need another

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
a person that thinks they've been defrauded

419
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,800
either that when you order a pizza either online or on the phone the moment that you place that

420
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,800
order that pizza is technically your property you know what i mean if you pay online with a credit

421
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:02,480
card it's your pizza so if they keep it from you then it's stolen and you have to call that um when

422
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,440
i watch that bar fill on the dominos pizza tracker all i can think about is like okay donna be careful

423
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,840
with my pie it says you're putting it in the oven right now please be gentle baby gloves i

424
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,560
wish sometimes i want to call and just i don't want to just be like hey baby gloves i can watch

425
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,800
you do everything on my computer i know what's at if i please put the pepperoni in concentric circles

426
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,000
it will say donna dropped the pizza on the floor she picked the hair off it and looked around to

427
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,960
see if anyone saw the internet saw donna is it possible that this person is worried about the

428
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,440
safety of the driver i i guess because i do know that those people come under come under crime oh

429
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,560
my god i've had a pizza delivered by nathan every day for the last six months and he's not here yet

430
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,600
and he's always on time also i think something's gone wrong i also need police to help me get out

431
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:01,360

442
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:12,320
avengers well listen if i if i order a pizza it takes 90 minutes to get there it's a good thing

443
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,160
the police will be there because there will have been a suicide and they won't

444
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,680
it will need to investigate my suicide oh this looks like a this looks like another

445
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:31,280
pizza-related suicide another pizza side this is the third this week oh no he was so looking

446
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,480
forward to the crazy bread and pesto sauce and cheese dippins he was getting pizza and wings

447
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:45,280
with dippins and he none of it none of it followed through he's he obviously was eating cheez-its

448
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,440
because there's an empty box of cheez-its as hand is stuck in like poo bear and jar of honey

449
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,680
so it wasn't a hunger issue he was just super boned out for pizza and dip he was definitely

450
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:03,680
snacking um did you guys see that uh somewhere in the middle east i want to say i don't know

451
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:09,120
because i'm not sure of the countries that are over there but um the there's a the uh

452
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,080
pizza it's over there are putting um cheeseburgers in the crust

453
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,520
there's a way so there's pizza huts east of us somewhere they're putting cheeseburgers

454
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,480
somewhere to the east they're putting like full-size like adult adult sized hamburgers

455
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:32,720
in a crust no you gotta imagine like um it's a cheeseburger stuffed crust yeah okay so like

456
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:45,120
there's a ring of dough um and jammed into it are it's our it's a mini cheeseburger it's a it's a

457
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,600
succotash of cheeseburgers it's yeah it's a mishmash of cheeseburger gobbledygook it sounds

458
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,320
like something i would have invented at my most boring and or you're most depressed

459
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:03,440
i i i looked it up and i got really into this idea like man i have to try it so uh i was i was

460
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:12,400
cruising over to the uh there was one sample by uh a guy named arva amed for the uh for the uh

461
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:19,840
the serious eats.com and uh he he checked out the pizza and said if i took the anti-alcohol

462
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:27,760
serious eats.com and uh he he checked out the pizza and said if i took the antonym of delicious

463
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:35,120
strapped it into a rocket and blasted it 20 000 light years away i may begin to get close to my

464
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:42,960
experience with the burger patty they also have chicken tenders that doesn't japan have a pizza

465
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,760
with hot dogs in the crust are we doing that too now there's nothing that upsets me more that this

466
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,200
is going on it's not in america like is there an area we haven't fallen off yet and could like oh

467
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,120
i don't know justin we the one we haven't made tacos with snack chips as the shell oh wait we

468
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:05,520
definitely have done that i guess that's pretty good those last they have a half-life a freshness

469
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,720
firmness half-life of about 13 and a half seconds from the moment that meat touches shell touches

470
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,360
through i want you to know that i've just pictured you in a lab coat and glasses with a clipboard

471
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:23,440
and like a montage of like timing the tacos yeah yeah eating a taco in a centrifuge like oh god

472
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,720
it's separating oh god i've separated now it's just a taco and doritos like a normal fucking

473
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,720
human thing to eat can i get the torritos can i get the doritos loco taco with the doritos on the

474
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:43,440
side i actually would like i would like to start buying bags of doritos that come in taco shell

475
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,640
form that's where i i just want to start there i i just want to cut out the middle man by which i

476
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:57,120

479
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,240
is a crust and also inside instead of a patty there is a blueberry pie but what's in the

480
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:30,400
blueberry pie justa what was the question can we call the police for pizza crimes oh

481
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,400
oh i'm not sure they have jurisdiction unless they're pizza police

482
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,600
there is a separate branch right that's what law and order was about yeah the three branches of

483
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,240
government it's a legislative executive judicial and pizza and pizza licious

484
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,040

490
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:30,080
to finally be starting my career in law enforcement i've already started running every day and mentally

491
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:36,240
psyching myself up is there any advice the brothers mcelroy can give me that's from soon to be po now

492
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,040
we have a little experience in this arena because one of our dearest podcasting friends is james

493
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:49,440
gowdy who's of course a police officer in the beautiful uh uk so um what do you now over there

494
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,480
they they don't have crime which is a thing yeah that's the big not to say that he has an easy job

495
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:03,200
of it but no there's no guns in in all of europe so right no guns no crime as far as i have seen

496
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:11,760
he has to fight criminals that are using trebuchets um what do you guys want from your police just be

497
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,280
could you just be cool just be cool like don't pull me over because i don't have a front plate

498
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,800
on my car i didn't know don't bust me for skateboarding on the rails at city hall

499
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:31,040
because this is sickest grinding in the city don't shoot any kids that's a good place to start i i

500
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,880
love police officers but i don't think that there is a profession that has like one bad apple kind

501
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,800
of yeah reference right yeah yeah absolutely do you know how many cops it takes to ruin the cop

502
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,560
reputation in town like one guy who drives around just shooting his gun out the window yeah a pretty

503
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,720
much almost without incident every time that i've ever been brought under the long arm of the law

504
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,360
the guy's been totally decent about it because it's like usually if you're busted for a crime

505
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:06,080
and you're a white person living in america you know what happens you know what you did you can

506
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:13,840
follow the trail from cause to effect and you right that line gets a lot harder to weave if

507
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:21,840
you are not a white white person of some of some means in america but uh like for me i i know what

508
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,280
i did i know what i gave i'll never forget the time i got pulled over for going i think like 23

509
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,760
miles over the speed limit um and the dude was really cool and he was like i'm gonna write down

510
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,000
that you're going 19 miles over the speed limit because if you're going 20 or more it's reckless

511
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,640
endangerment and i'd have to take your license away i was like thank you so much and while he

512
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,800
was writing the ticket i called our dad and i was like hey dad i'm getting this ticket and he was

513
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,640
like is there any way to talk your way out of it i was like the dude already cut you like going to

514
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:59,680
jail the biggest solid ever yeah i'm i'm i'm gonna say i'm good on this one and just take take it

515
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,440
take take the ticket and say thank you very much and then cry on my way to cincinnati um

516
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,880
one time i was pulled over coming back from a road trip and i was by myself and

517
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:21,840
this sounds like it would happen in a movie but i opened my glove compartment when he asked for

518
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:27,120
my license my registration i opened my glove compartment completely forgetting that i had left

519
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:33,840
a fifth of whiskey oh good in the glove compartment and it literally tumbled out like

520
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,360
comically like a scene from a really bad prequel the dumb and dumber not that there's more than

521
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:45,280
one but you could tell that the cops saw it and then just decided that his day would be a lot

522
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:52,800
better if he hadn't seen it he just sighed and like rubbed his his nose yeah let's all pretend

523
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:58,400
that didn't happen let's pretend i didn't see that and i mean it's not like i'm a lush it just

524
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,040
i it seemed like a place to put it it probably been there for for weeks driving is stressful

525
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:09,600
you know you gotta have some way to gotta relax just gotta unwind out there when i was uh with

526
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:17,680
my group of friends uh uh at bonnaroo and we got busted by drug enforcement officials for having

527
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:25,600
at bonnaroo yeah what um i gotta say it goes all the way down wasn't guys wasn't mine straight edge

528
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:33,600
to the limit no hardcore straight edge who's that wrestler cm punk i'm like cm punk basically

529
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,800
through and through wasn't mine okay but it was happening around me i tried to call an adult

530
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,320
there were no adults to be found i tried to call a teacher or a parent did you snatch out

531
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,680
of their hands they're like hey don't do this you're better than that what happened and that's

532
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:55,040
rolled up holding the bag literally the bag was full of sweet dosha um but they were really cool

533
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,960
they're like let's just hey let's just fill out some paperwork this might be because they were at

534
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,760
bonnaroo and it was probably the three thousandth ticket that they handed out that day where our pad

535
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,640
is empty we're down to the cardboard we're just gonna write on the cardboard iou one ticket yeah

536
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,920
yeah it's like it's like it's like it would be like a writing people uh peanut shell littering

537
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:23,360
tickets at logan's roadhouse texas style roadhouse it's exactly like that yeah yeah it would be like

538
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,400
uh it would be like handing out pizza crime tickets to somebody who spilled a little bit of

539
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,520
uh parmesan on the floor you know it's like cool it guys right take it easy

540
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:40,800

prefer pigs with with the popo with the bacon with guys come on they're wonderful people kill

542
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:54,400
them all occupied in college my friend tj was standing outside of a house party but he was

543
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,440
drinking out of a red solo cup which is like oh you know it's it's like a red flag to the police

544
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,880
like hey i'm drinking nobody drinks juice or milk out of red solo cups exactly there's only one case

545
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,560
in which you drink out of a red solo oh this it's it's ovaltine yeah and so tj at the time was 19

546
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:17,200
and so the cops roll up and they look at him standing in the front yard and they're like

547
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,440
excuse me son how old are you and he looks right at him and he goes i am i am 19 officer

and hightower cops and michael winslow i think i can't do this to you um this yahoo was sent

558
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,880
in by earl parsons thanks earl it's by yahoo answers user gabby who asks what do i say when

559
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:37,760
i touch his dick i want to be confident should i say something like omg it's big or should i say

560
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,320
that or what after and after i touch it what do i do it's like seven inches so that's why i would

561
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:50,960
say it's big you just gotta look at him and say nice nice nice good one bro ah sweet dick that's

562
00:59:50,960 --> 01:00:00,480
like the sweetest dick do start it out with omg whatever you say omg i love this hog is there any

563
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:07,760
words the first time that you see and touch the genitals of a person that you're interested in

564
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,400
there's no words you can say right you just gotta all i can think of is things you shouldn't say you

565
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:18,720
gotta get to business like you just gotta get the the the highest compliment you can pay genitalia

566
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,920
is immediately going to town on them because if you say like just smacking it around even some

567
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,680
even something as innocuous is like oh wow like you're gonna sound like it's like preschool

568
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:38,080
teacher or something like that like you gotta get an old star yeah you gotta start just like just

569
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:45,520
like uh just like touching it just like it's like you got it rub it and like it's like punching it

570
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:51,680
touch it and like whisper at whisper to it blow on it blow on it wink at it

571
01:00:51,680 --> 01:01:00,320
give it eskimo kisses but you're like it's the fifth element and you don't know exactly what

572
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,800
activates it maybe it's butterfly kiss maybe it's fire water you're not exactly sure what the fifth

573
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,040
element is it's probably not fire i'm gonna go ahead and put that out there it might be fire

574
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:15,360
is chris tucker there maybe there's probably a bunch of quotes you could get from fifth

575
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:26,720
element to say when you see the penis that's what you do you light some candles turn on some

576
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:33,680
satay and then you light some candles you pop some some champ some bubbly and you sit down and

577
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:40,880
you kiss softly gently you pull pull those pants down and you pull his underpants down and you look

578
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,440
and you bend down and you get real close to it you know coban dallas into it

579
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,480
they just did a study that is um if you do an impression of chris tucker it's impossible not

580
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,080
to sound racist they actually they actually worked that out just now with some research

581
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,440
some science research i know it's it's too bad what if it was like a really bad impression

582
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,600
of chris tucker well i i don't know yours was so good it's mine was flawless but what if it

583
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:18,400
was like coban dallas could you couple it with a really bad impression of jackie chan

584
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,200
oh man no because that one will be racist i don't have a good

585
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,720
my chan is my chan game is weak my fantastic yeah it'd be something like

586
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:35,440
like and he got one syllable out and we got a shutdown

587
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,680
but can we not i'm can i beat that out yes yeah you beat that out

588
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,560
oh shit dude you really could you just say like what's that

589
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:57,680
what's on this what's up what happens now am i good what's all this what's all the fuss about

590
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:03,920
where's the other one i don't think that one's gonna play you don't think that one's gonna work

591
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,680
i'm worried that this person is young because they said omg and i once you turn like 14 you're

592
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,480
not allowed to say omg anymore it would be i think a baller move to be like a 40 year old woman and

593
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:28,960
be like omg yeah that's actually travis that's the worst i'm what some might call a milf who's

594
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:38,000
ready to go to cougar town let me see your wiener take out that young wiener carbon dallas

595
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:47,760
yes i'm from sydney australia and soon the lfl the lingerie football league is coming to town

596
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:54,480
is that a bad choice to take a girl on a date to that's from guy hey yes it is all right good

597
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:02,160
night everyone yeah it's a pretty bad choice but is it a bad choice to take a grown mature

598
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:09,840
thoughtful woman to it as a date uh pretty much any grown mature thoughtful woman uh that i've

599
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:16,800
known in my life is going to be livid at the idea of the existence of a lingerie football league

600
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:25,920
mm-hmm what's you know what i i kind of am that's i okay i don't want to i don't want to cast

601
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:32,400
i don't want to cast dispersions but i don't think that this is going to be the kind of sports

602
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,240
entertainment that i'm looking for do you know what i mean what are you what would you say you're

603
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:46,880
looking for i am looking for a a robust athleticism and i don't and i don't think would you settle for

604
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:54,560
robusty i wouldn't i wouldn't i like to keep my sports game and my boner game totally on opposite

605
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:02,640
ends of a it's 100 foot high wall i don't start what if you start associating um shoulder pads

606
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,520
with arousal that's gonna make for some awkward locker room moments when you're the intramural

607
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:13,520
season picks back up it's the thing that's the lingerie is the key my key complaint because you

608
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:19,520
can't really get you can't tackle anyone nobody's ever been tackled while wearing lingerie i feel

609
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:25,360
like you know it's there's no protection it's negative protection there's gonna be burns there's

610
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,400
gonna be bruises and breaks and bumps griffin would you be more inclined to watch elantra

611
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:37,040
football league if the teams were coached by hologram of the late great vince lombardi

612
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:45,840
i mean probably travis would i be more entertained by it if it all took place on a spaceship

613
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:54,480
is that like what if when you went to it you got a million dollars for free would i be interested

614
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:00,720
in going yeah probably what if while i was there they gave me uh pizzas with lasagna inside the

615
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:07,520
crust yeah travis i'd probably be down i would probably be down with that oh just by going my

616
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,720
vertical leap gets a foot better yeah i think i could probably get interested in going to something

617
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,840
like that oh i can live forever because with these lfl tickets i'm sure i'm glad i bought these
