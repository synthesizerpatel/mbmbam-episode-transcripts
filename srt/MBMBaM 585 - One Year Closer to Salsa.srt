1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:01:17,260
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin

6
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,120

This is baby brother Griffin back

8
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,940
I just I just learned what you all were talking about that we should do for the intro and it's like I've fallen down

9
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,060
Oh, well a delicious pizza, right? Yeah

10
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,100
You guys heard about this Papa John guy

11
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,780
Okay, so let's start Justin why don't you start us off on a good foot I just

12
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,100
It is it is weird

13
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,060
It is weird. Uh-huh that my brother my brother me a comedy advice show

14
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,980
Has like a super villain, you know what I mean? It's yeah, it's weird

15
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,420
It's weird that we have a Sinestro. Yeah

16
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,420
Yeah, like yeah our energy with his own energy

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,820
Papa John schnatter who probably still calls himself that I don't think it's just I don't think it's schnatter

18
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,100
But I do like her it's it's natter. It's not on schnatter

19
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
schnatter

20
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,860
Papa John schnatter needs a schnatter Papa John need a schnack

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,140
He's still obsessed with Papa John's cuz he's Papa John or was Papa John until they stripped him of his title

22
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:42,500
Papa John the the pizza chain that includes ratty old banana peppers and garlic grease in every pizza

23
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,940
It has always seemed like they just spilled some banana peppers in the box they weren't too lazy to clean it

24
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,260
I can't get these out of here. I can't get these banana peppers out of here. So this dude

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,140
This dude did an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek

26
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,620
And this is the like and I credit to them big ups to Devin Leonard and the whole team over there

27
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,060
because the very first quote of this piece is

28
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,060
If you don't know about Papa John by the way

29
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,220
He was ousted from the company Papa John's that he found it for being an absolute shitbird right in a story

30
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
It was a crucifixion

31
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:27,240
Says John schnatter sure it was unethical. It was immoral. It was evil

32
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,300
Yes, yes folks

33
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,940
They crucified Papa John

34
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:39,540
He calls it an unethical crucifixion as opposed to you know, all those ethical crucifixions going around

35
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,840
All those chill crucifixions that you've read about in your fairy tales

36
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,920
Progressive elite left wouldn't let me say the n-word while I made pepperoni pizza and it was a crucifixion

37
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,060
Okay, the one thing that struck me as soon as I saw the title of the piece of Papa John is still obsessed with Papa John's

38
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,240
That's the one thing about Papa John schnatter that I thought yeah

39
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,320
Yeah, I get that if there was a restaurant out there that I started called Travis McElroy's and then

40
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,060
Kicked me out. I'd still think of Travis McElroy's from time to time

41
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,580
Yeah, would you refer to yourself as being unethically crucified? No, no

42
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,420
I think maybe I might say like I was justifiably crucified. I get it. Yeah. Yeah

43
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,900
Absolutely, he blames it on the upper elite left progressive and I don't know about me being upper elite

44
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,820
but I'm certainly a left progressive and I have fucked around with Papa John's pizza and his garlic dip homes from time to time in

45
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,380
My youth not so much these days and even then when I heard the news

46
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,140
The big news about Papa John schnatter saying the bad word on a call and then getting immediately fired

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,660
My response was pretty fucking cool. Yeah

48
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,620
You know, you don't have to be elite or progressive to look at this man and say I'm glad he got it. I

49
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,780
mean

50
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,980
the

51
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,140
This whole thing. So like here's the timeline on this dude in December 2017

52
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:12,460
Papa John was complaining that their shareholders were being harmed by the NFL because they didn't punish black players for protesting racism

53
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah, immediately after that. He was like, okay. Well, I have thought about it and I'm retiring as the CEO

54
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,420
And you would think that might be the end of it, but nope just here

55
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,300
Just a year later

56
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,420
Sorry, seven months. He word leaked about the the fact that he had used a

57
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,060
Racial slur pretty much on one of the real bumming. They're all pretty bad. But he is the n-word

58
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,740
He said on a conference call bad bad job

59
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,220
there

60
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,100
John and he had to leave as the CEO of the chairman. Yeah, and

61
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
This was on a call

62
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,820
Their ad agency had been working with Papa John on a strategy to counter the perception that he's racist

63
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:07,980
you know that I've never had to do and Steve Buscemi has never had to do and Tom Hanks has never had to do and

64
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,700
Roman Morris has never had to do and you know, I can name almost anybody

65
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,460
There's never had to come up with a PR strategy to counter the perception that we're racist

66
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,820
And then and then during said strategy session during such a session

67
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,620
This is quite efforts. I wish I hadn't said the word

68
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,320
Okay, cool. He had been attributing it to someone else during the call. Okay

69
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,620
and they and he says he accuses the ad agency people of

70
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,280
craftily

71
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,800
Provoking him into doing so. Mmm. Yes

72
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,160
There are different machinations finally tricked me into saying the n-word

73
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,480
Yes

74
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,720
the people that you were paying to make you look good whose job it was to make you look good and they were getting a lot

75
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,200
Of money from you to do so wanted to make you look bad. He came after a colonel Sanders

76
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Saying like he was racist

77
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,280
Yeah, but us in the same camp and it's like I mean probably his grandkids say no

78
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,920
He wasn't he was great

79
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,760
But you know in the in the big fast-food industry who can tell but he was like so what colonel Sanders did is worse

80
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Come in back, baby Papa John

81
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,920
Parallels, here's an interesting one from Jonathan Mays editor-in-chief of the trade magazine restaurant business

82
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,160
Who said the crisis was comparable to the one subway faced in 2015 when Jared Fogel its chief

83
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,880
Smokesperson pleaded guilty to just receiving and distributing child pornography and to engaging in commercial sex with minors

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,920
Yet there was a difference. There's a slight difference with those

85
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,500
Fogel thing came down subway could dismiss him

86
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,960
Yes, try to start fixing things and and frankly the name of the restaurant wasn't Jared the Fogel place Fogel

87
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,880
Yeah

88
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,720
Jared's kids club. It's not it's not that it's not that it's not about Jared and Jared's different things

89
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,800
just a quick reminder to

90
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,040
regarding

91
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,840
Mr. Papa is that I during all of this and him talk about his let me check. Yes crucifixion

92
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,040
He did also drop a tick-tock a video in which he took people on a tour of his giant

93
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:22,120
Mansion, yeah, they involved what appears to be like a 12 foot tall statue of two Eagles fucking in flight

94
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,720
This is brand now his brand is opulence. Yeah, right

95
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,200
That's his brand now is the opulence of Papa John. Is he going to commission?

96
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,660
Commission an 18 foot tall painting of him as the Christ

97
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,360
upon the cross with garlic dip dripping out of his as Shaq looks on as Shaq looks on

98
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
This to me Shaq you betray you are my protege Shaq and now

99
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,200
They so they had to remove his face from pizza boxes. Yeah scrub

100
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,320
Scrub all references to him from its website

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,680
Pictures of Schnatter on the walls of its Louisville headquarters had to go to yeah last September Papa John's

102
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,440
Last September Papa John's announced it was relocating many corporate functions to Atlanta physically distancing itself from its namesake

103
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,880
Do you know how wild things have to be for them to be like we have to move away from Papa John

104
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,480
I can still smell him. He's must be in the air. He still drives by every day

105
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
It's real slow and creepy too I hate it

106
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,640
He got half a billion dollars in stock when he cat when he cashed out you could start another pizza chain

107
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,600
You could start another pizza chain John if you really want to win us over. I

108
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Mean no, there is no way no

109
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,040
Okay, better pizza better pizza does not forgive your mini trespasses John

110
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,580
Better pizza better ingredients still races still Papa John's too

111
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,560
Can we just talk about just for a minute just for a minute? Everyone just for a minute. There's definitely been a

112
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,880
a conversation that went nowhere within

113
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,480
Papa John's HQ where they were like should we change our name and they're like no

114
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,520
he's just changed his name and like because this has been going on for a while and Papa John's the

115
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
corporate entity has

116
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:24,160
Definitely made the conscious decision at some point to continue to be Papa John's and at first

117
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,800
there's one of two ways I feel about this either that's like why are you still or

118
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,320
It's really really spiteful towards John Schnatter to be like

119
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,480
We're still Papa John's. We're Papa John. You're not Papa John

120
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,880
Here's a here's a here's a call. God. We have so many quotes about this gentle this guy

121
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,400
He just don't stop and this is actually I think it's like actually very instructive in your life

122
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,460
You may feel like your goal is to have so much money that you never have to think about money again

123
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,300
I think that's a it's a very American idea, right? But John Schnatter is like

124
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,660
Definitely proof that you can have as much money as you want and you might still be mad that someone says you can't be

125
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,280
A pizza anymore, right? What's that? He can't be this is what he said to OA and in this is a bunch of

126
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,700
It's one of the oh, that's the one America News Network does it? Yeah, that's just the one America News Network

127
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
the woke

128
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,860
It's already bad

129
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:30,700
Mob doesn't want you to have children's books. What as displayed by the cancellation of dr. Seuss earlier this year

130
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
I don't think that's what that meant now

131
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,780
They're apparently coming for your pizza. No dog

132
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:45,460
So much better pizza my friend and better ingredients. I would argue that Papa John's came for your pizza. Mr

133
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,020
Schnatter, yeah, we came for your pizza. You you don't have the pizza anymore. We saw her over here

134
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,740
Enjoy more macaroni and cheese and no one's out there on the fucking Ides of March stabbing little Caesars

135
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,920
Everybody's like yeah, the hot and ready sucks, but it's $5. Go for it. It's fine during your tenure

136
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,060
Jonathan your shit got overtaken by fucking

137
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:14,380
Dominoes. Yeah, how does that feel Jonathan Domino's got better than Papa John's you've lost your way sir

138
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,540
You have a statue of eagles. You don't know what people want in pizza. When was the last time?

139
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,180
John you ate a pizza and didn't do a racist

140
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,060
I mean I ate 800 of his own pizzas in what four months or something. That was famously

141
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,900
Famously reported. Yeah, that's a lot of pizza. This is really good

142
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,380
He's kept the this article talks about how he's cashed out the half billion in stock and he's like just out here

143
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,260
It says he's out there jetting in his Dassault Falcon between homes in Kentucky, Florida and Utah

144
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,420
Posting highlights and motivational bromides on tick-tock. He's protecting his best life

145
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,540
Except his best life is the one he no longer has the one where he's still running Papa John's. Yeah

146
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,820
Devastating his fucking black suits and his dyed jet black hair like he's fucking Johnny trash

147
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,300
I just want to point out this this motherfucker has

148
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,140
500 million dollars and three homes

149
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:20,180
It sounds like and a jet to take him betwixt them and he's still complaining. It's about legacy Travis

150
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
It's about legacy. You should know legacy

151
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,020
Wait, why should I know that most of all Griffin? This shows our this shows our legacy it is

152
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,620
Oh, man, we should start taking a little bit more seriously

153
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,900
Well, yeah a good name for the Papa Joe and we will move on eventually folks. Don't worry

154
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,020
This is not a grandpa situation if we did have to rename the Papa John's restaurant

155
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,100
Yeah

156
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,540
My mind went to Papa Pizza. Papa Pizza is pretty good. And then it went to Mama Mia. Papa Pizza come

157
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Come and get some diarrhea, which is

158
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,020
What about pop-pop John's pop-pop or just pop-pops

159
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,980
About Papa Papa Roni and then you only serve pepperoni pizzas

160
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Roni pizza for dogs

161
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,660
Oh

162
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
We're getting a little too. That's like yeah

163
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,340
You know what? I say lean into it just called Papa Shax just oh

164
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,580
The new thing Papa Shax would be who'd be good

165
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,280
I would eat and we truly powerful and and also the most powerful fart in the face

166
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,780
One could deliver to Papa John's would be to keep the Papa part and just change the John part

167
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:38,220
Yeah, it's like no, this is Papa Shax. He's my new dad. This is my new pizza dad Papa Shax. I love him

168
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,020
He lets me do whatever I want

169
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:47,820
He makes me very happy Papa Shax. This is a I'm just continuing to he

170
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,920
Originally when people were reporting about him trivializing the protests of black players in the NFL

171
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,060
His their PR firm at the time Edelman said that he needed to

172
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,280
Not acknowledge it and keep quiet and let it blow over

173
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Y'all are in denial. Shall

174
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,780
Schnatter remembers replied. I'm Papa John. This is not going to blow over

175
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Enduring credit

176
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,460
In this regard

177
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,980
He was correct. Yeah real Nostradamus that guy he was right about that

178
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,180
Correct. Good job. Maybe not right in the way. He thought he was right

179
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,060
Right. He was correct. His thoughts were wrong

180
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,900
But his truth in that matter was was kind of on point

181
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:42,060
It did not blow over even a little bit as evidenced by the fact that we've been talking about this gentleman for 15 minutes

182
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
It's real piece of shit

183
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:51,980
All right, let's let's let's start I can't I could actually talk about Papa John all day because I it's just like he's our nemesis

184
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,580
But the problem is and this is the real problem is it's making me hungry for Papa

185
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,620
Sucks. It's really infuriating. I would love one of those

186
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,540
Find a local place a local Papa John's no

187
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,900
Although now that he's cashed out it doesn't mean nothing you can

188
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,220
Now with confidence my local Papa John's

189
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:25,980
They're the sign they have outside has not changed to update with specials for 18 months

190
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,860
It has said independently own. Yep

191
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,260
That's the only thing I need to know. Yeah, I just give me a to give me a double chacarroni

192
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,740
All right, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do the show. Please. I

193
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,820
Can't we'll do the show. It's an advice show folks. What folks? This is an advice show

194
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,860
It is and Justin doesn't have the question list. No, I'm pulling it up

195
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,500
I get so many emails anymore. I feel like yeah, but the show doesn't sneak up on you

196
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,860
I feel like Google's letting a lot of space busy read what I'm getting the same thing

197
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,340
Very you're getting a lot of spam on Google, right? Yeah, it's wild. It's wild. Come on Google. I

198
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,980
Was going through the drive-thru of fast food. Oh my shit. Wait. Hey Justin what happy birthday

199
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,300
What? Oh, yeah. Oh my god. Happy birthday. Oh, man

200
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,180
We could have talked about that for the intro, but John stole that from us John my birthday

201
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,800
I think we can all agree. This is the worst thing he's ever done

202
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,260
I was just going it's it's oh, it's just nice to have one that you know, you know what I mean?

203
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,660
Yeah, you're not gonna get the rug pulled out from under you

204
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,700
Right, like when you find out Guy Fieri is secretly a pretty good dude

205
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,260
I'm not gonna get the rope pulled out from under me, right? Yeah, and this one we're not getting any tweets

206
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,100
Like I think you guys were kind of unfair too hard on Papa John. No, he sucks

207
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Guy fear I'd love to have you on the show

208
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,180
Please if you're there, I'd love to hear there. I was just going through the drive-thru of a fast-food chain restaurant

209
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,780
Just say shacks place. Yeah, where I ordered and received an ice cream code. Okay, that's not shacks

210
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,900
It is to my delight very tall and yummy

211
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,540
However, as I was pulling out of the drive-thru, I got a little fender bender on another car

212
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:17,060
I need to get out a car or call the police at exchange insurance details, but I'm holding this ice cream code

213
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:26,460
So fucking awesome should I just keep licking my ice cream cone while I speak with the person I just rear-end it

214
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Should I stay in my car until after

215
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,380
They don't say this but presumably should I write an email to you guys

216
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,500
Okay, I'm sure this already happened and there they want to check to see if they did the right right this is extremely awkward

217
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,660
But I don't want to miss out on my ice cream code. It's delicious

218
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,520
Wait, hello, that's from awkward ice cream in Atlanta. So maybe there's a varsity maybe

219
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:03,300
What is amazing about this is that there's a secret third option, right one and two is you stay in your car just fucking

220
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,740
Cold staring at this person while you lick your ice cream. He'd given them like one minute one minute, please

221
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:18,660
It's creamy and sweet, so I'll be out in a minute or you hop out there you're like, oh my god, I'm so so sorry

222
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,540
Oh gosh, yeah, I just actually got this

223
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Repainted. Oh god. Okay. I'm so the third option is you step out of the car really concerned

224
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,140
And you look at the damage to your car and look at their car and then they walk up and like hey, are you okay?

225
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,500
and you

226
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,460
Take your ice cream cone and realizing that there's no good way to eat it while talking

227
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,300
You throw it to the fucking ground and smash it so that it's not in the way anymore

228
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,780
that's even that might be the worst of the situation if you do that though, you could be like

229
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,340
Maybe we shouldn't involve insurance in this because we've both lost a lot, right?

230
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,060
Yeah, sure. We both like we've both suffered. Yeah

231
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,540
Oh, the back of your car is fucked up in the front of my car is fucked up

232
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,220
But I also lost an ice cream cone in the exchange. So who's the fourth option?

233
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,580
Oh, wow, they get out of the car you direct eye contact

234
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,820
Eat the ice cream cone in like one big bite and keep a straight face

235
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,900
Maintain icon no brain freeze face. Nothing. This is an intimidation play you've engaged in

236
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,840
They're going to watch you how how how like you're gonna Pac-man that ice cream and then say

237
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,100
Do we really need to get insurance involved, right?

238
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:34,320
Just an asterisk asterisk on that option. It is only possible for Travis and Travis like

239
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,580
Humans to pull that one off. I've been training right all my life for this

240
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,500
Could you fifth option step out of the car and be like, oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. I really fucked up

241
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,640
Here you go, and you give them the ice cream

242
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,020
And then you get your you get your drive away. Yep. We're good

243
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,740
Just stop stop stop stop come back here. No, no, I gave you the ice cream cone. We're good. Bye

244
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,980
Did you not want the ice cream cones? I'll take it back

245
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,940
But I do want it on the record that I was willing to give it to you

246
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:13,460
Sixth option. Holy shit. There's so many before they see you after the big accident smash that ice cream cone on your face

247
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:20,460
You walk outside and you gotta be crying covering your creamy face and you're like ice creams

248
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,940
And they will not they'll be like don't okay, you're crying. Don't worry about it. Let's just drive

249
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,100
Let's can we're saying you poor seventh option around seven

250
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,620
Yeah

251
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,800
quickly before they see you scoot over to the passenger seat and put the ice cream cone in the driver's seat and make it look

252
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Like it's the ice cream's fault

253
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,400
What he was you didn't see him stop

254
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Sorry about this eighth option

255
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,460
Do what Travis said but instead of putting the ice cream cone in the driver's seat

256
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,180
Smash it on the windshield in front of the driver's seat and just start screaming inconsolably

257
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,660
Is the ice cream cone your dad it was in fact my dad

258
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,540
He was my dad

259
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,380
I'm in one of those movies where my dad dies and then becomes an inanimate object

260
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,740
But it's now animate and it was that ice cream. Go to do is delicious not ninth option

261
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,220
Can you just slowly hand it to them and say here? I'm really sorry

262
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,500
I got this for you cuz I figured I would probably hit you and I'm sorry. Yeah, this is for you

263
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,140
Oh, I got like a prank show now. We're square

264
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,820
I wasn't gonna get anything at this Dairy Queen, but then I saw you in front of me

265
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,020
And I was like, I'm gonna ram that fucking idiot. So I bought you the ice cream cone in

266
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,220
Good conversation starter cuz I wanted to meet you and maybe I got us two spoons

267
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,300
Let's do this. You hit me really hard. Yeah. Yeah, it's a new car. I was excited getting used to yeah

268
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,740
Hey, are you feeling this you feel this vibe vibing, right?

269
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,140
Sharing an ice cream. Hey, hey officer. Does it seem like we're vibing the two of us

270
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:03,260
These handcuffs so that I can hold their hand, please. Wait. No, just watch the ice cream, please. Please please you do

271
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,180
Please do not finish it until the police arrive. Yeah, they have to see you. Yeah

272
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:16,260
Yeah, they know you're not intimidating admittedly that if you're still eating ice cream when they arrive that might remove any doubt of whose fault

273
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,780
This was yes, right if one person is just like well, sorry, I can't put this thing down

274
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,100
Sorry, I was very clearly driving one-handed. No question

275
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,380
Actually, if you look down you'll see my special necklace that holds the ice cream cone for me so I can eat

276
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Is prescription?

277
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,660
Necklace, thank you

278
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,080
Hey, can I do a quick wizard? Yeah, we visit the quick wizard

279
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,020
He's the wizard of the clouds brother, but he's much faster, but not the wizard

280
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
That sounds like something Travis would do. Yeah, of course

281
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,580
Okay, this one's coming in a little bit late

282
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,780
But you know lock it's good to learn this shit and remember it for one year because this one's about how to avoid taking off

283
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
The actors in a haunted house. Oh

284
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,460
I actually have inside and I've worked many a haunted house and I don't want to hear any of it

285
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,140
Cuz you don't hear about when I fell asleep in a coffin. No, no, I only want to hear what the wizard has to say

286
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,820
I love you Travis, but you are not the wizard or the quick wizard

287
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,040
I got by a child once we know all the stories you've told all the stories

288
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,760
It's time for the wizard to share his insights. This was sent in by Laura. Thank you, Laura

289
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,260
Step one going through the house, but avoid pretending not to be afraid if you don't want to be targeted

290
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,220
What acting tough or saying I'm not quintuple negative

291
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,780
I know acting tough for saying I'm not scared indicates to the actors that you actually are which will likely try

292
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,380
They will likely try even harder to frighten you or and this is a phrase they use a lot in this article pick on you

293
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,300
Yeah, now what's great too is the the opposite is true if you walk through the house going like

294
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:54,020
Then the actors are like look at that brave right so brave you can't show strength or weakness

295
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,180
Some they they the quotes that they use here is what not to say at a haunted house

296
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,300
Are they even trying to make this scary that blood is obviously fake if I worked at a haunted house

297
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,420
And I heard someone are they even trying to make this scary?

298
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,980
I would jump out at that person be like I'm gonna fucking kill you Greg just to boost it up way too far way too far

299
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,060
Yeah, do not kill you and everyone you love right? Yeah, you'll go a little too fast walk in the middle of your group

300
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,060
So the friends get scared first as a diagram. They've showed a

301
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:29,140
Five on like a six-sided die and pointed at the middle dot and it says you so that's good

302
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,820
If someone's hard, that's hard to or you need to practice that out in the parking lot first

303
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,940
Yeah, like you can't start doing that once you're in the house. Yeah, kind of kind of fucked up

304
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:46,460
If you're like, oh here comes a mummy with Dracula teeth get them Tommy and you push towards them if you have four

305
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,140
Big brave friends. I get it. You know, yeah, you're kind of the Scooby-doo of the group

306
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:59,980
Yeah, I get it. They could be like get away from Ralphie. He's really scared right now. He's going through a rough time in his job

307
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,900
Cheer him up

308
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Refrain from scaring other house goers

309
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:12,260
Which frustrates the actors that sucks boo Tommy got you and chainsaw man's like you fucking stepped on my line

310
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
My line was blue. I got you

311
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,620
shit

312
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,980
Pretend not to see an impending scare. So you don't annoy the actors that that would be the worst

313
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,180
That would be the worst. You're just up like a mummy with Dracula fangs and someone points like here comes a mummy with Dracula fangs

314
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:32,060
I've been scared at all about this now, but you can then give some constructive criticism

315
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,660
Yeah, like after everyone else has walked up like hey mummy with the vampire fangs. I could see you ahead of time

316
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,900
So you might want to just take like one quick step back. Oh, yeah right there. That's great

317
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:48,320
Oh, yeah, and maybe stop saying with your regular voice here comes a mummy with vampire fangs because it really gives away

318
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,140
The scare a little bit. Let me recommend

319
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:57,160
Let me recommend there's no mummy with vampire fangs over here and that will hold them into a false sense of security

320
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,300
So the next one is move at a quick pace. So the actors have less time to prepare scare

321
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,860
I love this you're at the front door

322
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:08,180
The ticket taker is like prepare to enter the house of a million mummies with vampire fangs. You're like, haha. See you soon

323
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,320
Just fucking full-blown sprint

324
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,780
Slow down

325
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,420
Hey careful, man, there's steps. There's steps in here

326
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,420
Interacting with the actors avoid asking the actors not to scare you don't scare me mummy with vampire

327
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,900
Wait, why not it says here in like a sub note which should be a main note

328
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,700
Keep in mind that usually if an actor notices someone is genuinely upset or very frightened. They'll back off

329
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,900
I don't know why they don't say that in like the first step of just like act

330
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,160
Genuinely pretty fucked up like you're having a real episode right now

331
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,400
From experience a group and I know you don't want to hear this but

332
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,300
It can often be just a little note from me a former haunted house actor

333
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,220
Just as scary if a terrifying scarecrow tries to comfort you

334
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:08,140
Because the the difference between scaring and comforting when you're in a scary scarecrow mask, it's a pretty thin line

335
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,660
Yeah, that's great

336
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,780
Not it does it just just don't

337
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,860
Don't push them. Yeah, don't try to scare the actors. I think though if you do if you are

338
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,540
The you know a vampire mummy and yeah a house goer comes up on you and is like boom

339
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,420
I'm the scary one and you get scared. You have to quit. Yeah, you have to actually switch places

340
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,020
That's the only way to be free from working on a haunted house. Let's jump over to dressing appropriately. Awesome

341
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,660
We're dark colored clothes

342
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,260
Oh, that's annoying. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, don't do that. No, it says do do that

343
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,420
We're dark colored clothes so that you're harder to see that's awesome

344
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,180
If I do you hiding from the people that are trying to scare. Why did you go? Why did you go?

345
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
Why did you stay home?

346
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,780
Trying to look brave for a partner or potential partner

347
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,860
We've all been there you got a crush and you want to scare the mummy vampire before it can scare you

348
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,740
So then your crush is like damn I want an engaging consensual goings-ons with this person, right?

349
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,260
Okay, these next two tips are I don't want to blow it out of proportion, but some real fucking all-timers

350
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,420
Okay, cover up with a long-sleeve shirt and pants to hide your goosebumps

351
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,420
Yeah

352
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,740
Yeah

353
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,060
You get goosebumps goosebumps when you're scared

354
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,120
So those tiny dots all over your arms and legs are a dead giveaway to actors how?

355
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,840
Brightly lit is this fucking hot house. Even if excuse me

356
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,940
I don't mean to be rude, but I can see your fear. It's are you okay? Do you need a glass of water?

357
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,700
I feel like if somebody's like I see your goosebumps

358
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,940
You should be allowed to like light a flare in that room and call timeout timeout

359
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,220
This guy's really fucking creepy in a real non haunted way

360
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:15,460
And then the next one which is also very good choose a large puffy coat to look more intimidating

361
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,460
Hell yes. Yeah get that starter jacket my dude. Yeah blue. I'm going to get oh shit. You're huge. Good bye

362
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Wave your arms in the air

363
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,940
Yeah, I don't know if you saw this guy while we were you know hiding and being spooky vampire mummies

364
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,940
This one dude came in and I was like, I'm gonna fucking get him

365
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:40,260
But then I saw the side the size of this lad this absolute unit. I was like, I can't he might hurt

366
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,940
In fact, he should play football. I'm thinking about like

367
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,580
Managing him to try to get him into a pro baller career his head hands legs and feet all look pretty small

368
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,780
But this dude's core was a gargantuan

369
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,460
And then finally leave the masks at home. I don't it's like Disney World rules

370
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:06,020
you can't show up being a you know, being a a chainsaw, you know, mommy and

371
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,340
Then if somebody comes in and it's like also a chainsaw mommy, that would be confusing

372
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,940
Mm-hmm. I once scared the shit out of Jonah Hill. I just wanted to throw that out. Just doesn't seem particularly difficult

373
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:22,060
Yeah, he's from his films. He seems like he's jumpy. He would be all skittish. Yeah some Q&A

374
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,100
What if I already did one of these things? Oh, you're going to jail try to avoid doing it again

375
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,740
Honestly, the actors will probably understand if you slip up and do something silly look push punch kick. Oh, it's okay

376
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,820
This is your first time first time. It's my fault. I'm a pretty scary vampire mummy

377
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,220
I get why your instinct would be to hit me. And honestly, I saw your goosebumps and got a little overeager

378
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,140
So, um, it's it we both can share the blame. And hey, here's another important haunted house fact

379
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,740
One out of every hundred vampire mummies is a real vampire

380
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,580
Mummy, so like I understand like it's not wanting to push and hit someone who is attacking you

381
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:07,180
Not a bad impulse in any other circumstance. Yeah, I'm sorry guys. There's so many good Q&A's in here

382
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,820
What do I do if you have medication but no medicines or prescriptions are allowed in the house?

383
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,340
What welcome to the house of a billion murders no medicine

384
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Is that an inhaler?

385
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,340
Put it in the bucket

386
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:29,540
Put it in the bucket. Can I get it back at the end? No, one of our chainsaw mummies is very allergic to medicine

387
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:38,460
One of the scariest things we can think of is a disbelief in science leave your medicine at the door medicine at home

388
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,000
This is an awesome one to the actors like to scare homosexual people

389
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,360
Huh? Whoa again back room after a hard day of scaring. Somebody's like, yeah, I saw his goosebumps. You know what that means

390
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Hey, hey, Bobby, how many do you get today?

391
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,800
How many at least 12 at least 12 of them 12 and a half cuz one of them was bisexual

392
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,460
So yeah, one what if an actor knows me and breaks character to stop and chat for a bit?

393
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,480
Oh shit Daryl, what's up, bud?

394
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,960
What? Think how cool that would look to your crush if your crush is like, huh Daryl knows vampire mummy

395
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,760
Ooh la la he's really connected. Another cool one. What if someone scares me get the fuck out of the

396
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Don't go in the fucking building

397
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Can't get over the medicine

398
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,400
We feed all the pills we get to the creature with a black look

399
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:41,280
He just gobbles up any pill he sees right and you slip into one of the zombies but the zombies for texture for their makeup

400
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,520
Was using peanut butter. Where's my epipen? You couldn't bring it in. No, I'm dying

401
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,200
I know that's the ultimate spooky scare

402
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,120
Pretty scary. Admit you're scared. We'll use your skeleton for the haunted house. Thank you very much

403
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,720
Thank you. That's where skeletons come from. Where else are you supposed to get them? Just lock that in for one year folks

404
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,400
Yep, sorry that it's a week late. Yeah, let's Travis everyone. I'm sure you'll remember everyone at home bless Travis

405
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,040
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And also with you

406
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,560
Let's take a quick break and we'll head on over the money zone

407
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,760
Can't tell you guys before we start the money zone

408
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,240
um after last week's episode I

409
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,880
Realized that I had to at least for a while leave the website. I had built bad

410
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,800
Because if I fixed it after the episode Thursday, and then people went to look at it Monday, and it was really good

411
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,240
Yeah, and people would be like what are Justin and Griffin talking about this one? So it's great

412
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,520
So you guys are welcome. I left it up so that you guys wouldn't look like assholes. Yeah

413
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,300
Hey, can I talk about pretty much the only kind of socks I own?

414
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Yeah, yeah

415
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,080
That's a bad setup because that sounds like it's gonna be pretty boring

416
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,800
Like if anybody else came up to you on the street and was like, let me tell you about all the socks I own

417
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,200
Let me start. It's pretty much just socks from the closed down trampoline park. Yes

418
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,840
That's pretty much all I wear. Yeah, sometimes I know those trampolines

419
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,140
They static them up and they just shoot right up into the air

420
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,120
But no

421
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,320
I want to talk about Bombas because Bombas his mission is simple make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal

422
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,640
Item donated this holiday when you give Bombas to someone on your list. You're also giving them to someone in need

423
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,100
It's a give-give. I just want to throw out. Hey Bombas if you're listening, that's a great mission

424
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,220
It's a wonderful mission and I feel like you've done a lot to achieve it

425
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,660
And now I think you should add like a second part to the mission. Yeah, it's like do that and also

426
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,820
We're gonna find life on other planets or something. Whatever you want it to be

427
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,100
You've got the first thing on lock like it's right now dream bigger Bombas isn't just socks anymore

428
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:54,820
By the way guys it's shirts and underwear too and they designed all of it socks shirts and underwear to be the clothes

429
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:00,260
You can't wait to put on every day. Everything they make is soft seamless tagless and has a luxuriously cozy feel

430
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,780
I've been wearing these Bombas like I forget the name of them. They're not like no show

431
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,080
They're just like the step above that because I'm not that brave

432
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,840
Little show little show and I not not a joke pretty much all I wear is these Bombas socks

433
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:21,380
Uh, they are cozy, but mostly like they fit so fucking right that it's I have that problem

434
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,300
It sucks too big doesn't feel good socks too small. I hate it. Bombas is just right

435
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,420
They make for great gifts. I have genuinely given Bombas as gifts before

436
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,060
Because you know, they're really they're really good and everybody really likes them

437
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,040
Hey promise another idea if you're listening because it's starting to get a little chillier now. What about socks, right?

438
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah for your hands and they even have little places for like your fingers to go

439
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no because that would make them just like everybody else

440
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,520
They're just socks that go right on your hands

441
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,600
What about socks that already have the puppet faces on them? That's awesome, too

448
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,720
You know this thought and you have the thought you can immediately picture a timeframe and that's when you're like

449
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,560
I got to wash the sheets. When I wash the sheets though, you know what I did?

450
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,880
Did I get a different pair of sheets from the from the closet? No, sure didn't

451
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,520
I washed my Brooklyn in sheets and then put them back on the bed afterwards. Nothing weird about that.

452
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,380
Are the only, it isn't, they're the only sheets I use. Should I buy a second pair? Probably.

453
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,400
That's what I do when I have my favorite outfit

454
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,480
I just take it off and then I stand a nude in front of the washer

455
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,800
Until that's done and then I stand nude in front of the dryer. How do you know when it's done?

456
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,120
Oh, when the washer's done. Okay. I thought it was just like you had to feel it. They got weighted blankets, cozy robe

I have a very special munch quad for you because it is a

477
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:23,200
So Taco Bell was worried about always worried about people getting enough rest

478
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,360
And so they're trying to make it so that you remember they have breakfast which is I mean if you've ever

479
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,560
Woke up disliking yourself rather than waiting until 2 a.m. To dislike yourself like a sane person

480
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,740
You can go straight to Taco Bell to get the breakfast that you crave

481
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,600
It's just Taco Bell food, but they say that it's for breakfast now. They put eggs in it

482
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,040
You can get

483
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,600
They're doing a lot of stuff to help remind people about it. They've got

484
00:40:52,600 --> 00:41:00,240
On October 21st, this is passed but they offered a a wake-up call. Oh by texting wake up to 1

485
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,680
866 wake up 3 fans can sign up to receive a pre-recorded wake-up call from Taco Bell

486
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,420
To kickstart their morning with a reminder that free toasted breakfast burrito awaits them. That's right. There was a free

487
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,760
Breakfast burrito free toasted breakfast burrito. They also have a sleepwear collection

488
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Wake me up Taco Bell and then they have some Taco Bell slippers to help you like get some sleep

489
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,440
So you wake up early enough to get the Taco Bell. Do you understand? Yeah, I get it

00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,480
Yeah, who do you think recorded that man?

Was it just like the CEO talk about did they get a name to do it couldn't matter less

492
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:38,720
It couldn't Justin if you're telling me if Benedict Cumberbatch could call you and be like Justin

493
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,680
I just want to talk to my baby. It's I remind you that your free toasted burrito is ready for you

494
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:53,320
The most important thing that they did and the thing that brings us here today is and the reason I wanted to bring the tone

495
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,060
down a little bit is that they also released a

496
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Bedtime story for adults to help you go to something like sexy

497
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,320
Yeah, that nice. Wait Travis has a good point. Is it a sexy? It's not sexy

498
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,440
But I am gonna read the entire thing. What makes it at all?

499
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,240
Well, it's it's not for kids. I mean, I don't know. It's just listen

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,040

00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,240
It's called sleep tight get that bite. Oh good. No, it's kind of

502
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,580
Sleep tight get that bite. No author credited

503
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,840
Some nights you just can't close your eyes

504
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:33,600
But a restless night means waking up past sunrise see waking up after breakfast means you've gotten up too late

505
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,600
You can miss your hot and toasty breakfast burrito date. See which we'd hate

506
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:45,480
Staying up late is always rad, but getting shut-eye. That's the new fad. So if you want to snag a toasty breakfast burrito

507

Winding down with a Baja bedtime nightcap forget the sheep. Sorry. I just need to clarify something real quick

511
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,880
Taco Bell, do you think it's a good idea to slam a Baja blast before bed?

512
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,160
Let me check mountain dew Baja blast a very caffeinated

It's a tip that's been staring you right in the eyes and it'll keep you warm and toasty straight through sunrise

Let's try out some auditory bliss. No, wait, go back to the park

00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,840
Taco Bell knows I think about death every night

523
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:05,240
I imagine sizzling bacon while you close your eyes breakfast salsa awaits on the other side and that's all

524
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,360
You heard me

525
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:15,160
Still here. Okay. Well by which we've been alive one last chance time to count some burritos while they dance

526
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,440
Repeat after me like you're back in grade school

527
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,240
Get it because you're acting like a child

528
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,960
Like that's the they got that and they're like it's done

529
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,120
Put it in book one burrito two burrito three burrito four

00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Wipe that sleep from your eyes

534
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,000
Hear your stomach rumbling. It's ready for a surprise

535
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,440

536
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,100
Breakfast is served 7 to 11 a.m

537
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:05,660
Get ready to jet now. Kiss me passionately hard on my taco lips. That's right. The narrator has been

538
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,340
a

539
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,140
Taco this whole time and now we're gonna bang

540
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,100
I really wish uh

541
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,860
I really hadn't heard that. No. No, I'm glad I read the story because it was like cool and

542
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,900
A good poem. It was hard because I fell asleep

543
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:25,260
Yeah, so restful rachel is like a good poet and knows a lot about poetry

544
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,140
I wish I could you know

545
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:31,260
Just sort of bounce bounce that off of her and see if it like would do good in a school of poetry

546
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,180
She'll probably tweet about it

547
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,460
Um, that was the that was a that was an absolute trip

548
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,380
It went into the deep dark corners of my psyche and where there were

549
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,860
voids that

550
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:48,860
My sort of mortal mind couldn't possibly fill they filled it up with salsa and cheese and rice

551
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,980
Yeah, it's better now. It's better in my head calmer now

552
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:59,260
The one thing that's still kind of uh, the one thing that's kind of freaking my bean is I can't decide if an endless

553
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,520
Uh, just like salsa filled plane is supposed to be heaven or hell or purgatory

554
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,260
It's but it's all it's all of all people. Yeah. Yeah

555
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,660
Am I like a chunk in it or am I still travis? Isn't that the question?

556
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:19,820
I mean we can all aspire to that can't wait. Yeah, but now it's just replaced my other existential dread with now just

557
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,940
Literally burning salsa a picante existential. Yeah. Yeah, which is fine. Which is good. That's better

558
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,460
I would rather think about salsa frankly. Sure. Sure. Yeah, um

559
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:36,300
The let's uh, let's ask another question or no. No, I mean we ask and answer the questions here

560
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,300
So we'll do both in one

561
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,020
And yes, I did lose the questions again. Okay, here we go

562
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,660
So I recently moved to a new city with only the contents of my car

563
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,540
And in the course of making friends here, I made some

564
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,180
friends

565
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,420
You know, I do not wink

566
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,900
wink

567
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:01,020
Actually, i'm 40 and I don't know a little you're 41 now justin

568
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,860
Oh, fuck you. Thank you in the context of the conversation. We just had love being reminded

569
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,220
Yeah, i'm a 41 one year closer to salsa

570
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,300
Okay, man, I know one of those

571
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,660
friends told me that they're shopping for a

572
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,180
New mattress that part's not in quotes. That's not a euphemism. Would it be

573
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,900
weird to ask them if they would

574
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,500
Sell me there. I'm just you made it very confusing

575
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,660
Would it be weird to ask them if they would sell me their old mattress? It was very comfortable

576
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,820
That was from sleepless

577
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,540
In chicope. Where's chicope? Why would they know how?

578
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:53,820
Their mattress feels because they're oh because they're uh, winky winky friends wink friends like friends because they booed

579
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,660
You know like um, you know like in they do it in minnesota, which is where chicope is

580
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,020
They they engaged in consensual coitus gets cold gets cold up there. Yeah, so

581
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,060
would it

582
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:14,780
Be oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry now that I understand what friends in quotes means I have a very clear answer, uh, which is

583
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,100
Yes, it's fucking weird

584
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,100
Why is it weird if you go to pork city?

585
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,980
And you're like damn this bed is is that memory foam how much?

586
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:30,060
That's strange. I don't think that's what's happening griffin. It's not like you're not buying it mid mid

587
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,860
That was a great test drive. I'll take it

588
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,860
This is this is when they're like, oh, yeah, i'm gonna buy a new mattress

589
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,580
There's nothing weird about saying like what are you doing with the old one? I need a mattress. Can I buy it?

590
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,340
That that's it's that makes like oh man, it hits

591
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,260
Why?

592
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,500
Thank you. Justin. I gotta clarify. Hold on

593
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,340
Um, okay. Do you know what it is? Yeah, I might be wrong, but i'm trying to figure out in myself why it hits weird

594
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,980
I think

595
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,020
that on some level maybe it could

596
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,540
Feel like

597
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,700
I was very happy in that bed

598
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,340
And that's a treasured time in my life

599
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,480
And I would love to keep that bed as a memento

600
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,180
of the time when I went to

601
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,580
Adult city. Well, yeah. No. Hey definitely don't say it that way

602
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:26,700
No one would say it that way. I said it that way for emphasis on a comedy show, but they're no you don't necessarily I mean

603
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,220
Oh man, it's weird. I don't think it does. I think that this is one of those things where

604
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,940
It like, you know how much skin

605
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,620
Do you know how much skin is in a bed?

606
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:44,460
It's mostly skin and maybe that's the problem. Oh, no. Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen

607
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,980
I'm not saying i'm wild about the idea

608
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:53,500
But if this is your option as far as like affordability goes and it's a comfortable bed

609
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,820
I like what the other things are going to do is throw it away, right like

610
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,700
Okay, let me ask this let me get your gut check on this wait, what is the it also but okay

611
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:10,620
Wait, wait, let me ask you this travis, but I was gonna ask you let me ask you. Okay, doesn't it kind of feel like

612
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,140
Well, why are you getting rid of it like you didn't even start to ask that you know

613
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,820
I mean that would be like oh i'm sorry to hear you broke up with your boyfriend. I need a boyfriend

614
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,300
I'll date him. That is so different and you know, that's not different. It's not different

615
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,620
I don't think that's that different now, but here's what I was going to ask. Does it hit different?

616
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,980
How do you feel of can I buy it versus?

617
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,980
Can I have it?

618
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:41,180
Much worse for the can I have it part? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because then it does sound like uh, i've taken you

619
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,820
And now I will take this as a trophy

620
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,940
That's not what it sounds like at all. Yeah, one thing that I think is bad

621
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,780
If you're having a just sort of like a fun sex time is at the end of it be like can I have this as a trophy?

622
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
That is not what's happening

623
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,860
Travis, I don't know why travis is endorsing that. I don't know either. You shouldn't listen to my brother

624
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:07,900
You shouldn't claim that you two are so socially awkward that can I buy your old mattress has

625
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:14,380
Transitioned in your mind too. I shall take this to remember the time when we parked

626
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:20,620
Can I buy the seat? Can I buy our our pork zone? That's not what it is

627
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,820
Can I buy our sex area?

628
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,380
Yeah, that's so wild

629
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:33,340
So to you to you on some level this person realized it too or they wouldn't have asked the question

630
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,060
If you have to ask if it is weird

631
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,780
It probably could hit weird because it has already hit you a little bit weird

632
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,860
So yes, 100 you're running the risk that the other person will think it's weird

633
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,100
Yes

634
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,700
but

635
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,980
How comfortable is the mattress? Is it worth a little bit of weird?

636
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:57,660
That you're gonna get a discount comfortable mattress and all you had was the stuff in your car

637
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,740
I don't know what you're sleeping on right now

638
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,560
Right, but it might be a little weird, but maybe it's a lot comfortable

639
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,300
I like I like this idea of somebody who has just moved to a new place

640
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:16,860
And rather than buy a mattress, they just decide to make love to different people who already have mattresses

641
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,580
This is there

642
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,060
You could say i've been sleeping around

643
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,860
Wait, you didn't wink. Yeah. No. Yeah. No

644
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,300
I've I meant literally and if any of and listen, hey i'm doing it for the right reasons

645
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,420
But also an additional right reason

646
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:39,340
That uh the bed's comfortable. I'm tired. I'm sleepy. I'm sleepy. I'm sleepy and so I sleep on the mattress

647
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:46,300
Everybody's enjoying it. Hey, i'd love to make love to you tonight, but what about some of that afternoon delight tomorrow?

648
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,700
After a nice long rest

649
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:55,100
Great comfortable bed. Also once we're done. Could I have it as a trophy conquest?

650
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,820
Damn it. I wasn't supposed to say that part out loud

651
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,460
One of my favorite podcasters travis backer said you should try to claim trophies from people

652
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:09,980
That is not what i'm advocating have any of you ever sold a mattress before a used mattress that you have used

653
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,660
No, I I did when I moved to austin

654
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:19,660
uh, I brought a mattress with me for some reason from chicago and then I

655
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,580
Slept on a little bit and I was like, this is not going to do uh anymore

656
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,980
This is a bad bed. And so I was going crazy like anybody want to buy my mattress for cheap

657
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:34,460
And a woman came and explained that she was going through a divorce and needed a needed a mattress for that

658
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,420
And I was like, oh, okay

659
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,980
And she's like have can I take the price off a little bit?

660
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,860
And I was like, yeah, of course

661
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,860
You can have it for a little bit less than I asked

662
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,140
She was like, thanks and as she walked it out of the house, I was like

663
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,300
Enjoy

664
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:52,540
Dummy, i've been riding that bed and putting it down wet for fucking 15 years dog. Are you kidding me?

665
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:59,820
There is so much of me in that bed that you could stick a knife in it and my voice would say ow from the bed

666
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,060
so, uh

667
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,260
Yeah, 100 well spent enjoy

668
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,140
Are you sure?

669
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:15,660
Are you sure? I was a teen in that bed. Are you sure?

670
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:26,860
There are things that matters is a scene that only god knows about and god said bad no bad

671
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,020
