1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:51,760
Times are tough. I mean, you take a look at the stock ticker on the wall and you'll see

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,520
times are tough economically. We're going into a national economic disaster, but here,

7
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,600
like a beam of light, is your Shirley Temple of the modern economic depression. My brother,

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,160
my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. I am your co-brother and sunshine on a

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,200
cloudy day, Justin McElroy. I am Travis McElroy and your animal crackers in your soup. I'm the

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,800
Skittles in your pocket, Griffin McElroy. Guys, my blue chip stocks done turned red.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,880
Yep. I don't, I am insolvent over here. A lot of red ink. Don't know what to do. I've been attacked

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,640
by the bulls and the bears. Yeah. And the, and the pistons and the oilers. Are they still around?

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,320
Oilers? Yeah, sure. Okay, cool. Texans now, right? I just don't, I just, I made a lot of bad

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,080
investments and I don't. Tell me, give me, give me the number one investment that you regret above

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,520
all the others. I mean, a lot of bad investments litter that path to financial ruin. But what would

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,680
you say your number one worst investment was? Books. Why did you think like books? Like what,

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,400
what do you mean? I thought. Put it all on borders. I, I put a lot on borders, but mostly just the

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,000
medium of books is what I invested it in. So like the idea of books. Stock symbol B O K S, which

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,520
looks like box, but you, you know what it means. I, I thought, you know, I thought TV and movies,

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,760
I thought this was just a passing fad. It was, it was a poor choice and I wasn't counting on the

21
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,760
illiteracy epidemic that's ravaging our world. You couldn't have known. How could I have known?

22
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,000
How could you have known? Let's, uh, what I think we should do is to sort of make sure that nothing

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,800
that bad ever happens to anyone again. We should answer questions on our advice show and in doing

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,120
so help them to avoid calamity. What do you think? And maybe convince them to, you know,

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,560
buy a book or two. Hey, maybe pick up a book while you're out today. Maybe buy a bookstore. I don't

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,400
know a lot of money into it. I don't know where you would do that since there aren't any bookstores

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:22,320
left and most libraries are pretty shitty. Um, but, but maybe a yard sale. Most libraries today

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,480
are basically just a bunch of DVDs, like a bunch of bad DVDs that they bought from blockbusters that

29
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,440
were closing. It's like just a bunch of copies of like Canadian bacon and UHF on VHS. I'm sorry,

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,360
did you say bad movies? No, I mean like easy to obtain movies from Amazon, way cheap to get UHF.

31
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Like way cheap. Yeah. And your library, that's all your library has anymore. Is UHF and Canadian

32
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,600
bacon and strange. She's out, she's out of control. Love potion number nine. Yeah, exactly. Is UHF in

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,880
the biography section? Cause that is basically the story of weird Al. It's a true life story.

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,200
Um, Hey, my software year, I asked out a girl as you can guess, she said no. Okay. What? Why would

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,400
I guess that? I know nothing about you. She, I guess like is the, is the assumption that I,

36
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,360
since I'm writing to you and I listened to your show, she said no. She said, yes, things are great.

37
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,200
Don't know why I wrote you. How can I stop being so happy all the time and in love? She also said,

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,440
I really like you, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend right now, but we are going into our

39
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,000
senior year and she's still the only girl I really like. So my questions are these when she said that

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
she really likes me, but doesn't want a boyfriend. Was that just her telling me that she doesn't like

41
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,800
me at all? Let's start here. Yes. Yes. And do you have any advice on how to get over a girl?

42
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,720
Because this is just starting to get sad on my part. Any help is appreciated brothers. That's

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,800
from infatuated in Florida. The line I, I really like you, but I'm not looking for a boyfriend

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,720
slash girlfriend right now is like textbook high school, letting them down easy. Everybody is

45
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
always looking for a boyfriend and girlfriend. Just wait till you get in college and you get

46
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,760
that line. And then like a week later, that person is dating someone like that'll happen

47
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,800
three or four times. And eventually you get the message. I'm cool. I'm cool being lonely. Um,

48
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,720
I don't actually want my counterpart on this earth. I don't want my soul to join with another's.

49
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm looking to wander like that dude on Kung Fu, just kind of going,

50
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,400
going around doing stuff by myself, mostly by myself. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I mean,

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,320
yes, she's not, she's just not that into you. Now, how do you get over her? That's the question.

52
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,320
My, my recipe, my, my tincture, my, my pulses for this sort of thing is time.

53
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:01,920
And imagine her, um, on the bathroom, making a bathroom. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Why?

54
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,200
Why would you do that? Well, if he imagines her making bathroom, then it will ruin the, uh,

55
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,960
construct of fantasy that he has built for her. It'll tear down the statue of sexiness. Right now

56
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,320
he's put it up on a sexy pedestal and he needs to put her on a porcelain pedestal. Exactly. He needs

57
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,200
to put her on a porta potty. Literally set her on top of a porta potty. Right. Um, if you imagine

58
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:35,200
her in the bathroom, that helps unless you're dirty. If you start to feel an inkling and inkling

59
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,640
you back out of that fantasy as fast as you can. An inkle of it, of a tingle. You bounce from that

60
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,800
thought. Bounce from it. Slam it in reverse and you run back out of there. I need you to tie a

61
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,800
rope around your waist and leave, leave the slack with a trusted friend as you dip in. If I pull

62
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,360
twice, you get me out of that shit. This is Inception 2. This is Inception 2 poopy spelunking

63
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,040
and I'm going down in this incepted fantasy. And listen, if I yank on this, you pull back.

64
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,600
I don't care how much I protest. And if I yank on this, you kill me. You kill me. Um, here's the

65
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,080
thing though, cause you said time and I think that's absolutely true, but here's what most

66
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,200
people fail to take into consideration with time. So this was his sophomore year. This is his senior

67
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,880
year. So let's say a year, year and a half since then, uh, going on two years. Time doesn't work if

68
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,160
you're still thinking about it two years later. It has to be, I've made the decision to let this go.

69
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,320
Now time will help. Not, it's been two years. Why can't I let this go? You need a catalyst

70
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,360
to kick that kind of thing off, right? You can't just like, so you need, you need, you need an

71
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:53,120
event to kick off that decision. And I think that because you live in Florida, that there's a lot of

72
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:01,200
options open to you, like a, like a weekend trip to Miami, you want me to drown yourself and fly

73
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,640
honeys because that's all, pretty much all they have. If Will Smith is to be believed and his,

74
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,160
his word is, has always been unimpeachable and serial killers. Yeah. Serial killers.

75
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Is there a serial killer down there? Dexter's there, but he kills serial killers, so you're

76
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,080
probably fine. So it's probably per capita better for serial killers because he's really cleaning

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,040
it, cleaning up the streets down there. We've got to get down to me and me. I know it's popping off

78
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,240
and, uh, every day, I think as long as you're not serial killing, it's dope. I think serial

79
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,800
killers are probably starting spreading the word now that you shouldn't go down there.

80
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,400
There's a dark passenger, a vigilante, if you will. Hey, my brother, my brother and me in a few weeks,

81
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,480
I'll be returning to school and I'm going to start training as a resident assistant.

82
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:54,560
Do you have any advice for me? Important in Ithaca. Did any of us live in on campus housing?

83
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,320
I did. You lived in a dorm? Yes, I did for two years. So you're the only one I think who got

84
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:08,320
into shenanigans, uh, on a, on a school. So what, what bad, what, what bad things did you do that

85
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,920
they can stop other people from doing? Oh God, really? Um, well, I don't know if it's bad,

86
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,560
but my favorite thing we did is we had this one kid, um, that we just terrorized and,

87
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,040
but in a friendly way. Well, so like he would, well, he would leave town and we would convert

88
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,360
his bed into a castle or, uh, he left town and we converted his bed into a time machine.

89
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,320
These pranks actually sound like awesome things that you're doing for him. Yeah. Well, but yes,

90
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,120
it basically consisted of taking his room apart with a drill and rebuilding it in, in our chosen

91
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,800
image. Um, and so basically like, what is your tip here? If you hear people using drills. If you

92
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,320
see them making a time machine, then cut, cut that out. Yeah. Well, I guess it's the question

93
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,120
how to be a better RA or how to be a better light RA. What's the, yeah. I mean, do you want to be

94
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,400
cool? Are you cool, man? Are you cool with drugs? Are you cool with partying and, and like,

95
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,280
kiss like kissing after hours? You need to make some decisions about what kind of parent you're

96
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,640
going to be. Do you want to be firm? Do you want to be nice daddy that they come to when they need

97
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,280
something? Do you want to run the place, um, with a totalitarian fist? Like that's what I,

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,680
that's what I'm feeling. That's what I'd be. I think the best RA is the one where like,

99
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,480
you can't see their subtle influence. Like if they know that you're controlling them,

100
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,360
then you've gone too far. I think you need to be there, but pretty much fade in the background.

101
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,400
You're not going to be friends with these people. I'm talking about, I would be like a Stalin-esque

102
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:52,640
figure. Like no, no pasta, no pasta in the dorms. You lock the doors at 11. If they show up at 1101,

103
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,920
they're sleeping in the elevator lobby. Yeah. I love that. Like psychological sort of aggressive,

104
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,880
psychological. Oh, there you go. Assign half of your dorm to be guards and have to be prisoners

105
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:14,080
and then just see how that goes. I'm not sure that the faculty of this institution would smile on

106
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,400
that. Basically become a warden of the floor. You're talking about, you're talking about mind

107
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,240
freaking an entire floor of students. Yes. I'm not sure that's legal. That's not a legal thing to do.

108
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,160
Yeah. The number one thing that you have to do to sort of keep,

109
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,560
let's call it stability or just maybe just sort of control is you've got to pick out the cool hand

110
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,880
Luke on the floor day one. Who is going to be the one? The Andy Dufresne. Who is your Andy Dufresne

111
00:11:50,880 --> 00:12:01,920
that's going to try to rally the other prisoners? You have to be the Strother Martin for this floor,

112
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,360
the captain for this floor. And then beat him in a golden eye tournament. And then beat him in a

113
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,760
golden eye tournament so they know, it's like shooting a guy in the dorms. You got to out

114
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:20,720
sack him on the quad. Is that a competitive? Can you win at sack? I mean, if other people

115
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,520
are watching and you can, you can because if they see you, you lose. But if you could secretly hack

116
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,160
well for long enough, then, uh, that's the only way to win. And even that is, you can see your,

117
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,440
Jesus can see you. Jesus. Jesus always knows when you're playing hacky sack. And he's always,

118
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,000
I want to hit you with this idea. I bet if they had been around and they may very well have been,

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,080
if they had been around in biblical times, Jesus and the disciples would have had,

120
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,680
Oh my God. Are you kidding? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Fully right sandals.

121
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,080
Like drink this wine. It is my bud. Play with this hacky sack. It is awesome.

122
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,400
That's in the Gnostic gospels. Judas dropped the sack. Get out of here. Judas.

123
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,320
Get out of here. Judas. I'll teach you. Will you? Do you still have my rusted root CDs?

124
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,360
We're trying to, we're trying to feel something over here. See, I would submit that like,

125
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,240
I think hack technology could have existed. It's a fucking bag filled with beans. Exactly.

126
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,640
Space age. Like they could put like bag of sand, a sandbag basically, right? Like just, just

127
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,600
problem with sand is that it's going to dampen the kinetic output of your limbs. You really,

128
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,400
you really got to get beans in there cause beans, uh, they give, they give you. For all we know, Jesus

129
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,160
was hanging out playing cornhole. Now I, okay. That's possible. I guess like that. I mean, again,

130
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,200
that technology, he was a carpenter. Yeah. Today. So Jesus invented cornhole. Today, Joshua, I will

131
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,160
take you out back and teach you how to make a sweet cornhole bowl. You have to paint it with

132
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,560
your favorite NFL team logo. My name is Jesus and I talk like my favorite team is the saints.

133
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,320
Bask in it. My name is Jesus and I talk like a text to speech converter.

134
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,880
I have a Yahoo that I think we should explore. Hit me. This one was sent in by Adam Jorgensen

135
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,720
or perhaps Jorgensen. Thank you, Adam. That last name. Uh, it's by Yahoo answers user,

136
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,400
big heart who asks how many different types of sex is there? These are about to get real blue

137
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:48,400
on this show. So this is a dad alert. Dad's click it off moms. You can stay. Um, I mean,

138
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,880
like breakup sex, makeup, sex, angry sex. I need a roof over my head sex or my personal favorite.

139
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We just watched. I need to try that sex. I need a roof over my

140
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,800
head. Like homeless person sex. I just wonder how many you can think of. I think it means like,

141
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,000
I need a place to stay tonight. I'll fuck you. I'll give you this. I'll give you this. I have

142
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,440
this for you. I need a ride to the airport sex. I need a ride to the airport. Sex is good sex.

143
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:24,320
That's a good one. Um, I ran out of toothpaste sex, a cup of sugar sex, surf and turf sex,

144
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:33,680
time travel sex, the technology for that. Well, of course it wouldn't exist in the modern day,

145
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,760
but like that time travel sex is when you go back in time and tell someone like,

146
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,560
if we don't do this, if we don't do this scientists of my day, et cetera, et cetera.

147
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,160
Yeah. Fill in the blank. Yeah. Right. Hurry down doomsday. That's that sort of thing.

148
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,880
That's a fine type of sex. That's how you, that's and then you birth yourself. You give birth to

149
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,040
yourself. You're your own dad. That's that paradox sex. There's, um, pretending to be someone's

150
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,000
guardian angel sex. That's a great one. Can you, can you expound? Can we explore that? Yeah. What's

151
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,920
the line there you give them? Um, I'm doing this for your own good. Yeah. I gotta save you. There's

152
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,440
an earthquake that's about to happen. I gotta, I gotta nail you down. There's a lot of manipulation

153
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,160
in your guy's sex. I wish it would be more consensual because a lot of this is like putting

154
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,280
pressure on someone of a sort of universal scale and I'm not sure that's even romantically. I mean,

155
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,200
there's all kinds of like there's forthright sex. There's, there's straightforward, no fool in sex.

156
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,240
There's thank you so much for the lasagna sex, which is different than all the other,

157
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,520
um, positive gratitude, sexual encounters. Um, lasagna, you really give it that special

158
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,840
something because it's multi-layered. It takes so long to make. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's commitment.

159
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:02,560
Uh-oh sex. Birthday sex. R. Kelly knows all about that. R. Kelly knows about birthday sex. He has a

160
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,880
song called birthday sex. Oh, does he? We could have a segment on the show where I just talked

161
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,560
about R. Kelly song titles and how great they are. Like, like pussy cry.

162
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,400
There's, um, I think my house is haunted sex. Okay. Spectral sex. I don't feel safe. I don't

163
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,640
feel safe in my own home. So you want to bone down? Uh-huh. To scare the ghosts away. Oh,

164
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,960
that's right because they can't look at this, at the sex happening. Uh-huh. Right. Um, I think

165
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,400
my bread is broken, but I'm not sure. Sex. Yeah. Let's find out. Let's find out. Let's find out sex.

166
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,160
Hey. The acoustic sex. Text the acoustic. Test my new soundproofing sex. Sex unplugged.

167
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,440
Did you guys hear Tracy chat last night? She was amazing. She did a fast car and I was like,

168
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:03,680
slow down. Um, I want to lose it. There's a, there's a, I'm pretending you're Tracy Chapman.

169
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,800
Is it all sex pretending on your Tracy Chapman sex? Yeah. Technically all sex is pretending

170
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,760
you're Tracy Chapman sex, but other persons, Tracy Chapman or pretending yourself are Tracy Chapman.

171
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:27,600
Yeah. Exactly. Or pretending that you are Tracy Chapman making love with Tracy Chapman. That is a

172
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,600
crazy, crazy afternoon. I'm going to look up a really quick, a JPEG of Tracy Chapman. Okay.

173
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,680
Just not weird or anything, but let's just like. Do you, do you need to be able to like focus on

174
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,960
her face when you're saying these things about her? Yeah, I can't make these goofs unless. Yeah,

175
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,800
that's a good looking lady. She kind of looks like, um, kind of looks like, uh, I'm not actually

176
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,120
looking at a picture right now. Let's, let's all take a break and look at a picture. Everybody,

177
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,640
let's take a second to contemplate Tracy Chapman. This is our, um, this is our new segment called

178
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,600
look at a picture of Tracy Chapman. Guys, this is great, but I need to go have looking at pictures

179
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,040
of Tracy Chapman sex. Okay. Now how is that different from pretending your partner is Tracy

180
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,920
Chapman sex? Well, it's more active. It's more of a, it's more of a, this is, this is the gun,

181
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:27,200
the starting gun that kickstarted my heart. Uh, and now I got, I just have to go high sex.

182
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,040
Got to, and of course I'm going to think about Tracy Chapman during the act because I'm. You're

183
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,840
saying it normally converts from one to the other. I'm saying there's a smooth transition.

184
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,480
Not all Tracy Chapman sex is let's all look at a picture of Tracy Chapman sex,

185
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,360
but all the other one other way around. So not all squares or rectangles that guy. Oh yeah.

186
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,120
Right. But all rectangles do want to make you have sex while thinking about Tracy Chapman.

187
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,960
Okay. Great. If you were to make a Venn diagram where Tracy Chapman was on one side of it and

188
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,400
sex is on the other, it would be very close together. It would look like a match.

189
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,120
Almost overlapping except for Tracy Chapman herself. She would be on the outside.

190
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,400
She is, she is of course asexual. She's in charge. She is in charge. She runs this show.

191
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,640
Hey Phillip, uh, why is there not Evian in my, my trailer specifically says that, uh, that I,

192
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,480
that I need that need that thing. One of these days we're going to do a bit where we make references

193
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,440
to, um, a relevant figure in the media. And I think that'll probably be when the show ends.

194
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,160
Well, you know why? Do you know why? At least for myself, I don't first, I don't know that many new

195
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:49,760
people that are around too. I'm not sure that I know enough about the new people to say things.

196
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,480
If I say things about Tracy Chapman, you, no one knows enough about Tracy Chapman to call me on

197
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,080
it. Yeah. Hey, I feel like people who know me see me as a character rather than a real person.

198
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,480
It might be due to the fact that I'm very outspoken wear big hipster glasses or the

199
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,520
fact that I'm a funny girl. I feel like when I talk to many of my acquaintances,

200
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,800
they want me to perform for them or something. Anyway, how can I get people to see me as a normal

201
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,480
person and not just a character? Should I just become more of an asshole and be less outgoing?

202
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,280
Should I dress differently? Help me brothers. That's from normal and NYC.

203
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:36,480
I think people treat you the way you allow them to treat you. Does that make any sense?

204
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,800
Yeah. So like if, if you've spent all of your time playing into the perception that you are

205
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:49,600
or this funny performer for them, like if that's the niche that you like worked into the group,

206
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,240
if you're like, Hey, I'm the funny one. And you embrace that and wanted to be, you know,

207
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,000
welcomed into the group as that person. It's your job now to change that perception. If you want to,

208
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,560
the only thing you can do really is be yourself. And if they like that person,

209
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,200
then you're, you're going to keep hanging out. If they don't, you're going to be,

210
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,640
you're going to be emailing us again in three months saying, how do I meet people? No one likes

211
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,680
me. I used to be funny and outgoing and now I'm quiet. Yeah. I don't, I don't think the answer is

212
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,640
like radically changing to the opposite end of the spectrum. Cause now go, why are you being an

213
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,280
asshole? And then you'd still be a character. You'd just be, you'd just be sad girl with glasses.

214
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,440
Right. The sad one. And I'd be willing to bet that without any background or further details. So this

215
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,080
is a young person question. This is like either in college or fresh out of college, still figuring

216
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,000
out who you are and like a solidifying personality. Yeah. Because so much, as you get older, so much

217
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,280
of your, so much of this question is answered by your actions. I mean, it has less to do with

218
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,640
the sort of personality box that you've built for yourself and more about the actual things that you

219
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,520
do in your day to day life as things get, you know, as these relationships progress.

220
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,480
Is there anything really wrong with being a character though?

221
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,440
There are so many good characters out there. It depends on if it's sustainable. Like if you're

222
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,760
the guy that drinks till five o'clock in the morning, every morning, and then goes to work

223
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,600
at seven and you're this wild, crazy partier guy, that's not sustainable forever. That's

224
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,760
you. You miss, you misunderstand. I mean, an actual literal character from a literary work

225
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:43,760
or movie or a book. You mean, you mean today I'm holding Caulfield. I, that is precisely what I

226
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,280
mean. Like what kind of literary character do you, I mean, like, like a Dorian Gray, like a Dorian

227
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,840
Gray. That's a little, I'm not sure that her friends would get that ref though. Um, also

228
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,400
shooting that painting. I got that literary reference. It was the one with the painting in it.

229
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,320
Um, I mean like, uh, um, a character from third rock from the sun.

230
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,240
So you're saying she should embody

231
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:20,320
a character played by say John Lithgow. I'm the matrix. I'm the, I'm, I'm the matrix guy.

232
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,600
Now the matrix guy was not, the matrix is not a character. You do realize that of course.

233
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,920
Right. Right. You mean that you mean, um,

234
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm Harry Potter and the goblet of fire. I'm the goblet of fire. It is a pleasure to meet you.

235
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:43,120
Hippogriff. I'm casting a spell now. Hippogriff. Um, I mean, it could be a lady character. It could

236
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:51,680
be, uh, could be, uh, eat, pray, love. Who eat, pray, love. It could be eat, pray, love. Hi,

237
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,120
I'm eat, pray, love. Do you want to go to India with me? This spaghetti is delicious. How I can

238
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,320
do any, if you name any literary character such as anything from eat, pray, love to the goblet of

239
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:13,920
fire. Okay. I will, I will impersonate. Mystic pizza. Mystic pizza. Oh, there's some spooky

240
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,640
pepperoni. Pass the insight. Okay. Okay. Um, the sisterhood of the traveling pants. Hey,

241
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,160
come back here. Hey, hey, hey, I'm all skin and undies down there. Come on back. I don't know how

242
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,680
we can, how she can use this. She can't just walk around without pants and say, hi, I'm sisterhood

243
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,040
of the traveling pants because then I got any other, you got any other characters for me or

244
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm all mine are empowered female groups. Divine secrets of the sisterhood, fried green tomatoes.

245
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,840
This is all I got. These are crunchy yet sour. I just learned about growing up.

246
00:25:49,840 --> 00:26:02,880
Um, beaches, what beaches and or moon struck, uh, beaches, uh, moon struck. I have not seen,

247
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,600
uh, beaches, uh, uh, women, you throw wings. That's all I know. That was not good. I'm not sure.

248
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,920
Beaches trivia. Okay. Was beaches a book though? I have a literary mind. I thought you were all

249
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,760
into books. Now you have a stake in them. Um, it proves me beaches was a book. I have to believe

250
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,600
that there is a book adaptation of the film beaches and I have to believe that I have won

251
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,520
all the book prices that books can win best book based on beaches.

252
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:47,520
And now the 1997 best book award goes to beaches. The book of the movie with Bette Midler.

253
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,320
You can only read it once because once you get to the end, your tears have soaked the book through

254
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,120
just throw it away. Buy a new beaches book, buy two beaches book. I need your money.

255
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,320
Mark Twain. Come on up here and accept this award.

256
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm glad he came out of retirement to write a beach is the book of the movie with Bette Midler.

257
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,840
Also called beaches.

258
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:16,240
Also called beaches. So I guess maybe act more like Mark Twain that that your friends won't see that

259
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,000
coming yet. You know, don't, don't sweat it too much. Here's what I would tell you. Don't start

260
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,440
second guessing who you've been for, because it can feel like that, because it can feel like that.

261
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,560
Sometimes like, oh, this is a front. This is a character, but everybody has a little bit of that

262
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,040
because your true self, you say for the times when it's just you.

263
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:44,080
I think, yeah, I think everybody, especially in like college after college period goes through

264
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,680
that. Is this the real me or am I just being the me? My friends want me to be that you're getting

265
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:57,200
too deep here. Just be you be happy. Yeah. Eat, pray, love, eat, pray, love, pray, love, go to India,

266
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,160
India. Is that where they go? Yeah. And eat, pray, love three of them. Eat, pray and love.

267
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,200
I'll go to India together. It's like sex in the city, but there's a lot more eating. Well,

268
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:30,240
do you know where we're going to go? Uh, tell me the money. So, uh, and first of all, we have some

269
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:38,640
wedding well wishes to Jake, Aaron, and Lottie Young from Tom and Simon, who wanted us to know

270
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,600
that they have two cats, Belle and Bowie, one of whom is presumably named after the musical star

271
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:53,680
of Jake's favorite movie, Labyrinth, Belle and Sebastian. Okay. What? The Belle and Sebastian

272
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:00,880
you're saying was in Labyrinth? Yeah. Right. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You

273
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,600
have said the dumbest thing that has ever been. I believe that's true. They're going to get divorced

274
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:14,960
now. Bummer. Oh no. Good job. Oh man. Thanks for your money. You soon to be divorced lonely hearts.

275
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,840
You give us money and we will give you lies in exchange. Yeah. Also, we want to wish a super

276
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,480
happy birthday to Anthony Edwards, presumably not that Anthony Edwards from ER. Uh, that's from

277
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,800
Melanie Lovelock, which is a great last name. Can we explore the possibility that she is wishing a

278
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,160
TV show character a happy 36th birthday? All right. We got to get into this, this thing again.

279
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:47,120
Anthony Edwards is a real guy, okay? Not a character. God damn it. God damn it. You did it

280
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:56,080
again. I'm Dr. Anthony Edwards. I'm Dr. George Clooney. Do you need some medicine? I have it.

281
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,560
So it's, it's Anthony's 36th birthday. Uh, a great run on the ER and many more birthdays

282
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:12,640
to come. Uh, we also have Bloody Fantastical. Um, that is a new dark fantasy slash horror podcast

283
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:21,520
that's got violence and teeth and sex and fantasy. Plus there's English, an English guy with a set of

284
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,440
pipes that will quote, I've been paid to read this, melt your socks right off. I cannot attest

285
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,920
to that personally. Uh, my, I do not wear socks. I'm more of a Senex type of guy or maybe like a

286
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,240
slipper in the home. But, um, I would like to think that my socks would burn, not melt unless

287
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,200
they're plastic socks. What was that? Senex? Senex? Senex, they're, they're sandal shoes.

288
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,600
Bottoms of them are sandals. The tops are just, I don't know. I think they're like hippie shirts

289
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,160
that they cut up real thin and then sew them together into shoes. They're like, how can the

290
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:05,200
bottoms be sandals? Like without the sandals, but without the top part, it's just the sole of a shoe.

291
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,320
You're talking about water socks right now. No, you're wearing aqua shoes around your house. Do

292
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,880
you wear these out of the house? What? Yeah, they're like the socks. They're like socks you

293
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,640
can wear outdoors. Socks are socks you can wear outdoors. Everything you're saying is bad.

294
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:30,240
They look great. It's a real beachy feel. Check out bloody fantastical.com or subscribe on iTunes.

295
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,080
I can't do a jingle. I'm too fucking angry about you wearing beach shoes outside of your house at

296
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,480
not beach. You don't live on the beach, Todd. That's your beach name. I love, I love that beachy

297
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,240
feel. You have hookah shell, anklets, bracelets, and a necklace. Five, hey, five different hookah

298
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
shells. If hacking is good enough for our Lord and savior, I can wear hemp sandal shoes.

299
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,040
Think about it. Let me get my key box. Just think about what you said. Send me on my way.

300
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,080
Have we reached the new segment where we just do rusted root impressions?

301
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:15,920
That's all I got. Now, Griffin, you have, rather than permanently stop doing jingles forever-

302
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,000
I came very close to just smashing my guitar and never doing jingles.

303
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,200
Last week. To just smashing my guitar and never doing jingles again.

304
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,680
But Griffin has agreed to continue to do jingles, but only for corporate companies.

305
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,680
He's sold out. Instead of human beings. I am not-

306
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,600
Because he realized it's ridiculous for human beings to have jingles. That's what he said.

307
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,240
I'm Michael. Michael's got the best hair in town. Everybody knows it's Michael.

308
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,960
Like that doesn't happen. I can't do that anymore.

309
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,520
So this week, Griffin's gonna do the jingle for bloodyfantastical.com.

310
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,600
All right. You say you're done with vampire romance.

311
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:10,160
I'm not so sure. Because you haven't heard Bloody Fantastical. It's love and vampirism

312
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:18,240
is pure. We're talking about dark fantasy and horror. We're talking about violence and teeth

313
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,720
and sex. It's got a bonus English gentleman who himself might be a vampire. No wait,

314
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,800
he just has bad teeth. Oh shit, that was kind of racist.

315
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:38,240
You paid your money and then I said a racist thing about you.

316
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,560
Bloodyfantastical.com. I'm sorry about the racist thing.

317
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,560
I am about to go to my junior year of college. My summer job has not paid well.

318
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,840
I'm heavily considering selling marijuana when I get back to school to make some extra cheddar.

319
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,360
Is this a bad idea? I am also a heavy marijuana smoker myself.

320
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,600
Great, great. How's this business plan come along so far?

321
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,280
So far your business does not sound good. I want to open up a bakery,

322
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,480
but I'm pretty much going to eat all of the bread myself.

323
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,960
Love brownies. So I'm just, that's the situation.

324
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,640
Listen, you know, you know who they don't let run the tricks factory?

325
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,160
Tricks rabbit. Yeah, he'll, he'll chop them all down.

326
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:33,600
All the best business plan, Google, Google was founded when Dr. Google was super pot high.

327
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Really, really, really pot high. He was like, oh, I got an idea.

328
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,920
The thing about it though, the reason that didn't work out is he loved to eat Googles.

329
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:48,960
He was addicted to Googles and he was addicted to searching.

330
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,400
But, but see, that was a good thing because that searching was on an inexhaustible product.

331
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:02,960
I just don't see how you make the line between like, I'm going to go smoke some marijuana

332
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,880
and I'm not going to smoke that, that I'm going to sell to people.

333
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm going to just smoke it. I mean, here's the thing.

334
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,600
I hate, I hate to be a stick in the mud, but of course it's not a good idea, dude.

335
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,080
It's, it's illegal. It's like pretty illegal.

336
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,920
It's like a pretty illegal thing that you can do.

337
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,560
Not the most illegal place. You pretty much get caught doing that.

338
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,800
You're out of college. You got the game.

339
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,320
Maybe he's good at football. You don't know.

340
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,920
All right. That's fair. Hold on.

341
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,400
You're allowed to, you're allowed to just sell weed.

342
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,960
You can do it. It is a fucking lawless old west style debauchery got to get down on sports.

343
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,360
You got to get up. You just get the pigskin, kick it through the upright

344
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,400
fork. You know, the big fork at the end.

345
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,040
Yeah, sure.

346
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,320
The score, kick it through that.

347
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,560
Yeah.

348
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,600
Get, kick it through the score fork and get some girls full, full bacchanal.

349
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,440
Um, I, you know, we can't tell you to sell weed.

350
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Obviously we have a lot riding on this program.

351
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,920
We can't go back to prison, but we can't tell you to smoke, to sell weed.

352
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,200
We can't tell you the best way to sell weed,

353
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:20,720
which is definitely by hiding it in those Mighty Max play sets and selling them on eBay.

354
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,600
Okay.

355
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,520
You just sneak, there's so many secret chambers in that Mighty Max play set.

356
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,480
You just sneak a little bit of conge in there and then.

357
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,360
No, don't do it at all.

358
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,480
Yeah, don't.

359
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,600
How do you hint, how do you hint that in the eBay listing though?

360
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,920
Say he's got quite a yard.

361
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
Mighty Max has got quite the lawn in here.

362
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,240
He's got a real, a real forest.

363
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,120
Filled with pot.

364
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,640
Oh no.

365
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,800
This Mighty Max is mighty green.

366
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,560
Green.

367
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,840
This is, this is his dankest adventure yet.

368
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,640
Fighting his nemesis, the sticky icky.

369
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:02,960
Yeah.

370
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,480
Um, I, you, I, I, I know that selling weed, I can't pass it.

371
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,040
Apparently someone's doing it cause everybody's got weed.

372
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,400
Well, I imagine it's gotta be like a, it's, it's like most things that are illegal.

373
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,120
A quick buck.

374
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,080
Yeah.

375
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,280
Like, but it's still such a bad idea.

376
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,080
Cause the consequences I think outweigh the, like, I've made some extra cheddar.

377
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,680
But also I went to prison for a little while.

378
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,240
What you need to define as a chemistry teacher who cook for you.

379
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,480
Exactly.

380
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,680
Or I guess in this case, like a.

381
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,280
Botanist.

382
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
A botanist who will grow for you.

383
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,400
A down on his luck botanist, which I'm pretty sure is all of them.

384
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,320
Pretty much all botanists everywhere.

385
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,760
Um, you, you, you're not thinking of the long game, sir.

386
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,880
Mr. Form spring because you're going to need.

387
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,000
You're going to need a new identity.

388
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,080
You're going to need a drug dealer identity.

389
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
Have you even thought about that?

390
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,800
What's your drug dealer name is going to be?

391
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,920
Who's the, who's the best drug dealer name that you guys know in real life

392
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,600
of the drug dealers?

393
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,840
You guys know what's, what's the best, what's the best name?

394
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,120
Dr.

395
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,440
Shoot.

396
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,200
That's not real.

397
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,480
Nobody fucks around with Dr.

398
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,440
Shoot for obvious reasons.

399
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,640
Travis, your turn.

400
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,920
General Stabenstein.

401
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,160
Yeah.

402
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,600
I only know one drug dealer in Huntington.

403
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,720
His name is Nike.

404
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,360
That's all I got.

405
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,560
That's really good.

406
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,240
That's pretty good, right?

407
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,600
Cause it's already branded.

408
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,960
Like you don't even have to advertise.

409
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
You got the advertisements covered.

410
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,600
This is my drug dealer, vitamin water.

411
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:31,920
Yeah.

412
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,560
You got to find some way to command respect so that people don't knock you over

413
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,680
and take all your, take all your jazz cigarettes from you.

414
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,920
Cause what I know about heavy marijuana smokers is those guys are fighters.

415
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,440
Just spry and limber.

416
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
You can't smoke it if you're selling it.

417
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,600
You can't.

418
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,200
You absolutely can't.

419
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,680
You've got to make, and hey, you know, this is a great opportunity.

420
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
You're about to make a bad life choice.

421
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,800
Why not counterbalance it with a good life choice?

422
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,200
I guarantee that if you stop smoking for a while so that you could sell it,

423
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,440
it would take care of the second one.

424
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,480
You'd be like, oh wait, now that I've cleared this haze, this is a bad idea.

425
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,640
No, I think it's fine.

426
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,440
Just don't, don't smoke it.

427
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Maybe you could do a similar idea that's quite legal.

428
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,400
And since you obviously know a bunch of other marijuana smokers,

429
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,600
start a door to door hostess cupcake business.

430
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,440
You're talking about a food delivery service for high people?

431
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,760
Yeah.

432
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,080
You just, you just bring munchies to them.

433
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,480
Yeah.

434
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,600
You guys need Starburst?

435
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,040
I don't know.

436
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,160
You could drive them places.

437
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,320
That would be fun, pot chauffeur.

438
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,800
Oh, you could sit next to them in class and movies when they start freaking out

439
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,040
and you just like pat their knee and say, it's going to be cool.

440
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,160
Carry a cool damp rag with you everywhere you go.

441
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,120
Shh, shh, shh.

442
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,640
All right, do you mean when they freak out on hallucinogenic marijuana?

443
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,920
Is that what you're saying?

444
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,400
Or when they start breathing heavily and they're like, I can't breathe,

445
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,440
my throat's closing up.

446
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,400
And you're like, no, it's not.

447
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,720
You're fine.

448
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,200
You're fine.

449
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,640
This is just a SpongeBob movie.

450
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,120
Don't worry.

451
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,200
Because that is what you would be watching.

452
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,700
Mm-hmm.

453
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,760
Don't sell marijuana.

454
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,240
Don't do it.

455
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,200
You're in college.

456
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,640
But if you do-

457
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,160
Just finish college.

458
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,520
And then sell marijuana.

459
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,400
Once you get your business degree-

460
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
You don't have to sell marijuana.

461
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,200
You're going to have a college degree.

462
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,700
Yeah.

463
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,680
Times are tough, Justin.

464
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,040
It kind of, but it negates the purpose of having a college degree

465
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,040
if you also have to list on your application that you have been arrested

466
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
for felony charges.

467
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,240
Can I suggest that you do that?

468
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,280
Just stop going to college.

469
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,360
Because you're already in the highest paying career

470
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,720
you're going to be able to net.

471
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,160
Just go with this lifestyle.

472
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,440
You just flipped a 180 sentence to sentence.

473
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,880
Write it dirty.

474
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,760
That's all I'm saying.

475
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,260
Get-

476
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,960
Listen, regulators, mount up.

477
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,160
Don't listen.

478
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,720
Hear me out.

479
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,400
Hear me out.

480
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,120
I'm hearing.

481
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,320
Go full criminal.

482
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,560
You're saying like, super criminal.

483
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,040
I-

484
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,720
What do you mean, super criminal?

485
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,320
Super criminal.

486
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Why stop at marijuana?

487
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,240
Go get some fucking sweet code book.

488
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
Rob a bank.

489
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,440
Stab a dude.

490
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,880
It's time to break bad.

491
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:21,280
Listen, the thing that is upsetting us about the idea of you selling drugs

492
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,720
is you have so much to lose.

493
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,720
You've got to get to rock bottom and then-

494
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,680
Climb your way back up.

495
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,880
You'll be unstoppable.

496
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,720
The time has come for you to quit college and like, break really bad.

497
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,400
Do you know why they brought down Nancy Botlin from Weeds?

498
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,000
Because she got family to worry about.

499
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,880
She didn't have that family.

500
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,760
She'd still be on the streets selling.

501
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,140
Yeah.

502
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,040
Well, I stopped watching Weeds a few seasons back, but I'm assuming that that's what happens.

503
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
God damn, I want to go have some marijuana.

504
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,080
This question got me in the mood.

505
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
Hey, who do I talk to about marijuana?

506
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,040
Where do you get it anymore?

507
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,160
It's legal now, right?

508
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,360
It's pretty much everywhere.

509
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,160
More or less.

510
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
Why don't you sell salvia?

511
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
Isn't salvia legal?

512
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,600
Fuck, don't sell salvia.

513
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,880
No, that would be doing people a public service because nothing will make you want to never

514
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,320
do drugs again like salvia.

515
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,540
Yeah.

516
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,960
Oh, that's great.

517
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,880
I just had tea with the devil and he told me he was going to kill me if I ever did this again.

518
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,560
Yeah, the devil is going to give me a prostate exam,

519
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,720
so I think I'm going to go lay down in a room for a year.

520
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,240
Okay, cool.

521
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,600
Bye.

522
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,080
Good experience.

523
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,960
Bye, everyone.

524
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,600
Good night.

525
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,040
Hey, great Halloween, everyone.

526
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,280
Time to make a new set of friends because you all saw me cry and pee myself.

527
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,560
I guess I'm not a character anymore.

528
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,960
Now I'm that guy who pees himself.

529
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,160
And rocks in the corner while the devil touches his butthole.

530
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,040
Hey, how about a yahoo?

531
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,880
Yeah, I'm ready.

532
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,280
Okay, this yahoo is sent in by Mike Burnsteel.

533
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,800
Thank you, Mike.

534
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,160
It's a pretty cool name.

535
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,400
Huh?

536
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,840
Pretty cool name.

537
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,200
Yeah, yeah.

538
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,600
I like it.

539
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,760
You know what, now that you mention it, it is a pretty cool name.

540
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,120
It's by yahoo answers user PDFGhost who says,

541
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,960
what are some good ways to look cool at the urinal?

542
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,120
I'm trying to seem cool at work when I'm at the urinal.

543
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,000
Lately, while I'm peeing, I've been putting my hands in my pockets.

544
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,280
I've thought about resting my elbow on the wall and putting my head against my hand,

545
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,560
just kind of chilling, acting like it's not even a big deal and I'm peeing.

546
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,600
NBD.

547
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,960
Any other ideas?

548
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,600
It's not like I'm trying to hook up with any dudes.

549
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,880
I just want people to think, man, that's a chill dude.

550
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,160
And everyone has to go to the bathroom.

551
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,080
So that's where you see the widest variety of people.

552
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,280
Bring your office chair with you and just kind of recline.

553
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,040
Oh, God, yes.

554
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,640
Just roll in there like, what's up, chilling, chill dude.

555
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,680
Oh, and go to the tiny kid's urinal.

556
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,160
And you know, just like lean back in your chair and hit it.

557
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,880
It looks huge.

558
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,960
Can you have a Mai Tai in your hand?

559
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,000
I don't know how cool your office is, but if you can have a Mai Tai in your hand while

560
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,960
you pee from your chair into a child's urinal while your boss watches you.

561
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,760
If you can do it hands-free and put both hands up and it just says,

562
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,840
what the fuck, it's summer, chill dude.

563
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,600
And maybe like hang ten.

564
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,080
And then you're just like, ah.

565
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,280
If you can do some wall push-ups while you're doing it, like get that, get diesel.

566
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,480
Get pumped.

567
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,280
Is it too complicated to do a touchdown dance?

568
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,200
As you're, like when you're done or what?

569
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,640
No, like as you're doing it.

570
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,240
Yeah.

571
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,040
I mean, it seems like a premature celebration because you don't know how long it's going to go.

572
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,800
Or if you're going to go that dribble.

573
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,920
If you do a bad job of it.

574
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,800
Um, can you plank?

575
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,840
Oh, you could if you had those like wall divider things and you just laid across them.

576
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,160
And you tucked your wormy in one of the toilets while you aimed down.

577
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,000
While you peed straight down.

578
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,280
But if there are other people in that bathroom.

579
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,440
I mean, if there are other people at the other urinals that you're planking on,

580
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,480
that's going to be a scene.

581
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,560
That's going to be a whole ordeal.

582
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,360
And what if they got one of those big pee troughs?

583
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,240
I think there's laying in the trough.

584
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,040
That would be perfect.

585
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,480
I've seen some people.

586
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,080
I've seen some people at a Cubs game that just go to sleep in that trough.

587
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,040
Daddy, is he planking?

588
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,000
Like, no, son.

589
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,440
No, son.

590
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,160
He's half dead.

591
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,160
That's JB.

592
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,000
You gotta pee around him.

593
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,720
Although, although if you would look cool, peeing on another guy is cool.

594
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,760
Who's the boss?

595
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,880
Who's the boss?

596
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,960
Oh, wait, you are the boss of this company.

597
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,720
I'll go clean out my desk.

598
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:42,960
Sorry about your desk.

599
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
Maybe just move your desk into the bathroom.

600
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,800
Yeah.

601
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,840
Don't pee in a urinal.

602
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,360
Take Dominion back over your urination.

603
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,360
Just pee in the middle of a conversation.

604
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,240
Pee in your pants.

605
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,040
I better go watch this.

606
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,800
Hey, Bradley, can you hold on for just one second?

607
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,640
Okay, go on.

608
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,800
Can you pee in your pants and then put your pants in the urinal while everybody's watching?

609
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,440
And wash them in there like a little washing machine?

610
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,160
I'll get this later.

611
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,960
Or just leave them behind.

612
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,480
Yeah, I'll pick it up at five.

613
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,040
Hey, Jerry.

614
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,960
How are things in accounts?

615
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,000
When Bradley Cooper took the Limitless Pill, do you think he came up with the coolest way to ever use the urinal?

616
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Can you just do what he does in that movie?

617
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,040
So you've seen the movie, right?

618
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,160
Have not seen it, but does he use a urinal at one point?

619
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,240
He uses all the urinals.

620
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,680
All of them at once.

621
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Limitless Pill gives you five dicks that are very, very cool.

622
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,000
Very accurate each one.

623
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,960
You know how human beings only use 20% of their dicks?

624
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,480
Bradley Cooper uses 100% of his five dicks.

625
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,800
He does 500% all the time.

626
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,080
That's what Limitless is all about.

627
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,280
Is that what it's about?

628
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,600
To be fair, if that's what it was about, it would have been a way better movie.

629
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,680
Just a ring of dicks.

630
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,000
A never ending ring of dicks.

631
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,400
Like a Cthulhu.

632
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,680
It's a very Cthulhu-esque situation.

633
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,720
So I guess those are some cool things you can do.

634
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,360
Can you flex?

635
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,440
Can you thumb wrestle the guy next to you?

636
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,800
There's so many options.

637
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,400
Can you thumb wrestle yourself?

638
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,360
You can scream at the top of your lungs.

639
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,880
Scream not again.

640
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,960
Or I finally got it.

641
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,040
Can you open up a window and pee out the window?

642
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,040
And put your arms up in a manner that says I don't fucking care, man.

643
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,080
I think that part's good.

644
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,160
I think that part is non-negotiable.

645
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,640
You gotta put your pants-

646
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,400
It's gotta be like, fuck it.

647
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,520
Just pee in.

648
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,920
And I do love dropping pants and underwear.

649
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,560
Hey, by the way-

650
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,920
Oh, be a girl.

651
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,320
I think it's a pretty dope way to win at the urinal.

652
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,080
If you're a girl, I think this day is yours.

653
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,920
Hey Dave, check this out.

654
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,560
High five.

655
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,040
I got it.

656
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,640
You go to the stall and you sit down to pee, but you leave the stall door open.

657
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,640
Oh, occupy.

658
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,560
Oh, no, don't worry.

659
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,280
What are you looking at?

660
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,240
Hey, we're all dudes.

661
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,920
Hey, all dudes here.

662
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,960
I'm just taking a break, taking a relaxer while I go.

663
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,400
This one's for me.

664
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,280
This Tucker's for me.

665
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,400
Does anybody have an O Magazine I can peruse?

666
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,120
Got some good housekeeping in here if you guys want to read.

667
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,760
Oh, you can't read.

668
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,280
You're standing up, dummies.

669
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
You still use urinals?

670
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,360
What a joke.

671
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,120
I love this luxury.

672
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,200
Like many of your fans, I'm seeking a little advice about the ladies,

673
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,520
specifically coworker type ladies.

674
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm really into this girl and I'm pretty sure she's into me,

675
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,320
but a lot of friends have told me that I shouldn't try dating coworkers.

676
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,520
Do you guys have any advice you could give me, bewildered in Brooklyn?

677
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,880
What is your job?

678
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,320
I'm so angry at this person.

679
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,520
Why?

680
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,960
You gotta give us some deets, yo.

681
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,680
It depends on where you work.

682
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,400
If you work at a blockbuster-

683
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:54,960
Right, that's key.

684
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,280
If you work at a blockbuster video, then you should be fucking like the world is ending,

685
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,800
because it is for blockbuster video.

686
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,120
If you guys are-

687
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,120
At least your financial solvency is ending.

688
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,560
If your lawyer partners, if your partner's at a lawyer firm,

689
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,920
you probably shouldn't fuck because then you'd have to divorce the firm

690
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,040
if something bad happened.

691
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,120
Then where would your clients go?

692
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,920
I know you and I are both lawyer partners,

693
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,720
but I really think this is going somewhere.

694
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:27,200
This fall on NBC, Lawyer Partners, they like Law and each other, and they kiss.

695
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,120
Watch it.

696
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,240
And Tom Cavanagh's in it.

697
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,440
It's got Tom Cavanagh.

698
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,160
Of course he is.

699
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,440
I think you ask her out.

700
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,040
We know nothing about this girl.

701
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,360
She could be-

702
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:39,920
I know.

703
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,040
She could be poison.

704
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,920
Like literal poison?

705
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,760
Like her skin is toxic?

706
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,800
I'm saying that she has a big butt and a smile as I'm saying it's going to be a bad scene for you.

707
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,280
Probably.

708
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,400
I don't know.

709
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,160
It depends.

710
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,920
Okay, let's, there's so many factors here.

711
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,320
But let's say if this is a non-disposable job, by which I mean, it's a job-

712
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,440
Like a career.

713
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,200
A career, thank you, Travis, yes.

714
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,520
If it's your career, I don't think intra-career dating is such a great idea,

715
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,000
but here's the thing though.

716
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,400
Here's the thing, and this is where maybe I'm out on my own here.

717
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:30,000
If she is that special somebody, if she's your special one, then you move heaven and earth.

718
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,520
You quit your lawyer job.

719
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,360
You get a new lawyer partner.

720
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,880
If she's that special somebody, but you need to make sure,

721
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,320
I think you need to get to know her as well as you can in the office situation.

722
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,880
You can date in the office.

723
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,520
I think you got to quit your lawyer job for this girl.

724
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,040
You got to open up a bowling alley in your hometown and just chase her down.

725
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,640
This fall, Tom Cavanagh.

726
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,360
Catch it, NBC, late night, eight o'clock, Sundays.

727
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:57,840
Catch it.

728
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,480
Please catch it.

729
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,560
And buy a book.

730
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,040
Please catch it.

731
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,600
Buy the book.

732
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,880
For the love of God.

733
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,680
Buy the book.

734
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,120
This is Ed, the book.

735
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,800
I wrote a novelization of the TV show.

736
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,440
I wrote a novelization of a show that was kind of okay that got canceled a decade ago.

737
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,920
Please buy it.

738
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,560
And also Michael Ian Black was in it, so you should check it out.

739
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,480
Michael Ian Black isn't in the book per se, but his name is.

740
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,520
Just over and over again.

741
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,720
It's the title of every chapter.

742
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,360
Please buy it.

743
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,320
Hey, anybody smell that?

744
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I smell another Pulitzer from Mark Twain.

745
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,680
Coming this fall from Mark Twain, Ed, the book.

746
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,880
Ed, the book.

747
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,640
You love Beaches, the book, the movie, the book, the movie, Beaches, the book.

748
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,120
Remember when you loved the book of the movie, Beaches, by Mark Twain?

749
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,680
Get ready to experience magic again.

750
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,320
When he takes, takes to the page with his quill.

751
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,760
Puts it in the paper.

752
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,160
Foo Fighters, come on up, because you won best theme song for a book.

753
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,440
Every time you open it.

754
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,080
I'm in the sky tonight.

755
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,640
I, I think that you can take co-workers.

756
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,520
But I think Justin is right and it has to be worth it.

757
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,400
It can't be like, oh, you know, we kind of click a little bit, I guess.

758
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,760
And I think I could boner.

759
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:27,200
So you could get a lot of the information that you need by going to like business lunch.

760
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,040
Like, do you want to go to business lunch today?

761
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,080
And, you know, that's your talk.

762
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,520
You pick things up.

763
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,720
There's nothing sexually threatening about taking a girl to Chili's.

764
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,760
She will be none the wiser.

765
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,920
Especially if she's in like a pantsuit and you're in a suit.

766
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,840
Clearly we're out of place here, the TGI Fridays.

767
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,520
I have a negative boner right now.

768
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,480
My boner went in.

769
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,800
That, that it'll be the situation where the server will say,

770
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,480
how are these checks being split up?

771
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,640
And you just laugh and laugh and laugh.

772
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,920
Because of course you're going Dutch.

773
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,320
Look at you.

774
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,120
You're in business suits.

775
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,640
She's wearing a pantsuit.

776
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,200
She doesn't want you to pay for shit.

777
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,520
I've got a briefcase here at TGI Fridays.

778
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,080
I'm going to put my styrofoam container of steakums into my briefcase.

779
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,800
I spilled chimmy rito sauce on these documents.

780
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Well, we're going to lose that big case.

781
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
We're going to lose our big client.

782
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,120
He will be put to death in the electric chair because of my sloppy eating.

783
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,040
But she was right.

784
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,480
The guac was worth it.

785
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,160
I'd kill for it.

786
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,040
And now we're in love.

787
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,280
That is how I met your mother.

788
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,200
The end of the show.

789
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,320
Season eight, the end.

790
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,640
Oh, Christ.

791
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,400
Man, I want some marijuana and some chimmy ritos right now.

792
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,160
This show is just filming with our issues.

793
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,120
I'm not even sure chimmy ritos is real.

794
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,920
Why do I hate it up?

795
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,320
Sure they are.

796
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,000
That's chimmy chonga doritos.

797
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,640
It's a mashup.

798
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,120
It's a food.

799
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,880
Chimmy chonga blasted doritos.

800
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,880
It's a food portmanteau.

801
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,040
And also, Tom Cavanagh is there.

802
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,680
Also, Tom Cavanagh is there in the sequel to Ed, the book.

803
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,640
Ed closes down the bowling alley, opens up chilies.

804
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,600
Do you guys know what day it is?

805
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,160
Oh, shit.

806
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,120
Oh, shit.

807
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,680
It's going to be a long episode, but we got to do it because people have to be aware of

808
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,120
the things that happen in August.

809
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,240
What day is it, Griffin?

810
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,560
What day is it?

811
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,160
There's actually a list of days.

812
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,880
It's a-

813
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,840
No, I don't want-

814
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,280
Lighthouse day.

815
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,640
It's an assistant's dog day.

816
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,840
Particularly preposterous packaging day.

817
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,440
Oh, how whimsical.

818
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,240
Oh, golly.

819
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,480
How whimsical.

820
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,200
That is actually the most foppish day of the year, so let's take a moment to celebrate that.

821
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,960
Every month, Griffin chooses an awareness.

822
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,520
Justin acts like he hates it, but I think he loves-

823
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,760
Secretly, he loves it.

824
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,480
So what, Griffin, have you pre-selected one, I hope, this month?

825
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,080
I have, I have, I have.

826
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,320
I mean, there's plenty of good options, like motorsports awareness month and celery, fennel,

827
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,680
and cactus month.

828
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:11,440
That's a lot of things for a month to have in it, but I think that what we need to go with-

829
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,840
You're saying fennel should have its own month?

830
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,800
I'm saying fennel, celery, and cactus should each have their own months and not be-

831
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,280
I just don't know how cactus fits in there.

832
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,240
It's kind of an odd manner.

833
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,160
Yeah, I can eat celery and fennel.

834
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,280
I won't like it, but I definitely can't eat cactus.

835
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,320
I can just drink it.

836
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,600
It is.

837
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,080
Get ready for kindergarten month.

838
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:38,320
We have a lot of pre-pre-pre-preteen listeners that I think we need to take care of their needs.

839
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:43,120
Dear my brother, my brother, and me, I'm going to be a junior in kindergarten and I need some

840
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,000
more cheddar.

841
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,200
Can I sell marijuana?

842
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:54,000
Get ready for kindergarten by finding a bodacious strain of marijuana that will take everyone to

843
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,800
Hightown.

844
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,200
Radical.

845
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,840
Oh, this glue stick purple is delicious.

846
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,520
Glue stick hookup?

847
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,040
You want to go over there to Short Darrell?

848
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,160
My brother, my brother, and me.

849
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,520
What can we tell these kids to get them ready for-

850
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,680
Because it's not just kindergarten, it's school.

851
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,840
We're getting them ready for the idea of school.

852
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,560
Hey, shit's about to get really bad for like 13 years.

853
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,400
Get ready to not do all those things you wanted to do whenever you wanted to do them ever again

854
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,120
for 13 years.

855
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,120
You like cartoons?

856
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,080
You're never going to see those again.

857
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,560
The kids at school are going to know if your tan's fake.

858
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,240
Don't let mommy spray tan you.

859
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,120
Good color.

860
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:39,680
Good base.

861
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,800
You gotta get a good base before you go to kindergarten.

862
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,280
That's so important.

863
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,240
Gotta get a good base.

864
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
You gotta get a beach's lunchbox.

865
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,880
Something relevant for the kids.

866
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,600
I don't even know what the- no joke.

867
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,240
I don't even know what an appropriate lunchbox would be anymore.

868
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,240
Do they do lunchboxes?

869
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,720
Ah, fuck, they might not even do lunchboxes.

870
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,560
They just all roll up with Clif Bars.

871
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,840
Clif Bars and Mel Jeans.

872
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,160
To be fair, I went to kindergarten in the OC, so-

873
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,660
Yeah.

874
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,040
Hey, teach, this water fountain fucking sucks.

875
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,540
Sucks.

876
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,960
Can I get a Brita in this bitch?

877
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,760
Is he then filtered?

878
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,560
I need it bubbly, bitch.

879
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,000
Bubbly, bitch.

880
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,960
Filter this.

881
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,760
Filter this shit.

882
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,200
I'm leaving.

883
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,600
Where can my security guard sit?

884
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:29,780
What?

885
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:36,640
Do- okay, I really do feel like maybe the most important tip is find out if people still have

886
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,360
lunchboxes.

887
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,200
Because god damn, can you imagine being the one guy to roll up and like throw in the Explorer?

888
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,700
Love it.

889
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,760
I got my lunch in here.

890
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,600
That could- that's going to be your whole identity.

891
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,960
Because you can like throw it away and be like,

892
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,440
Oh, it's an ironic lunchbox. That's how I'm meeting you guys.

893
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,320
It's a joke.

894
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,520
I'm one of those hipster kindergartners you read about.

895
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,040
Oh, they have to exist, right?

896
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,440
On their fixie tricycles?

897
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,720
Like, yeah.

898
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,520
It's a fixie big wheel.

899
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,240
Don't worry about it.

900
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,000
Are these free range animal crackers?

901
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,600
Gotta know.

902
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,400
If these have been caged-

903
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,240
I'm ironically eating animals.

904
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,040
How droll.

905
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,840
I don't even like Dunk Roos.

906
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,120
I don't even like Dunk Roos.

907
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,080
Oh, look at me.

908
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,200
I'm part of the proletariat.

909
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,480
So delicious, get it?

910
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,880
Where's my Clif Bar?

911
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,000
Oh man, I really am so disconnected from-

912
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,080
We gotta have some- we gotta have some fucking kids, you guys.

913
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,960
Do ki- somebody just like us- one of us needs to have kids like a scout.

914
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,200
Yeah.

915
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,560
Just so we know what's going on.

916
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,000
So we can- like, we got our fingers in pretty much every demographic,

917
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,600
but we don't have our fingers in any kids.

918
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,680
Get ready for kindergarten.

919
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,560
Don't let adults put their fingers in you.

920
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,200
That's bad.

921
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,080
That's not how it works.

922
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:02,800
That's bad.

923
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,560
It's a bad, bad look.

924
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,240
I think that my problem in trying to answer this question is that I picture

925
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,600
kids as just like tiny adults.

926
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,240
Like, that they're into the exact same stuff that adults are into.

927
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,840
That's why we're not parents.

928
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,320
Because we're all- we all operate under that illusion.

929
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,240
Like, if we ever had kids, we'd be like,

930
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,000
hey, there's a new Grindhouse movie coming out.

931
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,800
Oh, you're three.

932
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,640
Ah, shit.

933
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,040
Oh, you've got to try this seasonal ale.

934
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,320
Ah, you're three.

935
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:28,960
Ah, bummer.

936
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,000
You can't do this.

937
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,280
You want some more bacon?

938
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,160
Ah, you're one.

939
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:32,720
You're one.

940
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,600
Don't have teeth yet.

941
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,800
Can't nom this bacon yet.

942
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,240
Oh man, that is so weird to think about.

943
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,400
There are humans on this planet that can't eat bacon.

944
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,280
Like, little people, just like you and I.

945
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,960
Little people and also Jewish people also can't.

946
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,920
I don't think that's true.

947
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,200
It's not kosher.

948
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,640
Pretty much, I think everyone other than Americans.

949
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:52,880
Yeah.

950
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,680
And Canadians.

951
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,960
Canadians are eating thin ham, though.

952
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,000
Don't let them fucking fool you.

953
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,040
Yeah, that's fair.

954
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,480
Nice try, Canada.

955
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,160
Canada, your music and comedy is great.

956
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,360
Your bacon sucks.

957
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,240
Your bacon is fucking really bad.

958
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,320
I had some smoked bacon yesterday at the Blind Pig in Louisville, Kentucky.

959
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,080
Boy, that was- boy, that was good.

960
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,520
I had bacon ice cream.

961
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,480
Try some bacon ice cream.

962
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,720
I had big chunks of caramelized bacon in it.

963
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,080
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

964
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,680
We really got off topic there.

965
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,440
Yeah, that was a pretty- that was a pretty dramatic shift.

966
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,920
But you know what?

967
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,720
Topic, Anton.

968
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,160
When I was four going on five, nobody gave me any fucking pearls.

969
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,280
Just tough it out, kid.

970
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,640
That's how you get to be like us.

971
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,320
Tough it out, pussy.

972
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,600
My brother, my brother, me.

973
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,080
There it is.

974
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,080
So this is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

975
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:36,800
It's our show.

976
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,240
Thank you for listening to it so much.

977
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,200
Thank you once again for joining us for this hour.

978
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,480
I need a podcast where three people, three grown adults, yell at kids.

979
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,480
We got that for you.

980
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,040
Yeah, we got one of those right here.

981
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,640
We really appreciate everybody talking about our show on Twitter.

982
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,120
Of course, Austin and Mariko is there getting it- getting it done.

01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,480
DuckLips513, CocaineLols.

984
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,400
Oh, oh, oh, we also have to give like a huge thank you to Casey Green.

985
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:23,200
You can find his stuff at CaseyGreen.com.com and he- he wore a MBMBAM t-shirt in the Boston Globe.

986
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,640
On a piece about-

987
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,120
In a picture.

988
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,840
On a piece about webcomic writers living in Boston.

989
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,160
And I want to take a moment to thank- we have- I don't know that we've ever thanked the webcomic

990
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,760
community, but holy shit.

991
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,840
They come out in swarms to talk about-

992
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,160
Yeah.

993
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,200
We're talking about- we're talking about big-name players like Emily Terrible.

994
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,640
Talking about-

995
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,040
I love her.

996
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,040
Talking about boxer, hockey, Darwin.

997
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,960
Talking about all- all the good- all the good comics.

998
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,000
So thank you guys so much.

999
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,280
If you ever want to make comics of us, let us know.

1000
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:53,840
We'll pose.

1001
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:54,960
We'll pose-

1002
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,440
Pose for you.

1003
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,080
Pose for them.

1004
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,440
Pose- pose nude.

1005
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,080
Yeah.

1006
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:58,240
Yeah.

1007
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,000
We want to make naked comics.

1008
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,400
Sell them.

1009
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,360
We'll be super nude.

1010
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,320
How nude do you want it?

1011
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,400
It's a sliding scale.

1012
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,600
Pose as nude as you want.

1013
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,840
You better give me Minotaur legs, though.

1014
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,040
Minotaur legs are no deal.

1015
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,760

And uh-

1023
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:32,880
What?

1024
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,440
Holy shit.

1025
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,920
What? Jesse Thorne had a baby.

1026
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,640
Jesse and Teresa.

1027
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,920
Oh my god.

1028
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,360
Congratulations, you guys.

1029
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,320
It is the most adorable human being I've ever seen.

1030
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,640
Can't eat bacon quite yet.

1031
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,440
It'll get there, though.

1032
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:46,880
Yep.

1033
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,440
Simon Thorne.

1034
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,800
So welcome to the world, little guy.

1035
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:49,600
Thank you-

1036
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,960
Simon Travis Thorne.

1037
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,200
Yeah.

1038
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,200
I can only assume.

1039
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,520
Simon mbnbam Thorne.

1040
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,560
Welcome to the world, little buddy.

1041
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:02,240
Thank you to John Rogers Longwinners for our awesome theme song.

1042
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,680
Go buy that record.

1043
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,200
It's putting the days to bed.

1044
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,480
It's the name of the record, the theme song.

1045
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,000
It's putting days to bed.

1046
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,480
Just listen to it.

1047
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,280
Name of the record.

1048
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,480
Just go buy it and listen to it.

1049
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,480
Spotify it.

1050
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,120
Is that a verb?

1051
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,840
Yeah, you can Spotify things now.

1052
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,360
Verbs are created instantly now.

1053
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,240
You don't have to wait on those.

1054
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:18,740
Okay.

1055
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,360
And that's everything.

1056
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,400
Thank you guys so much.

1057
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,600
Make sure you come back next week and we'll do it again.

1058
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,200
If you wouldn't mind, just like tell someone that you care about.

1059
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,240
Maybe burn them a CD.

1060
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:37,440
Maybe burn them a CD or put it on a floppy disk and put it in their a drive for floppies.

1061
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,800
So that's where floppies go.

1062
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,640
I have a Yahoo that I'd like to consider over the next week.

1063
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,140
Okay.

1064
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,180
All right.

1065
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,040
Something to grow on.

1066
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,840
We'll answer next week.

1067
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,640
Something to grow on.

1068
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,600
Something to think about.

1069
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,640
You're already, you skipped to the thinking.

1070
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,600
This one was sent in by Louie Dog.

1071
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,640
Thank you Louie Dog.

1072
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,280
It's by a Yahoo answers user, Tom12.

1073
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,320
It's kind of a long one.

1074
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,840
Who asks, can pregnant women go swimming?

1075
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,520
Is it possible for pregnant women to go swimming without unintentionally drowning the baby?

1076
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,040
How far, how can the baby breathe if the vagina is underwater?

1077
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,320
Should the mother keep her vagina above the water so the baby can breathe through it?

1078
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,120
I'm Justin McElroy.

1079
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,920
I'm Travis McElroy.

1080
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1081
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,200
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

1082
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:25,920
It's your dad.

1083
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,880
It's going to be right on the lips.
