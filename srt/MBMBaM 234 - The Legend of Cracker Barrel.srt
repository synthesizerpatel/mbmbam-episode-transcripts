1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello, everybody, and welcome to a very special My Brother, My Brother and Me

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,160
Funeral for a Friend, Saying Goodbye to the Hobbit 2015.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,760
And I'm your youngest brother, Tom Bombadil.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,720
Griffin, are you sad that you'll have to let Tom Bombadil go?

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Tom Bombadil lives in my heart now, so he doesn't have to go anywhere

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,960
except for when he stops that heart right up,

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,520
and I have to go to the doctor to get the Bombadil out of me.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,880
We've been watching Lord of the Rings movies for 17 years now,

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
and now we're saying goodbye to the whole franchise.

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
By 17 years, you mean that we watched all six of them back to back,

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
and there goes a quarter of our lives. Approximately 17 years.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,800
We're going to say goodbye to the character of Peter Jackson.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,320
Goodbye, Peter Jackson. What are you going to do?

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Invention.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
He was a motion capture by Andy Serkis.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,760
There's a little Andy Serkis in there, and you just can't see him

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,440
because he's surrounded by CGI.

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,360
I wanted to say Tony Serkis, but I don't know who Tony Serkis is.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,160
I want to take a brief pause from the funeral for a friend,

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,480
saying goodbye to the Hobbit 2015.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,080
I'm a little over the Andy Serkis thing.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,440
I get that he's got a stretchy face. I'm into that.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,360
But this guy has played this range of roles

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,400
that makes you think that maybe, just maybe, people are just lazy.

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,920
We need a monkey.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
Andy Serkis.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,400
Andy Serkis.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,760
We need a little lizard man who loves rings.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
Andy Serkis.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,840
We need Ben Affleck.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,040
Oh no, we double booked him.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,320
Get over here, Serkis.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,600
Get the side of your dick out. You're going to be in Gone Girl.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,960
You're going to play the side of Ben Affleck's dick in Gone Girl.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,840
King Kong.

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
Andy Serkis.

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,840
Get Andy Serkis.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,960
Maybe he just is the only actor in Hollywood

45
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
that doesn't mind having shit stuck to his face.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,240
Maybe.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,720
Do you think that dude is like, can my face be in this one?

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,880
And they're like, sorry, but no.

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,560
We can CGI the shit out of it.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,880
We're going to put Armie Hammer's face on your face.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Can you please put my face on the side of Ben Affleck's dick?

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
And I'll be like, Gone Girl.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,600
I only just met her or something like that.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Can you write some incident, you know, it all ad lib.

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,200
It's fine.

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,920
So anyway, we're saying goodbye to the Lord of the Rings franchise today.

57
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
We got a lot of great guests lined up now.

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,600
I know what you're saying.

59
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,120
The Lord of the Rings franchise did technically wrap up December 17th last year.

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,240
But there's not a lot going on.

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,360
To be fair, critics, I would say that it wraps up when it leaves theaters, which is today.

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,000
Today, they just revoked all of the, if you didn't see it by now.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
Get the fuck out of here, Hobbits.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,360
You're done.

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,320
Just with a broom and it's like, hey, hey, hey, get out.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,920
Your movies are too long and they cost the same as other movies.

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,360
We need shorter movies in here.

68
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,400
We need Taken 3.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
It's a brisk 86 minutes.

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,840
I bet it is because there can't be much movie left there to make, right?

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,040
I didn't see Taken 2.

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
How'd they get her again?

73
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
I think he should keep a close eye on people.

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,280
She ate a cookie that was underneath the box and the stick fell out and fell on top of her.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Andy Serkis dressed up like Liam Neeson and rolled up in the house like,

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,160
come with me.

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,080
We're going to Baskin Robbins.

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
And then they got in the car and-

79
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Come with me if you want Rocky Road.

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
And then she looked and it's just Andy Serkis and he's covered in white.

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
Magic effect balls.

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Let's ask people questions.

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Well, we're not going to ask people questions.

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,320
That would be a pretty weird, like, reversal of our normal form.

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,600
Why don't we ask questions and then just wait for the listeners to answer?

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,080
Okay, here.

87
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,560
Question one.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
How do you make a funny introduction to a podcast?

89
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,440
We've tried 234 times and we can't do it.

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,760
My SO and I currently have an anniversary coming up and we live in the same house.

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,600
Recently, I walked into his office and saw part of what I immediately knew

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
was most likely a section of my gift.

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
It wasn't finished, but I could see what was happening.

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,720
It was on the floor, so not exactly hidden or in the process of wrapping.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Am I good?

96
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
Should I pretend fake surprise when he gives it to me or should I come clean?

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
That's from I Am The Ira Ray.

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
Is that a confirmed Ira Ray?

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,040
No, it is not.

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,520
I don't know.

101
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
It's a fucking Andy Serkis inside an Ira Ray suit.

102
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,800
Yep.

103
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
It's fucking garbage.

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,960
But let's help them out regardless of the fact that they've just perjured themselves.

105
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,760
You lie.

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,640
I mean, you lie and you lie and you lie and you lie and you bury the truth in your heart

107
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,320
where even you can't find it and you lie.

108
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,960
Why aren't you just walking around your house if your anniversary is coming up?

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,760
You got to put them present blinders on.

110
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,480
You know what I mean?

111
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,040
Like a month out before Christmas, I slice the pie before I go into any room.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
I throw a flash bang in there.

113
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,680
I get a snake cam, I put it through the lock on the door and just like scope it out.

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,240
And you know what?

115
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,440
If I see the glimmer, if I see a fucking UPC barcode on anything, I leave the house

116
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
and I come back tomorrow and I try again.

117
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
And you plant some cocaine there.

118
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,840
Why would I?

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,720
Is that the definition of adulthood, the day that you stop looking for your presents and

120
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,760
start actively trying to avoid where you think presents might be?

121
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Yeah, and bad on this dude for leaving these sweet honey pots out on the floor,

122
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,080
haven't even started wrapping it, haven't even finished.

123
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
Like he wanted you to find it.

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,320
What if this is a faint, a faint attack?

125
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,560
Yeah.

126
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,440
What if it's a, what if it's like a double blind bluff?

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,480
You're getting duped.

128
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Where you're like, oh, now I know what it is.

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,360
But you don't.

130
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
It's a car in the driveway with a bow on it.

131
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
You thought it was going to be a bookcase.

132
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,480
Ha, gotcha.

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,800
Actually, he asked us to tell you here on the show.

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
It's a look out the window.

135
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a 2008 Toyota Camry.

136
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,880
How many miles?

137
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,600
Only one previous owner.

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
60,000 miles.

139
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,480
One previous owner.

140
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,360
I don't know.

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,920
This sucks.

142
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,360
We were hanging out with a couple, a friend couple the other night.

143
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,520
It was before Christmas.

144
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,240
A frouple.

145
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,200
And we were all going around.

146
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,920
We were bowling.

147
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,840
And so every time somebody went up to bowl, their significant other said what they were

148
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,800
getting them.

149
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,880
And when they did this transaction with us, they were like, I'm getting them tickets to

150
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,520
this show.

151
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
And then they went up to bowling like, all right, what are you getting them?

152
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
And it's like, I'm getting them tickets to this show.

153
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,200
And it was the same fucking show.

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,080
And I didn't know how to handle that situation.

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
So I elected to do nothing.

156
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
Oh, my God, Griffin.

157
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,040
That's an impossible scenario.

158
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,280
Right.

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,400
You tell one person you've ruined Christmas for that person because then they know what

160
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,960
they're getting.

161
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
And they have to go out and get something else for that person.

162
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,200
It fucking sucks.

163
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,480
It ruins it for both of them.

164
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,760
Yeah.

165
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,160
I mean, you have to choose who you're going to ruin it for.

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,280
Or I think you did the right call actually just letting it happen because that would

167
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,720
be maybe like a sweet thing.

168
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,360
It was bad.

169
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
They survived.

170
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,760
Their marriage survived it.

171
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,080
So I guess everything came out.

172
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
Can you tell us what the show is?

173
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,280
Jersey Boys.

174
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400
So I guess I could go to Jersey Boys back to back nights now.

175
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,360
I think that's the plan.

176
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
And the second time they go back, they'll just like lean over to their neighbors and

177
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,040
be like, oh, you're going to love this next number.

178
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,280
They do a doo wop diddy that you might be familiar with.

179
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
They sing it around a lamppost and then around a trash can that's on fire.

180
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,840
Last night, he kind of buffed the G.

181
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,880
So let's see if he makes it.

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,240
He buffed the G, so let's hold up.

183
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
Oh, God, landed it.

184
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,360
Got it.

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Got it.

186
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Perfect.

187
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
Be careful.

188
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Be careful out there, guys.

189
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
It's a minefield out there.

190
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
You not only have to be careful about avoiding your own presents, you have to avoid other

191
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
people's presents.

192
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
So you don't land in this thorny Kobayashi Maru that I landed.

193
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,960
But this is the thing.

194
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,000
This is the other half of present is like the gift that you give half of what you give

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,480
them is like your reaction, right?

196
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,320
It's not just the present you give them.

197
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,160
It's the reaction of the present they give you.

198
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,800
So, yes, of course, you have to lie.

199
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,280
Of course, you have to act surprised because you can't just sit there and go, I knew what

200
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,240
it was going to be because then you're robbing them of like the joy of giving you a gift.

201
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,160
And if you and if you tell them ahead of time that, you know, you're doing something even

202
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
worse, which is making them have to come up with another gift idea, which is already the

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,760
hardest thing that any human being does ever right now.

204
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
Y'all want to Yahoo?

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,040
Please.

206
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,840
This Yajuru was sent in by level 600 Yajuru Shaman user Drew Davenport.

207
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,320
I don't know if he actually uses he probably has a Yahoo account, right?

208
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,680
He's probably got like a Google or that pops up every time anybody posts any dumb shit

209
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,240
on Yahoo.

210
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
At this point, he probably just has like a force of people that just sends him stuff

211
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
and then he sends it to us, right?

212
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
He's got no he's got elves that work for him at this point.

213
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
He can't hit all the houses.

214
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Well, they need work now that the hobbits wrapped up.

215
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
Can we get people to just start saying hello to Drew on Yahoo answers?

216
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,000
Just commenting.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
Hey, Drew, I'm assuming you're here.

218
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,520
This is an anonymous user.

219
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,640
I've never seen this before.

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,760
There is no user information on this anonymous user.

221
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,680
That's like maybe they got super blocked double blocked from or it's like the president.

222
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
The president of the United States of America, Barack Obama asks.

223
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,720
Barack Hussein Obama asks, what's a clever way to invite someone to medieval times?

224
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
I want to invite someone to medieval times, but I need a clever way to word it.

225
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
So that's not do you want to go with me?

226
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,800
I can't find a way to ask with the theme of medieval times apparent in the invitation.

227
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
Any ideas?

228
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,840
Oh, my God, it's so obvious.

229
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,560
What's that, Travis?

230
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,280
What's obvious?

231
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,120
OK, you have to fake some kind of accident or traumatic event, right?

232
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,240
And then knock them out, probably with chloroform or some kind of drug.

233
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,640
Right.

234
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,280
But then you wake up in the medieval time and you act like you've traveled back in time and you have

235
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,880
to escape this horrible time trap you've fallen into.

236
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
You're you're talking about a black knight kidnapping.

237
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
Yes, you're talking about a kid in King Arthur's court.

238
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,560
And also, you did not come here willingly.

239
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:42,880
Yes.

240
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,000
An unwilling kid in King Arthur's court.

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,640
What happened?

242
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Oh, man, aren't the Diet Pepsi's affordable?

243
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,040
I don't think the illusion of medieval times is as thorough and complete as you think it is, Travis.

244
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
Like that dude's taking a picture of the joust with an iPad mini.

245
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,520
So I don't think it's not going to hold up for long.

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,320
The first time you look at him and you're like, how did we get here?

247
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,440
What did your friends like?

248
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, I got four bars, so I'll just call, I guess.

249
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
Just call a taxi. Call my dad.

250
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,960
Hold up.

251
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,760
Hey, Dad, I think I got time teleported.

252
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
Again.

253
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,000
Again.

254
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,680
I don't get it.

255
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,200
I guess there was like we were like trying to banish the deadites or something.

256
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
But can you come get me?

257
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,440
Have you guys been to medieval times?

258
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
Never in my fucking life.

259
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,600
Are you kidding me?

260
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,720
Justin, if you lose my mind, it's incredible.

261
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,440
I don't doubt it.

262
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,280
I love I mean, I love everything that got going on.

263
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,920
Showmanship.

264
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,520
Mutton legs.

265
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:46,320
Now, I have not been there for 14 years, so I can't speak to how enjoyable it is as like a full blown adult.

266
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
I also can't tell you if the production quality is kept up.

267
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,400
Well, it's great now, because actually, because they're like they're in like the pre Renaissance era.

268
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,160
So oh, that's less, less, less jousting, more like bathing.

269
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,400
Yeah, what more bathing?

270
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
I guess maybe that's when they cracked that code, huh?

271
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
When at what point did we as humans go?

272
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,760
Our bodies fucking stink.

273
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,400
I wish there was something we could do about this.

274
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Perhaps dunk ourselves.

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,840
Could you slap slap with a glove?

276
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
Huh, I challenge you.

277
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,200
I challenge you to join me at medieval times at dawn.

278
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,800
Here's what you're gonna do.

279
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,080
You're gonna walk to school.

280
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,680
You're gonna go, you're gonna run into him in the hallway, and you're gonna be holding your tummy like,

281
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,640
my tummy, and they'll be like, what's wrong with your tummy, Stephen?

282
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,720
And then you, Stephen, be like, I don't know, you tell me.

283
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,080
And then you lift up your shirt to reveal your tummy, and it's covered in leeches.

284
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,440
And then they spell out, will you go to medieval times with me?

285
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
It's gonna take a lot of leeches.

286
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,760
Oh my gosh, it's gonna take so many leeches.

287
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,800
You're gonna need to buy them.

288
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,760
You can get them on Amazon with Prime shipping, but don't leave them on there too long.

289
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,840
You're gonna wanna get some extra blood in your tummy.

290
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,760
You're gonna wanna put some extra blood in there.

291
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,040
I don't know how you do that.

292
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
I don't understand why you can't just be straightforward about it though.

293
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,640
Why do people have to trick people and go on medieval times?

294
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
Do you know how stoked I'd be?

295
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
Why can't you just say, do you wanna go there?

296
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,000
Do you wanna go there?

297
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,480
It's like, you've seen it a bunch of times.

298
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,320
But they want something, I get it though.

299
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,320
You know, you want something, so many things in this life of mundane,

300
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,240
you want something with a little bit of magic pizzazz.

301
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
Can you hire a herald?

302
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
Boop-boop-a-doo!

303
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't think, would you just crinkle us that?

304
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,800
Mr. Travis McElroy requests the pleasure of your company

305
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,680
as you journey through time to adventure at medieval times.

306
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,880
Check yes or no.

307
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
I don't think you would say time quite that much.

308
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,840
It's a little bit redundant.

309
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,080
It's time for adventure.

310
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Let's travel through time to have a good time at medieval times.

311
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,400
What time shall I pick you up?

312
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,280
Check yes or no.

313
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,840
I got you a Morris Day at the time CD to listen to on the way.

314
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,600
And we can read a copy of Time magazine to stay entertained.

315
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
Travis, I know you've been seeking steady employment in Los Angeles.

316
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,440
They season the food with time.

317
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,000
I think that maybe you might've just stumbled into your new whole life.

318
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
Cause you did a really great job.

319
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,040
Thank you, Griffin.

320
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,960
If anyone needs a freelance herald.

321
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,400
To invite, specifically to invite people to medieval times,

322
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,520
Travis will need a bugle.

323
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,800
I will also do fancy parties.

324
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,960
If you want me to introduce as people come in.

325
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,800
And say like Lord Tom of Cruz.

326
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,360
I'll do that.

327
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,760
That's a pretty fancy party.

328
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
Yeah, that's the thing.

329
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,200
You're trying to, you want to set your shit apart.

330
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,440
What's the crossover of Tom Cruise enough that Tom Cruise goes,

331
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
but also they hire Travis to be a herald at the party.

332
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,440
One to one.

333
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,400
It's a circle.

334
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,720
Okay.

335
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,080
All parties.

336
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,840
I got another question.

337
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,880
Dear brothers, I'm making a career change by leaving the safety net of corporate auto insurance

338
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
to instead own and operate a gaming store.

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,560
Board games, card games, and role playing games.

340
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,160
The store has a solid customer base, but recently competition has been spawning.

341
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,040
And that worries me.

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,840
How do I differentiate my brand?

343
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,800
So my Pokemon will bring all the nerds to the yard.

344
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
That's from Dungeon Master Dan in Iowa land.

345
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,600
Dungeon Master Dan.

346
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
Griffin, why you, why me?

347
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,640
Just cause he mentioned Pachamon specifically doesn't mean that Griffin-

348
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,440
How many of us have ever played in a Pokemon tournament?

349
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,960
Me.

350
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,120
I came in second place.

351
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,840
Out of how many?

352
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,680
Like 14.

353
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,080
Nice.

354
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,440
Yeah.

355
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
I think you jack your prices up.

356
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320
Okay.

357
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,360
Wait, what?

358
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,000
Jack them way up.

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,520
You gotta be the most expensive game in town.

360
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,360
And that will help, you know, it'll, it'll, it'll help cut down on your losses,

361
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,240
thanks to this competition.

362
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,120
And it'll also make your shit seem like a premium product.

363
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
Maybe if you spend an extra dollar 50 on a Pokemon expansion pack,

364
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,320
you're going to get the, the, the holofoil magneton in there that you've always wanted.

365
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,840
Your, your heart's true desire.

366
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,800
That's what, that's what I'm saying.

367
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,960
It's a mental connection.

368
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm on some Malcolm Gladwell Pokemon trading card game shit right now,

369
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,720
where if people spend more money on their poke packs,

370
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,600
they think in their brain, I should spend more money on this.

371
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,520
And there's a better chance that I'm going to get a Mewtwo.

372
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
But there's not, right?

373
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
There's not a fucking, of course not.

374
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
But it's, it's, it's all poke psychology.

375
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,160
Maybe you could make your store a little bit more inviting.

376
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
Like maybe make it feel like an event every time people go.

377
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,480
Maybe have a couch there where people could watch TV or movies together.

378
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,440
So you're talking about a couch where people can watch TV and movies together.

379
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,880
Yeah.

380
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,400
There's a store that just opened here in Huntington called Rare Drops.

381
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,320
That's supposed to be a retro gaming store.

382
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,560
And I walked in and there's just people sitting on a couch watching TV.

383
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
And I couldn't figure out how to buy things there,

384
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
but it seemed like a pretty chill store.

385
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Did you walk into someone's house?

386
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,960
This is like my house.

387
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,120
Hey, this is like my house, but you sell Pokemon.

388
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,760
I'm into it.

389
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm into it.

390
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,200
They also had balls.

391
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,200
So what do you mean?

392
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,160
Like a ball pit?

393
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,800
Balls?

394
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,360
Oh.

395
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,240
Oh, beals.

396
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,280
Balls for the drink?

397
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Beals.

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,440
You can make it like any gaming store I've ever walked into that seem to be popular.

399
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,280
And while you stand behind the counter,

400
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,040
chat with somebody about some really specific game that I've never heard of

401
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,640
and don't make eye contact with me.

402
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
So I have to wait really awkwardly to find out where the really weird thing I want is.

403
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Yeah, if you could do better than that, you're already ahead of the pack.

404
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
I think maybe have it.

405
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If you set up a table with four chairs around it

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,640
and just say like, listen, this is free to whoever wants it.

407
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
It's there.

408
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
You're going to get a crew together.

409
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
It's like, you know.

410
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,840
And they're going to plan a heist.

411
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,680
You know, the old legend of the Cracker Barrel where people would gather.

412
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,440
They put a chessboard on the Cracker Barrel and they'd sit at the cracker store

413
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,320
and they every once in a while,

414
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,200
knock over the board to get some crackers out of the barrel.

415
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
You know how that goes?

416
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,840
Maybe you need your own modern version of the Cracker Barrel,

417
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
but it's like a card table where people could just play

418
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,720
UNO or any other board games that are popular right now.

419
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
What the fuck have you been talking about?

420
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
You know, Griffin.

421
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,320
You know how we would gather around the Cracker Barrel.

422
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,640
And there were crackers in the barrel.

423
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,760
That's not a great play.

424
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,680
You're going to have some staleness issues.

425
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,440
You have to carefully lift up the board.

426
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,080
So Steve can get a cracker like every five minutes.

427
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,040
Can I get a cracker?

428
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,560
We just fucking started.

429
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,240
We just fucking started this game of checkers.

430
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,760
We're both super good.

431
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,400
So it's going to go.

432
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
Please just one cracker.

433
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm real.

434
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm eating some chili over here.

435
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
I need something to dunk a brew.

436
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,640
Just one cracker.

437
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,360
Come on, guys.

438
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
But it's never just one cracker.

439
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,840
It's never just one fucking cracker with you, Steve.

440
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
Old Steve three crackers, they call him.

441
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
It's the only cracker store in town.

442
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,320
Come on.

443
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,920
I don't have to drive to Texarkana to get my cracker fix.

444
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,880
Please.

445
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,440
You can play.

446
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
You can set up another game of checkers.

447
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,720
All right, Steve.

448
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,680
We're going to pick up the board.

449
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,760
You get all the crackers you want now.

450
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,080
All right.

451
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,600
We don't want to have to lift it up again.

452
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Okay, let me just get.

453
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,600
Well, guys, I needed them all, but I still want some.

454
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,880
Steve, we specifically said get all the crackers.

455
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,120
Okay, we're going to do it one more time.

456
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,160
One more time, Steve.

457
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,280
Why don't you just have two barrels?

458
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,280
What do you think we are, the Rockefellers, Steve?

459
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
You could play your game like on the porch.

460
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
Just set it down on the porch floor.

461
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,320
Maybe if we had some kind of giant carpet rug chess board,

462
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,680
but that's ridiculous.

463
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,840
Well, let me knit one of those up for you, Cracker Barrel LLC.

464
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,400
Get there.

465
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
Get there for Pancake Sunday Fun Day.

466
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,160
You know what?

467
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,520
Here's my God's honest answer.

468
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,160
Because we've been playing D&D for the Adventure Zone,

469
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,920
our new hit podcast, and I've gotten a lot of tweets

470
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,280
from people saying, how easy is it for us to play D&D?

471
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
And it's not just that.

472
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,360
Like whenever we write on Polygon about a local gaming experience,

473
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,080
be it a board game or a local video game,

474
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
people always say, this looks fun,

475
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,720
but I don't have anybody to play it with.

476
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I still feel like there's shit like Meetup and all that stuff.

477
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
But I feel like if you can come up with some way

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,000
of getting people together,

479
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,640
like some sort of dating service,

480
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,960
but platonic, Catan matchups.

481
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
I really do feel like that's something that,

482
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,640
I'm sure there's absolutely lots of solutions for that.

483
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,160
I know that Dragon's Lair,

484
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,160
my local friendly neighborhood game store does that,

485
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,520
but I don't know.

486
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
I just feel like there's still,

487
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,480
that's still something waiting to be mastered.

488
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
And if you can crack that code, like fuck yeah,

489
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
I would get down on that.

490
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
How about every Saturday, like you demo a new game, right?

491
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
And then you offer a discount on that game during the demo.

492
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
So it's like, we're gonna break out the Bioshock.

493
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,880
It's a great idea.

494
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,480
Thank you.

495
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,920
And it's a great idea to do a clinic

496
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,160
and teach people how to play a game.

497
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,560
Like have somebody who actually knows the game

498
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,080
and then have them teach other people.

499
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
And then those people could have like groups

500
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,600
and you could just have like a day

501
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,720
where people play that thing.

502
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,040
Maybe a clinic is the first hour.

503
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,920
And then the rest of the day,

504
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,400
it's just like get a game together and play it.

505
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,840
Cause that's always the, like for me,

506
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,600
opening up a new game,

507
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
you spend the first 45 minutes saying like,

508
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,240
oh wait, hold on.

509
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
I think we're supposed to, okay, yeah, great.

510
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,040
So just to have a dude there who's played it already before

511
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,960
and figured that out who says like, okay, yeah,

512
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,240
if you wanna do that, you gotta do this.

513
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,120
And then, you know, you have like a popcorn machine

514
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,880
or something and you let people go to town

515
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,600
and make it a thing.

516
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Also, I don't wanna be mean,

517
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
but if you could make your store

518
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,080
the best smelling game store in town.

519
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,920
Cool, cool.

520
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,760
And I'm not just talking about like BO or whatever

521
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,440
cause the one I used to go to in Cincinnati

522
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,120
was very clean,

523
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,360
but it also smelled like really strong cleaning products

524
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,160
all the time.

525
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,440
I would go in there for it.

526
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,120
You know what's gonna fix that Griffin?

527
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,480
Popcorn machine.

528
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
Popcorn machine, maybe.

529
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,920
I mean, yeah, well,

530
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,000
cause you could get the BO popcorn smell

531
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,640
and then it's just gonna sound like a stinky regatta

532
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,200
and you don't want a stinky regatta smell.

533
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
You just fucking Febreze it,

534
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
neutralize the smell.

535
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
I want it to smell like nothing.

536
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,200
Travis was kidding about this,

537
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,920
but you could honestly like in so many specialty stores

538
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,360
that I've been to in my life,

539
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,160
you could make a huge leap forward

540
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,280
just like being personable

541
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,680
and like welcoming people when they come into the store

542
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,120
and like acting like you actually want them

543
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,240
to spend money there.

544
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,080
Like I'm not even joking.

545
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
It's a pervasive issue.

546
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,640
Make people feel welcome and don't eyeball them

547
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
like you think they're gonna steal

548
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,440
every time somebody walks into the store.

549
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,160
That for me is like every time I walk in,

550
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm like, I'm a pretty average looking dude

551
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,960
and I get eyeballed every time I walk into anywhere.

552
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,920
And if you're worried about that,

553
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,440
only sell huge board games.

554
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,320
Nobody's ever shoplifted a copy of Lords of Waterdeep

555
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,600
cause that thing is the size of a fucking like coffin.

556
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,600
It's like shoplifting a coffin.

557
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,160
You can't do it.

558
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,120
You guys wanna Yahoo?

559
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,560
Oh, can't I?

560
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,320
Challenge accepted.

561
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,120
By the way, Travis,

562
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,400
just not to like cause drama or like derail,

563
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,880
you look like if anyone's ever looked like a fucking brigand,

564
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,600
it's you.

565
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,160
Fair enough.

566
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,520
Not like a skeezy thief,

567
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,040
but like a kind of cool Douglas Fairbanks thief.

568
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,760
Do you guys think I could pull off like a roguish scar

569
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
across my eye?

570
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,000
I think you, yeah.

571
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,680
I think you absolutely should get out there Trav

572
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
and I think you should start living hard

573
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
and I think you should get cut.

574
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Thank you Griffin.

575
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
If you keep eating the way you're eating,

576
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
you're gonna get a roguish scar across where your heart is

577
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,240
because of the stint.

578
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
I have been eating so much better.

579
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,000
It's 2015.

580
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,840
I have been eating vegetables.

581
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,080
I have been eating more vegetables

582
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,480
and I've been eating even more vegetables.

583
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
You don't need to make a production out of it.

584
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,600
This Yahoo was sent in by Dan Green.

585
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,160
Thank you, Dan.

586
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

587
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,440
Eric the Bean, who asks.

588
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
Help, a witch turned me into bean.

589
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
Need anti-bean spell.

590
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,800
Dear wizards.

591
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,840
Need to break curse.

592
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,560
Eric the Bean asks,

593
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,920
if Obama proposed a law saying Obama

594
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,800
shall be supreme judge over all Americans.

595
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,680
Okay.

596
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,640
And single-handedly determine,

597
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,480
carry out and interpret the life

598
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,560
and death determination of every American.

599
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,240
And right before that,

600
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
pass a constitutional amendment saying

601
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,600
all other amendments in the entire U.S. Constitution

602
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
are hereby repealed and no longer apply.

603
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
And at gunpoint,

604
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,200
all 50 states ratified it for fear of being shot.

605
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
I'm gonna shoot you Nebraska.

606
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,320
Would you vote in support of a ballot question

607
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,160
giving Obama the right to determine

608
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,880
who in USA shall live and who shall die,

609
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,440
knowing if you vote no on this

610
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,160
and 99.9997% of Americans fearfully vote yes,

611
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,400
you will probably be rounded up and killed.

612
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,840
Wow.

613
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,040
A lot to unpack.

614
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
There's a lot to think about here.

615
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,040
I mean, this person got our governmental,

616
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,720
like, structure checks and balances,

617
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,240
separation of powers, fucking aces.

618
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,080
I saw that episode of Schoolhouse Rock

619
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,880
where the thing was like,

620
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
I'm just a bill, yes, I'm only a bill,

621
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,680
and the president can kill anyone.

622
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
Good, good news, Billy.

623
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
I survived the president's supreme judgment.

624
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
Okay, so break it down for me, Griffin.

625
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
The deal is-

626
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,160
Separate this and, like, parse this out.

627
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,880
Can, if Obama proposed a law saying

628
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,800
Obama shall be supreme judge over all Americans.

629
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,440
Okay.

630
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,800
He could single-handedly determine,

631
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,920
carry out and interpret the life

632
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,440
or death determination of every American.

633
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,800
I guess that just means, like, Steve Johnson,

634
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,840
fuck him dead.

635
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
I'm making a list and I'm checking it twice.

636
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
If the states don't ratify it,

637
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,120
President Obama will shoot the state.

638
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,520
Got it.

639
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,200
And I'm still a little confused about the logistics of that.

640
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,680
Would you vote for it?

641
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,800
Because if you vote no and it passes, you'll be dead.

642
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,120
So the first thing I want to hit here is,

643
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,800
has this gentleman, like, seen President Obama lately?

644
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,520
I don't think the dude wants to be president anymore.

645
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
I don't like it anymore.

646
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,800
He doesn't really look like he's having,

647
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
like, a grand old time doing it.

648
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
He's probably just about done.

649
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,160
But what I'm saying is he's been, like,

650
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,760
he's been, like, he's in his fucking, like, fourth quarter now.

651
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,920
And he's, like, lost his mind.

652
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,720
I love it.

653
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,400
I love seeing him pull out the big guns

654
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
and be, like, two free years of college.

655
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
Eat my butt.

656
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,520
Two free years of college.

657
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,320
How about that?

658
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
Oh, a Keystone pipeline, you're going to build that?

659
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,840
How about the Keystone pipeline into my butt,

660
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,880
which is where you're going?

661
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,040
I think that this dude's,

662
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,800
I think if he keeps, you know,

663
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,280
pulling off these grand gestures,

664
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,160
and, yeah, I love it,

665
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,960
maybe on, like, day, you know, his last day in office,

666
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
he's, like, let me just try one last thing.

667
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,920
Supreme judgment.

668
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,680
But then what if his supreme judgment,

669
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,040
he's, like, a party dude?

670
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,160
And he's, like, hey,

671
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
because that's where he's been going now,

672
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,320
as far as I can tell.

673
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,160
And he's just, like, hey, here's my judgment.

674
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,360
Everybody party on.

675
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,400
Free pizzas.

676
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
Everybody gets a $5 hot and ready.

677
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,560
What if he names himself supreme judge and says,

678
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,000
I just granted myself the power to decide

679
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,360
who lives and who dies.

680
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
And then the next thing he says is,

681
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,640
hey, you're all cool.

682
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
And then we all, and he's, like,

683
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
but remember this, you owe me.

684
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,440
I spared you today.

685
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,480
And for the rest of your life,

686
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,840
you have to go around knowing, like, man,

687
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,280
Obama could have blown me out of the sky.

688
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,200
Could have gotten real fucking bad,

689
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,920
but it didn't because Obama was pretty tight that day.

690
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,440
What if he just says, like,

691
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,520
everybody lives and abolishes death?

692
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
Oh, my God.

693
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,920
Whoa.

694
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,420
Whoa.

695
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
It's the tuck everlasting amendment.

696
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
All these other amendments are out.

697
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
New, and I'm going to pass some new ones.

698
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
These are my midnight amendments.

699
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,960
Number one, be cool.

700
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,960
Sorry, Obama.

701
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,520
What was that?

702
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,000
Be cool. Amendment two, come on.

703
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
Uh, breaking news coming from, uh,

704
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm Wolf Blitzer, breaking news.

705
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,160
The internet has been shut down

706
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,640
because of a almost conical terminal violation

707
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
of the first midnight amendment.

708
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,360
It was not cool at all.

709
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,920
It could not be cool for like a second

710
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,680
as Obama later clarified.

711
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,400
And it has been completely deactivated

712
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,920
via the button to shut down the internet

713
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,600
that Obama kept under his ass this whole time.

714
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,720
User, uh, user Kobe Sucks said,

715
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,040
uh, Lakers suck my dick.

716
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,360
That was a clear violation of the first amendment

717
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
and he will be rounded up.

718
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,600
The first midnight amendment.

719
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
And he will be punished with the second midnight amendment.

720
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,040
Come on.

721
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,760
Come on.

722
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,800
Now I'm going to, uh,

723
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,880
let's go to Twitter to get some reactions.

724
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
Okay. No, that's right.

725
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
Uh, the whole internet has been shut down.

726
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,680
Wow. I can breathe for the first time in like 10 years.

727
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,520
Guys, the news slowed way down.

728
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,800
I guess we can all celebrate that first amendment ourselves.

729
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,480
Just fucking chill.

730
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,040
You know, this whole Supreme judge Obama thing

731
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,080
is really working out.

732
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
I don't think it's a bad idea sometimes.

733
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,560
I think, I think we've been in such a standstill

734
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
governmentally speaking.

735
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,240
I just fucking nothing's happening to make my life better.

736
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
And I think that I think that's my favorite thing about

737
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,680
my favorite thing about this question is the idea of like,

738
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,640
you know, Obama hasn't been able to get anything done

739
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
in his eight years of presidency.

740
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,560
And so what he needs to do is one big thing.

741
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,920
Yeah. Yeah.

742
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,400
Yeah.

743
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,320
And then just like, say like, you know what?

744
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm tired of not getting things done.

745
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
I'm going to get things done now.

746
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,280
But you know what sucks?

747
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,440
You know what sucks is even if Obama was like,

748
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,760
I'm the Supreme judge, everyone can just be cool.

749
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,320
Shit's going to get real tight from now on.

750
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,560
Fucking like Ted Cruz would be like,

751
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
no, I don't want to be cool.

752
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,160
It's our amendment right to not be cool anymore.

753
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,320
And Obama's like, I repealed the Bill of Rights.

754
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,440
It's just be cool now.

755
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,480
You don't have a leg to stand on, Ted.

756
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,280
Number two, come on, Ted.

757
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Number three.

758
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Nice.

759
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,000
Nice.

760
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,720
President Matthew McConaughey.

761
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,720
So to review, the three midnight amendments are one,

762
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,000
be cool.

763
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,120
Two, come on.

764
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,440
Three, nice.

765
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Nice, okay, got it.

766
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,040
As long as you don't violate those three midnight amendments,

767
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,080
you're fine, right?

768
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,360
Like you're fine.

769
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,720
Yeah, but even if you don't.

770
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
But if you do, oh, the swift judgment.

771
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,080
Holy shit.

772
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,920
Blood will fill the streets.

773
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,400
What if there's like a purge where one day a year

774
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
the three midnight amendments don't apply

775
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
and nobody's fucking cool.

776
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
Everyone's like, oh, time to let my hair down.

777
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,080
Fuck you, Lakers, I feel so right.

778
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,680
And the judgment squads walk the streets.

779
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,120
Bring out your uncool.

780
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,640
My grandfather was uncool the other day.

781
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
He said something slightly racist.

782
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,920
Death to your grandpa.

783
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,480
Not cool.

784
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,800
I asked for grandpa, nice.

785
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,080
I was playing Super Smash Brothers

786
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
and my little brother walked in and unplugged my Nintendo 64.

787
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,000
Not cool, Dylan.

788
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,320
Not cool at all.

789
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,600
Judgment will be swift.

790
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
My friend Richard chose odd job.

791
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,520
Not cool.

792
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,800
Richard, you know the rules.

793
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,840
He's harder to shoot.

794
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,000
No odd job.

795
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,080
But you aren't Richard.

796
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,040
You odd job picking son of a bitch.

797
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,440
Uncool.

798
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,160
Uncool.

799
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,440
As Obama floats in his judgment chair.

800
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
This is the one day a year I get to use my judgment chair.

801
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,920
Still worth all the, what?

802
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,600
That's not a half bad Obama.

803
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,320
Thanks, Griffin.

804
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,560
I just talk like Dobber from Coach.

805
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,160
Brothers separated at birth.

806
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
It's a new year.

807
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,160
It's 2015.

808
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,120
The con is on.

809
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,480
And that means that it's time for you to reinvent your life

810
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,120
in a new form that is more pleasing to yourself

811
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,080
and those around you.

812
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,960
How are you going to do that?

813
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
Well, you need a new career.

814
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,800
What career?

815
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,600
I got one.

816
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,680
How about you learn one of the most in demand job skills

817
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,840
going right now, coding.

818
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,960
Heraldry.

819
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,480
Heraldry is number one.

820
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,760
Number two is coding.

821
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,920
Make 2015 the year you learn how to code.

822
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,520
And if you do want to learn how to herald,

823
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
I'm teaching a symposium this weekend.

824
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
There's still a couple spots available.

825
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,640
It's $250, but the price of the book is included in there.

826
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,280
Wow.

827
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,320
Travis, I had a full high energy lead-in.

828
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,520
I was about to nail the dismount on that ad

829
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,840
and you completely-

830
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,520
Well, Justin, I really want-

831
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
That was a huge violation of the First Amendment.

832
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,040
I was just about to say one month rails.

833
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,760
You trampled all over Justin's First Amendment rights.

834
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,760
Both of you can burn in hell.

835
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,120
Do the ad yourselves.

836
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,760
Justin.

837
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,800
Sorry, I can't hear you.

838
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,160
Obama's judgment chair is hovering over you in Austin.

839
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,320
It's about to hit you with a death ray.

840
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,880
So Justin.

841
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,520
Sorry.

842
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,560
Justice you, Griffin.

843
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,120
Justin.

844
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, dead Griffin.

845
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,280
Come on.

846
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,520
Okay.

847
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,800
Imagine for a moment you can build your own websites overnight.

848
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,280
Your resume could stand out when applying for a job

849
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,800
because you know Rails, you know Ruby, you know HTML,

850
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,640
you know GitHub, you know Groupon.

851
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,480
You know Grubhub.

852
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,400
You just fucked up a lot of stuff.

853
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,760
Ruby and Rails are the same thing.

854
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,120
GitHub is not it.

855
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,200
Groupon is a coding language.

856
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
You got that part right.

857
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,520
One month rails is the easiest way to learn how to code.

858
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
I did this with their HTML program.

859
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
There are little 30 minute lessons.

860
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,640
Some are even shorter than that.

861
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,520
Most are.

862
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,560
30 minute lessons for 30 days and you could be an expert in coding.

863
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,040
Honestly, the hardest thing you're going to have is knowing when to stop

864
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
because the lessons are really fun to do.

865
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,040
Once you start figuring it out, it's a lot of fun to piece together.

866
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,240
I knew a little HTML going in, but it really was an awesome way to learn.

867
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,040
They've got a lot of great videos and tutorials.

868
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,040
It works because you make the stuff along with them.

869
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,560
You're watching, but you're also coding from the first lesson.

870
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,560
It's really excellent.

871
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,160
I might do this for the Ruby on Rails one

872
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,440
because I've been having some trouble with my combined comparison operators.

873
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,760
Will it teach me how to use Google?

874
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,280
Probably in a roundabout way because you might end up Googling the URL.

875
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,440
Cool.

876
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,680
There's a one month iOS app.

877
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,320
Build an app.

878
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,120
Go build an app.

879
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,560
That's how everybody's making money.

880
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,680
You know that's where all the money is?

881
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
They're all in the app store.

882
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,880
I actually want to do that one.

883
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,080
We've made $14 billion off of the Bim Bam, the app experience.

884
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,400
Have we discontinued that app yet?

885
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,520
No, please do not go buy it.

886
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,040
Please don't buy it.

887
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
Don't buy our shitty app.

888
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,280
You should buy that app.

889
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
We haven't done anything.

890
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,280
We get a dollar.

891
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,520
We get a dollar.

892
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,080
It's like a roundabout.

893
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,720
I don't know what I'd do without that crisp $20 check coming in every month from Libsyn.

894
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,600
One month, 30 days, 30 minutes in each of those days and you can learn a new skill.

895
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,840
Give them the URL.

896
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,240
One month.com slash my brother.

897
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,600
Typically, it's going to cost you $99, but if you join right now, you're going to get

898
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,720
a one-time discount of 25% off.

899
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,240
That's one month.com.

900
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,520
And that's one, the word.

901
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,360
You suck.

902
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,200
Can I get one word out edgewise, Travis?

903
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,440
I just want to make it clear that it wasn't the number one.

904
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,000
It's one O-N-E month.com.

905
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,280
O-N-E month.com slash my brother.

906
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,200
And please, if you're in the LA area, do slash my brother.

907
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,760
Slash his tires and then slash me across the face.

908
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,280
Give me a roguish scar.

909
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,560
Give her a roguish scar.

910
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,280
I'm hungry.

911
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,640
I was going to make an O-N-Eaters joke in there because of the one-month confusion.

912
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,640
Because it reminded me of the O-N-Eaters joke from that thing you do the movie.

913
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,120
Justin, I got good news for you, my hungry lad.

914
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,120
Hit me with your best shot.

915
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,720
I know your life is hectic and I know that you make bad snacking decisions from time to time.

916
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:33,840
I know that you ate 14 meters of rope licorice the other day and that's not a solid decision.

917
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,600
Eating up a lot of empty calories there.

918
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,840
What if I told you you could get over a hundred nutritionist approved snacks

919
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,320
through fucking Nature Box?

920
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,840
Have you heard?

921
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,680
Is Nature Box like a new sponsor?

922
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,440
Have we had them before?

923
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
We've had them like a billion times.

924
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,320
Nature Box has something for everyone.

925
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,920
All with zero artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners.

926
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,040
Zero grams of trans fats and no high fructose corn syrup.

927
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
Get out of here, current syrup.

928
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Current syrup?

929
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,800
Get out, current syrup!

930
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,040
Let me hit you with this.

931
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,000
You're having a, you got those three o'clock blues.

932
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,080
Having a hard time getting through your working day.

933
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,200
I mean, all three of our jobs are either non-existent or, you know, imaginary goofy bullshit.

934
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,400
But it's three o'clock and you're in a slump.

935
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,680
How about you chew on some sriracha roasted cashews?

936
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,000
Or pistachio power clusters?

937
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Or Big Island pineapple?

938
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,400
Justin, that sounds like something that you can get into with your fucking Big Island lifestyle.

939
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm tired of living off sponge cake.

940
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,560
Something a little healthier.

941
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,120
You can try Nature Box for free with a free trial box that has five of their most popular snacks.

942
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,360
You heard me, five free snacks.

943
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,160
Five of them.

944
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,960
Free.

945
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,080
Snacks.

946
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,880
Five of them.

947
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,440
There's literally no reason not to do it.

948
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,200
Don't miss out.

949
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
Don't be a dummy.

950
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,600
Don't be a hungry lad like my Big Island Justin boy.

951
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,000
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you'll get a free trial box of tasty snacks.

952
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
You're going to love these snacks.

953
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,600
You're going to love these free snacks.

954
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,880
If you say it three times and people remember it, that's like radio ads 101.

955
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,040
And Candyman comes and says, eat some candy.

956
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,360
And you say, no, I'm going to eat Nature Box.

957
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah, naturebox.com slash my brother is the address.

958
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Fuck candy, fuck candy, fuck candy.

959
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,160
And now you memorize that.

960
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,240
Eat these free snacks.

961
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,000
I should say nature box in there too.

962
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,120
Got a message for Bobby and Bizza David from Nutter, Taker, and Eric.

963
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,680
You're apparently friends with these gangsters.

964
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,880
I feel bad for Eric.

965
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,120
Yeah, he's Nutter.

966
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,920
He's Taker.

967
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,720
I'm Eric.

968
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,240
But I want to be Nutter.

969
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,200
You can't, Eric.

970
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,080
You can't, Eric.

971
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,640
You're Eric.

972
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,120
Hey Bizza, I bet you're wondering why Bobby is making you listen to my bim bam again.

973
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,640
It's so you can hear this message.

974
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,960
Congratulations on getting married and stuff.

975
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,760
This is super late.

976
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,800
But as long as the brothers macro don't mention when this message was submitted,

977
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
nobody has to know whose fault it is.

978
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,400
And now a jingle from Griffin.

979
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,840
You can't just do that.

980
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,680
You can't just work like that.

981
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,240
I'm not some sort of falcon.

982
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,600
Oregon grinder monkey to dance for your dollars.

983
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,400
But he will dance for you.

984
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,240
Maybe you should reconsider.

985
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,520
My friend Eric might have to have a word which is

986
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,320
make a little chin music with him, Eric.

987
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,280
Shouldn't Taker?

988
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,960
No, I said Eric.

989
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,800
It's time to earn your nickname, Eric.

990
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,120
Earn your nickname, Eric.

991
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,680
Bizza, I'm really sorry that Bobby made you listen to this episode.

992
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,320
Yeah, what?

993
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,760
Bizza, did you just like try it once and decide it wasn't for you?

994
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,400
That's fine.

995
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,120
Like that, I get it.

996
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,640
It's not for everyone.

997
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,680
But I don't know why Nutter, Taker, and Eric would go out of their way to tell us that you

998
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
didn't like our program.

999
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,760
Hey, brothers.

1000
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,800
Bizza hates you.

1001
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,080
Bizza hates your guts, but we got our message from people she hates.

1002
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,200
It's again, it's fine.

1003
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,000
We don't mind.

1004
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,160
We're just kidding.

1005
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,960
Happy marriage.

1006
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Got a message from Molly from Claire.

1007
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,800
Here's the message.

1008
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,920
I'm going to read it.

1009
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,000
Happy birthday, belated Molly.

1010
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,500
Nope.

1011
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,600
Happy belated birthday, Molly.

1012
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,320
I couldn't get Lorelei or Rory to do this, but I think it's pretty good next option.

1013
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,040
I love and appreciate you always.

1014
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,720
Thank you for everything.

1015
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,640
That's from Claire for Molly.

1016
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm assuming those are those Gilmore Girls characters.

1017
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,120
I think it's Hunger Games.

1018
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,240
It's those Hunger Games.

1019
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,520
I think it's the Gilmore Games.

1020
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,800
It's time for the Gilmore Games.

1021
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
I don't want to have to hunt my daughter with a bow.

1022
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,840
You got to.

1023
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,760
I haven't seen the show.

1024
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,800
God, I wish I'd seen the show.

1025
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,240
I'd be making some really great goofs.

1026
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,000
We'll just say Gilmore Games and just slide that across the desk to SNL.

1027
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,720
Listen, SNL, you can have this one.

1028
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,200
We got it.

1029
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,680
Gilmore Games.

1030
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,480
Gilmore Games.

1031
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,280
This is bad.

1032
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,780
Okay.

1033
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,440
The Fraggles Games.

1034
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,560
Let me hit you with this.

1035
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,520
Gilmore Gate.

1036
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,320
Think about it.

1037
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,120
Just go ahead.

1038
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,440
It's about ethics in bed and breakfast ownership journalism.

1039
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
I've seen one episode and like- They live in Star Hollow.

1040
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,400
Is it like the OC?

1041
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,600
Because I would watch that.

1042
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,000
It's like the OC, but more wholesome and lovely.

1043
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,280
And I think she- Okay.

1044
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,880
So I think Lorelei has a friend who like can't remember her name.

1045
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,160
And I want to say it's like Flappy.

1046
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,680
I don't think that's true.

1047
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,080
But it's like a I think like a birdish name.

1048
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,920
Welcome to Gilmore Guys.

1049
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,360
Our podcast where we talk about what Gilmore Girls might be about.

1050
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,520
Gilmore Guys is a podcast.

1051
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,760
Another podcast beef foraged.

1052
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,640
I bet they actually watch it or have some vague idea of what the show's concept is.

1053
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,480
I watched several seasons of Gilmore Girls and I couldn't tell you what it's about.

1054
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,000
There are like 130 episodes of Gilmore Guys.

1055
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,200
Go listen to that podcast.

1056
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,120
It's got- Don't give them a free plug.

1057
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,000
I'll give them a free plug.

1058
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,880
It's a good podcast.

1059
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,320
The people on it are really funny.

1060
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,960
Fine.

1061
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,080
Here's your free plug.

1062
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,880
Oh, hey there, everybody.

1063
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,600
I'm Guy Branham and welcome to Pop Rocket,

1064
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,520
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture we all love to love.

1065
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,200
With me to talk TV, film, music, and anything else entertaining

1066
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,840
are journalist Margaret Wappler, academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

1067
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,520
digital strategist Wyndham Mitchell, and comedian Santina Muhoff.

1068
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,560
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark filled discussion about pop culture

1069
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,960
by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

1070
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,000
No name calling, no rudeness, just straight talk and a lot of role play.

1071
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,600
I'm only 30-something for another year.

1072
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,480
Me too.

1073
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,000
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

1074
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,040
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

1075
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,560
I have an awkward friend.

1076
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,040
Over the past month or so, he's been going to the local grocery store

1077
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,720
every Saturday to buy groceries.

1078
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,400
He does this because he has a thing for this girl who works there

1079
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,960
and she is a checkout clerk every Saturday.

1080
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,640
They don't know each other's names, but he's been doing things

1081
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,880
like buying healthier foods to try to impress her.

1082
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,480
We said that once as a joke.

1083
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,080
He plans to buy a flower soon.

1084
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
And while she is scanning his groceries,

1085
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,240
he wants to ask her what she thinks of it.

1086
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,720
And if she likes it, the plan is to leave it at her station.

1087
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,880
And when she tells him he forgot it, he will say,

1088
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,960
no, it's where I wanted it to go.

1089
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,200
How do I talk my friend out of this terrible plan confused in Coralville?

1090
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,040
Listen, bad news, our listeners have weaponized questions

1091
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,480
and they're trying to kill us.

1092
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,400
I just fainted for a second.

1093
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,160
You just deployed a viral toxin through your email to us

1094
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,640
and I breathed in the fumes and now I'm dead now.

1095
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,040
Again, my second death of the episode.

1096
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,160
I think it's romantic.

1097
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,360
No, fuck off.

1098
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,640
No, I don't, not at all.

1099
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,040
This person's just at the fucking savers trying to make a buck

1100
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,080
and your friend is gonna squeeze her out of her skin.

1101
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,800
Well, I have been over this.

1102
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,560
Let's hit this point again because apparently it didn't sink in.

1103
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,480
If the person you're talking to, man or woman, cannot leave-

1104
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,600
Can't run away from you full speed.

1105
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,040
Can't run away from your fucking whack game,

1106
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,760
then you cannot attempt to get a date with that person.

1107
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,520
It's not a lady zoo.

1108
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,960
Let me make a broader point.

1109
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,680
I agree with you, Justin, 100%.

1110
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,640
Here's my broader point.

1111
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,720
If you were about to fucking step in here and say

1112
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,040
this is not a half bad idea, I'll quit the podcast.

1113
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all.

1114
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,400
The exact opposite.

1115
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,480
My point is this, the idea of doing a big romantic gesture

1116
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,840
already only works if they were already going to,

1117
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,360
and this is outside of this realm,

1118
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,240
because you're right, ladies,

1119
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
I'm taking this to a different level.

1120
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,560
So imagine it's not an employee of a place.

1121
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,400
If you're gonna do a big romantic gesture,

1122
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,880
it only works if they also would have said yes

1123
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,320
if you would have just asked them.

1124
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,560
I don't believe that there's a person who would have said no

1125
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,240
if you just say like, hey, wanna go on a date?

1126
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,240
But then you like leave a rose at their station

1127
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,320
and they're like, okay, now I'll say yes.

1128
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,920
But we think that like big romantic gesture tips the scales.

1129
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,960
But really what it does is it just sets you up to be like,

1130
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,320
if it goes bad, it goes way worse.

1131
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,920
I just think that a romantic gesture

1132
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,800
for the initial incitement of a romance

1133
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
is like a very uncomfortable play,

1134
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,920
because it's a very tenuous situation.

1135
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,840
And like, I don't know, it just, it makes me very uncomfortable.

1136
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,880
Doesn't even factor in,

1137
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,440
because if this person had been getting vibes

1138
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,160
from the cashier, if she was craving his wave,

1139
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,600
his awkward, awkward wave,

1140
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,120
then he would like probably have picked up on that

1141
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,240
and just asked her out.

1142
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,800
But this doesn't sound like that type of dude.

1143
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,800
Yeah, it's just, man, this just sucks.

1144
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,440
I get your discomfort

1145
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,080
because it's hard to like talk to a friend out of that

1146
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,400
because I've certainly had friends

1147
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,600
who thought that this is just how the fucking world works.

1148
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,760
And it's hard to like shatter the illusion for them,

1149
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,600
but goddamn, somebody's got to.

1150
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,560
Well, the other side of this is what you're not saying is,

1151
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,760
basically what he's doing is he's afraid,

1152
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,080
because this is a thing that his backup,

1153
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,680
if she doesn't like the rose,

1154
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,880
he's not gonna leave it there.

1155
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,400
Or he says like, oh, thanks, I forgot it, great.

1156
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,600
And he's leaving himself out because he's afraid.

1157
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,920
And so it's the idea of like,

1158
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,800
he wants it to appear to be a romantic thing,

1159
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,080
but really it's that he's not willing to just ask her.

1160
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,440
And so like that in and of itself,

1161
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,640
I say, you say to your friend like,

1162
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,560
hey, if you're not ready to just ask her,

1163
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,000
then don't do this.

1164
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,600
Don't fucking sidestepping.

1165
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,320
Like it's gross, it sucks.

1166
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,640
It sucks to use this person's place of employment

1167
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,920
as a romance tool.

1168
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,000
Just leave them alone.

1169
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,360
If you wanna ask them out, just say,

1170
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,880
hey, I know this is weird,

1171
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,160
but do you wanna hang out sometime?

1172
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,080
But even that, like if you're not like fucking,

1173
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,120
every time you check out,

1174
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,160
every time you check out, just be like chatting with them.

1175
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,000
Like, yeah, I'm getting some fucking bok choy

1176
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,040
and trying to get my life together.

1177
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,800
And she's like, oh, cool, I like bok choy.

1178
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,480
Do you wanna talk about bok choy with me sometime?

1179
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,280
That's fine, but not like you left your bok choy

1180
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,080
here at the thing.

1181
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,320
No, that's for you, eat it, I love you, bye.

1182
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,800
That sucks.

1183
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,600
It sucks.

1184
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,640
Just be, the con is on in 2015.

1185
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,120
Love's not a con.

1186
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,400
Unless you're using it to get a lot of money.

1187
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,200
If that was the last sentence of this,

1188
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,120
and like also she has some diamonds.

1189
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,240
Or she's got a key card to the back door

1190
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,520
of the Savers that you need

1191
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,560
to pull off this $300 Savers heist.

1192
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,880
It's just sucks.

1193
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,640
Savers doesn't sell groceries either.

1194
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,720
So we've been saying some dumb shit this whole time.

1195
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,160
Why didn't I just say Kroger?

1196
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,560
I know that's a place where they sell groceries.

1197
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,440
I led you into that.

1198
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
I said Savers, Savers is basically an off-brand Goodwill.

1199
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,520
And I said it and you trusted me

1200
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,040
and I let you down again.

1201
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,440
Again.

1202
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,360
Do you want a yahoo?

1203
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1204
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
Okay, have we made this clear enough?

1205
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,360
Don't do it.

1206
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,360
Over the past fucking six years?

1207
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,200
Yeah, I think we made it pretty goddamn clear.

1208
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,720
Don't ask people out at their jobs.

1209
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,600
That sucks.

1210
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,880
I've seen though, I've seen people in movies

1211
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,040
and TV say like, when do you get off?

1212
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,320
Is that, and that always seemed cool.

1213
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,280
Is that not cool?

1214
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,920
Okay, real quick, side note, Justin.

1215
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,840
I think that if the vibe is so clear

1216
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,040
and you're like flirting

1217
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,680
and it's just the natural next step progression,

1218
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,440
fuck it, do it, but not-

1219
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,240
You're right, Travis.

1220
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,000
It's not if it's pre-planned.

1221
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,560
Yes.

1222
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,040
If you need a whiteboard to figure it out,

1223
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,120
then it's probably not a romantic opportunity

1224
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,000
you should be pursuing.

1225
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,480
If it's like, oh, the obvious next step

1226
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,400
is that you're like talking and it's like,

1227
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,840
oh, hey, there's a line.

1228
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,320
Do you wanna just like grab coffee sometime and hang out?

1229
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,280
Totally cool.

1230
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
But not like this, like elaborate,

1231
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,760
like you get Danny in and you make a plan

1232
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,600
and you've built a model of the savers

1233
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,640
so you can act out

1234
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,600
and then Brad Pitt zip lines in to drop the rose.

1235
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,640
Like, no, fuck it.

1236
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,440
And you've got the acrobat guy stuffed into your cart.

1237
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,320
He's ready to pop out.

1238
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,440
Not for a reason.

1239
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,880
Just cause it looks really funny with him

1240
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,160
curled around your orange juice.

1241
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,280
Pardon me, but you have a man

1242
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,240
curled around your orange juice.

1243
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,200
Yeah, I know.

1244
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:34,720
It's right where I meant to leave it.

1245
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,760
I've got a Yahoo here that was sent in by Jessica Rosen.

1246
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,400
Thank you, Jessica.

1247
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Big Cheese, who asks,

1248
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,560
why there is no beef nuggets,

1249
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,520
but chicken nuggets.

1250
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,160
So the whole sentence,

1251
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,880
why there is no beef nuggets,

1252
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,320
but chicken nuggets.

1253
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,520
Let me try and fix this.

1254
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,880
Let me take my red pen to this.

1255
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,120
Why there is no beef nuggets,

1256
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,400
but chicken nuggets is.

1257
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,640
That's good.

1258
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,520
That's a good edit.

1259
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,320
Chicken nuggets is,

1260
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,000
but beef nuggets isn't.

1261
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,440
Why am this?

1262
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,240
Why that is.

1263
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,360
Why that is.

1264
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,560
Just move that is over.

1265
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,280
Pelabra jot.

1266
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,760
You got it.

1267
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,560
Just pick it up.

1268
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,400
Drop it in the middle of the sentence.

1269
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,120
Nailed it.

1270
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,000
Thank you, Ghostwriter.

1271
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,400
Why there is no beef nuggets though, for real,

1272
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,280
because I read this question.

1273
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,160
I was like, dumb.

1274
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,280
And I was like, wait.

1275
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,040
And I was like, wait a minute.

1276
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,320
And I was like, mm.

1277
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,640
There has to be a lab somewhere where like,

1278
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,400
the scientists at McDonald's are like,

1279
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,760
we tried everything.

1280
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,360
We've come at it from every angle.

1281
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,920
They got a good point though.

1282
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,800
There ain't no beef nuggets.

1283
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,680
There ain't no pork nuggets.

1284
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,800
There's beef jerky, I guess,

1285
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,040
but that's like super dry beef.

1286
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,120
That's like a different type of thing.

1287
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,360
And you know, Jack Links is on that nugget game now

1288
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,760
and they are nuggeting it so right.

1289
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,000
But I want to see it have more mainstream,

1290
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,360
soft beef appeal.

1291
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,440
Mabim Bam's got that soft beef appeal.

1292
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,720
But can we get that soft beef appeal at a Wendy's?

1293
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,480
You can have a chicken fried steak.

1294
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,920
So why don't you have chicken fried steak nugs?

1295
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,760
Give me those steak nugs.

1296
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,240
You know Guy Fieri's fucked with some nugs though.

1297
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,080
You know he's nugged basically everything at this point.

1298
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,880
If you know what I mean.

1299
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,720
I don't know what you mean.

1300
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,240
Oh, 420.

1301
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,440
420, blaze it.

1302
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,880
Beef nugs.

1303
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,720
Is it because it takes longer to cook?

1304
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,840
Is that like, is it a scientific problem?

1305
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,200
I think beef nugs would be good.

1306
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,280
I think beef nugs would be pretty tight.

1307
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,040
I'm kind of hungry for beef nugs.

1308
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,360
I'm kind of into beef nugs and it makes me sad

1309
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,240
because it's very rare that I get hungry for food

1310
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,120
that doesn't exist.

1311
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,120
Usually most of my hunger pangs are tied to extant items.

1312
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,360
You try to keep it to the corporeal world.

1313
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,000
I try to keep it to the material realm.

1314
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,120
But the problem is I crave material.

1315
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,720
The specific Everlasting Cobstopper from the movie.

1316
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,600
Oh dog, fucking forget about it.

1317
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,400
Remember how that thing looked?

1318
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,680
Weird colorful candies jutting out.

1319
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,360
Not like the fake ass Jawbreakers that they tried to market and sell

1320
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,440
and you stamp it and you put it on a lunchbox

1321
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,480
and you put it out there.

1322
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:10,960
Not that.

1323
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,600
You're talking about a tasty fruity asterisk

1324
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,720
which is what they're selling there.

1325
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,080
Yeah, I would party on that.

1326
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,360
My mouth would have a lot of fun with that thing.

1327
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,760
Why are there no motherfucking beef nuggets?

1328
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,760
Okay, now I'm moving on to the third phase

1329
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,800
where I'm just angry that there aren't any beef nugs.

1330
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,240
I think the fourth phase is negotiation

1331
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,320
and the last phase is beef nugs.

1332
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,560
And then I go out and I acquire the materials needed for nugs.

1333
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,400
There has to be a reason, right?

1334
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,680
Like this has to be a thing.

1335
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,200
Have we done any research to see if like in 1960

1336
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,520
McDonald's had like McBeef nuggets?

1337
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,400
What would you dip them in?

1338
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,920
A1, right?

1339
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,800
Easy answer.

1340
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,560
Fuck, we've already got, we have everything.

1341
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,960
It's not like somebody's like cracking away at a chalkboard

1342
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,360
trying to like connect the molecules needed to form this shit.

1343
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,120
We all know this shit, it's obvious,

1344
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,680
but everybody's too fucking afraid to do it.

1345
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,400
Not Obama.

1346
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,640
Last day in office.

1347
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,520
Supreme judgment.

1348
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,840
That's the fourth midnight amendment.

1349
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,280
Oh no, that was the third and then fourth is nice.

1350
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,400
Nice, we did it.

1351
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,920
You cracked it.

1352
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,560
I am moving into a new condo in the DC Metro area.

1353
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,680
What do I do about the awkward introductions with neighbors?

1354
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,840
Do I knock on their door with baked goods

1355
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,760
or ask what day trash goes out,

1356
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,880
see if they make the first move

1357
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,600
or accidentally bump into them in the hallway someday?

1358
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,080
Or am I just supposed to go about living my life

1359
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,720
and only give a casual nod if I ever see one?

1360
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,160
That's from moving in Maryland.

1361
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,200
There is definitely a window.

1362
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,920
Can we put an official number of days?

1363
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,720
Because my neighbors and I on the one side

1364
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,760
have like a very nice relationship.

1365
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,880
Like when we had the baby,

1366
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,320
they brought over like dinner one night,

1367
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,800
like very cordial, very pleasant.

1368
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,160
Do not know their first names.

1369
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,560
Do not know them.

1370
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,060
And Griffin?

1371
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,080
You're gonna steal their mail.

1372
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,320
Literally, if you guys have any clues.

1373
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,720
Why the fuck would I know it?

1374
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,920
I don't know how, like clues to figure,

1375
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,120
if you like have the phone number of a private dick in the area.

1376
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,040
You're gonna need to set up a hotline, Justin,

1377
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,600
so that people can call in.

1378
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,800
This particular case.

1379
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,800
Can we develop a name that sounds like every name?

1380
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,720
And then you can call them that.

1381
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,000
Grinchum.

1382
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:39,680
Hi.

1383
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,240
Grinchum.

1384
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:41,920
Jomagree.

1385
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,600
Jomagree.

1386
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,680
Jomagree, I feel like covers a lot of your bases.

1387
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,600
If it's John, Gregory,

1388
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,040
just if their name is Jomagree,

1389
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,720
you're fucking wow.

1390
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,160
You really split the uprights.

1391
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,920
I think the only solution is,

1392
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,160
I have to gin up a reason to write them a check.

1393
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,040
Like I have to come up with a reason to write them a check,

1394
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,800
so I can ask them how to spell the name.

1395
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,720
So I mean, that's all I know your name.

1396
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,440
What if they say like it's Steve or it's Jim?

1397
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,600
That's always sucks.

1398
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,240
That's the bad thing about that gambit is it's like,

1399
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240
but you can always work your way out of it.

1400
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,920
Because every, it's 2015,

1401
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,800
there's more than one way to spell literally any name on the planet now.

1402
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,240
What I'm saying is you have,

1403
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,760
my problem is that I have learned my neighbors names several times,

1404
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,040
but our interactions are so rare that I don't,

1405
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,280
it doesn't get into the muscle memory.

1406
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,200
So you have to introduce yourself,

1407
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,160
I think right away,

1408
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,200
maybe just make some cookies and go around the neighborhood,

1409
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,360
tossing cookies to people,

1410
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,920
and then ask them their name and write it down.

1411
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,240
Put in your iPhone something right on the brim of your hat,

1412
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,120
so you can stare at it.

1413
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,120
Learn it early,

1414
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,840
but because once it gets past, I think like a month.

1415
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,360
Oh yeah, you're fucked in a month.

1416
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,640
It's over.

1417
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,400
We got a package,

1418
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,200
we got a neighbor on the left side named Terry.

1419
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,400
I love Terry.

1420
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,960
His fucking grandkids are always throwing footballs into our yard,

1421
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,240
so I don't love that Terry.

1422
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,640
Wish I could curtail that particular behavior.

1423
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,720
Be cool, Terry.

1424
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,160
Be fucking cool, Terry.

1425
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,360
Tell your grandkids to chill.

1426
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,760
I hope something happened to him when Obama comes calling.

1427
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,240
When we got back from spending Christmas in Huntington,

1428
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,880
we had a package for a Terrence,

1429
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,400
and it took us like a whole day to figure that one out.

1430
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,800
Really?

1431
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,520
When the number, the house number was one different from yours,

1432
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,600
and you have a next door neighbor named Terry,

1433
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,360
it took you a whole day to piece it together?

1434
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,720
How many Terrences do you know?

1435
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,840
It's not a common shorthand.

1436
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,720
I just, I picture Rachel Griffin like standing in front of a wall

1437
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,800
and there's like red yarn strung between

1438
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,280
all these like newspaper clippings and pictures,

1439
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,760
and it just says Terrence and is circled like eight times.

1440
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,680
And on one side it says Terry, our next door neighbor,

1441
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,320
and then it's like it's struck through like impossible.

1442
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,800
Name Terry is not named Terrence.

1443
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,000
Could not be him.

1444
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,200
Terrence Howard?

1445
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,040
Question one, question one, question one.

1446
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,880
I'm really disappointed in you.

1447
00:56:59,440 --> 00:56:59,940
Okay.

1448
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,120
My guy on the other side is named Durant.

1449
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,240
That one's pretty easy to remember

1450
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,600
because you're not going to get a package for Dur.

1451
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Hi, I've got a package here for Dur.

1452
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,080
I don't know.

1453
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,280
I don't know that one.

1454
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,320
This is for Durant.

1455
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,120
That can't be it.

1456
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,200
Durant-sus.

1457
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,800
I don't think I know a Durant-sus.

1458
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,360
What if it, what if the package is for David

1459
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,480
and you found out you've just been

1460
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,320
mispronouncing it the entire time?

1461
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,120
This is for Mark.

1462
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,760
I don't know Mark.

1463
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,720
Uh, hi Mark.

1464
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:28,960
Hey.

1465
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,520
Shut up Durant.

1466
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,560
What's your angle Durant?

1467
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,120
I got package thief.

1468
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,960
So this has been our show.

1469
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,840
My brother, my brother, me.

1470
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,520
We hope you had fun listening to it.

1471
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,040
Got some fun news.

1472
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,000
Some exciting news.

1473
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,800
First off, live shows.

1474
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,480
First want to mention bit.ly forward slash mbmbam sketch fest.

1475
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,880
If you want to come see us and JJ go in San Francisco

1476
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,880
in like less than a month, it's going to be awesome.

1477
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,480
And you won't want to miss it.

1478
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,600
So go buy those tickets.

1479
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,280
But Travis, I think we have some other ones to talk about.

1480
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,440
Well, the big announcement Justin is that we're ready to

1481
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,480
announce what our, um, our spring, our April.

1482
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,640
The big announcement is that we're ready to announce.

1483
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,640
We've been teasing this announcement for so long.

1484
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,920
We released a microscopic trailer for this announcement,

1485
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,520
but now it's time for the full thing.

1486
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,320
Did you find it?

1487
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,680
If you go onto the MBMBA website and click the pupil in

1488
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,440
Griffin's right eye, then it will open up a code.

1489
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,880
And if you can decipher that code,

1490
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,160
where are we doing shows?

1491
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,800
The story with these live shows is we're announcing them.

1492
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,520
We're doing it in the Midwest where you'll have to find us.

1493
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,960
Um, so MBMBA Minneapolis on April 3rd,

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,840

And that's a bit dot L Y MBMBA M M I L.

1499
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,360
So MBMBA mill, um, where's that one at?

1500
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,080
In Milwaukee means the good land.

1501
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,920
I know it means a good land, but where's the, what is the venue?

1502
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,800
Turner hall, right?

1503
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:21,920
Sure.

1504
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,800
Something like that.

1505
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,160
No, the, the, yeah.

1506
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,080
Pabst riverside Turner hall and then MBMBA Chicago on April 5th.

1507
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,640
And that's it bit.ly forward slash MBMBA Chicago.

1508
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,080
Three in a row, three cities, three stops.

1509
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,120
We're going to be some fucking road dogs out there

1510
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,440
getting some nugs for the road.

1511
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,760
Saw bones will be there.

1512
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,600
Saw bones will be at all three shows.

1513
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,560
It'll be so tight.

1514
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,760
It's a family affair.

1515
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,960
Midwest we're coming.

1516
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,400
You guys have been very boring with this live tour announcement.

1517
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,800
You need to fucking, I want to get the data out there.

1518
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,040
Okay.

1519
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,000
You got the data out there.

1520
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,360
Now it's time to fucking hype it up.

1521
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,320
Listen up Midwest.

1522
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,760
We're coming to fuck you.

1523
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,600
We'll be all up in your guts.

1524
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,200
We're going to crush your guts.

1525
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:05,920
Milly Wacky.

1526
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,960
I just like the way you say it.

1527
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,000
Where's the Chicago show.

1528
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,560
Oh, uh, Lincoln hall.

1529
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,440
Lincoln hall.

1530
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:13,920
Is that right?

1531
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:14,960
Sure.

1532
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,920
That sounds right.

1533
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,200
It's going to be in Chicago.

1534
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,640
That's for sure.

1535
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,360
Let me tell you this.

1536
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,840
I'm going to talk about ghosts and dicks for an hour at Lincoln hall on that night.

1537
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,040
So it better be there.

1538
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,280
All of those tickets, everything goes on sale, um, January 16th.

1539
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,840
So this Friday at 12 PM central time.

1540
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,280
Um, so 1 PM Eastern time.

1541
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:37,760
Yes.

1542
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,560
Get your shit.

1543
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,160
So right.

1544
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,920
Set your clock, set your calendars.

1545
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,120
I don't want to be a dick, but these shows like sell out pretty fast.

1546
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,760
A lot of the time, but tickets are only $20.

1547
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,280
So make sure, um, you get your tickets before they all sell out.

1548
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,160
Uh, January 16th, 12 PM central time.

1549
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,720
Um, and along with when we post this episode on maximumfund.org,

1550
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,240
we'll put these links in there as well.

1551
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
So you can very easily find them.

1552
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,800
I will forget to do that, but just remember the links.

1553
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,120
Okay.

1554
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:09,760
Um, make sure that you listen to all the other great maximum fund shows, uh,

1555
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,680
bunker buddies jumps to mind.

1556
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,640
That's a show that Travis does with Andy Bolt about, um, surviving different

1557
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,000
apocalypses.

1558
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,160
Is that the, is that the right?

1559
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,360
Apocalypse.

1560
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,320
Apocalypse.

1561
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,120
Uh, also maybe consider checking out saw bones.

1562
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:25,680
That's your show.

1563
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,880
Justin does with Sydney.

1564
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,640
It's about medical history.

1565
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,680
That's a good one.

1566
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,120
And you should check out the flop house.

1567
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,840
It's a show Griffin does with Elliot Kalin and Stuart Ryan.

1568
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,280
Dan McCoy.

1569
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,400
If they had me, man, I'd do whatever.

1570
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,840
Griffin would just bring him drinks.

1571
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,920
I, I, I, this is an open invitation.

1572
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,520
I will do crazy beautiful with them, man.

1573
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,360
I fucking hated that movie or no reservations with Catherine Zeta Jones.

1574
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,840
I think those are the two worst movies I probably ever seen.

1575
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,480
Um, there's also big gulp and the adventure zone.

1576
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,040
Um, that's another one we do, but yeah.

1577
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,040
Jordan, Jesse go judge on Hodgman.

1578

It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1589
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,840

That's it.

1593
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,720
That's the end of the episode.

1594
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,280

Okay.

1615
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,920
It doesn't have to be the other thing.

1616

1617

1619

Gaper granny asks,

1620
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,800
according to the Bible is vanity over one's potato salad.

1621
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,280
A sin.

Hey everyone.

1629
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,960
We're the flop house.

1630
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,720
One of the newest additions to the maximum fun podcasting network.

1631
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,920
I'm Dan McCoy.

1632

1634
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,920
What is the flop house?

1635
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,360
You may very well ask.

1636
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,600
We watch a bad movie and then we talk about it.

1637
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,960
A bad movie podcast.

1638
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,440
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

1639
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,040
I'd answer that by saying one,

1640
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,120
we've been doing this show for over seven years,

1641
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,200
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche and two,

1642
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:17,760
shut up.

1643
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,960
Sick burn.

1644
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,680
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast,

1645
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,080
a podcast about words that sound like other words,

1646
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,720
a podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one,

1647
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,760
a podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie,

1648
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,920
or discussions about sex tarps.

1649
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,440
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out

1650
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,520
and talking about ding dongs.

1651
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,560
That's mostly used to.

1652
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,440
Wait, what?
