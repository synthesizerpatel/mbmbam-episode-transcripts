1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
I want you to keep that big grain of salt and be ready to take it.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,640
As you enjoy, Justin, Travis, and Griffin, ladies and gentlemen, McElroy Brothers!

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,640
Your advice should never be followed.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,920
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,480
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,480
cool they are for listening.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
What's up, you cool baby?

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:55,480
If you change your mind, if you need me, let me know when I'm here around.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:03,960
If you've got no place to go, when you're feeling down, if you're all alone, when it's

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:21,960
really cold, let me know when I'm here around.

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Welcome.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,640
I am already very sweaty.

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
And I'm spent.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
Thanks, good show.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,840
Another classic for the record books.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,160
We arrived here a couple minutes after Travis.

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,680
Travis got here, of course, to help set up.

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Opening with the story, are we?

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,720
Yeah, I just thought I'd open with it.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,800
We got here a couple minutes after Travis.

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,440
His co-workers were looking for us.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,860
They don't know us.

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,840
Travis had come in to set up.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,680
And the young lady sitting out there said, oh, you must be the brothers.

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
We said, yes.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,080
She said, Travis said to look for you.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,760
She said that one of you was blonde and one of you was fat.

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,240
Hand to God.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,680
Hand to God.

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,960
I have no excuse.

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
One of them?

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
It's the dumbest.

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Like, I'm not blonde.

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
I was in a rush.

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
You were so in a rush.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,960
You don't know what the fuck hair color he has.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,640
And there's other, the thing is, the fact that I'm overweight isn't even the first

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,800
thing people notice about it.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,800
One, he's the best rapper of the three of them.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,120
You will hear him drop beats and rhymes.

42
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,160
Just forget his homemade toffee.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Yeah.

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,840
If he's carrying a great plate of toffee, that's Justin.

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,200
Of course, I could also loop back into our original complaint about him being a portly.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Festive.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Festive.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,000
You're never too short on time for manners.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,680
Yeah, there's always time for, if there's one message we try to espouse on My Brother,

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,720
My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy.

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm Travis McElroy.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
The blonde one.

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,000
You guys, maybe you can't see this from the audience.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,520
I frosted my tips for this show.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,640
So I can think of two things that are different for this show than our last live show.

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Okay.

59
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,120
First of all, we don't have tangible microphones.

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
They're on our face.

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
It's weird.

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,120
They're attached to our face, which is great, because I don't know if you guys know this.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,640
I produced the show, and I edited it, which I think are the same thing.

64
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,280
I pay you as though they're the same thing.

65
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Justin pays.

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
I know.

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
It's riding up.

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
What's it doing?

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Thank you.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,520
Do you ever want to know what Griffin's glasses sound like?

71
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
They've got a lot to say.

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
They're super tender.

73
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
For a show, they're super tender.

74
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,560
They're super tender.

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,240
We produce a lot of sound that is just genuinely sonically unpleasant to hear, and I catch

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
it.

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,900
On our last live show, we had mics, so if we had to make such a sound, we could get

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,280
away from it, but this is going to be as raw as it gets.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,040
You're going to enjoy listening to us drink.

80
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,280
Every gulp, every sip, every belch, every glottal stop.

81
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
Is that a sound that people make with their mouths?

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
A glottal stop?

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Yeah, I think so.

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Every sniffle, snort, sneeze.

85
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,480
Guys, buckle in.

86
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,520
Your ears are about to go on a roller coaster.

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
So that's the first thing.

88
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Also, they look kind of like...

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
I feel like I'm in a boy band.

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
I don't know if you guys can see that.

91
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
I just have the cord.

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,280
I'm either a Kings Island performer or a founding member of S Club 7.

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
We also have...

94
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,440
Justin's sister-in-law is in the audience, who is how old?

95
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
She's 10.

96
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
10?

97
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,560
I'm a little too young to hear some of the words we're going to say on the stage.

98
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
So...

99
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Hi, Riley.

100
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Yeah, hi, Riley.

101
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Hey, Riley.

102
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
They've requested...

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,200
The Smurl family has requested that instead of using earmuffs, this is the only time we

104
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
say it, like dick or...

105
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,520
No, no, no, that one's fine.

106
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,760
Or like a vagina.

107
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
We have to use the term front butt.

108
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,620
So as much as we can, we're going to interchange the two.

109
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,480
So just a little pre-show anatomy, terminology.

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,760
Fuck, it's so hot on this stage, you guys.

111
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
It's really hot.

112
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Now it is.

113
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,760
My front butt is sweating so bad.

114
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Oh, man.

115
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,960
Both of my butts are unblesantly damp.

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,440
I have to get out of here.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Yeah.

118
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
So let's get to the advice.

119
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
What do you think?

120
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Yeah?

121
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Yeah.

122
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Yes.

123
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
All right.

124
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Let's get it wet.

125
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's dump this melon.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
I've given up on clothing.

127
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,680
Instead, I've opted for a uniform because I don't want to think about what I wear.

128
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,840
Several black t-shirts and several pairs of jeans.

129
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,080
It seems to work, but certain people around me think it's weird.

130
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,560
Are they right or am I on the bleeding edge of wardrobe efficiency?

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Cole from Cincinnati.

132
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Cole, are you here?

133
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Cole, where are you?

134
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Cole, where are you?

135
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
If you aren't wearing a black t-shirt and jeans, yeah!

136
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Dedication.

137
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
I salute you.

138
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
To the goof.

139
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Cole with a K from Cincinnati with a C. Well done, my friend.

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,680
Well, well done.

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,360
So first, before we really delve into the meat of the question, if people around you

142
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,980
think your clothes are weird, but you think it works, that's pretty much the definition

143
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,600
of your clothes not working.

144
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,720
If you're talking about clothes working, you are covering all your, like, gentle bits.

145
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Yes!

146
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
You're protected from the immediate elements.

147
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,760
Like, yeah, I guess in that...

148
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,880
Yeah, in the attitude tigers and the ice age, you're safe.

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Yeah, you're fine.

150
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:44,160
My favorite fashion catchphrase is Tim Gunn, who says, make it work for you.

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Everybody else doesn't really matter.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,320
So, that's point one.

154
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Point two?

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I love it.

156
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
I'm a big fan.

157
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
I'm down.

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I think...

159
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
I have maybe five shirts.

160
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Yeah.

161
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Five shirts.

162
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I have two pairs of jeans.

163
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
One of them I favor.

164
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
I favor this pair of jeans.

165
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,360
The other one, I'm not so hot on.

166
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,720
I think everyone has a favorite pair of jeans, right?

167
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Yes.

168
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,680
Most people don't have, like, a swap-out, like a one-in-one-out system, like I do.

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
You only have two pairs of jeans?

170
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,480
You have, like, a favorite and then an off-court buddy.

171
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
I do.

172
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,800
That's what I call them, my off-court buddies.

173
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
They've...

174
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,320
See, Travis's jeans are almost exclusive.

175
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,760
You're wearing your only pair of jeans that are not covered in paint and soot.

176
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
That is correct.

177
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
I bought them two days ago.

178
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Yes.

179
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Thank you.

180
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,440
They're much smaller than mine, you see, because I'm the fat one.

181
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Oh, no.

182
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Oh, no.

183
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
That's...

184
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Yeah, that's the whole show.

185
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Welcome to the show.

186
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Welcome to the show.

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Welcome to the show, Mr. Gentleman.

188
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
This is the most custom of Bim Bam ever.

189
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Welcome to the grand finale of My Brother, My Brother.

190
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
My Brother, That Other Guy, and Me.

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Who gets killed off?

192
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Spoiler.

193
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Travis.

194
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
So...

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
I feel like I'm getting cut, right?

196
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Yeah.

197
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Yeah, you're getting cut.

198
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I think...

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Like, I'm down with the whole, like, Doug Fonny ideology, too, wearing clothing.

200
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Right.

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
You got a t-shirt, sweater vest, shorts.

202
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Covered.

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Unless I'm mistaken.

204
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
I'm not.

205
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm not.

206
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm not.

207
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
I'm not.

208
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm not.

209
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
I'm not.

210
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm not.

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I'm not.

212
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm not.

213
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm not.

214
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm not.

215
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
You're getting cut off by Travis.

216
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
Unless I'm mistaken, that's our second Doug reference in 45 seconds.

217
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,340
Offar Buddies is from...

218
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
Holy shit.

219
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
Yeah.

220
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
Welcome to the live show.

221
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
How about Patti Mani?

222
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,360
She's a lucker, isn't she?

223
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Yeah.

224
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,440
Anybody in here need more allowance?

225
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
I do.

226
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Because I do.

227
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
All right.

228
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,100
What's up half of the alienated crowd?

229
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,440
How does it taste?

230
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Wait.

231
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,180
Do you think anyone in here isn't on board with Doug?

232
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,940
Do you think anyone in here is going, what?

233
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,520
Some people might be Eureka's castle, I don't know.

234
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
That's fair.

235
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,520
So, what's up?

236
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,080
Have you considered actually investing in a literal uniform?

237
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,100
Well, a jumpsuit might work.

238
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,240
I like the interplay.

239
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
No, let's do it.

240
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,900
This is good.

241
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,740
Let's get raw.

242
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,700
Yeah, I can see a light on you now, Cole.

243
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,680
I think, yeah, a jumpsuit, some sort of janitorial tunic.

244
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,400
Some sort of oppressive imagery.

245
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,240
Some sort of, like a magistrate's garb.

246
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,080
Ooh!

247
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,960
Or maybe we don't have to go that specific.

248
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,400
What about just like a sailor, like a sailor thing?

249
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,320
Yes.

250
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,820
And I'm not talking like a modern seaman.

251
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm talking about like a blue and white sailor.

252
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
Oh my.

253
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,900
Oh, okay.

254
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,820
Wait, now, what kind of sailor was that again?

255
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,160
Like a sailor.

256
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
Sailor.

257
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
Sailor.

258
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,280
Listen, he's excited.

259
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,160
He's excited about his nautical craft.

260
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,240
Aren't all sailors?

261
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,080
Yeah.

262
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,900
They love to.

263
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,740
Really?

264
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,560
Yeah.

265
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,400
So, Cole, in closing.

266
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,540
Be a sailor, become a sailor.

267
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,880
Become a sailor.

268
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,220
Just walk around the docks like,

269
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,420
anybody need a hand?

270
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,340
No, don't do that.

271
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,840
Actually, no, I thought about it twice.

272
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,680
Ha ha ha!

273
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,500
Ha ha ha!

274
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,340
Ha ha ha!

275
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,160
Ha ha ha!

276
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,980
Ha ha ha!

277
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,800
Ha ha ha!

278
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,640
Ha ha ha!

279
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,480
Ha ha ha!

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,300
Ha ha ha!

281
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,140
Ha ha ha!

282
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,980
Ha ha ha!

283
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,800
Ha ha ha!

284
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,640
Ha ha ha!

285
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,480
Ha ha ha!

286
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,320
Ha ha ha!

287
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,180
That would require an entirely different kind of uniform.

288
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,600
Oh, man.

289
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,440
Oh, something stainless.

290
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Yes.

291
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,660
Something, lot of mesh.

292
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,600
Something that really features my front butt.

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Something that really shows off that FB.

294
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
How about a Yahoo?

295
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,740
Hey, how about one?

296
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,020
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

297
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,860
Thank you, Jacob Locker.

298
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,700
Thank you, Jacob.

299
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,520
In heaven.

300
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,060
He is, he died and he's in heaven now.

301
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,440
It is by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica, who asks,

302
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,360
am I the only one who has a phobia of hot tubs?

303
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,300
I have an epic fear of hot tubs.

304
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,460
I was electrocuted by one before, and I've seen people

305
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,280
on 1000 Ways to Die die in hot tubs

306
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,180
for a few different reasons.

307
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,680
If I get, they had a whole special.

308
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,760
How many different reasons?

309
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,600
We'll get to that.

310
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,380
There was a raccoon in there with rabies.

311
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,460
Maybe you're in a hot tub and someone shoots

312
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,380
and stabs you to death.

313
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,720
If I get close.

314
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,160
I'm in a hot tub, I gotta eat coli.

315
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,180
If I get close to one, I have a panic attack.

316
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,100
I know it's silly, but I'm so afraid I'm gonna die in one,

317
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,240
and it has nothing to do with drowning.

318
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,840
Nothing to do with.

319
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,300
I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there

320
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,980
who's afraid of hot tubs, not drowning or drains

321
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,720
or electrocution, but just hot tubs in general.

322
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
Get that fucking thing away from me, man.

323
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,240
What kind of life are you living that day to day

324
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,400
you are confronted with hot tubs

325
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,280
to the point that you can't avoid them?

326
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,120
Right.

327
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
Or he's in a cruise ship.

328
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,480
Yeah, maybe think before you talk.

329
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,560
What is the scenario exactly in which a hot tub

330
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
poses a threat to you?

331
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,340
That's not electrocution.

332
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,240
Not electrocution, not drowning.

333
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,120
I can't think of any time where I haven't looked

334
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,360
at a hot tub and gone, ah, cool relaxation

335
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,400

336
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

337
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
Time out, time out.

338
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,180
Cool relaxation?

339
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,720
Cool, like.

340
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,560
This is cool.

341
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,940
I think you're familiar with the concept though, right?

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,180

theory I think it is the communal experience of a hot tub over a bathtub

361
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,960
which I totally agree with because we've talked about how does before like you're

362
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,980
getting your balls particles in a soup with everyone else's balls particles and

363
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,140
who knows like what kind of convection is going on in there I think though that

364
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,420
if this was a pubic fear it would be specifically mentioned I have enough

365
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,020
faith in Jessica that she would provide us she's afraid of the pubic ionic

366
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,620
bonds that are going on in this hot tub what kind of show did this turn into you

367
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,580
we have a ten-year-old in the audience guys listen you're right this is weird

368
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,500
people came here for real talk this is real as it gets right sometimes your

369
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:43,340
front but you soak it in water and what yeah and what it expands like a dinosaur

370
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,700
in a phone

371
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:58,100
oh god oh if only oh it's a chicken so much fun it's a my wife and I were on

372
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,980
vacation and we saw a very peculiar sight we saw another couple with their

373
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,820
baby but you see their baby had pierced ears real piercing what would make

374
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,580
parents think this is an okay thing to do to a baby in arms follow-up would

375
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,740
fuck but actually do that to their baby puzzled in paradise um before we get

376
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,460
it again I hate to like stall on the wisdom how close did you roll up on this

377
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,900
that's what I want to know that that was my first question too is how do you know

378
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:37,500
they're not like clip-ons yeah you just jack my mic I had it set specific

379
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,460
inspector baby hey do you mind if I get right up in your baby like by his head

380
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:49,740

00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,980
piercing gentle this one was sent in also by Jacob locker thank you Jacob as

413
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,780
always it's by Yahoo answers user Kelly are who asks how to start a letter to a

414
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:59,460
friend that's in jail that's it that's it yeah that's it no like details of

415
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,460
what they're in jail here I'll make him up or my friends in jail I would like to

416
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,860
correspond with my friend but I'm too much of a pussy I'm too much of front

417
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,620
but to go and talk to him in person do you have an easy an easy intro you can't

418
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,420
be like I feel it like I feel this this this Cali are because you can't just be

419
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:24,260
like salutations like there's there is there are two wrong ways to do this and

420
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:31,980
the first one is to blow right over the fact that they are incarcerated did you

421
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,820
go see bridesmaids yeah you can't see any movies they let him see prison

422
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,380
movies what do you can you explain escape from Alcatraz like that like now

423
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,820
see I thought that same thing Shawshank no Shawshank the wrong that's what I'm

424
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,340
saying like you don't want to give these prisoners any ideas are there any movies

425
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,620
where there are people who are in jail they're like yeah this is pretty fucking

426
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,140
cool okay I can lift weights and stuff like all my friends are not well they're

427
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,220
not here but my new friends are they show Shawshank but they cut it at the

428
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,060
part where Morgan Freeman wants to go back to prison and like they have a

429
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,020
little credits that come up at the end like and then he went back to prison and

430
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,860
he was super happy prison awesome he totally regretted his top his time with

431
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,820
Tim Robbins much like Susan Sarandon

432
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,880
there was a prison version of that movie where he he goes to read was that was

433
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,420
that Morgan Freeman movie read I don't know he goes anything can I get a rock

434
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,740
hammer and he's like nope

435
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,020
no you may not the prison edit have fun in prison forever

436
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:42,660
so that's the first way the second way is to joke about it too soon like you

437
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,700
got a can to rattle against those bars or like you've gotten like your has

438
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,740
somebody touched your front bite in like a way that you didn't particularly

439
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:58,140
enjoy interest yeah soap jokes are like right out the window I don't know is

440
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,340
there any way that that sort of splits those uprights I mean you could talk

441
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,460
about the awesome things you do on the outside yeah we think that enjoy that

442
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,500
like I did just see bridesmaids and it was a revelation I enjoy the tweeting of

443
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,460
birds and the child's laughter like that can they not cannot bring birds into

444
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,180
the jail oh I like your right face I'm pretty sure so many times I got a bird

445
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,780
that just seems I watched the prison edit though it might yeah it's at all

446
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:31,340
all aviary life just got cut right out of that right up you it highly depends I

447
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,940
think on how long they're in the clink if they got 20 years ahead of them you

448
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,540
got you got to catch him up well no you got to say how terrible shit sucks out

449
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:46,580
here man what tell him terrifying news on the outside I think that would get

450
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,980
around

451
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,380
the sky is lit with fire now where you are but everywhere else it's made a

452
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,460
circle around your business and out here it sucks so bad you're the only safe one

453
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:10,460
they outlawed ice cream what are we doing you gotta come back we need you

454
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:17,580
here my wife's cousin and I their wife are staying with us overnight next week

455
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:23,260
our house has no guest room my wife says that we need to offer our room to her

456
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,420
cousin because that's a polite thing to do I say that they are not expecting

457
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,460
extreme comforts considering the fact they are one not staying in any of the

458
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,540
nearby hotels and two we didn't invite them they called and asked they called

459
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,700
and asked if it would be okay if they stayed in our place what do you think

460
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,020
this was fight worth fighting that's from be rad be rad no matter what we

461
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,740
decide it's about to be if you're here Brad are you here very smart Brad nice

462
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,140
job very cunning have we considered that be rad is short for like Bob rad hey

463
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,980
what's up I'm Bob rad I want to be honest I made up that name okay okay

464
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,460
that's good my bad did you make up the question to the question is there okay

465
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,980
wait are you is this a bit are you did you make up a name for someone well

466
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,260
let's just say I made up the name based off a real name I think you can put

467
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,660
together with that real name okay so the guy is like what the fuck you feel like

468
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:30,820
that's your goof is like Brad and a be rad get it you're off the show I think I

469
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,980
know why be rad didn't raise his hand now that that Brad is divorced from me

470
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,660
now that's another Brad it's a parallel universe Brad that calls himself be rad

471
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:48,220
good work Travis you created a splinter universe so is it worth is it worth

472
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,100
fighting I think unless your life is in like mortal danger that it's usually not

473
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,260
worth fighting that's my you know my my marriage tip for everybody but uh so

474
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,820
we're gonna go ahead and assume that no it's not worth fighting but then we're

475
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,640
gonna go into a pretend universe okay never fight about it be rad though you

476
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,140
know him he's crazy fucking scrappy yo fucking pull a knife on have you been

477
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,140
like lying the whole time like how much have you made up in these all of them

478
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:24,820
just pretty much okay listen Travis did doesn't know shit he's got to be advised

479
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,820
constantly about every single thing on the earth

480
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,660
wow this is every answer every yahoo question to all Travis gots to know about

481
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:45,420
hot tubs he's very afraid shit yeah although that would be pretty scary so

482
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:53,020
my wife's cousin listen I I think it's it's it's probably like if you fight

483
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,740
about too much there's probably a good chance you'll end up sleeping on the

484
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,260
couch anyway so why not it's a yourself some a question of how tangential that

485
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:06,740
cousin is is it like you're fuck I don't know what a cousin is a brother's

486
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,500
sister's son right like a dad's and Travis is the bad guy you don't know

487
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:21,660
what a cousin is okay a cousin is your is your brother's your dad your dad

488
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:29,580
it's your daddy's sassy son or son or daughter what right yeah so I think if

489
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,500
it's that close then man yeah I mean doesn't it I think cousins aren't close

490
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,620
enough that you they get the normal like familial privileges I think that you

491
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,860
have to how close you gotta be how close you gotta be I think immediate family

492
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,820
ob's grandma grandpa they're old they get the bed they need that bad yeah

493
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:54,140
yeah have you seen their bones they're they're everywhere they're everywhere

494
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,220
they're literally used to jangling in a jingling I thought you meant like what's

495
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,260
this in my refrigerator oh it's grandpa's bones again the bad news is if

496
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,500
you you will have to sell your mattress afterwards because they're gonna hold it

497
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,580
up oh you're not gonna get rid of that smell that new old person smell you

498
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,020
can't get that out so Brad long story short be rad you mean be rad you are

499
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,700
right if that's what you want you are right you shouldn't have to give up your

500
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,100
bed but you're gonna have to give up your bed yeah right it's not this is not a

501
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,100
battle you're gonna you're gonna win or is really worth fighting I mean nobody

502
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,180
you know what sleep under the stars maybe and then maybe you can make a

503
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:42,100
wish that your cousin's not there I wish I didn't have any cousins I wish I'd

504
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:48,220

505
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,980

506
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,340
Brad would never would never allow that like Brad prime we're having a crisis of

507
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,740
infinite Brad you know what I mean I think you need a yahoo answer this one

508
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,460
sent in by Jacob Walker I swear I thought I arranged these so that it

509
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,700

556
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,580
I think well I think we could probably do like if anything's like a but worse

557
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,580
idea I like that mother who's included there just in case anyone was wondering

558
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,740
because if you can get past your wife that's cool but if your mom goes what's

559
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,980
the deal well she's got maternal you're a feminine friend she's got maternal

560
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:05,140
insight she knows she knows when you two have been just rub two hands together

561
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:17,060
she knows what you've been working on a plan to kill Superman I've I've worn

562
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,060
glasses since I was three years old but recently I've been feeling like they're

563
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,820
keeping my sexy back I've I've been thinking of maybe ditching them in

564
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,300
favor of contacts or LASIK but at the same time I'm a total nerd and I feel

565
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,100
like the glasses kind of reflects some street cred there in senses glasses no

566
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,260
glasses help skeptically be spectacle

567
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:51,780
are they here no no and fuck them listen whoa straight up I don't care what you

568
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:57,740
do I usually don't but don't get LASIK like don't get LASIK I'll tell you why

569
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,660
it's because they cut off the tip of your eye with a laser right like that

570
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,540
is like an hybrid it's like a ninja where the sword comes in it's like I'm

571
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,420
just gonna take a little off the top and it's like a barber he's like a ninja

572
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:16,220
barber I guess and like oh wait just to jump back tiny ninja laser barber yes

573
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,900
and he cuts off the tip of your eyeball so you can see better like you know how

574
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,220
LASIK works as far as I know no no I read it I saw a documentary on

575
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,620
Discovery Channel they get a tiny ninja barber with a laser beam that cuts off

576
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,420
the tip of your eyeball I don't think that's accurate at all that's what

577
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,420
you're singing with that's my story I've read 1984 a few times I'm pretty sure

578
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,380
that the people who when they go to the place and the guy says I'm gonna shoot

579
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,860
your eye with a laser but trust me it's all cool those are the people that are

580
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,500
first with their backs against wall when the revolution comes that's all I'm

581
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:56,260
saying if you'll buy that line of laser propaganda double talk I think you'll

582
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:03,580
believe anything I think LASIK is double plus good I get if I were to get some

583
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,900
sort of corrective eye surgery I would definitely get it at the Ministry of

584
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Love you mean the last one yeah I was there it was good so they got into this

585
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,340
or William or well Ian but it went 20 minutes and then they ended in they

586
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,820
said they were done forever because one of them called the other one fat it was

587
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:36,780
weird I I thank you I don't like just wear the glasses glasses are like a

588
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,580

590

bitter icy gesture of an unfriendly she goes it is tantamount it is show it is

668

play a Donny Osmond fantasy game with me

692
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:58,940
all you need to do is respond to this as if you were the hot man himself Donny I

693
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:06,140
love you I'm only 15 but I think you're a cutie do you like me I like you and

694
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,500
your music I often listened at puppy love will you dance with me sometime I

695
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,300
always dance around my room with a pillow pretending it's you I know this

696
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,380
probably sounds strange to you but I just think you're so handsome I can't

697
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:28,820
stop thinking about you oh man the first man to travel to space to inhabit

698
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,020
another planet will be Donny Osmond because you can't know that's out there

699
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:38,540
and not I'm out I have to get off this planet before I'm shuffled off this

700
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:44,300
planet my favorite thing about that question is the phrase you probably

701
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,980
think this weird now as if there is a circumstance in which that isn't weird

702
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,980
right that's normal I would say Vegas on the over under on you finding this weird

703
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:59,140
I don't know three to one I felt pretty good about you think this is weird let

704
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,740
me know if this affects the odds I danced a puppy love with a pillow which

705
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:16,700
I've put I put a wig on the pillow to simulate your your flowing flowing the

706
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,100
coolest thing about the internet is you know the old bit that like comedy is

707
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,860
tragedy plus stop it reduces that to zero oh god on the internet is instant

708
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:35,100
tragedy so here we go 15 man start now who the fuck is a 15 year old in love

709
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,780
with Donny Osmond yeah I'll tell you what is it she sounds like a hipster

710
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,340
right so it's like instead of what generational gap knows who Don I'm saying

711
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,060
that general occasion that generational gap has moved forward a bit so if like

712
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,420
if I wanted to be a hipster I'd be like oh man across we stills and Nash right

713
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:55,180
but like for her it's all Donny Osmond all the time I feel like that's a really

714
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,300
specific genre well fuck out specific like she's fucking crazy out of her mind

715
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:07,180
I want to know what Twilight character got her into Donny Osmond where did

716
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,780
where did she make the leap between like I like Edward wish he was a little

717
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:21,100
whiter I wish he had a sister who he might maybe fuck I'm a little bit

718
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:29,380
country I'm a little bit vampire I I'm a little bit all alone this is her oh now

719
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,740
it'll only be like that for her whole whole life

720
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:44,340
I think I'm gonna cat named Donny Osmond in a few years and by the way it's a

721
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:51,060
puppy is the gag you don't damn it puppy love right there I feel like let's

722
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:55,540
give it three years okay okay she's 18 she's of age now literally nobody else

723
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:04,380
knows who Donny Osmond fucking Marie Osmond is like hey what's Oh Donny God

724
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,940
I'm so sorry Merry Christmas

725
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:14,300
cuz it's Christmas time it's that you've built a world for your bit I built a

726
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:21,260
whole Donny verse if you will it's working out great for her yeah the Donny

727
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:27,620
verse that she's built for herself it's more of a prison like a permanent

728
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:38,740
emotional forever present it's circled around again by the way it was funny and

729
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:46,140
now what is the appropriate way to deal with an ex at a wedding the situation is

730
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,060
this we were together when a mutual friend got engaged we split up six

731
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,220
months ago we have not really spoken since then so I have no idea if she will

732
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,460
have a plus one or if she's even going I've since begun seeing someone else and

733
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,100
I would like to invite her to come with me to the wedding I'm concerned that if I

734
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:06,060
bring a date and my ex is there alone it could potentially upset her and I

735
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:12,740
wouldn't want to do that at this point at this point considering just staying

736
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,780
home to avoid the situation but I would hate to miss my friend's wedding RSVP

737
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:26,300
reluctant are you here RSVP reluctant what whoa whoa it got weird uh fuck it

738
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:32,380
you won you won fuck it you know this is not a contest yeah it's always a con

739
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,860
yeah like you totally you already have the winning handle unless she shows up

740
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:42,060
with two dudes or a dude and a half it's like eight and a half feet tall

741
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:48,900
Jesus what if it's one of the burn Troyer like that or just Donny Osmond who

742
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:56,140
I would consider a dude and a half yeah or a pillow covered in tears either way

743
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:02,660
that's negative that's negative ten dudes yeah listen you got a beater you

744
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,580
gotta win gotta win gotta win gonna have to assume that she's gonna show up to

745
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:13,060
that joint with Bradley Cooper on her arm and it's like you got what yeah I'm

746
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,900
saying maybe she knows Bradley Cooper I'm saying maybe she knows Bradley

747
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:28,180
Cooper I'm saying she knows Bradley Cooper not mr. Cooper she's not hanging

748
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,140
she's not hanging she is that she's gonna make that joke at the wedding

749
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,820
because it's gonna be awkward she doesn't know Brad very well oh be right

750
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:40,460
she doesn't know Bradley good like she is hanging with Bradley Cooper you mean

751
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:46,900
be Radley Cooper if she shows up with Bradley Cooper and be Radley Cooper then

752
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,460
you're in trouble because that's a splinter verse situation I would say you

753
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,740
just go like I think you're past the point of it's nice of you to care but

754
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,660
you don't have to yeah you're done with that listen did that all in the

755
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,980
relationship you don't have to care now what you do six billion people on this

756
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,460
beautiful globe a good percentage of them you gotta say fuck it all right I

757
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:13,540
don't mean I don't mean that like I mean you just gotta your heart is this big

758
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,820
you don't have room for people that aren't in it anymore so they're kind of

759
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:22,900
over there you're you should be busy caring about your date yeah yeah hey

760
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,740
is it gonna be weird for your date cuz then you've got it don't even worry

761
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,220
about that all you got to worry about is getting your front but what

762
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:39,180
that's that is the truth that's that's some raw truth I like that cuz you don't

763
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,260
you don't have to give a shit about her here's what you do you you worry about

764
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,380
your front but and that everything else is just gonna fall into place cuz either

765
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,300
one or two things gonna happen she's gonna beat you she's gonna show up with

766
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,780
Bradley Cooper you can't there's no female on earth as equivalent to Bradley

767
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:58,460
Cooper on the other end of the spectrum right so she was like wins with a Trump

768
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,780
card like unless you become the guy that beat the shit out of Bradley Cooper

769
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,060
which let's get realistic did you he's not gonna happen it no zero chance he is

770
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:13,940
a dreamboat he is a dreamboat and a pugilist

771
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,140
you learn how to fight from Quentin Rampage Jackson and Liam Neeson they

772
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,660
told your other option is to get Quentin Rampage Jackson or Liam Neeson to go

773
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:31,300
with you just as moral support I think you could probably do it they'll defuse

774
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,260
the situation much like I imagine they defuse the bomb in the hit film the a

775
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:41,060
team I haven't seen no I'm told it your third option is just try to make her

say my more direct question is what conversation is going on in America

811
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,300
right now that's like maybe we should legalize heroin is that a thing that's

812
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,420
going on did I miss the conversation in Washington heroin here's what here's

813
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,340
why you'd pass it heroin is the only drug I can think of that is not a

814
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,060
gateway drug

815
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:29,540
the fucking guy yeah thank you after going through nine or ten gates and it's

816
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:36,620
like well I'm here you guys unless you consider the fun and excitement of

817
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,140
working in the fast-food industry a drug I'm hooked on the problem is if you if

818
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:46,340
you if we pass a law that says heroines totes cool go crazy somebody is gonna

819
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:51,460
invent crackle in which is you just take crack and you pour it into heroin like

820
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,340
that's the next step crackle ins are actually the proudest

821
00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:01,940
tribe of native that's true it's history it's hard to judge like it's hard

822
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,700
there's no metric for pride but we're pretty sure it's the crackle and yeah

823
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:12,980
mmm mmm that's good that's good stuff I hear that you remember racks you know

824
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:16,620
racks shut down because it was a hundred percent heroin addicts really

825
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:24,100
couldn't show up on time couldn't get that roast beef carved no no like oh

826
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:30,260
sorry y'all who answers users Richard Karn wait a fucking second from home

827
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:37,100
improvement fame yeah keeps it keep on Richard Karn like he's probably on the

828
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:43,860
he's probably on the stuff right I don't want us this isn't the basis of a libel

829
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:51,620
suit so I'm gonna say this is a total fabrication but Richard Karn I know Tim

830
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:58,260
Allen got it you know why I've been Jonathan Taylor Thomas you know that's

831
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:04,140
the home improvement theme song yeah just for you guys a musical listen

832
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:09,740
Richard Karn went to Tim Allen fellow definite heroin user and said I need

833
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,140
more power

834
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:19,220
and then he grunted but he wasn't like doing it to say the thing is because he

835
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,700
was like shooting heroin into his arm right so you you grunt because it hurts

836
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,420
Richard Richard Karn has to watch John O'Hurley just butcher the family feud

837
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,700

845
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,260

H heads he's H that was a test you pass yeah we have smack oh we have sky

849
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,780
marshals in the audience I think we have two of those and one of these so maybe

850
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,660
do another one of those yeah sure gotta move quick though these people got so

851
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,460
I sent him by Peter Urmston thank you Peter it's by y'all who answers user

852
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:47,780
Adrielle who asks my writing instructor told us we need to touch the horse's

853
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:54,380
vagina before we can write it there was this front but before we can write it

854
00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:04,980
that makes no sense to me at all is there any truth to this I mean it's

855
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:11,740
gonna before you ride a horse you gotta earn its trust yeah we are we are on a

856
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:18,620
stage right now a theatrical stage yeah with the the poet take that of the

857
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:23,900
years yeah lording over us what if we just did a quick performance of Equus

858
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,380
like right here on the stage that'll be cool I don't know who we're gonna get to

859
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:36,800
play the horse as I will have to no one from the audience no this is not the

860
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,760
proper we've never done audience participation in the show but when we do

861
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,940
it will almost certainly not involve one of us touching a front but

862
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:51,460
almost sir almost I'm gonna leave us 95 96 percent chance yeah the horse you're

863
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:56,060
right Justin the horse will go faster I imagine because horses are very long

864
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:03,300
circumstance that a horse goes listen a talking horse that's all right well yes

865
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:08,180
he'll give you a she will because dude horses don't have vaginas and front

866
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:12,460
buts characteristically they both have front butts but go on different casts

867
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:22,820
right different genus is a front okay it'll be more than this look I think it

868
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,020
will be a little bit more incredulous than that I think we'll give us like a

869
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:30,420
pain like here's what's up horses are are very long they're very long creatures

870
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:35,980
most equestrians extraordinarily long okay they don't know the left hand or in

871
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:40,180
this case front half doesn't know what the back half is doing so if it's some

872
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:45,940
like if a human hand touches their vagina front but front but if they feel

873
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:51,740
like human grasp on their front but like whoa what is that what is that

874
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,400
sensation I think that I think it's gonna I think somebody's going to break

875
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,620
that down with the whole separation between the front the back you're

876
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:05,100
saying no if a human hand touches it it doesn't register as horse masturbation

877
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,940
and they don't know what's going not to the horse okay have you seen a horse yes

878
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:15,260
you have seen a horse yes is there any horses on the straight no I'm not gonna

879
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:26,740
get we got horses on all fours okay okay okay so you're a horse okay so you're a

880
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:31,740
