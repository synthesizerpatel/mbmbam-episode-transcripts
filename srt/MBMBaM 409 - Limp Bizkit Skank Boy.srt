1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,600
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:02,480
Do-do-do-do-do-do. That's right, it's May, the end of May when we recorded this. Probably June

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,160
by the time this one comes out, and everybody knows what that means is that it is summertime,

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,600
time for barbecue, pool time, and of course, the Summer Olympics. Did you guys practice that

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
little opening music bit? Because that was really good. Yeah, Juice and I call each other on the

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,920
phone every week, and we say, okay, you ready? Three, two, one. Yeah, see? It was good again,

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,800
you nailed it. Yeah, thanks. The summer can only mean one thing, the Summer Olympics are back,

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,800
and I am so excited about these hot games. The games are out this year, got a bunch of new ones,

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,960
and excited they're switching it up, and I haven't heard anything about it in the news,

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,240
which I follow religiously, and that's kind of surprising, so not exactly sure where they're

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,640
being taken place this year, and that's got me worried, but there's some new games, I bet,

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,600
and I'm excited to see all the athletes back in the mix. I've actually read some theories on

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,360
Tumblr that I'm pretty excited about. I saw one, and I hope that this pans out, but I saw one where

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,280
they're gonna flip it this year and do the winter events at the Summer Olympics, and the summer

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,840
events at the Winter Olympics. Sure, yeah, so dune skiing is gonna be fun, and then cold pool is the

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,800
new one for the Winter Olympics. Yeah. Yeah, so it's Ryan Lochte, and he's trying to get in the

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,840
pool, but he can't quite figure it out, partially because the water's frozen, but also because he's

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,240
just a really sort of dumb individual. No, you don't mean that about Ryan, you don't know him

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,320
personally. The media can spin all sorts of things. Yeah, yeah. I'm looking forward to sopping wet

26
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,400
curling. Sopping wet curling is the sexual fantasy. I am looking forward to slick sticks. That's where

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,840
you put two slick sticks in your feet, and you just slide your way on down the hill at top speed,

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,040
rocketing down across the mountains and through the hills on slick sticks. It's the first one

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,720
to grandma's house wins. Why are we talking about the Olympics? The summertime month is almost upon

30
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,960
us, Justin, and that means that the calendar has turned over another page into another Olympics.

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,440
I don't understand why you're getting fucking confused about it. It's not funny when we talk

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,000
about the real Olympics. Why did we think we could invent new Olympics? I don't think I invented this

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,160
Olympics, Justin. I think Julius Caesar did or some shit. Could we talk about how the Olympics are on

34
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,600
rotation like Brigadoon and they only pop up if you are in the right place at the right time and

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,080
the missed part and boom there's the Olympics and go get trapped in there because when they go away

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,160
they'll take you with them. Yeah, if you're left in the Olympic Village after they shut off the old

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,000
torch you sort of live there for another year until the next Olympics take place. Every year

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,680
the Olympics appear in a location that no one knows and so it's always fun to hunt for the

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,640
Olympics and all the athletes are getting ready because they know that once they start, like

40
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,760
whatever the first event is, if they're not on the same continent as the Olympics, and they have been

41
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,640
in the ocean, if they're on the same continent as the Olympics, they're going to miss their event.

42
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,880
They don't have long to get there. Pretty sure this year they're taking somewhere new. I think

43
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,360
they're going to get out to, you know, Casper, Wyoming. Oh, okay. Yeah, the summertime destination

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,480
of the world, certainly of the United States. I'll be there, you know me. I'm there every year,

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,080
me and Al Roker, and paddling around, tumbling around, wrestling. We like to wrestle with each

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
other, not for the sport, but just like every time I see him we just sort of like make the pose and

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,200
then we start sort of grappling right there on the ground and sometimes he wins, sometimes I win.

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,840
I would like to propose something. I assume that the Olympics committee is listening. We collect

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,560
a bunch of dirt, we dump it in the middle of the ocean, we form an island, and we call that island

50
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,680
Olympics Village, and like you build your shit on there, and you just use that over and over again.

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
We populate it with like the most capable, strongest, most beautiful athletes in the world,

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,080
and every year we know where to go, we know where there's gonna be, and it answers to no country.

53
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,360
AARON One issue I'm seeing, Travis. Shang Tsung's gonna find this place.

54
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
Travis Oh shit.

55
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,480
AARON Shang Tsung's gonna find this place, start using it as the new sort of connection to the

56
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,160
nether realm, and gonna turn it into a Mortal Kombat.

57
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Travis If he's willing to pay, you know, to lease the space when they're not using it for the Summer

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,760
or Winter Olympics, I mean, listen, the Olympics Village gotta make their nut somehow, so if,

59
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,520
you know, if he wants to pay to have Mortal Kombat there in Spring and Fall, I think that's okay.

60
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,600
AARON It bothers me every time the Olympics go to some big city that people already know about.

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Why can't it come here to Huntington, West Virginia? This is my pitch. Come here,

62
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,200
build your slaloms, build your ramps, build your skateboard tubes, build it all here, and just

63
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:20,000
leave it. The problem that you get in your Rio de Janeiro's and your soul's is that you put up your

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
ramp, and after two weeks, someone's like, actually, please move, this is where I park,

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,680
this is where my, you know, you name it, laundromat, falafel shop, news agent, whatever you like,

66
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,160
this is where that goes, and your ramp is in the way, please move it, Olympics. You put that in

67
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Huntington, I can guarantee, just leave it there. We'll find a use for it, thank you. We'll do

68
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,400
something with it, and if you want to come do the Olympics here again, all your shit's already here.

69
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't you just do them here again? No need to move them. One problem I see with that, Justin.

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,240
You are just so nitpicky. Well, I want us to nail this fucker down. Okay. Shang Tsung moves to

71
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:10,560
Huntington. Justin, can I also say, if you ever want to have just a fun YouTube dive, go on

72
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,040
YouTube and search Abandon Olympic Villages, and you will learn that what you have just described

73
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,240
is exactly what the Olympics already does. A lot of prep work, zero post work. Enjoy your ramp,

74
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,080
idiots. We out. Olympics out. What are you gonna do with that ramp? I guess dry everyone's laundry

75
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,920
on it, because it's your problem now. See ya. They tell him, we're gonna be back for this.

76
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Three and a half years, the world is gonna come back and get this ramp. So just leave it here,

77
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,800
and the world will come back for it here in three and a half years. Our globe is littered with

78
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,440
soccer fields nobody needs. Olympic detritus. That's why there's soccer so big all around the

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,680
world is because the Olympics keep building them. There's all kinds of soccer places.

80
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,760
So Casper, Wyoming, enjoy the soccer field. You can turn it into a fertile farmland maybe

81
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,840
afterwards, but don't think about the after times. Think about the coming up times when

82
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,520
all the medals are going around, and everyone, there's just so much jumping and throwing,

83
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,320
and I'm psyched on my fucking gourd. So can we start the show now? It was 10 minutes. I think

84
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,200
we've been pretty good boys, and I think we deserve it. Six months ago, I joined a small

85
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:30,400
kickboxing gym. All the coaches are excellent, and most refer to us by name, during classes,

86
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,680
or sparring. Due to my work schedule, I often attend a morning class that is fairly sparsely

87
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,400
attended, often just me and one other student. It's always taught by the same coach. He definitely

88
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,320
doesn't know my name, and it's gotten to the point where he knows it's too late to ask,

89
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,440
and now he's gonna go through weirdly elaborate ways to avoid having to use it.

90
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
It's given me contact social anxiety. Brothers, how do I let him know my name

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,360
without embarrassing us both? That's from Panic Stricken Pugilist, Pennsylvania.

92
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,960
I feel like this is an opportunity to use a phrase that is rarely used these days,

93
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,320
but I think you could bring back, which is, you know, boldly proclaim you're going to do something,

94
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,960
or my name isn't Travis McElroy. Oh, that's great. That was definitely

95
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,520
invented for this scenario, which is good. Yeah. Oh, but it would really mess with him

96
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,960
if you proclaimed, like, I'm going to bring in biscuits for everyone tomorrow,

97
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,640
or my name isn't Travis McElroy. And then you don't bring in biscuits the next day,

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,520
and they're like, wait, so is his name- What's his fucking name?

99
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,480
Isn't Travis McElroy? Fuck. So take that one off the list, I guess.

100
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,600
Sort of a similar thing. You could invent some power moves that have your name in them. So sort

101
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:47,280
of like the Derrick Driver or something. You know what I mean? Like the Derrick Spin Kick.

102
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:54,000
And it's like, here it comes, a Derrick. It's not a very good name. So like Derrick's,

103
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,280
the Derrick, oh, the Derrick Dart. And you just kind of throw yourself at the person.

104
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,440
You gotta shout it like you're a street, like you're Ryu from Street Fighter. It's just sort

105
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
of like- Derrick Dart!

106
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,760
And then you do it, and the problem there is that he's gonna think your name's Derrick Dart,

107
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,120
which is fine. Business card that you hand to somebody right before you kick their ass?

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,880
And I'm going to be your opponent today, and it just says Derrick Dart opponent.

109
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,440
You have to stay within the bounds of the question. It would be weird for you to give a

110
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
business card to somebody who has ostensibly known you for a while. So that would not fly.

111
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,280
This is custom, Justin, for the art of kickboxing, is you show respect to your opponent by

112
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
exchanging business cards.

113
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,120
Personalized boxing gloves that say your name across the gloves.

114
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,160
Oh, yeah, or backwards so that when you punch them. Oh, and the shoes can have the names on

115
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,240
too. So when you kick them right in the torso, they look down and it says, property of Derrick

116
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,800
Jemison.

117
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
I know it's called kickboxing, but it feels weird that you're allowed to kick them, right?

118
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,400
It just seems like you're trying to kick them and they're like, whoa.

119
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,080
That's his feet.

120
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,040
What?

121
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,160
Powerful feet.

122
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
What are you doing, kicking another human being? What's wrong with you?

123
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,280
With those powerful feet.

124
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,880
Who throws a shoe?

125
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,440
My daughter threw a shoe at me this week because she was mad, and my reaction was,

126
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,080
who throws a shoe? Honestly.

127
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
And she did not get it.

128
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,840
This kid.

129
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,040
She prefers Borat.

130
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,240
Y'all want a Yahoo?

131
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
Honestly.

132
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,440
This Yahoo was sent in by Esther Joy. Thank you, Esther. It's Yahoo Answers user question mark.

133
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
I'm going to say Flo from Progressive Insurance asks,

134
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:50,400
Would Apple sales be affected if Steve Jobs dropped the iPod on stage while presenting it for the first time?

135
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:59,920
I would like to show you what we've been-

136
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,200
This is you nerds at home, and you take your disc in and pop it in the Discman,

137
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,000
and then this is how you nerds walk all gentle so as not to disrupt the disc spinning.

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,160
What if I said fuck the disc?

139
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm so glad that I said that because I'd like to show you the iPod.

140
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,960
This special little music toy is going to-

141
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,320
Aw, damn it.

142
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,280
Aw, damn it.

143
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,480
Aw, beans.

144
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
Miss Steve's big day.

145
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,560
Aw, nerds.

146
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,440
I've broken the music toy iPod.

147
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
Oh, all the music's leaking out everywhere.

148
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
All the songs are all over the stage.

149
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,960
Oh my, oh my-

150
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,440
Somebody get some brawny paper towels.

151
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,680
Hey, there's a big puddle of Sister Hazel over there, everybody. Be real careful.

152
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,240
How?

153
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
Okay, there has to be some sort of behind the scenes technical wizardry happening

154
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,960
because I've never seen any of this.

155
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,040
I've never seen Jony Ive like,

156
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,600
oh, look at this, and this is the iPhone 10.

157
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
I gave it a little nubbin' up on top.

158
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
It's like a dandy little hat.

159
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
And what's good is you can brush the hat and,

160
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
oh, fuck me, I did drop my music toy.

161
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,520
It's never happened.

162
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,720
There has to be magnets in the gloves or sticky glue on all the display phones.

163
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,400
The only time it happened is with the special edition

164
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,920
that was red and branded with U2 stuff.

165
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,080
They did drop that one on stage,

166
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,000
but then Bono just started playing his guitar to distract everyone

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,080
and nobody noticed that it happened.

168
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,360
Oh, that's, yes.

169
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,520
Yeah, that's a little behind the scenes right there.

170
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,280
That's why each Apple press conference ends with a concert,

171
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,000
usually by a bad music artist,

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,080
is they want to distract you just in case.

173
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,440
So they have this lever they can pull.

174
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
Tim Cook is like, here's the iPhone 8,

175
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
and I've just thrown it high in the air accidentally,

176
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,280
and it's exploded on the ground.

177
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,800
Take it away, Imagine Dragons.

178
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
And they're like, boom, and the bullshit.

179
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,120
And you're like, whoa, what just happened?

180
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
You're concussed almost by the bad music.

181
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,840
Now, Griffin, you just threw the glove down

182
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,760
at both U2 and Imagine Dragons.

183
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,240
Anything you want to walk back for people at home?

184
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,800
Yes, I will say that Foo Fighters, I believe, did one,

185
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
and that band still shreds.

186
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,160
Okay, one time I was at work at PetSmart,

187
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
back when I worked at PetSmart,

188
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
and I was pulling my iPhone out of my pocket, it slipped.

189
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,760
I tried to catch it,

190
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,320
but instead ended up spiking it into the ground

191
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,840
as though I was angry at my iPhone,

192
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,120
and it shattered into a bajillion pieces.

193
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,320
I would like to see Tim Cook do that now,

194
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,840
and then be like, just kidding,

195
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,480
and pull an even better iPhone out of his pocket.

196
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
The next iPhone, yeah.

197
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
Technically, I think they did this

198
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
at the last Apple phone press conference,

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,840
where he was like, this is the iPhone 8.

200
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,520
Looks a lot like the iPhone 7, huh?

201
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,320
Is Imagine Dragons ready yet?

202
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,880
They're not?

203
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,200
Fuck.

204
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,160
Okay, check this out.

205
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,680
Smash.

206
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
Here's the iPhone 10.

207
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,000
We skipped 9.

208
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,160
Bono, get out here.

209
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
Bono, quick, quick, save me.

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
Travis, you went through a few iPhones, memory service,

211
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
because there was the one time we were at our aunt's pool,

212
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,480
and our daddy was bringing your phone to you,

213
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,200
and he did definitely drop it on the hard cement,

214
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,400
and he picked it up,

215
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,720
and then just continued the delivery,

216
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,640
and tried to walk away real fast,

217
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,600
and you were like, um, um, um, um, um,

218
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,880
one moment, please.

219
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,760
It exploded.

220
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,120
That was my iPhone 3, I believe, if I remember correctly.

221
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,760
Cool move.

222
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,480
Cool move by dad, though.

223
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,520
Was that at Aunt Brenda's house?

224
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
That was at Aunt Brenda's house,

225
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
and cool move by daddy,

226
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
trying to sneak one past you,

227
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,920
as if you would not notice the sizable chasm

228
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,760
in the glass surface of the screen.

229
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,880
It was super cool, dad.

230
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,120
It was cool.

231
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
If you're listening, dad,

232
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I haven't forgiven you, and I never will.

233
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,960
But if you drop it on the stage,

234
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,160
Tim Cook just tries to explode the iPhone 8,

235
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,040
because it sucks,

236
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,560
and then he picks it up,

237
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,840
and he's like, oh, look at that.

238
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
It's still good.

239
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,440
Well, um, I guess-

240
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
That's better for Apple Socks, right?

241
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
If he drops it on stage-

242
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,440
Yeah.

243
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,280
Okay, is that better for Apple Socks?

244
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,200
He drops it on stage, it's fine.

245
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
Like, literally nothing happens.

246
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
But you do realize that this company

247
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,960
is in the hands of people,

248
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,400
the sort of hands that will drop an iPhone

249
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,680
at just the least opportune time possible.

250
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Right.

251
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,040
That's going to shake my face, I think, as an investor.

252
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,560
Okay, here's what I wanted to see.

253
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
I want to watch a real time,

254
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
like, tracking of Apple Socks

255
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,160
as Tim Cook drops it,

256
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,800
and there it goes down,

257
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,160
right?

258
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,680
But then he catches it on his foot,

259
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,520
and flips it back up into his hand,

260
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,400
and the fucking sock just goes through the roof.

261
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,240
I think that the optics we need to avoid here,

262
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,760
Apple, we're now doing this,

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,200
and it's a paid service,

264
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,040
so we'll send you an invoice,

265
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,480
is it's got to be purposeful.

266
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,160
It can't look like it has a slippery accident.

267
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
I think that Tim says,

268
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,080
here's an iPhone 11,

269
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,520
we're so excited about this,

270
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,040
sorry about that nubbin on top,

271
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
we shaved it right off.

272
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,920
And for the next part of my book report,

273
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,440
I'm going to kick this thing's ass for about 10 minutes.

274
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,880
And he does take his shirt off,

275
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,520
and then he dropkicks the phone across the stage,

276
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,040
and walks slowly to over where it lands,

277
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,080
and then picks it up again,

278
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,160
and kicks it right back to the other side of the stage,

279
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
and repeats this process for 10 minutes.

280
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,960
And then at the end,

281
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,840
and he brings out Limp Bizkit to play along with it.

282
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,360
No, no, Travis,

283
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,000
at the end,

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
he gets on the phone,

285
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,520
shows it still works by calling Limp Bizkit

286
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,560
to come out on stage.

287
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,440
And then while he's still shirtless on the stage,

288
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
and sweaty from the 10 minutes of phone kicking he just did,

289
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,520
he just skanks it up there so fucking hard

290
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,040
to Limp Bizkit's great songs.

291
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,600
And they go on the road,

292
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
and Tim's like,

293
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm actually,

294
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,480
this feels good.

295
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,840
This feels right.

296
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
This is where I belong.

297
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm going to keep doing this with you, Limp Bizkit.

298
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,360
I'm a Limp Bizkit skank boy now.

299
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,880
Fuck off, I'm free.

300
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
I want Tim to come out one year and say,

301
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
hey everybody, two things to announce.

302
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
One, I'm free.

303
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,920
I travel around Limp Bizkit,

304
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,840
and I'm fucking free as a bird.

305
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,760
Second, your current phone is fine.

306
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
It's fine, and I'm free.

307
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,680
We couldn't come up with any new ideas.

308
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,840
Just keep buying more of those, I guess.

309
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,560
It's not a, yeah.

310
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,600
Or don't buy them.

311
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,560
You don't need them.

312
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm free.

313
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,640
My name is Tim Cook,

314
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
and I'm the dancer for Limp Bizkit.

315
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
And I'm telling you that I'm free

316
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720
for the first time in my life.

317
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,760
Your phone's fine.

318
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,400
Tim Cook walks out and pulls just a Walkman

319
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,120
out of his pocket with a Limp Bizkit cassette in it.

320
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,640
He's like, this is all I need.

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
You can still fucking jam to this.

322
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
What are you, what are you talking?

323
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,040
I've got, you need one cassette.

324
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Limp Bizkit, there it is.

325
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,960
This is my one cassette of Chocolate Starfish

326
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
in the Hot Dog flavored water,

327
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,560
and this is all I fucking need.

328
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,480
This tape fucking melts.

329
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,800
Why would I want to make a phone call on my Walkman

330
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,760
and interrupt my Limp?

331
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,840
If I make a call, the Limp goes away.

332
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
They're two separate products.

333
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,840
Grow up.

334
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
That would be a dope feature for iPhone 11

335
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
is if it let you make calls

336
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
while still listening to Limp Bizkit.

337
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,560
I try not to take a shit on Steve Jobs' legacy, folks,

338
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,200
but the biggest mistake he ever made in his life

339
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
was making the iPod bigger

340
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
than the storage you would need

341
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
to hold Chocolate Starfish in the Hot Dog flavored water,

342
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,440
and maybe one other Limp Bizkit track.

343
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
But that's it.

344
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
You don't need other records.

345
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
This fucking melts.

346
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,560
Hey, everybody, come up individually.

347
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,960
Listen to my headphones.

348
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,400
Like in Gordon's tape.

349
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,280
Come up there and play you a Limp Bizkit song

350
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,360
that'll change your life.

351
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,240
Yeah, Tim.

352
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,120
Tim, I like this.

353
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,760
This is good.

354
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,960
Dude, your nipples are huge, man.

355
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,240
Do you want me to get that shirt?

356
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,640
It landed on my wife in the audience.

357
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,700
So.

358
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,220
So.

359
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,880
God Almighty.

360
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
I have a new segment I wanted to try.

361
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,780
Okay.

362
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,280
And this will be more of a service.

363
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,560
The world has had a lot of time to get things right and wrong,

364
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,760
and what I want to talk about is Proverbs,

365
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,280
not the book of the Bible, though we might duck in there.

366
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,640
But I want to hear my brother, my brother and me

367
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
take the great advice that has already come before us

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
from all the great world cultures and wise people and whatever,

369
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,760
and I want to bring it into the modern era with us here.

370
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,960
It's called, this is Travis's name, Proverb Punch-Up.

371
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,680
And I want to take some Proverbs,

372
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,400
and I'd ask if you have a favorite proverb

373
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
that you'd like us to sort of like update.

374
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
You know, just let us know and we'll take a swing at it.

375
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,720
But I thought we could just kind of get started

376
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,320
and kind of try to bring the, make these modern.

377
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,800
You know what I mean?

378
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,480
Yeah, maybe no jokes on this one.

379
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,840
Maybe like a real, like on a serious.

380
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Here's the first one I want to talk about.

381
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
The pen is mightier than the sword.

382
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
The pen is mightier than the sword.

383
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,600
And what this is saying currently is like,

384
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,280
you can write words that could do more damage than one sword.

385
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,680
That's fine. Nobody has pens.

386
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:29,920
Yeah.

387
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,200
And even fewer people have swords.

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,120
So this is no good.

389
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,400
This, as an analogy, this is useless to us now.

390
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
As a people, we need to move on.

391
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,600
So how can we fix it?

392
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,480
The pen is mightier than a sword.

393
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,680
Do you know the origin of this one?

394
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,240
It was Alexander Great.

395
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,720
And he was up against the other army

396
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,840
and they had so many swords and they didn't have any.

397
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
And he said, oh shoot.

398
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
And he pulled out his pen or his quill

399
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,440
and he wrote down on an order form,

400
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
I would like to buy a hundred swords.

401
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,280
And so they filled it out and then all of a sudden

402
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,760
his one pen, Justin and Travis,

403
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
became a hundred swords just like that.

404
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,280
Just like that with ship because he had prime, of course.

405
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
See, I heard it was Abraham Lincoln

406
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,760
was leading the north troops in the civil war against the south.

407
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,200
He goes to the one great river

408
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
where they sort of separates the whole country

409
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,160
and they were, all the bad guys in the south

410
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,360
had a bunch of swords, the curved ones.

411
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,160
And all of his men had, was pens.

412
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
They didn't have any guns.

413
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,760
They didn't have any swords.

414
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,960
They just had pens.

415
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,640
And they were like, Abe, I know you cannot tell a lie.

416
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,880
What are we doing here?

417
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,560
Because it seems like we're about to get fucking wrecked.

418
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,720
And he was like, no, don't worry, my man.

419
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,880
The pen is mightier than the sword.

420
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
You just have to sort of like, you know, get in there.

421
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
You gotta jab harder.

422
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,640
You gotta jab hard.

423
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,080
You gotta strike first.

424
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,400
You gotta be sneaky.

425
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,640
But the pen can be in the right circumstances.

426
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,080
Milder than, more powerful, mightier than the sword.

427
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,120
See, I thought it was a young man named Sammy Clemons.

428
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,080
He was looking at a sword and he was like,

429
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
this is fucking boring.

430
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,440
And then someone handed him a pen.

431
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,800
And when he turned it and made it look like a chicken

432
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,960
was walking across the road on the end of the pen.

433
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,360
And he said, oh, this is mighty funnier than that sword.

434
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,800
Okay.

435
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,960
That young man grew up to be Mark Twain.

436
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,240
Wow.

437
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,560
Yes.

438
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,360
Wow.

439
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,680
Wow.

440
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,080
Now, what I heard is comedian Dave Barry.

441
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,360
Dave Barry, someone showed him an apple and said,

442
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,400
this is a sword.

443
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,320
And Dave Barry stabbed into the apple with the pen.

444
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
He's like, well, I guess swords are shit.

445
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
And so he says, based on this one observation,

446
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,880
I can confirm that all pins are mightier than all swords.

447
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
But we've lost the plot a little bit

448
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
because how we update it.

449
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,360
Fix it.

450
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
Think about all the other things

451
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
that must be mightier than the sword.

452
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,040
You know what I mean?

453
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,000
Like a big block or a pencil even.

454
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
Maybe we update the proverb

455
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,240
with just a complete power ranking of all extant objects.

456
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,800
Okay.

457
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,960
Just to let people know where they clock in.

458
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,800
So sword would be, sorry gang, close to the bottom.

459
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,560
Pen would not be in the top.

460
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Technology has evolved so much.

461
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,160
I mean, God, bazooka, Thor's hammer.

462
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,280
Those are just two things that I thought of

463
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,720
off the top of my head.

464
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,520
I mean, right there, the pen is mightier than the sword.

465
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,760
Fair.

466
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
The erasable pen, that's huge.

467
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,320
So then you have to say the erasable pen

468
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,520
is mightier than the pen

469
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,640
because it does have the sort of corrective.

470
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,200
Yeah.

471
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,480
Maybe the proverb is just this then.

472
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,600
The bazooka is the mightiest thing of all, gang.

473
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,400
I like that.

474
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,240
And then there's no question about it

475
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
because there is absolutely nothing

476
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,680
that can step to one of these beautiful tubes.

477
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,360
Because if someone's got a pen and they're like,

478
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,000
I've got this and you're like, I've got a bazooka.

479
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,160
I hope you can write very fast

480
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,960
and you have some sort of distribution network

481
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,720
available to you because this is gonna be over quickly.

482
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
I don't really know.

483
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Okay, but what if you use the pen to write broken

484
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,080
on the bazooka?

485
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,520
Because then they look at it, they're like,

486
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm not fucking with that.

487
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,520
It could explode right there.

488
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
Well, I kind of like this checks and balances though

489
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,320
that we're establishing between pen and bazooka.

490
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,280
It's just dumb.

491
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
I could blow you the fuck away

492
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,040
before you could get your piece of paper on my bazooka.

493
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,080
This is kids shit.

494
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,120
The bazooka wins.

495
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,920
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

496
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,080
I'll look at my fucking horse you gave me

497
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,360
wherever the hell I want to.

498
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,160
You can look at a horse wherever you want.

499
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,120
It's your horse.

500
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
I don't see why you can't look.

501
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
Don't you want to know what you're dealing with?

502
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
See if it needs some dental care?

503
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
This seems stupid to me.

504
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,040
Do you know what I don't like about this aphorism

505
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,920
and I never have?

506
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,600
It's a negative, right?

507
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
Give me a positive.

508
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,280
Like, do look a gift horse in the eyes.

509
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,640
Oh, you shouldn't do that though.

510
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,200
Oh my God.

511
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,080
Oh, no really?

512
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,040
That's a huge mistake.

513
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,440
Huge.

514
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,080
Why?

515
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,440
Because then it makes them feel like you're on the same level.

516
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,880
If someone looks you in the eyes,

517
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
that's going to drive you into some sort of battle fury.

518
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,760
You don't want that.

519
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
Well, but one in 10 times,

520
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,880
that's your first step to Seabiscuit.

521
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Because you look them in the eyes and you connect.

522
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,080
You say like, hey, they didn't appreciate you, but I will.

523
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,320
Now run fast, you beautiful bastard.

524
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,080
I'll tell you what's huge now is for teens today,

525
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,440
is reverse psychology.

526
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,640
Because if you tell a teen don't look in that horse's mouth,

527
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,960
they're going to be in that mouth by sundown.

528
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
So what you have to say is that I demand

529
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,880
you look in that horse's mouth right now.

530
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,560
And then people will see that and be like,

531
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,600
fuck this system.

532
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,800
And they won't do it.

533
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,280
Yeah.

534
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,720
What if you put a picture of a horse's mouth on Instagram

535
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,160
and they're all going to see it?

536
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Shit, that's funny.

537
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
Isn't that good?

538
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,600
How about we make it a little bit more of like a test, right?

539
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,480
And you make it like,

540
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
oh, looking on horse's mouth, up to you.

541
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,680
We get John Quinones near that horse and he says,

542
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,920
oh, I see you looked in the horse's mouth.

543
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,040
Have a seat.

544
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,240
The early bird catches the worm.

545
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,840
This one's pretty good still, I think.

546
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,840
I think it does work.

547
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,360
Early bird catches the worm.

548
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,920
Worm.

549
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,240
But the super-duper late bird that's so late

550
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,440
that it's the next day is there before the early bird.

551
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,200
Yeah, time means nothing.

552
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,160
Yeah, time means nothing.

553
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,360
Time is an illusion.

554
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,200
Early bird catches the worm.

555
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
The late bird will figure it out.

556
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,560
Something, I mean, they're doing something.

557
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,840
They're going to eat a late bird.

558
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Late bird will get a late worm.

559
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,480
You know what I mean?

560
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
Like, there's worms in the fuck everywhere.

561
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,280
Yeah.

562
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,360
There's not just one fucking worm.

563
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,280
That's a good, I like that aphorism.

564
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,960
There's not just one fucking worm.

565
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,400
There's plenty of worms.

566
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,280
And this bomb I just invented is going to get them all out of the ground.

567
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah.

568
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,920
How about this for a proverb?

569
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
There's plenty of worms out there.

570
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
How come, how come there's plenty of fish in the sea

571
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
but there's not plenty of worms in the dirt, right?

572
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,080
How come it's not like the early hawk catches the one fish in the water?

573
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
Like, that doesn't make any sense.

574
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,040
There's lots of worms.

575
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,880
There's worms everywhere.

576
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
Just get a different worm.

577
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,840
Here's the thing we can twist it though.

578
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,200
The easy twist here, the late worm stays alive.

579
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,320
Yeah.

580
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,680
So it's just a question of what you are, a bird or a worm.

581
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,240
And me, I'm a dirty, nasty worm.

582
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,080
Wriggling around the ground, eating up dirt and dookie in the ground.

583
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,760
I love this.

584
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,960
There's plenty of worms.

585
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,000
That's a proverb, right?

586
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
There's, there's plenty of worms.

587
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,240
Plenty of worms.

588
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,360
Get there when you get there.

589
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,560
There's plenty of worms.

590
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,720
There's like 30 worms.

591
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,280
I think it's better if we attach a specific number to it.

592
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,640
Okay.

593
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,200
That's good because that, you can't sleep all day.

594
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,560
You do have to wake up eventually.

595
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,800
But like, so the proverb is just like.

596
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,280
There's 30.

597
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,240
There's like 30 worms.

598
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,720
There's 30 worms.

599
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,520
Not like.

600
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,560
We got to be definitive.

601
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,280
30 worms.

602
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,400
There are 30 worms.

603
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
There are 30 worms.

604
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,280
That's a good proverb.

605
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,320
We're gonna get that on a t-shirt.

606
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,640
Okay.

607
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,760
There are 30 worms, comma, don't be the 31st bird.

608
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,920
Uh, yeah.

609
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,640
No, that's great.

610
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,240
Right?

611
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,280
Because that establishes like, you do need to get there.

612
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,800
But you don't have to be the first.

613
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,680
It's okay.

614
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,440
Just don't be the 31st.

615
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
I mean, you'll eat something, right?

616
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Oh, that's good.

617
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,280
That's good, Justin.

618
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,480
It's gonna be something.

619
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,000
Maybe it's a mealy worm.

620
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,960
There are 30 fresh, good, good worms.

621
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,280
When God, when God makes a worm get eaten, he gives you another worm.

622
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,040
Yes, so there are 30 good fresh worms.

623
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,520
Try not to be the 31st bird.

624
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,040
But if you are, there will probably still be some options available.

625
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,720
A weird, sick worm.

626
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
You might have to eat a caterpillar today.

627
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,560
That you despise.

628
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,120
I love that.

629
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,760
Because you know what?

630
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,480
It's pithy.

631
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,240
It's brief.

632
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,880
I love it.

633
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,360
Yeah, it's even better than the last one.

634
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,840
Excellent.

635
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,920
All right, let's take a break real quick and we're gonna head into the Money Zone.

636
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,880
Can we do a review?

637
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,400
Like an after show sort of review of that new segment?

638
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,920
Okay, yeah.

639
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,840
I think that's really up to the listeners if they want us to fix their problems for them.

640
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,440
You know, everything's gonna be hard at first.

641
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,960
It's about growing and learning.

642
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,480
What did you learn from that?

643
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,120
That it was a great segment and you're a beautiful, creative mind.

644
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

645
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,560
Perfect.

646
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,880
Our first sponsor this week is Casper.

647
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,000
It's a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create an exceptionally

648
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

649
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,240
We've told you all about Casper.

650
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,360
You know we're huge fans.

651
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,560
I love sleeping in the Casper mattress in our guest room when I'm sick and don't want

652
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
to infect my family.

653
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,440
So that is a treat that I look forward to being sick.

654
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,720
But Casper is also a great mattress for anytime sleeping.

655
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,800
Even when you're healthy, Casper is right there for you.

656
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,400
But I just love it and it's great also to open the box and see it kind of unfurl.

657
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,040
It feels a little bit like magic, which I think we can all use a little bit of in our

658
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,080
day-to-day lives.

659
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,720
Casper brand mattresses combine multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface

660
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
with the right amount of both sink and bounce.

661
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
What's the right amount?

662
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,600
Shh, don't ask.

663
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,920
Ten.

664
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,960
Ten sink, eleven bounce.

665
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,240
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

666
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,800
Get the mattress, sleep on it for three months for crying out loud.

667
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,040
And if you don't like it after three months, I mean that would be wild.

668
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,920
Of course you'll like it, but if you don't, you can just send it back.

669

Can I please talk about me undies?

673
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,760
Yeah.

674
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,720
They are the fun, comfy undies that feel as good as they look.

675
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
You know about me undies.

676
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,880
If you haven't tried them, you gotta listen to me right now.

677
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
It's the most important thing you'll ever listen to.

678
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,600
These guys are made out of sustainably sourced material from beechwood trees.

679
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,840
And you know, you're thinking, I don't want to wear a tree.

680
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,680
They make it soft, so don't stop attacking me.

681
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,080
This naturally soft fiber, it makes a fabric that won't sag down or ride up.

682
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm wearing a pair right now.

683
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,120
Got black and white spots all over it.

684
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,600

Holy shit.

696
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,600
No joke, this is amazing.

697
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,160
Public speaking is many people's greatest fear.

698
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,880
But when your brother, sister, child, best friend, whoever gets married, guess what?

699
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,840
You do it.

707
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
This is brilliant to me.

708
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,040
Is there a partner website called Secret Toast?

709
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,240
And this is toast I keep under my desk and it's not yours, Janus.

710
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,080
I know it smells like burnt bread and jam over here, but mind your own beeswax.

711
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,960
Janus.

712
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,440
Janus.

713
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
I have a message from Clopar.

714
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,280
It's from Felrin.

715
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,360
This says in a nasally voice, please.

716
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,040
Well, you're the boss.

717
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,600
Hey, weird legs.

718
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:22,720
I paid the McElroys to distract you long enough to have my army of dippy bird robots,

719
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,880
Koalaac, and Clopar clones take over your dimension.

720
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
You're losing it, Justin.

721
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,640
Don't you dare team up with Betty, Jenny, and Mimnim to try to take it back.

722
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,960
You'll never get past the security goats.

723
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,600
Later, loser.

724
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,120
Think that's XOXO.

725
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,400
XOXO, you're right.

726
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,040
Thank you.

727
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,080
Happy birthday to that loser Dalton, too.

728
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,400
Did I do that?

729
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,280
Yeah, you did.

730
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,080
You did do it.

731
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,200
We all heard it.

732
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,600
Preferred time frame on this was six weeks ago.

733
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,920
So happy birthday, Dalton, and good luck on the next one that is just around the corner.

734
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,240
Sorry.

735
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,160
Here's a message for Caitlin and it's from Ammo.

736
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,880
And it's a big Adventure Zone spoiler, which is fun new style of content for the

737
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,400
Jumbotron spots on the Bim Bam.

738
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,360
So if you haven't listened to Adventure Zone and you want to, or even if you don't want to,

739
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,120
you're going to want to at some point, I bet.

740
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,120
So go ahead and skip ahead or turn down the volume for the next like 10 seconds.

741
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,600
Here we go.

742
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,240
You are the loop to my berry blue jeans.

743
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
Let's be neck romantic together.

744
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,720
That is a sweet message.

745
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,280
And I'm sorry that a few people probably turned down their car speakers and didn't hear it.

746
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,160
But to put it in sort of non-spoilery terms, they love each other.

747
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,200
How's it going, everyone?

748
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,160
I'm Oliver Wang.

749
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
And I'm Morgan Rhodes.

750
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,120
We have a brand new show on the Maximum Fun Network that we'd love to share with you.

751
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,240
It's called Heat Rocks.

752
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,880
Morgan, we should probably explain what a heat rock is.

753
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,920
It is a banger, a fire track, true fire.

754
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,960
Right, dope album.

755
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,280
Each episode, we will bring on a special guest to join us to talk about one of their heat rocks.

756
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,400
It might be a musician.

757
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,120
A writer.

758
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,920
Maybe a scholar.

759
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,880
I mean, I would have been happy to just talk to you about your heat rocks.

760
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
But this is a different show.

761
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,120
Yeah, I think people might enjoy hearing maybe the guests instead.

762
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,360
To do that, you'll have to go to MaximumFun.org.

763
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,920
So if you want to talk about hot music, you should check us out.

764
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,480
Heat Rocks.

765
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,000
This weekend, I was in an apartment store and in the clearance section, there were men's underwear.

766
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,080
I only spotted one pair that I liked and I started making my way to the checkout counter

767
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,920
when I realized that in buying a single pair of underwear and nothing else,

768
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,360
the checkout lady would almost certainly think that I had recently pooped my pants,

769
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,880
which I did not, I swear.

770
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,680
I circled back around and grabbed a second pair of underwear that I did not like,

771
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,360
just to save the embarrassment.

772
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,000
Was this all in my head or did I make the right move?

773
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,080
That's from not so soggy bottom boy in corduroys.

774
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,600
No, the problem is you've just sent the message to the checkout person

775
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,720
that you have recently pooped your pants and you're planning on doing it again.

776
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,480
That is exactly what I was gonna say.

777
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,400
Strike again.

778
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,000
They'll be like, do you need a bag for this?

779
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
And then you say, no, I've got a bag.

780
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,040
And you pull up an empty Chipotle bag that you had on you

781
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,720
and that will sort of drive this illusion home completely.

782
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,640
And then go back in 10 minutes later and buy another pair of underwear.

783
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,560
Just keep going back in.

784
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,400
But is there a limit at your establishment?

785
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,280
What is your limit?

786
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,720
I think the way to avoid any suspicion here is to shop as leisurely as you possibly can.

787
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Maybe even saying out loud, I am in no rush.

788
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,160
Okay, I also want to point out, you are gonna buy one pair of underwear

789
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,360
and you're like, if I just buy one pair, they're gonna think I pooped my pants.

790
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,320
What should I, I've got it.

791
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
A second pair of underwear.

792
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,880
Like there are many items you could have like tacked on

793
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,840
that would have just upset the narrative completely.

794
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,560
Because the problem, like I worry about this.

795
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,480
If you go right into, if you go to Rite Aid, right?

796
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,280
And you lay down a huge container of toilet paper,

797
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,160
they're gonna think, oh, this guy has to shit really bad.

798
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,880
He came in just for this because he got to shit so bad.

799
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,400
He's not thinking ahead.

800
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,840
He needs to do this right now.

801
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,360
Now, if you get the toilet paper and like sugar-free gummy bears,

802
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,440
they're gonna think, well, whatever he's buying with it

803
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,520
must be something that makes him shit a lot.

804
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,760
Because he's buying toilet paper with it.

805
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,920
I would assume this guy's got big plans.

806
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,760
The only solution, here's what you should have done.

807
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,360
You should have bought the underwear, but also a t-shirt,

808
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,040
a button-up shirt to go over it, a pair of pants, a pair of socks,

809
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,160
and a pair of shoes, and laid them all out on the counter

810
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,280
like that as you bought it.

811
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,080
So it looked like you were buying a whole outfit,

812
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,520
maybe even a hat, right?

813
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,080
You're buying a whole outfit in one go.

814
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,280
Problem there, Trav, is not Shang Tsung.

815
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,560
It's that I would just assume it went everywhere.

816
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,040
Oh, you pooped your whole outfit.

817
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,360
I pooped my body is the problem.

818
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,560
So I think what you do is you walk up with the one pair of-

819
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,680
Like you had a blowout.

820
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,800
Yeah, you walk up to the counter with the one pair of underwear

821
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,640
and you make eye contact with them the whole time.

822
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,840
This part's important.

823
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,520
And you don't have to spend other money

824
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
just to fucking prove something.

825
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,120
You just look them in the eyes and you say,

826
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,240
I didn't-

827
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,240
I didn't.

828
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,040
Place the one pair of underpants on the counter and say,

829
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,480
can you gift wrap that?

830
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,080
Oh, that's great.

831
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,880
Real good.

832
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,640
I'll wrap a lot of gift wrap around

833
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,400
so it'll take me about 15 minutes as the crow flies to get it unpacked.

834
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,960
I won't be at any sort of rush so you can make it as fancy as you want.

835
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,640
Maybe you could announce,

836
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,720
please leave the tag on because I'm going to show my partner the style

837
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,680
and I don't know if they'll enjoy the style of these boxer shorts.

838
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,440
So please leave the tag on because I have a partner

839
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
who's very choosy about my undergarments.

840
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
So leave the tag on, please, because I might return them.

841
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,880
And when I do, I will be well within my rights to do so.

842
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,840
Oh, no.

843
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,880
Ultimate power move.

844
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Halfway through checking out, just say,

845
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,040
no, you know what?

846
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,800
In fact, I don't need these.

847
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,400
And then walk out of the store.

848
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
And they'll come back.

849
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,240
Yeah.

850
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,240
Waddling.

851
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,720
They'll know that not only did you not poop your pants,

852
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,320
you are confident you're not going to between there and home.

853
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,680
I told my partner about the style of these boxer shorts

854
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,360
and they insisted that I return and purchase them posthaste.

855
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,760
Yes.

856
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,280
I sent them a picture and they said,

857
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,920
oh, yes, that will be very flattering.

858
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,440
And so here I am.

859
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,280
You know how partners are.

860
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,640
Maybe you could buy one pair of underwear

861
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,840
and then while they're checking you out, whisper under your breath,

862
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,120
maybe you shit your pants.

863
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,160
I'm buying these for you.

864
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,280
Did you shit your pants, Cashier?

865
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm buying these for you because I think you shit your pants.

866
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,640
That's good.

867
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,960
They'll get so defensive about it,

868
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,600
they won't have the chance to sort of judge you.

869
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah.

870
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,360
Also, I will take this impulse purchase funny coffee mug.

871
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,240
Thank you very much.

872
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,200
The danger with that one is you got to get yours in

873
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,640
before they get theirs in.

874
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,600
So maybe while you're even just 15 feet away,

875
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,200
approaching the register, just be like,

876
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
smells like you shit your pants.

877
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,920
I didn't.

878
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,400
You could also walk up and give them the underpants

879
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,120
and you say, you can check out

880
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,880
and then you lift up the underwear

881
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,360
and you pretend like you're having a lot of trouble lifting it

882
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,440
and you go, oh God, do you guys do delivery?

883
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,800
An ultimate I'm never going to shit my pants confidence move, right?

884
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,200
Buy the underpants and a pair of sheer white linen pants.

885
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,560
Yeah, right?

886
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,920
I'll tell you what move I like, boys.

887
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,160
You walk up to the registry,

888
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,440
you got this one pair of underwear,

889
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,520
you hand it to them, they beep it.

890
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,760
They say, that'll be $7.99, please.

891
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,720
And you say, I shit my pants.

892
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,800
Listen, no, shut up.

893
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,600
I shit my pants and I don't have my wallet.

894
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,680
Can you please, please?

895
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,640
My boss is here.

896
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,200
My boss outside, my boss outside.

897
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,440
I shit all over my pants, please.

898
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,080
And they say, oh my God, you don't have your wallet?

899
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,880
And you say, no, my wallet at house.

900
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
I have other underwear there.

901
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,560
I wouldn't need these if I had it, please.

902
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,920
And they say, okay, just take it.

903
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,000
Take it, take it, take it, take it and go.

904
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,200
Do you need to use our bathroom?

905
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,880
And you say, no, I change in a car.

906
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,720
And then you go outside with your free underwear you just got.

907
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,400
And you Kaiser Soze away.

908
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Yeah, you waddle up to the register,

909
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,240
do this scheme and you waddle away.

910
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,440
But then they see you outside.

911
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,800
Shhh, rotten proud, $8 richer.

912
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,520
How about a Yahoo?

913
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,440
Yeah, I would love to do a Yahoo, Griffin.

914
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,200
Okay, here's one that was sent in by Grayson Harlow.

915
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,920
Thank you, Grayson.

916
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,240
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

917
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,440
I'm gonna call him Biverly asks,

918
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,760
is it okay to eat some sandwiches in church?

919
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,480
Hmm, no additional details here,

920
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,640
but you have some sandwiches and it's noon time

921
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,960
and the creature's really ripping and roaring.

922
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,320
And you think, I'm not gonna make it.

923
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,280
I need to eat some of these, some sandwiches right now.

924
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,640
Yeah.

925
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,320
Is it okay to just start chomping down on these?

926
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,240
Or do I need to wait for the, you know, to be dismissed?

927
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,480
Or is it possible to maybe slump one down real fast

928
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,560
during prayer when nobody's looking?

929
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,840
And then if they do come up to you, you're like,

930
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,040
did you just eat two egg salad sandwiches during the prayer?

931
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,880
You say like, I guess you weren't looking, huh?

932
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,320
Hey, I guess you don't need anything from God, huh?

933
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:06,720
Okay.

934
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,440
Huh, I guess the question, Griffin, the important question,

935
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,640
what's on the sandwich?

936
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,880
Because there are definitely some answers to that

937
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,040
that make it more okay than others.

938
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,080
Like peanut butter sandwich, fine.

939
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,920
Peanut butter sandwich doesn't bother me.

940
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,560
But like, if there's some like sloppy meats on there,

941
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't know how I feel about that.

942
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,840
Sloppy sinful meats, you mean?

943
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,400
Yeah.

944
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,200
Yeah.

945
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,520
Anything cured is of the devil.

946
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,160
Sure.

947
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,480
I was in Ironton on Monday for the 150th

948
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,640
Ironton Memorial Day Parade.

949
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,520
It's the longest continuously running Memorial Day Parade

950
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,600
in the country and I went to the Shake Shop on my way out

951
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,560
because when you roam, you go to the Shake Shop in Ironton.

952
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,640
And I was waiting for 100 years for my milkshake

953
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,520
and my ice cream.

954
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,400
And a woman who looked like she just came out of church

955
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,960
came up to the counter to pick up her order.

956
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,360
And judging by the foil, it was a single hamburger

957
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,880
is what it looked like to me.

958
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,520
It was one single large hamburger.

959
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,720
And I did not hear her during the ordering process.

960
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,400
So I can only extrapolate.

961
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,680
But when the woman behind the counter handed her this

962
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,960
what appeared to be a sandwich, she said, and I quote,

963
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,640
I put as much mayonnaise on there as I thought was safe.

964
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,280
But if you need more, come up and I'll give you a cup.

965
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,480
What?

966
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,960
That's the worst thing I ever heard, Jesus.

967
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,120
What possible codicil, what collary could you have put

968
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,840
on your order that would make someone so eager to please

969
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,560
vis-a-vis and so confident that they had not vis-a-vis mayonnaise?

970
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
What possible direction could they have been given?

971
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,400
It sounds to me, J-Man, like the direction was

972
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,080
give me a reckless, dangerous amount of mayonnaise.

973
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,400
Yeah.

974
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,440
And the person behind the counter was like, no, no, not again.

975
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,560
I put as much on there as I thought was safe.

976
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,280
Safe.

977
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,400
Because I thought it was safe.

978
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,000
That is what she said, safe.

979
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,560
But if you need more, come up and I'll give you a cup.

980
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,280
That's the worst part?

981
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,800
No, no, we can't jump over that part.

982
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,000
It's the worst fucking part.

983
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,120
A cup.

984
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,200
And I'll give you probably a plastic ramekin of mayonnaise.

985
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,280
This person definitely means in a church service,

986
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,200
like a Sunday church service and not physically in the building, right?

987
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,520
Because we grew up in the Baptist Church

988
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,960
and we had a fucking lot of sandwiches in that building.

989
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,320
Yeah, no, I think a lot.

990
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,400
I think they're talking about the sermon of the Lord's time.

991
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,440
Here's the key to eating a sandwich during church.

992
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,200
You got to pick your crinkle times.

993
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,120
You can't just be sitting there and in a silent moment of prayer

994
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,920
and reflection just as you open your subway $5 footlong.

995
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,160
Got to pick the moments when everybody says like,

996
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,880
amen, you can peel a corner then.

997
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,680
You know what I mean?

998
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:03,920
No.

999
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,800
It's going to be slow.

1000
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,600
Know the long hymns.

1001
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,440
Talk to the minister of music beforehand.

1002
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,240
Just say, how many verses of Amazing Grace are we busting out this set?

1003
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
Three whole verses?

1004
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,600
Shoot, yeah, bud.

1005
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,280
Catch yourself there, don't cuss.

1006
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,520
Yeah, I can definitely squeeze in a sandwich.

1007
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,600
Up from the grave he rose.

1008
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,320
That's the moment.

1009
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,280
Because people are going to be having such a big fun time with that tune

1010
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,840
that you could just hide in the back,

1011
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,920
scratch down behind a pew,

1012
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,440
treat yourself, enjoy it.

1013
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:31,920
Yeah.

1014
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,680
Don't do it during communion

1015
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,680
and they come around with crackers and you say,

1016
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,560
no, I'm good.

1017
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,040
I planned ahead.

1018
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,680
Or you take a couple of crackers

1019
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,240
and you take a little Lunchable Meat and a little Lunchable Cheese.

1020
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,200
How thoughtful.

1021
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,240
And the minister says, if you don't stop doing that,

1022
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,640
I'm going to ask you to leave religion.

1023
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,680
And you say, I'm still doing it, aren't I?

1024
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,960
It still counts.

1025
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,200
I just use it as a topping.

1026
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,960
I don't see what the problem is.

1027
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,600
My salad lacked crunch and pizzazz.

1028
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,400
It's a food hack, Mr. Pastor.

1029
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,080
So calm down, why don't you?

1030
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,200
And here's another secret that they don't tell you.

1031
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,960
You can request whatever drink you want in communion.

1032
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,160
So if you want like, you know, you want some, I don't know.

1033
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,520
Sprite mix.

1034
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,040
Yeah, you can get some Sprite in there.

1035
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,880
You can get some San Pellegrino.

1036
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,880
Welcome to Church Hacks with Travis.

1037
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,240
Yeah, well, okay.

1038
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
I guess only Travis gets the Church Hacks.

1039
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,560
Yep.

1040
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,160
Here's a Church Hack.

1041
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,040
If you go in the Kiwanis room when everybody else is in there

1042
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,680
listening to the sermon like dummies,

1043
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,920
they probably had donuts during the day

1044
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,040
and you could just sneak in there

1045
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,680
and pilfer to your little chubby hearts content.

1046
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,640
Church Hacks.

1047
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,360
I'll tell you a secret.

1048
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:47,840
Church Hacks.

1049
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,240
I'll tell you a secret place you could eat a sandwich during church

1050
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,760
and that's in the sort of prep room for the baptism.

1051
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,280
So you're gonna need to go up to the pastor

1052
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,760
pretty much every week and say, I need a-

1053
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,640
I fucked up again.

1054
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,960
I need a tuna.

1055
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,120
You know what?

1056
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,200
This time I really understand it.

1057
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah, I get it.

1058
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,560
This time I'm really, really ready to dedicate it.

1059
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,120
So I need you to juice me up.

1060
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,080
Let me in there.

1061
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,760
It's like, I love your spirit.

1062
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,200
I love your initiative.

1063
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,480
Every time after the service, I go in there, clean up.

1064
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,080
It smells like the stickiest ham.

1065
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,120
Is something happening that I don't know about.

1066
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,960
And the best part of doing it this way

1067
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,800
and doing it with a baptism every week,

1068
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,640
you don't even have to worry about cleaning the mustard

1069
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,000
and crumbs off your face.

1070
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,080
That doesn't get taken care of by the bath.

1071
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:32,560
Sure.

1072
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:37,200
Do you think that if Subway started off advertising

1073
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,240
soft paper for church, that that would be-

1074
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,200
People would think that that was like a heathen thing

1075
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,320
or they'd be so stoked that somebody was talking about church

1076
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,920
that they would just kind of roll with it

1077
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,720
and stop going to Chick-fil-A and just start going there.

1078
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,080
How do you think that would shake out?

1079
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,320
Okay, you give me an idea, Justin.

1080
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,640
A partnership between church and Subway, and we set it up

1081
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,120
like the Alamo Drafthouse where you can sit there

1082
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,240
and your peer, you just like stick a little card in a thing

1083
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
and a sandwich artist comes by, they grab it,

1084
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,920
they come back to you, they hand you a sandwich

1085
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,720
in soft paper that you can eat during church.

1086
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,560
Now, the benefit to church here is services

1087
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,960
will become three and a half hours long,

1088
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,320
but you can get a sandwich during it

1089
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,400
and also maybe forgiven or whatever.

1090
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,480
You're welcome, church, we fixed it again.

1091
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,920
I think church would be stoked

1092
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,920
about Subway's participation in this.

1093
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,240
And the thing I'm basing that on is how stoked everybody is

1094
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,080
for Dennis Quaid since he was in the I Can Only Imagine movie.

1095
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,680
And now they're like, we got a Quaid, the good one?

1096
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,880
Always liked Quaid.

1097
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,280
I've always loved Quaid's.

1098
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,520
Well, Dennis, I don't know about Randy, what is he even?

1099
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,760
Is there a third Quaid we don't know about?

1100
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,040
Hold on, let me look.

1101
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,840
Hold on, let me look.

1102
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,920
Third Quaid.

1103
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,560
Thanks everybody for listening to my brother,

1104
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,280
my brother and me.

1105
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,800
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1106
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,480
Justin, hold on, let's see if Travis finds the third Quaid.

1107
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,800
No, I'm gonna move, I'm gonna charge right ahead.

1108
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,800
We're gonna be in Phoenix, I think this is the only,

1109
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,880
well, no, we're gonna be in Phoenix, Arizona this June.

1110
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,680
All Quaids.

1111
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,600
We're doing a couple shows before that in San Francisco,

1112
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,000
but I believe those are sold out

1113
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,640
unless I am completely mistaken.

1114
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,280
I mean, Dennis Quaid has several children.

1115
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,760
That doesn't count.

1116
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,520
You cannot attend those,

1117
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,880
but you can come to see us, Phoenix, Arizona Symphony Hall.

1118
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,040
That's Saturday, June 16th.

1119
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,400
We are also gonna be in Orlando, Florida

1120
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,320
at the Walt Disney Theater on Friday, August 31st

1121
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,480
and Atlanta, Georgia at the Cobb Energy PAC,

1122
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,440
Performing Arts Center, I assume, doing my bim bam.

1123
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,520
I just found a Rick Quaid on LinkedIn.

1124
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,160
Ooh.

1125
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,320
If you're the Adventure Zone fan,

1126
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,080
we're going to be in, Travis has not updated these to say

1127
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,960
which are sold out.

1128
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,440
We're gonna be in New York, Cincinnati, Boston and San Diego.

1129
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:01,840
I think-

1130
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,320
Last I checked, Cincinnati and San Diego

1131
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,920
were the two that still had tickets.

1132
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,240
Okay, so you should come see us at those.

1133
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,280
McElroyShows.com slash Tours is the spot

1134
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,240
where you can get all those tickets.

1135
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,400
We're doing a sort of collaboration

1136
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,600
with a mysterious package company.

1137
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,280
This is also Adventure Zone themed,

1138
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,720
but it's called Tacos Correspondence School of Wizardry,

1139
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,280
Cantrips and Other Magics.

1140
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,760
If you go to bit.ly forward slash Tacoschool,

1141
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,440
T-A-A-K-O school, you can sign up for that.

1142
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,280
It's gonna be like a narrative experience

1143
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,360
that you have via the mail

1144
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,880
with a lot of cool little things

1145
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,200
and some new audio that we've recorded.

1146
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,360
There's like an audio component to it.

1147
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,280
It's gonna be really neat, but it's worth checking out.

1148
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,520
Bit.ly forward slash Tacoschool.

1149
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,000
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1150
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,960
for the use of our theme song.

1151
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,680
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1152
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,920
It is a great soundtrack for whatever you're doing.

1153
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Washing dishes, driving in the car,

1154
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,080
furiously Googling for people with the last name Quade.

1155
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,200
Whatever you want.

1156
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,440
Thank you also to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1157
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,720
You can go to MaximumFun.org

1158
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,240
and check out all the great shows there.

1159
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,520
Shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself, Lady to Lady,

1160
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,920
Switchblade Sisters, Jordan, Jesse Go,

1161
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,200
all kinds of shows there.

1162
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,480
And if you want to hear more stuff we do,

1163
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,720
it's all at McElroyShows.com.

1164
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,040
Oh, speaking of, a new special project at MaxFun called Bubble.

1165
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,160
It's a series that Jordan Morris wrote

1166
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,600
and that a bunch of people are doing some voice acting in,

1167
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,920
including these three McElroy brothers here.

1168
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,040
So that should be coming up soon,

1169
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,120
but you can find it in iTunes now

1170
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,160
and go ahead and hear one, the promo for the show,

1171
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,840
and two, go ahead and subscribe to it

1172
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,840
so you can get all the episodes.

1173
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,760
It's like a podcast sitcom if you can believe such a thing.

1174
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,480
Yeah, it's a sci-fi drama sitcom.

1175
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,360
Dramedy.

1176
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,320
Drama.

1177
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,400
They really did all the genres for this one.

1178
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,480
So that's gonna be great.

1179
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,920
And do you all want the final?

1180
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,200
Yeah.

1181
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,160
Yeah, you know I do.

1182
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,440
Final Yahoo!

1183
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,120
Sent in by Carl Vincent Boddy.

1184
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,680
Thank you, Carl.

1185
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,880
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1186
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,880
Sorry, something's going wrong.

1187
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,840
So there's a hat trick for Yahoo being a big piece of shit.

1188
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,920
Sorry, there's a banner at the top of the page

1189
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,400
that says we are undergoing maintenance for a few hours.

1190
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,960
Some features may be temporarily unavailable.

1191
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,120
What maintenance do you need to perform Yahoo

1192
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,720
on your service nobody uses?

1193
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,160
It's fine.

1194
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,880
It's fine as the way it is.

1195
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,280
It's perfect as is, as evidenced by the fact

1196
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,640
that this username doesn't show up.

1197
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,440
I'm gonna call him Carlson asks,

1198
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,000
who else right now is shirtless and chomping

1199
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,720
on a huge hunk of cheddar cheese like I am?

1200
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,560
My name is Justin McElroy.

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,840
often a bad movie, and we review it on our podcast,

1217
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,600
but mainly talk about other stuff.

1218
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,360
And I don't know, hang out.

1219
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,480
