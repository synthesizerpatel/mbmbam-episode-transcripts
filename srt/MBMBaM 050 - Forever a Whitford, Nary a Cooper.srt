1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:53,280
Another year older, but about 20 years wiser. It's my brother, my brother made 50th episode

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,920
spectacular. This is our one year anniversary of bringing you, taking your questions,

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,360
turning them alchemy-like into wisdom. I'm your host and oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,080
I am a co-host and middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

9
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm a permanent guest host and the youngest sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Hey guys,

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,960
what do we got planned for this super special episode? Because I know this is the kind of thing

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,920
that podcasts, they usually don't just let it, you know, sail by. They usually do something to

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,800
commemorate. Yeah, well, I have gotten you this special presentation. If you guys will open your

13
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,680
hands right now, you will see the gold watches that I brought you. I was wondering where that

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
came from. Yeah, that's from me. And enjoy. If you see the inscription on the back,

15
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,920
can you read it? Go ahead and read it out loud. I'm not embarrassed.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,600
Is this Sanskrit? I can't read this. No, you just turn it upside down. Oh, it says great job.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:09,440
It says, in quotes, time for laughs. And it's laughs with four Fs. That's what it says.

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
So I got those for you guys. If you guys will look outside, you'll see my

19
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,480
one year anniversary gifts. I got you both ping pong tables. Whoa, good purchase. Thank you.

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,000
And if you guys will check your mailboxes, you'll have gotten the postcards telling you that I

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,520
donated trees to Jerusalem in your names. They need trees so bad over here. They do. It's a

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,960
treeless wasteland that where Jesus was born. That's why he hates trees. Hey, let's get into

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,120
the questions. My girlfriend and I have been dating for seven months now, and we enjoy going

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,440
out to eat every once in a while. The thing is, when we order the food, she takes it upon herself

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,720
to order both her food and my food. At first it was kind of cute, but now it's really starting

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,280
to bother me. Should I say something to her about it? Or is this one of those things I need to let

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,840
go? Flustered in Florida. Wow, that's so weird. Yeah, I've never heard of that. That's not a thing

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,040
that people actually do unless they're in like a movie. What if when she ordered your food,

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:15,360
you just screamed, wrong. Close, but not right. Let's go with a steak. We were looking for

30
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,520
steak. Maybe she really knows him really well. I would actually be a big fan of this. I hate

31
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,360
deciding what to eat at a restaurant because I don't understand the big words. Like what's a

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,720
gruyere? What's a gruyere? I think he probably like picks the food. I just think that like when

33
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,880
the lady comes around, that she says like, he told me earlier that he wanted to have the steak

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,760
and gruyere. So I'm going to order that for him. Maybe or maybe like really mean and she thinks

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,680
like he's overweight and doesn't want to say anything about it. So she's like really passive

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,520
aggressive. Like he'll have a salad. Yeah, I'll have the chicken corn on blue and Tubby Tubbs

37
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,360
over there is going to have a shot of wheat grass and some disapproving looks. Somebody skipped his

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,880
morning jog so he gets a mixed green. I think that you should probably ask out of curiosity,

39
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,800
like very non nonaggressive. Hey, why do you do that? Why does that happen every time? Maybe

40
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,680
there's a good loving reason for it. What could the loving reason be? Maybe you're really bad at

41
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,520
like human interaction and she's saving you from having to make a fool of yourself in front of the

42
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,880
waiter. Like she knows you're going to make terrible jokes about how you want your steak

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,760
done or whatever. How do you want your steak cooked? On the grill. She's trying to prevent

44
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,280
that from happening. My name is Fred and I'll be your customer this evening.

45
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
Could you steak me?

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,720
The first time you guys went out, did you embarrassingly order things like

47
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,480
I'll have the hamburger because you hold the mustard and put the mayonnaise in a cup next

48
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,080
to it and stuff like that. Maybe she just doesn't want to deal with your whininess.

49
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,240
Bring me the mayonnaise in a stein if you could, please. I need a thimble full of vinaigrette.

50
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,920
If I see a pickle, I'm going to burn this restaurant down.

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,720
Sorry, Darlene. I think you should ask to find out what the reason is. If it's a good reason,

52
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,320
it's not worth it. Does it really bother you? What you should do is just completely embrace this

53
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,960
and when your lady orders for you, make eye contact with the waiter and just give a real

54
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:42,240
slow nod. Yeah, like you're inviting him into your relationship. She was correct.

55
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,400
Why don't you turn it into a contest where you tell her, listen, baby, I don't mind

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,360
if you keep ordering for me, but I'm going to order for you. If I get to the waiter first,

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,760
I'm ordering for you. It doesn't even have to be like that. You can be like,

58
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,240
who knows the other person better? She'll order something for you and she'll be like,

59
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,040
I think he would like the barbecue bacon onion burger from TGI Fridays. Then you'll be like,

60
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,800
she'll have cookies. Sir, it's seven o'clock. I know for a fact she hasn't eaten dinner yet

61
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,760
because she's at a TGI Fridays. I know what I said. She'll have the cookies, please.

62
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,720
She'll have the cookies, please. And a bowl of croutons. I get a bowl of croutons,

63
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,880
some of those cocktail swords. There's one thing I know about my girl and that she's

64
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,360
got a big race coming up and she's got to carb. Got to carb up. Croutons, please. Just carb her.

65
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,360
I don't have a feminine while. I'm not sure what happened. Please help me. How do I attain

66
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,640
some feminine while skills? I'm a girl if that helps. It does. Yes. Yeah, certainly.

67
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Forgetting feminine while. Every woman has feminine while. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,560
maybe Stella got her groove back? Just go watch that and do exactly what Angela Bassett does.

69
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,520
I don't think that it's something like, it's not like a list of things you know how to do.

70
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,760
It's not like a skill you pick up at summer camp. It's just something like,

71
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,720
that is the, that is a term that's used to describe like what women do in society.

72
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,640
I have to ask, where did you acquire that knowledge? Where did you acquire that knowledge

73
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,760
that it's not a thing that ladies learn at summer camp? Because I could totally see

74
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,120
a lady going to summer camp and then that's when she learns how to fucking work it.

75
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
Isn't that what finishing school is? Where they teach you how to fucking work it?

76
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,240
So you're saying like in middle school when they separated like the boys and girls to watch

77
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,920
different movies, the boys were off watching the Uncomfortable movie about pubic hair,

78
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,040
but the girls were totally watching movies about how to like work it?

79
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:00,000
The girls actually get a class by RuPaul who comes in and just teaches them how to work,

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,880
you know, how to find their fears, how to find their bliss and just chase it, you know?

81
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:12,080
Chase that bliss! We had to look at horrifying pictures that still haunt me to this day of

82
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,240
vivisected cocks. Like this is, if you would lathe your cock, this is what it would look like.

83
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,160
You just split it right down the middle, right down the prime meridian,

84
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,320
and then they got RuPaul teaching them how to make it work.

85
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,960
Exactly. That's bullshit.

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,320
At the end there was like a fashion show on a catwalk.

87
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,760
So maybe our, maybe our listener missed that day of school.

88
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, were you sick? Were you sick that day on Make It Work Day?

89
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,880
What was the name of that show that was on MTV that they taught the guys how to be like players

90
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,360
and it was, but it was hosted by the guy who wore like goggles and like furry top hats.

91
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,760
I think it's like the America's Next Great Pickup Artist, The Pickup Artist.

92
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,880
The Pickup Artist. Yeah. Ma'am. What fucking douche chills I got. I had a winter of douche chills.

93
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,520
How are you helping our writer?

94
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm saying that maybe you call that guy up and be like,

95
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,480
maybe he knows a thing or two about the lady game.

96
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,800
Like how to make-

97
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,560
He can never do that. He can never do it. He only knows how to work that system

98
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,160
the one way. If he tried to see it from the other side, it would turn him gay.

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,960
No, but this is like a, if like a, you hire a bank robber to do your vault security.

100
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
Oh shit.

101
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,960
I'm saying it was all about how to, how to pick it up.

102
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,520
It is so much easier for girls though, right? Like guys takes,

103
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,240
it takes whole reality shows to teach them how to work their, you know, how to work their something.

104
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
Girls, like, didn't we establish like just flash a boob, right? Like you just-

105
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
Well, don't do that.

106
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,960
Don't do that.

107
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,480
But you could.

108
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,520
I think with guys, it's like, it's like teaching them an elephant how to paint. Like you can do it.

109
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,080
It just takes a lot of work, a lot of commitment from the elephant.

110
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,400
Ladies are like, like mad sexy. They're like super sexy. All of them, 100%.

111
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,080
Guys, we don't have like, unless I'd blast my core, like Bradley Cooper style,

112
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,760
unless me and Coop hit up the gym and do some yoga lattes and blast our pecs and cores,

113
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,640
just wail on them.

114
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
Or even Bradley Whitford style.

115
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,200
See, that's my jam.

116
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
I would take a Bradley Whitford core at this point.

117
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,160
Forever a Whitford, Mariah Cooper.

118
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,880
You monsters.

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,840
So find RuPaul, pay top dollar. It's your fault you should have been absent that day.

120
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,680
Covergirl, turn to the left.

121
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,320
Griffin, hit me.

122
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,840
All things, all things just keep getting better, you guys.

123
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,480
Yeah.

124
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
On this, our 50th episode.

125
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,840
I have so many good ones. How about-

126
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,400
Oh, this is good. This is an appropriate segue.

127
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,720
This one was sent in by Cosmodoodlecat. Thank you.

128
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
Okay.

129
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bay Harbor Butcher.

130
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh, good.

131
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,840
Who asks, who asks terrifyingly,

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,040
I am thinking about doing this to 25 women this upcoming week.

133
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,840
What?

134
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,800
This can't end well for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

135
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
I am trying to build my confidence so that I can start meeting women

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
when I'm out and about like a store, for example.

137
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,640
I usually find myself talking slash flirting with women when I'm out,

138
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
but never know if I'm taking their kindness the wrong way.

139
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,320
So I always end up just leaving without a number slash email.

140
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,360
So this is my plan.

141
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,400
I'm going to walk up to 25 women and say,

142
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,440
hi, I just wanted to tell you that I think you're beautiful.

143
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Have a great day and walk away.

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,240
How would you feel if some random guy did that to you?

145
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,720
Additional details.

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
Additional details.

147
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm okay looking, not a supermodel.

148
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
Listen, hey, there's so many fallacies,

149
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,520
so many riddled with plot holes, the question is.

150
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,160
Let's start from the beginning,

151
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,520
from the opening, some of the nomenclature misstep that you've made here.

152
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,400
Bay Harbor Butcher?

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Like that's your line?

154
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,280
That's your handle?

155
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,000
It's your tag?

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
It's this great face.

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you mind if I take it?

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm planning on doing this to 25 women.

159
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,800
I'm going to chop them up and hide them around the city.

160
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,760
Can you catch me?

161
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,480
I don't think you can.

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,560
Can I add you to Facebook?

163
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,440
By which I mean the book that I'm making out of faces.

164
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm confused by his premise.

165
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,080
His premise is that he often talks slash flirts with these women

166
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,840
and leaves without getting a phone number.

167
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,720
So his plan of attack is to leave without getting a phone number.

168
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
Like what I'm going to try to do is make a conscious choice

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
not to have any connection.

170
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
You know when your dad catches you smoking,

171
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,640
it makes you smoke a carton.

172
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,920
He's trying to like burn himself out on failing.

173
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,920
I'm not closing the deal.

174
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,200
Just take a dip in the failure pond.

175
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,320
What are you doing, dude?

176
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,240
It's like-

177
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,800
Sweet face.

178
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,680
Dip.

179
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,560
Gotta go.

180
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,960
It's like Alec Baldwin said in that movie,

181
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,600
A, always B, B, D, dipping.

182
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,560
Always B, dipping.

183
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,000
Dip.

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,880
I'm out.

185
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,480
See, I would take it one step further and just at a full run

186
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
pass by these women and just go,

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
you're really pretty.

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,480
Good face.

189
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,600
You're gone and you're out.

190
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
Doppler dating is what we call it.

191
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,080
We used to do that in our hometown of Huntington.

192
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,680
I remember Justin introduced me to that game

193
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,720
where we would drive around and yell things at people

194
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,600
as we drove by and I had to stop playing that game.

195
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,880
We would always nice things like,

196
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,560
hey, cute face or hey, like you're jorts.

197
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
But we had to stop playing that game or at least I did

198
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,880
because there's nothing more infuriating

199
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,720
than when people yell shit at you.

200
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,040
Yeah, because you never assume it's nice

201
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,000
and you can't make it out.

202
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,600
You almost never can make it out and there's no recourse.

203
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
There's nothing you can't be like,

204
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,160
yeah, well fuck you too.

205
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, you're gone.

206
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
You already left.

207
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,760
You're like in a car.

208
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
You're like super far away.

209
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,680
I think that everybody should just say nice things

210
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,040
to everybody all the time.

211
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,960
I think you can end your compliment

212
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,040
as long as you say like, sorry, I'm a creep.

213
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,320
Yeah.

214
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
Sorry, I'm a creep-o.

215
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,680
Well, that's actually something I've always wondered.

216
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,560
Like when you see a girl with like a really nice haircut

217
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,880
or something, but if you preface by saying,

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm not trying to be creepy, but you just made your hair,

219
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,080
you just made your compliment so creepy.

220
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,520
There needs to be a word for like a precursor

221
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,880
that actually defines what you're about to say to somebody.

222
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,640
Like a non-creepy, no homo.

223
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,000
Like if you're like no creep and you said something.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Like yeah, but one that doesn't make you sound like a douche.

225
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,080
Like a douche.

226
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,760
Like just creep warning to say.

227
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Creep alert.

228
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,120
Creep alert.

229
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,160
I'm about to creep you out.

230
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
Yeah, that would be good.

231
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,840
But there's gotta be something about it.

232
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,440
Creep wise.

233
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,480
Creep wise.

234
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
No creeping.

235
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,480
The problem with being a creep is that like drawing attention

236
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,440
to what is creep.

237
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,640
Just makes it even creepier.

238
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
There's nothing you can do to uncreep something.

239
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,720
Like once it's been creeped, it's like the taint.

240
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,200
You know what I mean?

241
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,160
It's like that virus that's killing all those bats in Ohio.

242
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
Like once it's there, you can't get it off your nose.

243
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,400
It's just gonna ruin the population.

244
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,000
Because the more you try to justify it,

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
the more creepy it becomes.

246
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Exactly.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,720
No, but I didn't.

248
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
But I was just creepy.

249
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
Do you know the only thing you can do is make it fucking work.

250
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
Just make it do work for you.

251
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,760
It's hard to do.

252
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
I've never done it.

253
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,160
Do as we say and honestly do here.

254
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,040
If you crack this Da Vinci code, you let me know.

255
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,560
Because I would love that.

256
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,960
I'm filled with boundless love.

257
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,720
And I would love to just come up to people on the street

258
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,880
and be like, hey, you are just super attractive.

259
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
Everything you're doing, yes, yes, and yes.

260
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Do you know how to make that work?

261
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
How do you make it work?

262
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
You'd be Bradley Cooper.

263
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,000
You'd be super attractive.

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Fuck me.

265
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,640
Hugely, hugely attractive.

266
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,480
I was going down the list of features.

267
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
I checked Whitford.

268
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,560
I didn't check Cooper.

269
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,760
Yeah, you gotta be careful.

270
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,920
And number one, step one, don't refer to yourself

271
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
as the Bay Harbor butcher.

272
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,960
Like I don't think I can emphasize this enough.

273
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,280
Hey, I'm from California and I recently enrolled in college.

274
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,080
On the East Coast.

275
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,760
I'm a big basketball fan.

276
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,520
And by that, I mean baseball.

277
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,160
Sorry.

278
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm a big baseball fan, specifically a Giants fan.

279
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,640
And sorry, are you a big fan or a Giant?

280
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,840
I recently had the pleasure of watching my team thrash

281
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,560
my friend's team, the Paleys, in the North League Championships.

282
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
I put this question in as a test.

283
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,480
In the mountains of the North.

284
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,440
Where we beat clan stock, the team of the North.

285
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,520
Sadly, he is an uber sore loser to the point

286
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
where shit talking is no fun.

287
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,720
Now, when I talk shit, he just admits his team's failure

288
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
and overall inferiority.

289
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,600
This just makes me feel like an asshole.

290
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,680
How can I talk shit and not feel like an asshole?

291
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
What are you desperately seeing solutions?

292
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,680
Like, what are you saying?

293
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,080
How can I be a dick and not be a dick?

294
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,560
Like, have you, wait, first of all, what?

295
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,840
Okay.

296
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,720
Do you not understand what an uber sore loser is?

297
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,680
If you're like, your team lost and he's like, yeah, they did.

298
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,520
That seems like a pretty good loser to me.

299
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
I completely accept my team's failure.

300
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,080
Oh, okay.

301
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,520
No, he's like taking it so personally that he can't rip him.

302
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
And what's that guy's deal?

303
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,640
Like, hey, the Phillies suck.

304
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,140
I know.

305
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,120
I suck too.

306
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,080
Everything sucks.

307
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm just a little bitch.

308
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,280
I can't do anything right.

309
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,640
You're stupid, Darren.

310
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
This is exactly why Susan left me.

311
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
This is why Susan left you.

312
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,120
It's because of the Phillies.

313
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,240
It sucks.

314
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,200
Come back, John Krunk.

315
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,040
Your friend needs to get some pride.

316
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
I think you need, your operation needs to change.

317
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,160
You need to change from a how do I be a jerk

318
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
and get away with the operation to a let's build Darren up.

319
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
Like, you gotta, if you care about Darren,

320
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
and I know you do, you gotta start building up that confidence

321
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,040
in both him and the Phillies.

322
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,680
They don't need any help building confidence in the Phillies.

323
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
The Phillies, I don't know if you guys know this.

324
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
I know you guys aren't big baseball men.

325
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
The Phillies, half robot, half of their league,

326
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,720
half of their bench is robotic.

327
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,400
Okay, so not like cyborgs, like half of them are 100% human.

328
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,040
Okay, there's some mixies in there.

329
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,640
There's some half and halves.

330
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,000
Half robot, half human.

331
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Roy Halladay, 100% robot.

332
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
He's actually a pitching machine,

333
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
like one of those things that you see at batting cages,

334
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
only they had a wizard cast a spell on him

335
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
to make him look like a human being.

336
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
It seems like there should be rules against that.

337
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,480
There are rules against that.

338
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,600
Phillies are cheaters.

339
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
They live in a cheat city full of cheaters.

340
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,440
Fuck the Phillies.

341
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,240
So why is it that this guy is so down on his team?

342
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Probably because he hates robots.

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
He knows that that's the future.

344
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,440
The future is all 100% robotic.

345
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,920
Oh, shit.

346
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,600
He feels bad that he feels like a traitor to flesh men.

347
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,360
Is that what you're talking about?

348
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,560
Because he's a flesh traitor.

349
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,280
He's a flesh traitor.

350
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,480
He's a flesh traitor.

351
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
Everybody should have been rooting for the Giants in that.

352
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
Brian Wilson, the real American hero.

353
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,720
He's not robot at all.

354
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,880
I hope that our fans who also know anything about sports

355
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,320
have enjoyed these past three minutes

356
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,440
because that's all you're getting.

357
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
We waited a year to give you this much

358
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,040
and you've got to wait another year

359
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,000
for three minutes of sports related riffing.

360
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,440
I almost never want to ostracize

361
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,560
entire just swathes of fans of our show.

362
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,160
Like, I love everybody.

363
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
But if you're a Phillies fan, you can go fuck off.

364
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,280
Okay, good.

365
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,560
Go find a different podcast.

366
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,680
This one's not for you.

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,000
Cool.

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,640
Okay.

369
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,000
I disagree with that.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,720
In fact-

371
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
Robo-lover.

372
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,160
Can I ask one of the two internal advice questions

373
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,600
that I have for the show?

374
00:19:59,600 --> 00:19:59,840
Yeah.

375
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,120
So this year, you know,

376
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,600
this is my second year living in Cincinnati

377
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,840
and I've decided to become a Reds fan.

378
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah, you did.

379
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,000
People have been giving me shit about that.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
I'm like, you can't just become a fan.

381
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,040
Like, oh, you become-

382
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,840
Why not?

383
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,640
You absolutely can.

384
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,520
Yeah.

385
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,480
It's like, I live here.

386
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm going to follow it.

387
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
It's not like I'm like rabid about it.

388
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm not going to like go around and be like,

389
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
woo, Reds are the best.

390
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
I don't know anything about baseball, but-

391
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,880
Scraps, I think the problem you have is telling people,

392
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
hey, I'm about to become a Reds fan.

393
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,560
Coming up in a couple of weeks,

394
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,480
I think I'm going to become a Reds fan.

395
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,320
So look for that.

396
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,280
Look out for that.

397
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,640
It takes you a whole season of watching a ball organization

398
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,120
to like really grok what their style is,

399
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
to really grok their style.

400
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,240
And after that, you can be like, I'm a fan.

401
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
Like, I didn't give a shit about football

402
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,200
until I moved in with a huge Packers fan this year.

403
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
And so I started watching the Packers

404
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
and then they won the Super Bowl.

405
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,360
And now I'm a Packers fan,

406
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,960
which makes me look like a shithead.

407
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,360
Like-

408
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,840
Yeah.

409
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
But you had already picked your horse.

410
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,400
I had already picked my horse.

411
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
I had no idea what they were about.

412
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
Dude, the same thing happened to me with the Red Sox

413
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,000
with the first year that they won the World Series.

414
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
I lived that summer with a really huge Red Sox fan.

415
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
And then I was like, okay, now I like the Red Sox.

416
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:09,840
And then-

417
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,640
How are we-

418
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,920
Everybody gave me shit.

419
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,360
How are we not the most, like,

420
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,280
the richest sports gamblers in the world?

421
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,520
Yeah.

422
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
Well, because I mostly just bet on golf.

423
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,480
You're just a, you vote on McElroy.

424
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,440
He's crushing it.

425
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,320
He is crushing it.

426
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,760
He's like 11 under.

427
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,560
11 under on the 13th.

428
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,680
Okay, that's all I can,

429
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,560
I literally can't talk about sports anymore.

430
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,840
And he's only 21.

431
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm dying.

432
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,160
This is killing me.

433
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,480
I was recently involved in a retail rage incident

434
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
over a parking space.

435
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
As it came to a head, it became very clear

436
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
this man wanted to punch me.

437
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,160
He didn't.

438
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
But that didn't stop me from thinking

439
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,320
about what I would do if he did.

440
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
My first thought was to instantly kick him in the balls.

441
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,960
But what do I do after that?

442
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
Borderline beaten up in Baltimore.

443
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,760
Good one.

444
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,560
In Baltimore?

445
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
See, they have a stellar baseball team.

446
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,440
I swear to God.

447
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,080
I swear to God.

448
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,280
It'll be my brother and me.

449
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,560
I just want to see it by Nickelodeon.

450
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,600
I want to take a second.

451
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:01,840
Okay.

452
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,640
I want to apologize to people who live in Philadelphia.

453
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:04,960
Okay.

454
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,840
A little over the line.

455
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,720
They're backpedaling now.

456
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
Your baseball team is all chips and wires.

457
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,080
And you know it.

458
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,280
Um, a ball kick is a pretty good-

459
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
I don't think that's a good opening salvo.

460
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Ball kick, the problem is you got 30 seconds

461
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
where this guy could just wail on you

462
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
before that catches up with him.

463
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,360
Well, but also you gotta-

464
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,080
Wait, hold on, hold on.

465
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,320
Stop.

466
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

467
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,160
30 seconds?

468
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,560
That's how long it takes for pain signals

469
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,080
to get from your balls to your brain?

470
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,440
There's a- it's a delayed response.

471
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
Have you not experienced this?

472
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,720
A ball kick doesn't take-

473
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
For me, it's like, it's like preeminent.

474
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
Like, I see the foot coming towards my balls

475
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
and I- I have phantom pains already.

476
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,080
Like, I-

477
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,800
There's a delay.

478
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,000
There's a definite delay there.

479
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
There are 30 seconds.

480
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
How slow are your- your balls wires?

481
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,320
What?

482
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,560
My balls wires are so fat.

483
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,440
Like, they're straight gold-plated wires

484
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,560
that goes straight to my brain.

485
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,120
Like nickel-cabbage.

486
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,240
Oh, you got it.

487
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,440
HDMI ball wires.

488
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
I'm working with a T1 connection on my balls wires.

489
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,040
I got a- my balls just got prodigy this year,

490
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,560
so they're taking a long time.

491
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,440
It's like 24 balls down there.

492
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
Here's the thing to think about.

493
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
It- you got to tell this story later.

494
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,240
Do you want to be the dude who leaves off the story with,

495
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,600
I kicked him in the balls.

496
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,040
I kicked him in the nutsack.

497
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,920
How often are you going to get to punch somebody

498
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,880
full off in the face?

499
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,040
I think that opportunity would be so rare.

500
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,080
You should just grab it.

501
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,960
I have never done it.

502
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,880
I don't think I've never-

503
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
I've never punched a-

504
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,680
I mean, we played lockjaw before, but I've never-

505
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,080
Yeah.

506
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,480
I've never-

507
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,600
Not like an anger.

508
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,400
Not like an anger.

509
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
You just punch somebody for fun, but I've never-

510
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
Straight up though, you will break your hand.

511
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:34,880
Like-

512
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,200
You think?

513
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,320
The human skull is, unless you get them like right on the cheek,

514
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
the human skull is basically like,

515
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,160
you know, an eighth inch of skin and then all bone.

516
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,760
You will break your hand.

517
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,120
Why not try to make a friend?

518
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,520
Why not just give him a hug and say,

519
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,080
listen, we're about to fight in this imaginary scenario I concocted,

520
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,320
but like, what if we get our next question is from a guy who says,

521
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,040
hey, I got into an argument with this guy and I almost beat him up,

522
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,120
but then I didn't, and I feel like the bigger man.

523
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,080
I hope he wasn't thinking about kicking me in the balls.

524
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,640
Yeah.

525
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm getting married in June to his sister.

526
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,360
He's my best man.

527
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
I love him very much.

528
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
I love him very much.

529
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,360
Don't tell his sister.

530
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,320
We are in love over a parking space.

531
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,960
We fell in love because we hated each other so much over the parking space.

532
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
I say if you're committed to fighting the guy-

533
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,320
Samurai sword.

534
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,200
Samurai sword.

535
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,920
Act crazy.

536
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
Hit him with the flat edge of a samurai sword.

537
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,640
Don't cut him.

538
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
We would never endorse that.

539
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,120
Oh, start by just hitting him with the scabbard,

540
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,000
just like whack him once in the face, just to taunt him and be like,

541
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
that could have been the blade.

542
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,840
Walk away.

543
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,480
Walk away.

544
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,440
I have a sword on my hip, I guess, at all times.

545
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm the kind of guy that rolls around with a sword tied to his waist.

546
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,840
Walk away, bro.

547
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
You know, you never hear-

548
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,440
When you hear somebody in the ER,

549
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
if you hear them in the ER and they get stabbed with a sword,

550
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,560
it's always a samurai sword.

551
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,040
You never hear like, he got stabbed with a midi.

552
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,760
No, it was pretty much a guy walking around with a katana,

553
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,480
and he just had it.

554
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
And if you see a guy like that, just walk away,

555
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,240
because he probably will-

556
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,320
Yeah, I would say they're towing on.

557
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,240
The katana is the official sword of crazy people.

558
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,960
Right, yeah.

559
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,320
I've never gotten in a fight before,

560
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,440
and I don't know if you guys have this fear that

561
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,720
the first time I get in a fight, I'll kill the man.

562
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,600
Sure.

563
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,280
Oh yeah, we've talked about this.

564
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,000
My giant ham fist will kill a dude.

565
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,960
I don't want to kill him.

566
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,040
Everybody who hasn't been in a fight assumes that

567
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,680
were they in a fight, or every man, I guess,

568
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,200
I would limit this.

569
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,560
I don't know if ladies think this way.

570
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,360
I hope not.

571
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,560
It's kind of terrifying.

572
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,480
Every guy who hasn't been in a fight thinks that

573
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,680
were they in a fight, they would be a lethal fight.

574
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,160
They would be-

575
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,680
Okay, I'm not even tapping into something deep.

576
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,000
Suddenly, the spirit would overtake them.

577
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,560
Something in them would flip.

578
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:01,360
I don't think that I'll launch a fury of punches at a person

579
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
that had such tremendous strength that it would kill him,

580
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,200
but what if my meager upper body strength,

581
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
what if I unleash that on somebody,

582
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
just my normal upper body strength,

583
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,240
but I hit them in just the right place,

584
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,600
and their heart explodes.

585
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,080
Whoa.

586
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,440
That can happen all the time.

587
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,800
What if I punch them in the brain,

588
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,080
and their brain stops working?

589
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,600
Or what if you punch them in the wrong place

590
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,880
and give them a boner?

591
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,680
What if you punch them and it makes you fully erect?

592
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,120
You have to live with that.

593
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
There's only one thing that gets me going.

594
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,880
I've been desensitized to everything else.

595
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,000
I have to punch a man in the face to reach full erection.

596
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,120
Griffin, you were moving up the ranks of the UFC very quickly.

597
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,680
What happened?

598
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,720
My career was cut tragically short

599
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
because I couldn't punch a man without getting a boner,

600
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,800
and they found it hard to get sponsorships after that.

601
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,640
That kept happening.

602
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Rockstar Energy Drink pulled their endorsement

603
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,800
because they didn't like my fight boner.

604
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,720
Yeah, but Rockstar Iggy Pop left in there and wrote me a check.

605
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,000
He said he liked what I was doing.

606
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,040
He said it was kind of nuts.

607
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

608
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,160
Yeah, sure.

609
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
This one was sent in by Kelly.

610
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,920
Thanks, Kelly.

611
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Clarissa, who asks,

612
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,640
has anyone found any Jersey Shore fan fictions?

613
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,720
I have already looked on miba.com and fanfiction.net,

614
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,120
so is there any other sites or ideas on where to look?

615
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,360
I mean, those are the two.

616
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,880
Those are the main ones that I go to.

617
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,160
Here's the good news.

618
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,640
They're real people.

619
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
You can make fan fat.

620
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,320
You just go meet them and make it happen.

621
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,240
It's a good thing that I had a little bit of free time

622
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,120
before this episode because let me tell you, Clarissa,

623
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,080
there is indeed Jersey Shore fan fiction.

624
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
Fuck, get out of my way, bitch.

625
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,720
I yelled out my window at the ghetto ass hooptie

626
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,640
that was trying to cut me off.

627
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
I pulled my head back into the car

628
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,920
before taking a sip of my Red Bull.

629
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,320
I don't need any distractions or traffic.

630
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,080
I need to get to the Jersey Shore.

631
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,880
I had just drove into Seaside Heights

632
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,600
and I finally realized that people can't drive.

633
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
Honk, move.

634
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,920
Hey guys, my name is Rosalina Lee.

635
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,440
I'm 23 and I'm ready to party it up in the Jersey Shore.

636
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm 50% Chinese, 50% Italian,

637
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,360
and 100% Guidette chick from New York City.

638
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,720
My name is Chi Chi for my Chinese heritage.

639
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,440
Every guy loves me, every girl's a hater.

640
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
I'm 5'3, hazel eyes, brunette, so sexy, isn't it?

641
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,400
How long is that story, Griffin?

642
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,680
That's like mad sexy.

643
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,360
That is so sexy, Chi Chi.

644
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,200
I mean, it's pretty good.

645
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
It's a pretty good length.

646
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,760
I'll just do a quick summary.

647
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
Yeah, does it get dirty?

648
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,600
Does it get-

649
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,440
She lights up with Nicole Snooki-Palazzi at one point.

650
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,920
They just fucking hit the town, tear it up.

651
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,720
Who's that?

652
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,680
It's Vinny.

653
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,800
Vinny's in the mix now.

654
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,080
Vinny, this is my girl, Chi Chi.

655
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,840
They're drinking.

656
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,680
Oh, Pauly's there.

657
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,600
He's DJing a hot set with an Italian dinner fam.

658
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,720
At an Italian family dinner party.

659
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,440
Whoa, they're at an Italian family dinner party with Chi Chi that Pauly's DJing?

660
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,120
Pauly is flipping on the ones and twos.

661
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,920
Vinny's in the mix.

662
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,760
What's that?

663
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,240
Who's that girl?

664
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,960
I've never seen the show, but I have to assume you're talking about Pauly Shore.

665
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,320
Yes, Pauly Shore is there.

666
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,200
It's a shame the situation couldn't make it out for this, did it?

667
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,040
Yeah, situation doesn't make an appearance, I'm sorry.

668
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,480
Yeah, okay, good, thank you.

669
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
What's the art?

670
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,160
What's the plot?

671
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,400
They go to this party.

672
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
They start finding codes in all of Da Vinci's paintings.

673
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,120
We gotta steal the Declaration of Independence, and then we gotta work out on it.

674
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,620
What?

675
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,440
That doesn't even make sense.

676
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,280
There's some really sweet flexes for your trikes and your dykes on the back of it.

677
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,240
You gotta check them out.

678
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,640
Really flex it out.

679
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,600
Check my trikes.

680
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,280
Check my trikes and my dykes out.

681
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,960
I learned from the back of the Declaration of Independence that you gotta get caught.

682
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,840
Gotta get diamond.

683
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,520
Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln was the original of the situation?

684
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,120
Was he?

685
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,800
That's the truth.

686
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,280
That's how he'd summon the strength to end slavery.

687
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,080
It's because, do you know what his Jersey Shore name was?

688
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,560
Tell me.

689
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,440
The Emancipator.

690
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
The Emancipation.

691
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
The Great Emancipator.

692
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,760
What up?

693
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,480
Who's in the club?

694
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,720
It's the Great Emancipator.

695
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,800
Did you guys know that people, once you enter Jersey Shore, you get a new moniker?

696
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,440
Really?

697
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
Your name legally changes.

698
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,640
Well, you have to apply for it, and it usually takes like six to eight weeks before you get

699
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:52,880
it back.

700
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,320
There's a lot of bureaucracy involved.

701
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,120
You gotta go to shitty Ellis Island and change your name to something terrible.

702
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,160
What would your guys' Jersey Shore names be, do you think?

703
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,780
Me?

704
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,660
Mm-hmm.

705
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,460
Well, both of you.

706
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,380
The two people I'm talking to on this podcast.

707
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:13,220
I would get Perm, and people would call me the Ex-Perminator, but I would be, like,

708
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,100
uncomfortable about it because the word sperm is right in there.

709
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:25,140
It leaves the door open for some really just baseline low-hanging fruit ridicule that I

710
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,900
think I would probably regret the name pretty quickly.

711
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,500
Travis?

712
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,420
Travis, I would probably get a really strong fake tan and want to be called Orange Julius.

713
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,820
What about Philippe?

714
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,380
How many Philippes are running up in there?

715
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,940
See, that's the thing.

716
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,380
That's what I don't understand about Jersey Shore names is that they can flip from

717
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:53,300
the situation or Mr. Hardbody, like something completely out of this world crazy.

718
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:59,060
Is there not one goddamn sane person in New Jersey that goes, listen, you can't name

719
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,420
yourself the something.

720
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,100
Like, that is not something you can do.

721
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,140
You can't call yourself the situation.

722
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,980
Unless you're in the XFL, you can't just name yourself anything.

723
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,220
Right.

724
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
Unless you are a group of people.

725
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,260
If you are a group of people living inside one body, if you are Legion, then you become

726
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,220
the situation.

727
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,820
Look at that.

728
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,380
I have a situation over here.

729
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,220
My body is possessed by a squadron of demons.

730
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,300
But like changing your name, isn't changing your name sort of like saying you're going

731
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,980
to become a fan of this team?

732
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,860
Like, you've got to just do it and commit to it and then let people die.

733
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,660
You say, I'm now the situation.

734
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,940
Like, what I'm saying is if I walk into the club and say, hi, my name is Dr.

735
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,740
Frankenstein and let's crank it up, then the only people who are going to take me seriously

736
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,100
are people who are meeting me for the first time that evening and maybe not even them.

737
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,100
Definitely not even them.

738
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,140
Especially not them.

739
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,140
See, I think we've got to go the other route, which is if you move to Jersey Shore, you

740
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,180
can also change your name to something completely reasonable.

741
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,460
To something just like another name.

742
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,180
Like a different name that another person might have.

743
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,700
Like, oh, in Chicago, I'm Griffin, but once I get to Jersey Shore, I'm Antoine.

744
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,260
Right.

745
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,540
I would like my Jersey Shore name to be a situation.

746
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,580
You don't want it to be definitive.

747
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,940
No, I am one of any number of situations.

748
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,980
Hey, guys, when I get done selling myself at the Jersey Shore, you know where I like

749
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,180
to take a trip to?

750
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,980
Where to?

751
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,540
The money zone.

752
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:53,940
Man, you just took it right there.

753
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,140
Yeah, I was leaving.

754
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,020
I thought, don't you put like a liner there or something?

755
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,060
Some sort of music there.

756
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,940
I left the gap.

757
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,180
Who's taking us, sweet Griffin?

758
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,980
Uh, we have two people.

759
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Two different distinct people and organizations taking us to the money zone.

760
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,060
The first one is Dawson's puberty cream.

761
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,460
Dawson's puberty cream.

762
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,340
Rub it on your parts.

763
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,020
Rub it on your throat.

764
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,540
It's not gonna crack anymore.

765
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,020
Dawson's for when it absolutely has to be hairy.

766
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,300
Is that echinacea?

767
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Oh, that's delightful scent.

768
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,140
Bob Ball.

769
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,420
What?

770
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,100
Bob Ball.

771
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,740
What about him?

772
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,300
He's a professional.

773
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,620
I mean, he's your friend and mine, but.

774
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,780
He's a professional voiceover artist.

775
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,220
And people say, what is that?

776
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,260
Like, I don't know what that is.

777
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,140
You don't know what that is.

778
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,500
I'm an idiot baby child.

779
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,940
You're a fool.

780
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,740
Let me tell you.

781
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,740
It's when you talk, but you don't see the person.

782
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,700
That's a voice actor.

783
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,380
We haven't talked about it in a while, but like, if you listen to the show and at the

784
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,980
beginning of the show, you're like, who is reading that smooth, velvety warning at the

785
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,860
beginning of the show?

786
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,380
I always thought it was, I always thought it was the dragon from Dragonheart.

787
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,500
Did you?

788
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,860
Yeah.

789
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,340
Like not the, not Sean Connery, but the actual dragon.

790
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,980
The actual dragon whose voice they had to dub over.

791
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,300
Yeah.

792
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,740
Like Natalie Wood in West Side Story.

793
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,100
This dragon's super loud.

794
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,940
You keep it down, dragon.

795
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,420
We're just gonna replace you with Sean Connery.

796
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,140
That's it.

797
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,740
You would get a Bob Ball.

798
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,380
He does that.

799
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,660
He does voiceover dragon work, commercials, podcast intros, voicemails, whatever.

800
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,340
He'll do anything for you.

801
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,900
And he has a range, he says, from condamining to condescending, explanatory to exclamatory,

802
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,180
which that should probably be on his business cards.

803
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,140
On his everything.

804
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,620
He should tattoo that on himself, on his body.

805
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,340
Yeah, he can write.

806
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,220
He does sound effects.

807
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,700
He edited a video for us over at Joystick that was dynamite.

808
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,980
It was a lot of fun.

809
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,820
And his rates are reasonable.

810
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:56,420
And if you want to get a hold of him, it's Bob at BobBallVO.com.

811
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,020
And you can check out the website, BobBallVO.com.

812
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,140
And he's revamping that website.

813
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,180
So make sure you check it out.

814
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,380
Lots of interactivity.

815
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,900
Some games for the kids.

816
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,860
Go to the kids corner.

817
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,300
We'll send your kids to sleep.

818
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,500
Something for everybody.

819
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:15,460
And as a special, special edition, this week on Thursday, April 14th, his wonderful wife,

820
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,740
Michelle, it's her birthday and she will be turning 21 again.

821
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,100
So happy birthday, Michelle.

822
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,180
Now, also, this is a bi-lane.

823
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,660
There's a bi-lane we're taking also to the money zone.

824
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,260
Also, metagame theory.

825
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,940
Or as Travis here has written, meet game theory.

826
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,700
Theory.

827
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,860
You know, theory, theory.

828
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:45,140
Justin, do you know how hard it is to write an email when you're drunk at eight in the morning?

829
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,740
I do want you guys to know that traditionally,

830
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,700
how I build the question list is just mostly all just copy and pasting.

831
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,780
And I actually had to type that one in.

832
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,980
It was the one thing in this entire list I hand typed and I blew it.

833
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,140
metagame theory.com.

834
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,580
That's a podcast that explores the unique ability all games have to stimulate the mind.

835
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,180
Not just your thumbs.

836
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,540
See, I usually just feel it in my thumbs.

837
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,220
Is it because I don't listen to this podcast?

838
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,660
I don't know how to open myself.

839
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,900
You need to open your heart to the metagame theory.

840
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,300
I want to know how the games I play affect me psychologically, psychosomatically.

841
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,060
Okay, well, listen, if you want that, metagame theory is that for you.

842
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,500
But it's also a gaming channel.

843
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,260
It brings you strategy talk.

844
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,700
They got rants.

845
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:42,420
They got special guests, old friends, and theories that connect them all in the Medicaid.

846
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,300
This is a show.

847
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,980
This is the matrix of podcasts is the best way to describe it.

848
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,380
If you would be the one, you can find the show at metagame theory.com.

849
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
How much is it gonna cost me, Ditto?

850
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,660
$108 an episode.

851
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,860
Whoa, whoa.

852
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,540
Yeah, listen, that's pricey, but you got to think of everything you're getting for that.

853
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,300
You're getting competitive rants.

854
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,140
You're getting old friends.

855
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,660
Maybe get some new friends.

856
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,140
You're gonna learn things about games that you didn't know about.

857
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,300
Tetris is a brainwashing machine invented by the Russians.

858
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,180
Whoa, really?

859
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,540
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,380
They ended the Cold War with Tetris.

861
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,620
And you learned this at metagame theory.com?

862
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,340
Mm-hmm.

863
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,020
Well, not that, because it's a lie.

864
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
It's total phony baloney bullshit I just made up.

865
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,460
It just from whole class.

866
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,300
Actually, the show is entirely free, incredibly free.

867
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, the $108 thing, that was totally fallacious.

868
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,900
You're just like a lot of flim-flam from you today, I feel like.

869
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,820
Yeah, I'm a flamster.

870
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,300
This is true, though.

871
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,380
The first three people who go subscribe to the RSS feed on the site and then send an

872
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,660
email mentioning this ad are gonna get a free t-shirt.

873
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,300
Go.

874
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,340
Whoa.

875
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:52,740
Go rush.

876
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,620
Gird your stupid loins.

877
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,940
Go gird your stupid.

878
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,660
Why would you gird your loins with a t-shirt, Griffin?

879
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,020
I mean, it's diaper.

880
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,340
If it was free, I figured fuck it, right?

881
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,900
I made a diaper out of this metagame theory.com t-shirt.

882
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,340
But listen to that show, and maybe, oh, what if these two forces could get together?

883
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:16,260
What if Bob Ball could do voiceover for Metagame Theory, or as Travis has written here, meet

884
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,380
game theory?

885
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,740
That's the old tongue.

886
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,380
In the old tongue.

887
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,340
You've actually written Rob Tall here, too, which is weird, because that's not his name.

888
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,460
I'm Rob Tall.

889
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,900
I'm a voiceover fardist.

890
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,700
A voiceover fardist?

891
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,820
Yes, that's what I said.

892
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,540
And if you go to, maybe if the two of them go together, you'll hear a song that the two

893
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:53,220
of them will make, a jingle, if you will, that might sound a little something like this.

894
00:39:53,220 --> 00:40:08,100
Gotta pop those nooks first.

895
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,100
His name is Bob, that's short for Robert.

896
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,020
His brother's name is Rob, that's also short for Robert.

897
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:27,620
One acts with voices, the other facts with voices, and they love each other very, very,

898
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,140
very, very, very much.

899
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:39,300
He's got the voice of a dragon, he's got the eyes of a marmot, he's got the soul of a man,

900
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:49,700
and the body of a man, but he's playing mind games, he's playing mind games, like the kind

901
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,460
of mind games you find at Metagame Theory.

902
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:01,060
I said the kind of the mind that you find at Metagame Theory.

903
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,780
Did I mention voice of the dragon yet?

904
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,380
Yeah, I think you got that.

905
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,100
Can you say something about the free t-shirt?

906
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,220
Can you work that in?

907
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,700
Yeah, okay.

908
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,380
Robert, Robert, what you wearing?

909
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:22,660
Robert, what you got on there, underneath that suit and tie, right against your chest.

910
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,820
Don't play it so close to the chest, gotta know what your t-shirt say.

911
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,060
It says metagametheory.com, and it was free.

912
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:41,940
I didn't pay anything for this t-shirt, I got it from my brother, who won a podcast contest.

913
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,380
The end.

914
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,660
That was wonderful.

915
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,300
I feel like I can get like four or five more verses out of that.

916
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,060
No, I don't think we need that many.

917
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,500
I don't think would be, I think, hey, this is kind of-

918
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,260
Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob,

919
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:10,420
Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob,

920
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,580
they both have dragon voices, Robin Bob, Robin Bob.

921
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,020
Hey, this is an ironically timed question.

922
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,700
I am bored, unless I'm actually laughing at any moment, I am bored.

923
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,580
I think this is causing problems in all areas of my life, but especially trying to keep a man.

924
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,020
They're all just too boring.

925
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,100
How can I retrain my brain, says Allison, 29 and three fourths.

926
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,300
Sounds like you're leading the most boring life.

927
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Yeah, what about some excitement?

928
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,660
Maybe put some Tabasco in your meals, both metaphysically and sort of literally.

929
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,980
Like put Tabasco on your soul?

930
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:55,620
Yeah, a little soul in your bowl, a little spice, spice in your life.

931
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,460
The spice is life.

932
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,020
Oh my God.

933
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,420
Why don't you throw some Tabasco on your man?

934
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,820
Ooh, you won't see that coming.

935
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,380
In his eyes.

936
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,860
You gotta keep it zesty, Allison.

937
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,540
Do one thing every day that scares you.

938
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,020
How's that sound?

939
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,580
That sounds pretty inspirational, doesn't it?

940
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,740
Stab myself in the stomach a little bit.

941
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,460
I'm starting to scare myself.

942
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,100
Just the tip.

943
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,220
Maybe men are, I mean, people are, can be kind of boring.

944
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,140
I think you need to think about this.

945
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,660
I'm gonna turn this around on you yet again.

946
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,660
Maybe chicks.

947
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,540
Hold on.

948
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,020
No way.

949
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,060
No way.

950
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,780
Stay with me.

951
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,460
I don't know why you're trying to usher in the apocalypse even faster.

952
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,620
We'll get there eventually.

953
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,580
Classic callback.

954
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,140
You gotta peel back the layers because everybody has something magical inside them.

955
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,220
Everybody has a little seed of magic.

956
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,900
You just gotta get to it.

957
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,260
Even the Bay Harbor butcher.

958
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,380
The Bay Harbor butcher, he has obviously a lot of love in his soul.

959
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,660
He just doesn't know how to let it out right without cutting women.

960
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,900
I don't want to be too counterproductive here, but you may want to just like,

961
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,140
I don't want to say lower your standards, but life isn't going to be

962
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,940
a constant rollercoaster of excitement.

963
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,940
Unless you work at King's Island.

964
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:16,900
Yeah.

965
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,100
There it is.

966
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,140
Get a job at King's Island.

967
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,340
Get a job at King's Island.

968
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,860
Ride the son of the beast every day.

969
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,300
Oh, too bad they closed that.

970
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,340
Well, that'll be especially scary because that is closed.

971
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,620
Yeah, it doesn't exist.

972
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,660
But that's good, man.

973
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,700
Fuck that rollercoaster.

974
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,860
That rollercoaster took my eye, I think.

975
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,180
Oh yeah?

976
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,140
You know, my eye's bad.

977
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,020
I think that rollercoaster scared my eye into not working.

978
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,220
Wow.

979
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,380
Something every day that scares your eye.

980
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,500
Think about this, Allison.

981
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:46,820
By leading a boring life, you've avoided having your eyes scared to the point of in operation.

982
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,380
As it happens all the time.

983
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,060
I read about it in the science journal.

984
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,140
How about a Yahoo?

985
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,020
Because I've got a lot of them.

986
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,900
Give me, give me, give me.

987
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,740
Oh, this will be good.

988
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,020
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker, who's just the best guy.

989
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,260
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ice Cream Eater, who asks,

990
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,540
should I build a disco playhouse for kids in my backyard?

991
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,540
Yes.

992
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,780
Let me explain.

993
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:21,380
I had this idea in the back of my head for a while, and I liked a little advice.

994
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,260
And that's what we do here.

995
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,900
I myself was a 70s kid, and disco fever never died in my heart.

996
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,460
What if I built a mini Studio 54 in my backyard?

997
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,460
I could get a disco ball, a stereo for my old record player, and a Pixy Stix vending machine.

998
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:48,100
I'd love to dress my kids up like 70s celebrities like John Travolta, Barbara Streisand, Mick Jagger,

999
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,260
and such, and make them dance and have fun.

1000
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,420
Should I go through with the idea?

1001
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,940
Hey, you fucking kids.

1002
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,860
Hey, you fucking kids, you don't look like you're having fun.

1003
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,180
We're gonna make you have fun, Babs.

1004
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,500
I'm gonna make you have fun.

1005
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,340
Little Babs, dance with little John.

1006
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,740
Have fun.

1007
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,900
Do your best, Jagger, because you're Mick Jagger.

1008
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,460
Do it.

1009
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,980
Snort this Pixy Stix.

1010
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,860
Snort it.

1011
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,700
That's what he means, right, by Pixy Stix?

1012
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,660
Oh, Christ, yes.

1013
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,340
What colors should the inside of the disco playhouse be painted?

1014
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,740
Should the disco playhouse have windows or no windows so it's dark inside?

1015
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,220
Yeah, I think-

1016
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,500
What is the color of massive amounts of psychological suffering?

1017
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,020
That's really gonna-

1018
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,420
Puse?

1019
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,780
What color would you paint the inside of the disco playhouse door?

1020
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,020
If the disco light's disco ball is turned on and me and the kids are dancing,

1021
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,700
would it be better to have curtains at the entrance of the disco playhouse to block out

1022
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,260
any outside light or no curtains and close the door?

1023
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,380
I think-

1024
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,780
Holy fucking shit!

1025
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,140
Jesus Christ!

1026
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,460
Which is the one that keeps Jesus out?

1027
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,900
Is that curtains or is that a door?

1028
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,500
Cause if he could see, he's gonna kill you instantly and take you to hell.

1029
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,140
Himself.

1030
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,500
And he doesn't like to go down there.

1031
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,280
Wow!

1032
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,880
So-

1033
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,060
Dog.

1034
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,380
You-

1035
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:57,940
Dog!

1036
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,180
No.

1037
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,620
No windows.

1038
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:00,900
No.

1039
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,420
You owe it to your-

1040
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,540
Your brood.

1041
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,900
Your ruined brood.

1042
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,860
No windows.

1043
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:10,660
To make sure that their fucking friends, their cohorts in elementary school,

1044
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:15,860
aren't gonna see them dressed up in polyester jumpsuits and snorting pixie sticks with their dad!

1045
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:16,500
It's too late!

1046
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,220
Their dad-

1047
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,020
Their dad inside!

1048
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,060
You killed him already!

1049
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,180
Their dad inside and outside if you let them snort pixie sticks in a tiny Studio 54 you

1050
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,620
built in your backyard!

1051
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,100
Hey, I know I only get you kids on the weekends, but listen.

1052
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,380
Listen, look what I've been working on all week.

1053
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,740
Uh, I've been working on a discotheque for you and your little-

1054
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,100
Do your friends want to come?

1055
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,660
You want to have your little friends come?

1056
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,940
Dad, we're 26.

1057
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,620
We're 26 years old, dad.

1058
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,380
You know, you know, I heard your friends talking about how much you love the Gap Band and I

1059
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,540
was just, oh, that's a conversation that never happened, nor will it ever.

1060
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,060
God, I miss the 70s.

1061
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,420
Yeah, I miss the 70s too.

1062
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,180
Hey, do you guys want to make a wild cherry reunion group?

1063
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,620
Like, we'll get a wild-

1064
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,620
Little Wild Cherries is what we'll call it.

1065
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,620
Motherfucker.

1066
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:07,620
How- Okay, no windows, no doors, no walls.

1067
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,660
Don't do it.

1068
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,660
No problem.

1069
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,620
No problem.

1070
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,500
You never had- I know- Listen, I've had some fucking stupid ideas too, okay?

1071
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,620
I'm there with you.

1072
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,860
Like, I've had some ill-advised notions that my wife has had to dispel me of.

1073
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,100
Uh, I tried to order my own dinner once.

1074
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,940
That did not go well, for example.

1075
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,700
The, this, or is it great?

1076
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:36,180
Like, I want it to be going on in the world that I live in, I just don't like the idea

1077
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,780
of it happening to real people.

1078
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,140
Yeah, I don't like the idea of a dad, like, consulting with his children, like, should

1079
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,500
there be a fuck room?

1080
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Like, dad?

1081
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:44,980
Daddy?

1082
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:51,060
Should we just have a, like a champagne, a champagne re- like a champagne tent, maybe?

1083
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,780
This is the slick, this is the stupid slide.

1084
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,100
It's coated in vodka.

1085
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,460
This is crazy, tonight.

1086
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:06,340
I think that you're never too young to indulge in all of your mind and heart's bacchanalian

1087
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,180
desires.

1088
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,820
Unless the only party guests have the same last name as you.

1089
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,300
In which case, you're always too young- It's just gonna be me and the kids, partying

1090
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,700
like it's 1973.

1091
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,820
The kids- No.

1092
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,380
The kids punked out at, like, 1030.

1093
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,780
They went inside and watched Babar.

1094
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,780
But I stayed there just twirling, just wildly twirling to the sound of Donna's Lover.

1095
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:34,180
Just twirling, hoping that if I spin fast enough, I'll reverse the rotation of the earth

1096
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,260
and travel back in time to grown-up Studio 54, to adult Studio 54.

1097
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,700
You know, the one good thing about this is you're really gonna prepare your kids, because

1098
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:49,540
for the rest of their life, they can always, like, no matter how sad or weird things get

1099
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,980
for them, they can always say it's neither the saddest nor weirdest thing.

1100
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,380
They've never been a party to.

1101
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,380
And when your kid becomes the Bay Harbor Butcher and they're constantly trying to peel people's

1102
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,460
faces off, they have a pretty justifiable reason for why they are that way.

1103
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,140
Hey, I just want to say, I don't want to creep you out, but I think you're beautiful.

1104
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,060
Can I teach you how to roller skate?

1105
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,020
Will you come to Lil' 54 with me?

1106
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,700
We're going to Lil' 54.

1107
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,740
I hear Lil' Elton John is there, playing Lil' Crocodile Rock.

1108
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,740
The kids love it.

1109
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,300
It turns out to be really fucking fresh, though.

1110
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,220
What if it's dope and every kid wants to get in?

1111
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,020
What if it's dope and everyone wants to be your kid's friends because of it?

1112
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:33,860
They have to stand behind a tiny velvet rope and have sex with the tiny doorman to get

1113
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,860
in.

1114
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,860
Stop it.

1115
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,860
That's not good.

1116
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,860
You're weirding me out.

1117
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,860
That is what will happen.

1118
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,580
I hadn't seen the movie in there, a movie called, like, Just 54, and it's just like

1119
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,100
Mike Myers and Ryan Phillippe.

1120
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,900
Mike Myers is in it, and they're just, like, fucking in big pits of bubbles all the time

1121
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,700
when the bubbles are made of LSD.

1122
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Yeah.

1123
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,780
And then, like, three flamingos are there.

1124
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,620
What if the dad is the only one that gets coked out, and he just, like, rolls around

1125
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,260
the dance floor welcoming kids to his party?

1126
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,260
Welcome to my party!

1127
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,660
Welcome.

1128
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,580
Welcome to Lil' 54.

1129
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,100
Michael's over there in the corner if you want to go play with him.

1130
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,980
What do you mean I can't get in, Lil' Bouncer?

1131
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,420
I made this place.

1132
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,060
I built this out of my own two hands.

1133
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,620
I am Lil' Studio 54.

1134
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,620
That's so little.

1135
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,540
You can't cut me out, David.

1136
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,020
We built this together one weekend.

1137
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,020
If you remember.

1138
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:34,540
If this happens, can everybody, can we crowdsource this and just say, everybody, go outside,

1139
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:38,980
look in your backyard, look in your neighbor's backyards, and if you see this, can you just

1140
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
call me?

1141
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,980
I'll give you my number.

1142
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,580
I need to know.

1143
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:46,100
It's been a really rough month, and I could really use this in my life right now.

1144
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,500
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first, a few housekeeping things.

1145
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,980
If you haven't gotten tickets to our live show yet in Chicago, that's going to be next

1146
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:03,420
Sunday, you know, six days from today, I guess, 10 o'clock, us, Dan Telford, Jordan Jesse

1147
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,420
Goh.

1148
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,420
It's going to be huge.

1149
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,420
We've sold about half the tickets.

1150
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,140
They're only 12 bucks, so if you want to go bring a crew, it's going to be a lot of

1151
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,140
fun.

1152
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,140
When can they get tickets?

1153
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,340
Is that a good time, right, or you can go...

1154
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,340
We will...

1155
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,340
There's a couple links on the MaximumFun.org.

1156
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,460
We'll tweet blast it, too, when this episode goes up.

1158
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,620
You can check out, but make sure you get tickets to that.

1159
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:28,620
Like we said, they're only 12 bucks, and it'll be a lot of fun.

1160
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,700
MBMAM.com is our website.

1161
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,820
That's where you can go to listen to other episodes of the show.

1162
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,860
The ways you can ask us questions are there.

1163
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,860
MBMAM.com.

1164
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:47,020
It's at MaximumFun.org, MBMAM, MBMAM at MaximumFun.org.

1165
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,020
One year, guys.

1166
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,020
One year.

1167
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:52,140
One year we've been doing this, and you can't get the URL correct.

1168
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,140
I'm sorry.

1169
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,980
It's that hyperlink.

1170
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,340
Any Twitter people we want to say hi to?

1171
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,340
I mean, who's been talking up the show?

1172
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,620
Dan Rogers took his MBMAM shirt to go see the Pixies.

1173
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,820
I'm sure Frank Black saw it and thought, hey, looking good.

1174
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:12,420
There goes my favorite podcast.

1175
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,740
I Am Ben Kendrick is throwing a pack your bags and move away going away party.

1176
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,740
A theme there.

1177
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,740
We like that.

1178
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,740
Where's it going away to?

1179
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,740
I don't know.

1180
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,740
Cool.

1181
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,740
They're leaving New York.

1182
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,660
Momohine has caught up on all the back episodes, even with her aching teeth.

1183
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,660
Aw.

1184
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,660
I know.

1185
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,540
Our show is best appreciated when you still got like a little nitrous buzz.

1186
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,540
Go ahead.

1187
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,540
From the dentist.

1188
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,540
MBMAM.com.

1189
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:42,500
You can also you'll see a link to the forums there, lots of good discussions and growing.

1190
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,300
We're there all the time talking with people.

1191
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,460
So make sure you stop by and say hello and make sure at the live show.

1192
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,980
If you come, you know, send us questions now and maybe we'll get at the live show and let

1193
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,980
us know.

1194
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,380
Say, hey, I'm going to be in the live show.

1195
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,020
And here's my question.

1196
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,620
And also make sure to stick around afterwards because we'll probably go get schwaisted.

1197
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,980
It's going to be my fucking birthday.

1198
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,020
Everyone's going to be there.

1199
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,020
My dad's going to be there.

1200
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,020
It's going to be dope.

1201
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,020
We're going to party.

1202
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,020
We're going to party with my dad.

1203
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,020
It's going to be sick.

1204
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,020
It's going to be sick.

1205
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,020
It'll be like a little 54 again.

1206
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,540
It's going to be a tiny baby 54 for me.

1207
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,340
It's going to be like big, tiny 54.

1208
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,440
We're going to have pixie sticks.

1209
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,020
As far as the eye can see, we're going to snort them.

1210
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,020
My dad's going to be there.

1211
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,020
It's going to be sick.

1212
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,940
Seriously though, all kidding aside, it's been a year we've been doing this.

1213
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,140
Thank you guys so, so much.

1214
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:36,460
I know we say thank you a lot, but I really mean it.

1215
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,820
I don't think we mentioned this on the show last week, but we broke a million downloads.

1216
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,820
Broke a million downloads.

1217
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,580
It's just because you guys have been so super cool and supportive.

1218
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,700
Thank you for spreading the word in our first year.

1219
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,100
Please keep talking to people about the show because that's how we've grown.

1220
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,140
It's why we're still doing it because you guys have been so cool and supportive and

1221
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,140
everything.

1222
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,140
And thank you.

1223
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,140
We really appreciate it.

1224
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,500
I love you.

1225
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,820
So Griffin, hit me.

1226
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,780
I'm ready.

1227
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,900
This one is a final question for episode 50, sent in by Jacob Locker.

1228
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,900
Thank you Jacob.

1229
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:18,420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jay who asks, how to do extreme couponing?

1230
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,660
I'm Justin McElroy.

1231
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,140
I'm Travis McElroy.

1232
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1233
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,220
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1234
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,220
Kiss your dad.

1235
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:44,500
Go wear them ellipses.
