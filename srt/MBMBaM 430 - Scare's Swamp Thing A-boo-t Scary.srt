1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,600
Can't do the Tim Curry thing. Can't do that. Why not? I think you've done it more than once,

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,880
so like why break tradition now? That's a good point. I mean, I'm saying you've already done

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,640
it more than once, why say, but I can't do it three times? Maybe just skip the intro because

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,760
the intro always goes a little bit long, and just get into like the meat of the of the tune.

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,320
Okay. Scary, freaky, crawly Halloween. In media res, Tim Curry.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:24,720
Wow, I can't believe I sang the whole thing. Yeah. To my brother, my brother, my brother,

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:39,120
my brother, and Merman? There's nothing spooky about the name. My brother of Frankenstein,

12
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,600
Frankenstein's brother. Yes, yes, yes. Actually, I prefer to be Frankenstein's monster's brother.

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm Doug Frankenstein. I'm the brother of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, and I'm like,

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,000
well, I don't know about this. Hey, do you think it was weird? Okay, Frankenstein's brother,

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,600
let's talk about him for a second. Yeah. So Dr. Frankenstein makes Frankenstein, right?

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,720
Then he makes another one, Frankenstein's brother. Everybody calls the first one Frankenstein,

17
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
right? Right. He's like, I called it Frankenstein. So Frankenstein's brother gets made. He's like,

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,240
bzzzap. Okay, I'm awake. Hello. What time is it? Oh, cool. This is so weird to be alive. It exists.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,640
This is amazing. So who are you? I am Dr. Frankenstein. And who's that? That's Frankenstein.

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,200
So I guess you just went ahead and called him. And what about me? Your name. Oh,

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,320
you're the brother of Frankenstein. Well, that fucking sucks. That's weird. Call me Bill

22
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:47,600
Einstein, please. Bride of Frankenstein? How about we go with Victoria, my name?

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,120
Victoria. And then maybe we'll date and we'll see. This would be like if Travis was named

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,240
brother of Justin, and I was called like Lil' Justin.

25
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,600
My name is Justin. This is the Justinettes. Welcome to my brother, my brother and me,

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,240
or as we're gonna call it from now on, Justin and the rest. It's an advice show for the

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,520
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,200
Oh, God almighty. Give me one of those. I don't think I should have to do a spooky

29
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,000
voice because my voice already kind of sounds like bones. I'm Griffin McElroy.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,640
I wanted to try a thing where it was like the cryptkeeper, but he couldn't come up with

31
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,440
a good pun. But that's still just how he sounds all the time. Because sometimes he would have

32
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,280
to be like, yes, I would like fries with that. Yeah. And it's like, oh, what's the joke?

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,520
Like, there's no joke. I'm just a hungry boy. I'm a hungry. Yeah. He has to live.

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,920
I'm sorry I don't get it. There's no need to be rude. Just tell me what's the pun.

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
Nope. This is just me all the time. I'm actually feeling really down today and

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,240
just wanted some comfort food. Doesn't the flop house have a legal

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:08,080
copyright on talking about cryptkeeper? Don't they have the lifetime TM on that

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680
particular character? Anything can happen on Halloween.

39
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Oh, we're back. Once Justin starts stepping on Travis's toes, on his goof toes, you can just

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,320
drop that and he'll get distracted as if a child distracted by a pinwheel or something.

41
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Well, that's the thing is that once that precedent is set, once it's established that

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,040
anything can happen on Halloween, there's no rules just right anyway.

43
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah. So this is our Halloween

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:41,040
spooktacular. Travis kind of, what's a nice way of putting it, deputized himself to give us a

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
theme episode because those have gone. Yeah, pretty good, I think. Let me check the

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,760
books. I mean, actually, you got friends who keep the records on this one, like baseball

47
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
statisticians. And so let me just go back and check where there's a column that says themed

48
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,440
episodes and see how. Oh, it's full of spiders.

49
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,240
It's full of spiders. Now they're calling on me.

50
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,640
I had a good reason, though. I wanted to do this because we got just randomly one good

51
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,440
question about Halloween and I thought, oh, that's fun. What if we had more of these?

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
Sort of an anchor, a spooky anchor for the rest of the episode.

53
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Yeah. Okay.

54
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,320
And you know what? It'll also probably occur to people that this episode is horrifyingly late.

55
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,920
And so you guys just gave me too much time to think about it.

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,400
That's fair.

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,560
Yeah. This is how this is how Sad Libs got started. And now here we are doing a Halloween

58
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:43,200
Sweetactular. Y'all give me too much time on my own and I just have these ideas. These ideas.

59
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,200
Here we are. Here we are talking about Halloween.

60
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,520
Not new. This is not a Halloween watch.

61
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,680
No.

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,880
Even though that would make a lot of sense because there has just been a Halloween film

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,640
and we do do that from time to time.

64
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,160
What are you guys gonna, yeah, what are you gonna be?

65
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,640
Oh, what are you guys gonna be this year? Wow, this is weird.

66
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,160
What are you guys gonna be this year?

67
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
Well, BB is going as Daniel Tiger.

68
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Love it.

69
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,520
And so I thought that I would kind of do a complimentary costume

70
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,200
and go as Johnny the evil karate person from Karate Kid.

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,840
Oh, that's fun.

72
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Now, how does that sort of jive with Daniel Tiger?

73
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
Like Daniel, how the kid's name is Daniel.

74
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,760
That's fair.

75
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,200
Oh, Daniel.

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,760
Yes.

77
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,440
My little guy is going to dress up like a lion because you can just do that when they're small.

78
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,840
It's just like, yeah, they're a puppy. Fucking look at them. It's incredible.

79
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
So he's going to be a lion. I'm going to be David S. Pumpkins.

80
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,760
Nice.

81
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,320
This 2018 and I'm here to say David S. Pumpkins is still in my heart.

82
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,800
He still lives in my heart. I've made room for him. He's not a victim. He's in there.

83
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,960
We're all doing superheroes.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Because Charlie's going to be Supergirl.

85
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:03,840
Cool.

86
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,800
And there's just, you know, I've always struggled finding

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,040
sort of more rotund costumes that I can feel great about.

88
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,520
All right.

89
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,880
But pretty low on that list is like skin tight lycra.

90
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Yeah.

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,800
So I'm probably going to have to do the Superman t-shirt thing

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
underneath like a dress, like I'm chained.

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,760
Like you caught me.

94
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,440
Oh, that's fine.

95
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,920
Now I do like that, but let me say, Justin, I think you would look beautiful whatever you wear

96
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,280
because I know you and I think you would fucking own it.

97
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,520
Yeah.

98
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,040
Well, I did order a full Superman costume.

99
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,600
Nice.

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,360
So we are going to try that on and just see how it grabs us.

101
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,160
Maybe a little bit of a Kingdom Come vibe for all you comic heads out there.

102
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,440
Well, we'll give it a whirl, whirlsy daisy.

103
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,640
Anywho, so, but I did see it.

104
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I saw, you know, I saw a t-shirt that had, well, I was looking for a costume.

105
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,160
I saw a t-shirt that had printed on it, the Clark Kent dress shirt

106
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
with the Superman t-shirt underneath.

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
It was like, it's just a lot of layers.

108
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,960
That's three shirts.

109
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,600
Away.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
Yeah, it's like three shirts in one.

111
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Fuck yeah, I love that shit.

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
Why don't they do that more?

113
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,600
If I go to, you know, J. Crew and I want to get some autumnal layers going,

114
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,800
don't make me buy, you know, a jacket Oxford t-shirt with a tank top underneath it.

115
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,400
Just give me one big shirt that looks like all of them for $40.

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,120
I'm going to get into our very spooky Halloween questions

117
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
because if we don't do them this week, we're not fucking going to do them ever.

118
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,680
So let's go.

119
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm working at a professional haunted house this year.

120
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,240
Nice.

121
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
And I have this problem where people take what I say literally and ruin the scare.

122
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,920
For example, my character was right before a train scare.

123
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,400
Is that, you just kind of threw that out there.

124
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,320
Like, well, you got a train scare coming up.

125
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Well, I think context clues don't make sense as we continue on with the question.

126
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,700
Okay.

127
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
I was supposed to have died on the tracks.

128
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,880
So I would scream, don't go on the tracks.

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
It doesn't happen too often.

130
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,360
But every now and then, Bingus is like, okay, well, let me turn our whole group around

131
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
and not go obviously forward.

132
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,960
Where do we go?

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
I wouldn't go in there.

134
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
Oh, all right.

135
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
Sick.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
You obviously had a bit of trouble with the train, so I don't learn from the rest of that.

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
It does seem dangerous.

138
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,840
So I guess I'll, is this way to funnel cake?

139
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
What can I do in response?

140
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,600
I've stuttered and yelled, I want you to go on the tracks as a last resort.

141
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
No, you know what?

142
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
Do go on the tracks.

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Winging it in Westland is who that is from.

144
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
That is very good.

145
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,960
That's a very good quandary.

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
I miss haunted houses.

147
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,480
Me too.

148
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
It used to be fun and easy to go to them before I had children.

149
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
Now it's a little more challenging.

150
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
I've worked several haunted houses in my life.

151
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,280
This is true.

152
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,400
I want to hear some good haunted house stories from my brother, Travis, who I love.

153
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,120
Well, one time in La La Land.

154
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,640
So he's got a lot of celebs.

155
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,200
I actually did.

156
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Who's got the best feel?

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,880
Jonah Hill.

158
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
Jonah Hill, you got him good, huh?

159
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
We scared the shit out of Jonah Hill.

160
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
Oh, good, dude.

161
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
Did he shit his fucking pants?

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
He did, oddly.

163
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,560
Nice, dude.

164
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,920
Actually, I don't know that to be true, and I don't want to get sued for libel.

165
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,560
Nah, if it's true, then it's true, baby, and it ain't libel.

166
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
You made Jonah Hill dookiest shorts, you loved it.

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Awesome, dude.

168
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,160
Now who's the maniac?

169
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,720
Here's the thing.

170
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,880
He shit his pants, and then he came back through three more times.

171
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,680
He loved it.

172
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,520
And each time he shit his pants.

173
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,600
He said out loud, he said out loud, I've been constipated for six years.

174
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Thank you so much.

175
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm going to cast you my next feature.

176
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
They'll teach him to drop out of the limelight to focus on directing.

177
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,760
No, but I was in one and I fell asleep in a coffin.

178
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
Well, that's pretty much the biggest story.

179
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
That must have been anti-climactic for the people walking by.

180
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,280
I was in a coffin that I popped open and scared people.

181
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,920
And one night, when I was working a haunted house in Oklahoma,

182
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,680
I did fall asleep in the casket.

183
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,840
It was a good nap.

184
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,520
I bet, dude, the dirt nap, it's sort of designed to be good.

185
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,440
The wake up was not great.

186
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,160
No, sure.

187
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
Not a cool wake up.

188
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,560
Here's the thing about a haunted house.

189
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
End of the day, it is still a house.

190
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you.

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,680
And I can't say like, yo, Derek, go to the bathroom.

192
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
I can't, you know what I mean?

193
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,480
I can't say, yo, Derek, time to go upstairs to the nursery.

194
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,280
Derek's going to go where he wants to go.

195
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,760
It is still a house and you need to be hospitable.

196
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,480
Do you know what I mean?

197
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
Yeah, I do know what you mean.

198
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,120
It's a house?

199
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
It's a house.

200
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,320
Lest we forget, that's, you know what?

201
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,960
It's a haunted house, but to somebody it's a haunted home.

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
That's what you think about.

203
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
That's somebody's haunted home that you're traipsing around in

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,320
and spilling your hot cocoa that you purchased in line.

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
You're spilling that everywhere.

206
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
It's somebody's haunted home.

207
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,480
They should establish that more.

208
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
There should be a room that you walk into

209
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
and there's just like somebody watching TV and they're like,

210
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
oh, there's nothing scary in this room.

211
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
This is just the den.

212
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you want to fucking buy it though?

213
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
Because I hate how haunted it is.

214
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Yeah, oh, would you please buy this house?

215
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,240
Come back in like May.

216
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,040
It sucks.

217
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
Very fun usually.

218
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,840
In May, it's the worst.

219
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah, because it's still this,

220
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,920
but also like I have to go to work.

221
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,720
Yeah, thank you for your like sort of tourism through my life.

222
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
Sort of like this life tourism, but this is my haunted home.

223
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,120
Next time you come, could you bring some groceries or something?

224
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,960
I haven't been able to leave the house.

225
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,040
There's a chainsaw man by the front door.

226
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
I can't go fucking anywhere.

227
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,640
We live, this is our first Halloween in a new neighborhood

228
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
that we recently moved to.

229
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,520
And there is a house down the street that about two weeks ago,

230
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,080
their whole front yard became covered

231
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,400
in a barrier of black garbage bags.

232
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,640
And you know what the fuck that means.

233
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,480
That it's about to get really spooky in there.

234
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
They don't want anybody to see the Halloween surprise.

235
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,680
Then they spray painted the bags with a date

236
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,520
that you know their mixtape is gonna drop

237
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,800
and you're so fucking psyched.

238
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,080
Yesterday, I drove by it

239
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,800
and they had also spray painted on $5.

240
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,320
Is your house, bud?

241
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,160
That's a home hot.

242
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,160
You can't turn it into an unlicensed haunted home.

243
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,600
Like an off-track, especially scary factory.

244
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,480
There's no way it's like OSHA standards in there.

245
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm like, hey, someone's gonna fucking touch you.

246
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
Like, uh, no, no, no.

247
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,440
You know what, Griffin, call OSHA.

248
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,920
Get Etsy a haunted house.

249
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,720
Yeah, do it.

250
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,600
Get a license.

251
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,840
There are rules, trust me.

252
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,880
I've been yelled at.

253
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,280
Here's the way you solve this one.

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,160
Because you can do this and you can amp up the scares.

255
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,920
So you act like you weren't finished with your sentence.

256
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,080
Like, don't go across the tracks.

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,360
And then they're like, okay, I won't.

258
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
And then you turn around like,

259
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,320
because I'm gonna eat your feet.

260
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,400
And then you go after them.

261
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,160
To like, eat their feet.

262
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
And they're like, so scared.

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
Or like, I'm gonna eat your ass.

264
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
Because I'm gonna, well, get to the tracks.

265
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
That could send a different message, Justin.

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm gonna eat your fucking ass.

267
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
I'm gonna eat your whole ass, yeah.

268
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,400
That might be a mixed message, though.

269
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,920
Awesome, dude, I'm so scared.

270
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
Shit.

271
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,400
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

272
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,200
This one was sent in by Ray Gaynor.

273
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,120
Thanks, Ray, it's Yahoo Answers User.

274
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,680
Dan, who asks, if you pump a haunted cellar

275
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
full of concrete, does it get rid of the ghost?

276
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
Like, if you totally obliterate the ghost's environment

277
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
by filling the whole cellar full of liquid concrete

278
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
right up to the ceiling, does it effectively exorcise it?

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,280
Or would the ghost just move upstairs

280
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,080
and haunt the rest of the house?

281
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,680
Stupid ignorant people who don't believe in ghosts

282
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880
should not respond to this question.

283
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,400
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

284
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,120
Who you gonna call?

285
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,400
Me, the Ghostbuster.

286
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,120
Conk.

287
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,080
All right, so I'm gonna fix this one up proper good.

288
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,160
Ain't no fucking ghost gonna get out of this, boy.

289
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
Do you have anything you need to get out of the cellar

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,160
before I begin the extraction process?

291
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,560
Well, I think our cat was down, oh.

292
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,120
Okay, your cat, good news, cat's still down there.

293
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,520
You know where it is, and you always will.

294
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,640
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

295
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,560
I just reduced the square footage of your home.

296
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm a Ghostbuster.

297
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,040
I mean, ghosts are, by definition, incorporeal.

298
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
Yeah, but to, but counterpoint, Trav,

299
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,560
I'm not saying that they would be like forced out,

300
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,160
but I don't know of a ghost who would be like,

301
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,240
oh, cool, I'm gonna brick.

302
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,480
Yeah.

303
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,160
I'm just gonna sit down here, I guess.

304
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,200
The ghosts are just like, oh, okay, I get it, fine.

305
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,960
I get it, you don't want me here.

306
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,840
You could have just said, or like hung crosses up.

307
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,080
You didn't have to ruin your finished basement, dog.

308
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,600
You didn't have to kill your beloved Mr. Mittens.

309
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,760
Like, this is gonna kill your resale value.

310
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,880
What were you thinking?

311
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,280
I don't think-

312
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
This is like one third of the square footage of the house.

313
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,200
You had a bar down here.

314
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,560
Cellar's actually a lot of trouble.

315
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,680
I would be fine with just concreting one right up.

316
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
So I didn't have to deal with all the dankness,

317
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,720
the mold, are you kidding me?

318
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,360
And the ghosts?

319
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,200
Folks, if it's below ground, it's gonna get wet in there.

320
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,080
That's Earth.

321
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,200
That actually is true,

322
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
but my basement just flooded a little bit.

323
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,760
I don't know how much water there has to be in a basement

324
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,880
for you to call it flooded,

325
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,000
but any presence of water that cannot be explained.

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,320
Yeah.

327
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, if there was, okay, imagine there was a ghost

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,720
that was extremely terrifying and very spooky.

329
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,160
He is not friendly.

330
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,760
I cannot highlight this enough.

331
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,360
This is not a friendly ghost.

332
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,320
Is he like standoffish or?

333
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,720
No, he's like a scary fucking ghost, right?

334
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
Like from the movie.

335
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,320
What'd he kill?

336
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,440
Does he kill?

337
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,880
No, ghosts don't do anything.

338
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,840
Ghosts really aren't scary,

339
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,480
but imagine he's like a scary, frightening ghost.

340
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
Like if you give him a second, he'll like try to push

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
your board game shelf over on top of you.

342
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,360
Oh, no.

343
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
I know, but he's acting out.

344
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,200
I just organized those.

345
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
He will also maintain your basement

346
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,600
and keep it dry and spotless.

347
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,080
Shit.

348
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,680
I guess what I'm saying is if you could have a butler

349
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,120
that was also a ghost.

350
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
A boodler.

351
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,760
Thank you.

352
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
That's unnecessary, but okay, I suppose.

353
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,360
Yes, fine.

354
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,400
We've checked with the judges.

355
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
They say it's okay.

356
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,640
A bootler.

357
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,960
No, if you don't say it right,

358
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
it just sounds like you're mispronouncing butler.

359
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,280
You gotta say booooodler.

360
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,840
Don't think I have to do anything of the sort.

361
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,320
So what would you, what would you-

362
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,440
Hey, whose phone's ringing?

363
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
Hey, whose phone just rang?

364
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,520
It's a ghost.

365
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,240
Oh, Justin.

366
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,360
Justin, did you get a ghost caller or?

367
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,480
Don't be scared.

368
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm very scared of the rudeness that I didn't expect.

369
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
The booooodness.

370
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Yeah, I thought maybe we were all very,

371
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,880
very on the same level, but I'm terrified we're not.

372
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,640
I thought we've been recording episodes for over nine years.

373
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

374
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,280
I don't have a phone.

375
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,800
Fuck.

376
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,120
Hell yeah, dude.

377
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,680
Too real.

378
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
It's really good.

379
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,520
Let's get back to Justin's spooky sexy upstairs downstairs reboot.

380
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,440
Yes, I would keep-

381
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,480
If I had a moody standoffish acting out ghost

382
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
who wasn't necessarily trying to kill me,

383
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,320
but didn't mind tipping a board game shelf over on me,

384
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,800
but kept my basement clean,

385
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,280
maybe cleaned like the cat box that was down there

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
and like kept it dry.

387
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,360
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

388
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,800
I think I'd be okay with that.

389
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,760
Okay, thank you, Travis.

390
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,640
Thank you for weighing in.

391
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,720
I have a second question.

392
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
Let's say he was just a spooky ghost.

393
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Not helpful, okay?

394
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,320
Okay, he scared your family.

395
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,720
He scared your pets.

396
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
He scared your guests.

397
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,240
He made a very scary place to be in, okay?

398
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,200
So you can banish this ghost,

399
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,440
but it takes 20 minutes and you have to watch the entire time

400
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,760
and the ghost can talk and stuff.

401
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,960
Would you banish this ghost into non-existence

402
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,720
if one, it took 20 minutes,

403
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
two, it could talk the whole time,

404
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,360
and three, you had to watch?

405
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,920
And the ghost knows what's going on the whole time?

406
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,800
It knows what's going on.

407
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,160
It knows that you're doing it.

408
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,080
You're like holding a giant lever

409
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,640
to banish this ghost into non-existence,

410
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,360
but you have to stay in the room the entire time.

411
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,160
Is the ghost experiencing any kind of discomfort

412
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,200
or is it just like...

413
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
He's being banished.

414
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
No, he's being slowly banished into non-existence.

415
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,920
He's being nothinged and he knows that you're doing it.

416
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,320
I think I could make a hard case for like,

417
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,160
sorry, bud, you knocked over all my board games.

418
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,320
I spent all afternoon organizing those.

419
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,680
You did knock them over, so I have to destroy you forever.

420
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
I have to send you to the nothing place.

421
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,080
I don't think that's-

422
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,160
He's gonna make a lot of promises here,

423
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,760
and there's gonna be a lot of like,

424
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,880
I will make you board games from now on.

425
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,240
I'll suck your fucking dick, dude.

426
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
Have you seen Ghostbusters?

427
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
You ever had an ecto style?

428
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,680
I will, I'll do it.

429
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,840
What if that's how the Ghostbusters did it?

430
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,520
What if rather than trap,

431
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
what if when you hire the Ghostbusters,

432
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,800
they had to stand in your living room

433
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,720
and blast the ghost into non-existence

434
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,160
and it took 45 minutes and they could talk the entire time?

435
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,760
I mean, that's why they kept Slimer around.

436
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,000
Slimer was the only one who they felt pity for.

437
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,520
This Slimer is like a fucking ghost hospice nurse

438
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
just talking the ghost into non-existence.

439
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,080
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's fine.

440
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,160
Rest your slimy head on what passes through your neck.

441
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,800
It's the slime zone.

442
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,920
Ah, nice.

443
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,680
Ah, Ghost still got it, man.

444
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,240
Horses are done, but Ghost still got it, man.

445
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,520
Damn, damn, damn, damn, Daniel.

446
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
How do I tell people to give me bones?

447
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
I collect bones and enjoy getting them as gifts.

448
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,360
Best gift I ever gotten was a human pelvis replica.

449
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,680
Unfortunately, you nasty person.

450
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,920
Unfortunately, it's always a little awkward

451
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,400
asking people to get me bones

452
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
during gift-giving holidays or birthdays.

453
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,760
How do I ask for bones while being taken seriously

454
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,040
and not freaking people out?

455
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,560
That's from Cass.

456
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,800
Probably your biggest risk is like asking to get bones

457
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,960
and people giving you like DVD seasons

458
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,560
starring David Boreanaz.

459
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Yeah, but really.

460
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,680
But then you get it and you're like,

461
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,760
oh man, this isn't bones, but then you watch a couple seasons

462
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,440
and you're like, I'm okay with this.

463
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah, and it does feature a lot of bones.

464
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
There's a lot of bones.

465
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,160
Sure, that's gonna tickle your fancy.

466
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,680
Man, I need to get back into that show.

467
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,040
I fell off at some point.

468
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
I think I only made it through the first three or four seasons.

469
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,160
I mean, enough that I would say I'm a bones fan,

470
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,000
but not enough that I would say like,

471
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
I know everything about bones.

472
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
No one loves bones more than me.

473
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,680
I tell you, my favorite thing is David Boreanaz

474
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,160
versus pretty, I don't know, I wouldn't call him

475
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,720
like an uptight FBI agent.

476
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,680
I think he was in the FBI, but he wore funny, silly socks.

477
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,360
And like, that's how you knew like,

478
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
ah, he's a funny guy.

479
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,320
Yeah, he knows how to find the bones too,

480
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
which is so important.

481
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,840
And I tell you, I watched that movie Lovely Bones.

482
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,840
There was no David Boreanaz and his friend Carver

483
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,200
finding noob skeletons.

484
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
And I was so fucking pissed off by that.

485
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,480
But anyway, if you wanna know how to get bones as a gift,

486
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
there is in a way, it's wild.

487
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,160
I think they're all illegal.

488
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,760
I think it's illegal to own a bone.

489
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,320
Yeah, this is kind of like saying like,

490
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,560
I wanna get Pop-Tarts from the government.

491
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,680
I don't know how you do that.

492
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,920
That's sort of not a thing that they deal in.

493
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,440
There's a place in Los Angeles,

494
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
I'm trying to remember the name of it,

495
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,680
but what keeps popping in my head is Cryptonomica

496
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,800
because of our stupid RPG show.

497
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,560
But there's a place that just sells jewelry

498
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,280
made of bird skulls and pins

499
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
made of rabbit skeletons or whatever.

500
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,080
But they just want a pure bone experience, Travis.

501
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,720
They don't want it to be fancied up.

502
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,240
If there's a place in LA I know about,

503
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
it's called La Brea Tar Pits, full of bones.

504
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,840
You just gotta know how to get them with my special drone.

505
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,120
That's true.

506
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,520
Wouldn't you rather have a bone with a story

507
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,920
than just like, I bought you this bone?

508
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,280
That's not interesting.

509
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,120
Right now I excavated you this bone.

510
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,480
I pulled this out of the tar pits with Griffin's bone drone.

511
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,920
TM, TM, TM.

512
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,680
TM, TM, Griffin's bone drone.

513
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,080
It can be either a drone that retrieves bones

514
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
or one made out of bones for a special Halloween party.

515
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
Or maybe both.

516
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,640
Bones though, huh?

517
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,560
Where do you get them?

518
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,360
Who has them?

519
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Everybody, but they won't give them to you.

520
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
Are they at the store?

521
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,000
I know that probably if you went to like the butcher counter

522
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
and asked for bones,

523
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,680
I think they legally have to give it to you.

524
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,960
Right.

525
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
Does that still count?

526
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
Is that the kind of bones you want?

527
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,680
I think they love human bones

528
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,320
and owning as many of them as possible.

529
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
You think it's an insurance policy

530
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
in case they have a kickball accident?

531
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh, replacement bones.

532
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
I got a new fibula.

533
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
A bone donor.

534
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,280
I got a new tibia.

535
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
Got a new Tiburon.

536
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,800
My ulna's new.

537
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,760
It's from a guy named Ralph.

538
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,800
And now I have it.

539
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,400
It would be nice to like fall off the bleachers

540
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,520
at the big game.

541
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,920
Yeah.

542
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,760
And then everybody's like, oh no.

543
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,040
And you're like, it's fine.

544
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,640
I actually have another one of these.

545
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, I have other bones.

546
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,280
Let me, just get me home

547
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,000
and I'll slap a new one in there right away.

548
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
It's not polite for me to pop the new bone in

549
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,000
for everybody.

550
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,280
Because some of y'all get squeamish.

551
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,200
But I'll do it.

552
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,080
Not you, Doug.

553
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,120
I know you're weird.

554
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,680
Not you, Doug.

555
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,880
I've seen you play Operation.

556
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,320
Get the fuck out of here, Doug.

557
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm trying recently, just to be clear,

558
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm trying recently to transition away

559
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,760
from like using Steven to Doug.

560
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,160
Oh, cool.

561
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,120
That's my go-to funny name.

562
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,840
We've gotten a lot of letters from Stevens.

563
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
Like please, please, please, please fucking stop.

564
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,200
Please, God, please.

565
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,160
I mean, hell.

566
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,640
I think you guys hate me.

567
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
Derricks are never gonna get off the hook.

568
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,920
Derricks are never, yeah.

569
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,760
But I mean, it's gotta be,

570
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
it's gotta be those names.

571
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,600
Justin does Vicky or Victoria a lot.

572
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,920
I do do Victoria a lot.

573
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,000
We do need to retire Steven, though.

574
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,320
Yeah, Steven's had a good run.

575
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,160
God, I feel like dog shit.

576
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,560
Wish I had some new bones.

577
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,800
I could use a new fucking rib cage at this point.

578
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,080
Well, Griffin, if you really want a new rib cage,

579
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,520
I know one way we could afford it for you.

580
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
By doing advertisements in the Money Zone.

581
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,320
Oh, thank you.

582
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,920
Yes, the money bone.

583
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
I would like to tell you all about Squarespace.

584
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,000
Yup.

585
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,480
Yeah, that's actually great for me.

586
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah, it's actually just a coincidence

587
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,360
that then they also happen to be sponsoring us.

588
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
Sponsoring us, but even if they weren't,

589
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,320
I wanted to talk about them.

590
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Because I think that the next wave of the future

591
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
is haunted websites.

592
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,840
Yeah, it's like a haunted house,

593
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
but you don't need to leave your house

594
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,360
or go anywhere or do anything.

595
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
And it's basically like as you're scrolling through,

596
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,840
it would be like a social media platform,

597
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
like a Twitter or a Facebook or an Instagram.

598
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,280
But as you're scrolling through,

599
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,520
every third post is scary.

600
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
And then just when you start to expect it,

601
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,640
then it's like every fourth post.

602
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,960
It varies a little bit so that it works up to you.

603
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,120
And I'm gonna work on building this idea

604
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,720
using Squarespace to turn my cool idea

605
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,200
into a new website to showcase my work scariness

606
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
and announce an upcoming event or special project,

607
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
my new innovation, my scarivation.

608
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,680
Travis, you don't know literally anything

609
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,120
about making websites.

610
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,680
Oh, but Justin, I do not need to.

611
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,400
My completely infantile brain plus Squarespace

612
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,920
equals websites.

613
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,680
Because Squarespace has beautiful templates

614
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,360
created by world-class designers,

615
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
powerful e-commerce functionality

616
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
that lets me sell things online, which I will.

617
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,720
There will be a lot of merch on my scary website

618
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
and free and secure hosting.

619
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,160
So I don't have to worry about anyone hacking

620
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,480
my scary website and stealing my ideas.

621
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,400
Sure, God, please.

622
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,960
You got it.

623
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,800
You just gotta go, man.

624
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,200
Please.

625
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,160
You just gotta read it.

626
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,560
I mean, get it.

627
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,400
You're making a scary website.

628
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,360
Yeah, I just wanna make it clear.

629
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,320
The website would be scary.

630
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,200
Oh, so scary.

631
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,400

I got a ghost in my dick.

638
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,760
It's me undies time.

639
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,240
Whoa.

640
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,960
That is their slogan.

641
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,080
I got a ghost in my dick.

642
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,880
I'll put it in my me undies to where they're very, very soft

643
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
and make fun, crazy prints.

644
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
Do you know they also make lounge pants and tees?

645
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
Well, I've been convalescing for what feels like two

646
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,800
and a half months.

647
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,960
I've been wearing these lounge pants so much

648
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,240
that they have become me.

649
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,560
Anyway, fall is here and it's the perfect time

650
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,320
to put these cozy essentials to the test.

651
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,800
I really do enjoy me undies quite a bit.

652
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,760
I tell you, I tell you, I wore them up north,

653
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,320
took a trip up north to the northern most regions

654
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,440
of Minnesota.

655
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,080
And these me undies kept my whole business area

656
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,600
completely great.

657
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,240
And they have the lounge pants.

658
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,280
Let's get back to those.

659
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,040
They are made from the same three times softer

660
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,440
than cotton micromodal fabric as their undies.

661
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,640
You can check out their latest jack-o'-lanterns print

662
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,800
in undies, socks, and bralettes.

663
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
And they got a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

664
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,920
If you don't love them, you can keep them.

665
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,560
They'll refund you.

666
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,600
It's risk-free.

667
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,680
They got a great offer for our listeners too.

668
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,320

go to meundies.com slash my brother.

That's meundies.com slash my brother.

674
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,960
I would love to tell you all, share a special message

675
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,440
with you.

676
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,200
And it is from Pops slash Fistmaster.

677
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,720
And it's for Alex, Nick, Olivia, and Jill.

678
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,520
And that's not a great start, but I'm gonna push on through.

679
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,560
Thank you for being my good, good kids.

680
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,000
I am so proud of you and love you so much.

681
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,920
The brothers make life better because they remind me of you,

682
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,000
especially the talking over each other's goose.

683
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,680
Here's to many more years of fun.

684
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,480
That's good, man.

685
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,440
Yep.

686
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,880
Got him.

687
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,120
Here's to many more years of fun and great job.

688
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,080
Sincerely, Fistmaster.

689
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,720
Fuck yeah.

690
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,880
Now, to be fair, that's not a weird nickname.

691
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,920
In the 90s, he was transported to an alternate universe

692
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,440
where he turned out to be the one spoken about in legend

693
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
and he was the Fistmaster.

694
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
Fistmaster, I've heard of him.

695
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
Trav, you wanna read this last one, please?

696
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,000
I sure do.

697
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,760
My voice sounds like a mud bubble.

698
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,960
It's from Taylor and it's for John.

699
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,000
Hi, baby.

700
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,200
Turns out your anxious baby got nervous writing this.

701
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,720
Anyway, life is a drip and I am so lucky to be

702
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,080
writing beside you.

703
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,400
You're a strong, inspirational man.

704
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,520
The very best cat daddy to our very bad beans.

705
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,120
And my best friend.

706
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,600
I can't wait to watch Peezy and Bean grow old with us.

707
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,920
I love you always and unconditionally.

708
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,920
200 mummies.

709
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,480
And then there were 200 mummies.

710
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,800
There's like 200 mummies.

711
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,640
Believe it or not, there's 200 mummies in this one.

712
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,520
Oh, shoot.

713
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,240
The secret is out.

714
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,800
I, Open Mike Eagle, officially had a wrestling match.

715
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,920
And on the next Tights and Fights, I'm talking all about it.

716
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,680
From the rap battles that got us started.

717
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,560
Open Mike, you ain't ready.

718
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,160
Oh, really?

719
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,120
Just call him.

720
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,240
Like something, forget it.

721
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,280
Into how I hurt myself in ways I didn't know I could.

722
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,480
That day and the day before, I got so many texts from people

723
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,160
who really care about me who were like,

724
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,360
please don't break your neck.

725
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,760
The only place you can get the full story is on the newest episode

726
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,520
of Tights and Fights.

727
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,960
Find it on maximumfun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

728
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,960
You know Yahoo?

729
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,960
Yeah, I'd love one.

730
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,800
This is usually the part after we come out of money zone

731
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,000
where you interrupt me a little bit.

732
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,280
Weird.

733
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,720
Nope, not on this one.

734
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,760
Sorry to, sorry to disappoint.

735
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,880
All right, so here's a Yahoo.

736
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,240
This one was sent in by Kyle.

737
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,840
Who was it from again?

738
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,760
Say it slowly this time.

739
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,280
Wait, say it slowly this time.

740
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,320
Here.

742
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,000
Folks, it's a haunted doll watch.

743
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,040
What else could it be?

744
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,680
This is coming to us from actually,

745
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,160
this is I think our first repeat seller.

746
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,480
It may be that this has happened before,

747
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,880
but this person's intro is so wild

748
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,240
that I'm happy to welcome back Lacy.

749
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,160
Here's a reminder of Lacy.

750
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,000
Today, I will share my story with you

751
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,360
so you can get to know me.

752
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,400
My name is Lacy, so feel free to call me by my name.

753
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,560
That is like a fucking like mid-90s like hip hop song.

754
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,840
Like stop what you're doing

755
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,680
because I'm about to ruin your day.

756
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm Lacy.

757
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,920
Today I'm going to share the story of a scare.

758
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,520
She's in a wonderful coven.

759
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,880
She practices the art of magic.

760
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,120
She lives in harming one,

761
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
harming none and helping all.

762
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,600
I said harming one.

763
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,160
It's okay.

764
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,760
Listen, if you get out of this life only harming one, not bad.

765
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,880
I believe in harming Beverly Fitzpatrick

766
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,360
who used to be my friend when we were in third grade.

767
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,040
She knows what she did.

768
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,560
She knows what she did, Beverly.

769
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,560
Huge capsule letters.

770
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,240
This is a tangible item.

771
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,120
Don't get it twisted.

772
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,120
And then right below that it says,

773
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,280
this is a sexual spirit meant for you.

774
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,840
Oh my God, this is not a toy.

775
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,720
Oh my God.

776
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,280
Meant for me?

777
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,720
Meant for you.

778
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,120
My brother that I'm selling a sexual ghost here.

779
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,360
Is it a fucking toy though?

780
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,240
It's not.

781
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,400
It's a tangible sexual spirit.

782
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,520
It says this is a tangible item

783
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,840
and then right below it says it's a sexual spirit.

784
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,280
And Lacy, which is it?

785
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,880
Lacy, Lacy, it can be both.

786
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,560
Justin, it's 2018.

787
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,360
Lacy, which is it?

788
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,640
People can be both tangible items and sexual spirits.

789
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,320
Today I present to you the sexual spirit of Kayla,

790
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,000
a new undiscovered Miles Davis record.

791
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
This is a highly erotic spirit.

792
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,360
If you desired a sexual spiritual connection

793
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,160
with another being, I think everybody does.

794
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,640
This spirit is meant for you.

795
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:47,280
Kayla is of, this is underlined, a very sensual spirit.

796
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,720
Yeah, oh my God, you make it so much worse with each repeated.

797
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,960
If you are not aroused by looking into her eyes,

798
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
then read no further.

799
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,680
Let me take a quick check.

800
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,840
Well, okay, hold on, wait, let's pause the podcast.

801
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,400
I'll send you all the legs.

802
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,360
Send me a JPEG, yeah.

803
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,000
Not everybody is gonna be able to continue with this.

804
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,160
We're not all gonna get through to the end of this.

805
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,680
Because some of us are gonna,

806
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,720
if we're following the directions,

807
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,600
some of us are going to have to bail.

808
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,280
But yeah, so we'll just do this.

809
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,000
If you click on the JPEG and you don't get out.

810
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,160
I would love to send you guys a glossy JPEG,

811
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,000
but new Skype is so fucking miserable that I can't even,

812
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,800
here we go.

813
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,400
There is a link to Kayla.

814
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
I am having zero erotic reaction to this, my friends.

815
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
I wish I could come with you,

816
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,280
but I'm getting, my erotometer is just in the,

817
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,960
completely in the red right now.

818
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
There's no activity.

819
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,440
It's completely fair.

820
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,760
I do wanna keep, I'm gonna keep reading

821
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
just as a public service,

822
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,160
but I think we've all established

823
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,280
this is not for any of us.

824
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,080
This is not any of our king.

825
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,880
It might just specifically be for Dan Aykroyd.

826
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,840
And I know we've already referenced him once this episode

827
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,280
and might again.

828
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,520
Yeah.

829
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,160
It just feels appropriate.

830
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,960
Well, we referenced his character in Ghostbusters.

831
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,280
But this is for Dan the man.

832
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
Dan the human man.

833
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,160
This spirit will provide you

834
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,040
with an intense sexual attachment.

835
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,440
You will feel Kayla in any room you are in.

836
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,240
I mean, after you buy her, I guess that's your right.

837
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,720
You will follow, she will follow you around.

838
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,360
She is at your beckoned call.

839
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,400
That's not.

840
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,360
That's not it.

841
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,800
That's not what you meant to say.

842
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,040
She will exist to pleasure you.

843
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,800
This is starting to yuck me out,

844
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,480
but I'm gonna push on forward.

845
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

846
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,240
It's starting to.

847
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,840
Now is the time where the yuck.

848
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Just from a power dynamics perspective,

849
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,920
like I want Kayla to be a real person.

850
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,680
And if we have a strong sexual connection,

851
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
that's like great.

852
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,880
But I also wanted her to be able to pursue

853
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,840
her other interests.

854
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
She is ready for you anytime.

855
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,480
All you have to do is call her

856
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,600
and she will be there to pleasure you.

857
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,160
Oh, no.

858
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,840
She's a doll.

859
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,720
It sucks so bad.

860
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,640
It sucks so bad that she's a little doll.

861
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,080
She will appear to you telepathically as a young woman.

862
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,320
Well, you're assuming a lot all of a sudden,

863
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,600
aren't you, Lacy?

864
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,280
Maybe that's not my fucking thing.

865
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,080
She'll be in the body of a 20-year-old.

866
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,920
She has long, dark hair.

867
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,200
She will be wearing only a long T-shirt.

868
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
I gotta say, man,

869
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
usually with these listings,

870
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,080
it's always about like,

871
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,800
it's always about like,

872
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,240
you'll feel a general sort of spirit

873
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,000
of Lacy's giving you the fucking Craigslist ad, right?

874
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Like, this is her exact description

875
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,160
and clothes guarantee.

876
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,520
It's so oddly that she'll be wearing a long T-shirt

877
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,600
with an off-brand Barton Simpson on it.

878
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,400
Right, exactly.

879
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,960
She'll be wearing just a left sock and a slat brace.

880
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
She'll be wearing a big dog T-shirt

881
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,080
she stole from your uncle.

882
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,920
She won't get the reference and neither will you.

883
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
She will be in the body of a 20-year-old.

884
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,520
She has long, dark hair.

885
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,600
She will only be wearing a long T-shirt.

886
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,280
She will fall into your arms.

887
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,040
You will catch her and feel her body brushing against you.

888
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
Well, I might catch her.

889
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,400
Maybe, I got shit to do today.

890
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,040
She only wants to satisfy you.

891
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,240
She will whisper into your ear.

892
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,680
She will speak to you in her soft voice.

893
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,400
She will nip at your neck.

894
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,840
She will be ready.

895
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,160
You will dream of Kayla often.

896
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,120
You will feel her arms around you at all times.

897
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,680
This is not a normal sexual spirit.

898
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,320
You can't just walk into any fucking Costco

899
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,280
and buy a regular sexual spirit.

900
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,120
She's not like the others.

901
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,840
She's special.

902
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,120
She's very active.

903
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,160
Artisanal.

904
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,640
She is.

905
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,280
I keep waiting.

906
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,120
I feel like there should be a twist here

907
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,200
and that's when she'll turn on you.

908
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,520
Like this is, where's the twist?

909
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,960
She's one of the more active sexual spirits in my collection.

910
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,000
So Lacy's keeping the real nasty birds back for herself,

911
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,560
you see, but she is pretty nasty.

912
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,440
Can I give it up?

913
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,000
Her only wish is to make you feel pleasure.

914
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
She is a very talkative spirit.

915
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,520
She will only speak if you desire to speak with her.

916
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
If you do want a conversation,

917
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,840
she communicates best through dousing and pendulum.

918
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,160
How's your relationship going Justin?

919
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,880
Pretty good.

920
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,160
We communicate mainly through dousing and pendulum.

921
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,520
It gets me rock hard.

922
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,600
It gets me rock hard and she's always ready

923
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,920
and she's always in the same big dog's t-shirt

924
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,120
she stole from my uncle.

925
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,440
If you're in need of a pendulum,

926
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,040
I have them available at my store.

927
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,360
Damn Lacy, you thought of everything.

928
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,960
You can view them by clicking here.

929
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,080
Can you imagine buying this sexual spirit?

930
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,400
It's like there's got to be some way we could talk.

931
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
Anyway, I can't think of anything.

932
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,960
I am a reputable seller and I have been for years,

933
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,520
which is something that reputable sellers always say

934
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,880
in my experience.

935
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,800
All my items are authentic and you will get a tangible item.

936
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,960
You'll be extremely satisfied with this purchase.

937
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,080
I combine this spirit doll to you free of charge

938
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,720
so the magic can begin working before arrival.

939
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay, so what Lacy is saying is she'll do a spell on this doll

940
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,200
to make a horny spirit fly across the country

941
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,280
and it goes faster than UPS could do it

942
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,600
because I need this sexy spirit now.

943
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,760
I will be sending a free gift along with Kayla,

944
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,320
which does not seem sinister in the slightest.

945
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,160
She's not a pendulum though.

946
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,760
You're gonna fork out for that baby?

947
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,160
She's a beautiful spirit and will make a great addition

948
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,480
to anyone's family who's open to the paranormal.

949
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,560
And I would hasten to say pretty much anything, huh, Lacy?

950
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,640
Who in reading this listing got to that line

951
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,520
and would be like, well, I'm not open to the paranormal.

952
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Like that was the deal breaker for them.

953
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,960
All caps, red text, italics, exclamation points, larger font.

954
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,480
Authentic, spirit, magical, powerful.

955
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,280
And then just when you're about to nut.

956
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,520
Per eBay's policy, I must state that I am not to be held

957
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,280
responsible for any paranormal experiences

958
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,960
that may or may not happen.

959
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,840
You're betting on a tangible.

960
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,880
All right, just when I'm about to go nuts.

961
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,720
It's like, but it could not happen.

962
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,120
I don't think that eBay,

963
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,920
I understand why Lacy has phrased it to say,

964
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,120
I'm not responsible for any paranormal occurrences

965
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,080
that may or may not happen per eBay's policy.

966
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,800
Yeah, they're taking some liberties.

967
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,200
I'm pretty sure that eBay's policy is not

968
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,040
if an item you buy on eBay has a ghost in it,

969
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,840
it's not the seller's fault.

970
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,000
Like I'm pretty sure eBay doesn't specify

971
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,480
that ghost items are not the fault of the seller.

972
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm pretty sure it's just the other one.

973
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,640
Yeah, I bought this vintage Mickey Mouse clock

974
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,760
off of your eBay site and it's haunted.

975
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,040
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

976
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,840
Per eBay's policy, ghosts attached to the item

977
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,080
are not the responsibility of the seller.

978
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,640
So I guess.

979
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,200
As always, I'd like to close this haunted dog segment

980
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,560
the way I always do by saying,

981
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,640
if you're the person at eBay that takes calls

982
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,720
about shit not being haunted enough,

983
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,200
please give us a buzz.

984
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,920
Would love to hear from you

985
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,200
even though you got the disclaimer,

986
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,120
I'm betting your phone is still ringing

987
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,480
off the proverbial hook.

988
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,120
And I would love to just touch base real quick.

989
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,080
Whatever you need a second.

990
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
Just a couple anonymous transcripts

991
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,000
from those calls would just be top notch.

992
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,120
Just so dope.

993
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,480
Real good.

994
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,360
We'll put the monster voice filter on it

995
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,440
before we put it on our podcast for sure.

996
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,960
Do you want a Yahoo?

997
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,480
Yes.

998
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,760
This one was sent in by Griffin,

999
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,640
but a different one.

1000
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,280
Thank you, Griffin.

1001
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,640
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1002
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,840
They're anonymous.

1003
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,640
I'm gonna call them.

1004
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,720
Munchie asks,

1005
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,600
Halloween prank, what would happen if I did this?

1006
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,680
Say that on Halloween night,

1007
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,760
I keep several open cans of creamed corn

1008
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,040
by my front door.

1009
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,480
And every time I get a trick or treater,

1010
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,280
I open the door,

1011
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,200
quickly dump the can of creamed corn

1012
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,240
into their bag of candy,

1013
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,240
then shut the door no words ever spoken.

1014
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,800
What would come of that?

1015
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,200
I think you'd be arrested.

1016
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,920
Why?

1017
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,400
It's definitely illegal.

1018
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:40,960
Why?

1019
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,720
Why?

1020
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,200
Huh.

1021
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,040
Because you'd be,

1022
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,040
you'd be ruining children's candy in evenings.

1023
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,640
I don't know.

1024
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,840
It's a trick, motherfucker.

1025
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,400
It's not a good one, though.

1026
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,600
It's a great one.

1027
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,960
It counteracts all the treats.

1028
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,440
It's a trick that negates every treat

1029
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,640
they've received up to that point.

1030
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,080
It's a pretty good trick.

1031
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,320
I mean, I guess.

1032
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,160
It's not the most creative.

1033
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,640
Creative.

1034
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,800
What would you do then?

1035
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,840
Really trick them?

1036
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,320
Yeah.

1037
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,840
Maybe like distract them

1038
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,600
and then swap their bag of candy

1039
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,520
for just a bag full of creamed corn.

1040
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,560
So then you get the candy.

1041
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,000
Then I get the candy.

1042
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,880
And you know what?

1043
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,120
Maybe I just leave the creamed corn in the can too

1044
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,560
and I just give them a bag

1045
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
with a can of creamed corn in it.

1046
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,600
That they'll use to just beat you to shit with.

1047
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,040
No, the door's closed.

1048
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,760
All right.

1049
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,480
They can't get me.

1050
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,840
I'm never leaving my house again.

1051
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,160
Never.

1052
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,480
I have enough candy to live off the rest of my life.

1053
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:36,960
Yeah.

1054
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,560
Enjoy the Garmin Bosia, kids.

1055
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,920
I think it'd be funny.

1056
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,480
It'd be, I mean, it'd be so bad, right?

1057
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,200
But like, I love that like bad humor.

1058
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,040
Like me, myself, Irene humor.

1059
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,000
Like that bad.

1060
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Like they shouldn't be doing that.

1061
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,800
Do you know what I mean?

1062
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,000
The raunchy stuff.

1063
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Like the super raunchy.

1064
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,200
Something about Mary when he comes.

1065
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,160
It's like so bad and it shouldn't be happening.

1066
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,600
Griffin, this one's gonna take you back.

1067
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,400
Is that hair gel?

1068
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,520
Yeah.

1069
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,440
Here's the thing.

1070
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,920
Try to let him have it.

1071
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,400
Let him go.

1072
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,840
It's me, the Crip Keeper.

1073
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,280
I wrote that joke.

1074
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,600
What?

1075
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,320
All right.

1076
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,880
Yeah, he wrote the-

1077
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,760
You did?

1078
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,920
I wrote all of something about Mary.

1079
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,120
Wow.

1080
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,560
Except I called it.

1081
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
There's something about scary.

1082
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,400
Uh-huh.

1083
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,120
Hey, Crip Keeper, that doesn't make any fucking sense, bud.

1084
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,440
There's two things about scare.

1085
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,040
Okay.

1086
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,240
All right.

1087
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,560
But it doesn't make any sense, right?

1088
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,160
I called it scare's tomb thing about scary.

1089
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,680
Yeah.

1090
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,280
We also had an extended aboot.

1091
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,360
So scare's tomb thing, aboot, scary.

1092
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,600
I think that's all of them.

1093
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,360
Scare's swamp thing, aboot, scary.

1094
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,120
It's a fucking bad podcast.

1095
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,240
People have been listening to this podcast for almost a decade.

1096
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,680
I'm just saying the hit film scare's swamp thing, aboot, scary.

1097
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:10,960
Yes.

1098
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,840
It's the perfect joke.

1099
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,640
It's a Halloween.

1100
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,240
It was a horror comedy.

1101
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

1102
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,480
With Cameron Diaz.

1103
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,960
Like, oh, shit.

1104
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,400
I did one too many, didn't I?

1105
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,880
I have too many questions to get through.

1106
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,120
I know that we barely touched on that yahoo, but I got to move on.

1107
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,520
Hey, bros.

1108
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,400
No, please.

1109
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
I never dressed up for Halloween.

1110
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,680
Super religious parents.

1111
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,480
But this year is my year.

1112
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,440
My wife and I have an invite to a Halloween party.

1113
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,320
And we also have all the components for the perfect Bob and Linda Belcher costume.

1114
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,720
The only issue is that I've had a beard for three years now.

1115
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,520
And this costume would require shaving down to just the mustache.

1116
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,320
My question, is it worth shaving away all my hard work for my first ever Halloween costume?

1117
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,480
That's from Spooky Stache in Surrey.

1118
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,280
Why don't we lightning round through these last questions?

1119
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,000
Because Justin's right.

1120
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,960
We are not going to come back to these ever.

1121
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,320
For sure, for sure, for sure.

1122
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,160
They are Halloween themed.

1123
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,200
I am going to say, probably not because it's one night out of the year and your beard is

1124
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,920
going to take you a while to get back, I think.

1125
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:24,480
Halloween costumes are about having fun and like playing dress up.

1126
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,600
They're not about, and maybe you don't know this because you haven't done it before.

1127
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,600
It's not about tricking your friends into thinking you're the beloved burger man.

1128
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,600
Like, they're not going to be fooled.

1129
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,960
They'll know it's you.

1130
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,640
So you don't have to make it a complete fabricate, a complete ruse.

1131
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,880
You don't have to be in character all night, I guess is what I'm saying.

1132
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,760
The Halloween police aren't going to send you home because you didn't do it.

1133
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,280
Now, if you're going to go compete in like some sort of Halloween competition, maybe.

1134
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,080
What's the prize?

1135
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,080
I mean, I said I was doing David S. Pumpkins earlier, but really, I'm just putting on a

1136
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,360
nice blue suit that I own.

1137
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,040
And then I'll say his favorite stuff.

1138
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,680
What's the worst laziest Halloween costume everybody here has ever done?

1139
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,760
Where it's like, still, you try to do a costume, but it's like, it's just bad.

1140
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,640
You did a bad job.

1141
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,800
I've never done a bad job.

1142
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,200
Okay.

1143
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,800
I put on a striped sweater and I said, I am Harry Potter.

1144
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,120
I broke a stick while I was on my way to the party.

1145
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,760
This is not a joke.

1146
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,880
I broke a stick off of a tree and that was my wand.

1147
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,400
It was awesome.

1148
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:31,520
I once wore a green pair of ladies sweatpants and a white dress shirt and said I was Peter Griffin.

1149
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,880
I remember that.

1150
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,960
It was not a good costume, but it was dark time for all of us.

1151
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,680
Good sweatpants.

1152
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:38,960
They were good sweatpants.

1153
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,840
See, I've done Dexter and I did a good job.

1154
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,000
I did Quailman and I did a good job.

1155
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,280
I've done Wolverine.

1156
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,520
Yes.

1157
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,000
Quailman.

1158
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,200
You know, the best thing Sid and I ever did was Phil and Lil.

1159
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,000
Those are adorable.

1160
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,560
That was good.

1161
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,760
They were good costumes.

1162
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,440
Anyway, let's move on.

1163
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,160
I hope that helps.

1164
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,360
Just keep your beard.

1165
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,560
Don't shave your beard.

1166
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,880
I work at a scare farm.

1167
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,040
Is that a pun or?

1168
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,640
Scare farm is probably like a haunted house, but more rural.

1169
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,120
Got it.

1170
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,320
Every year where I get to run around and terrify children and adults alike.

1171
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,360
But every year without fail, there are a couple of people that end up fighting

1172
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,840
rather than fleeing upon being spooked.

1173
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,800
So dope.

1174
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,360
How should I prepare myself for these situations?

1175
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,760
And what types of defense tactics should I employ

1176
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,320
when dealing with the easily scared common folk?

1177
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,280
That's from Bloodcurdling and Bruised in Branchburg.

1178
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,040
So awesome.

1179
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,480
It's so awesome.

1180
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,360
Oh, it's a mummy.

1181
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,320
A real mummy.

1182
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,040
I got him.

1183
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,760
Punch, punch, punch.

1184
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,880
Oh, shoot.

1185
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,520
That's right.

1186
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:34,800
Oh, no.

1187
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,480
That was just a 20 year old.

1188
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,200
Damn it.

1189
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,360
Do they go see Lion King on Broadway and they're like,

1190
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,520
everybody get the fuck out of here.

1191
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,080
That's a hyena.

1192
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,120
To wild animals.

1193
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,000
I've only been struck once doing some spooks.

1194
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,480
And I was doing a haunted house.

1195
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,240
So I worked with this company that set up haunted houses at people's houses.

1196
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,360
And they did it for this like seven year old's birthday

1197
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,760
that happened to be like three days before Halloween.

1198
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,560
And so it was like the same 10 kids and they all came through the party

1199
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,320
of the haunted house over and over again.

1200
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,880
And so I was just like sitting in a fake electric chair like doing like a jump scare.

1201
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,200
And this little girl just came through.

1202
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,320
I jumped, she stared at me for like five seconds

1203
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,800
and then hauled off and smacked me across the face.

1204
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,200
Whoa.

1205
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,120
And I instantly turned back into an adult and I was like, how dare you?

1206
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,800
And she like ran away.

1207
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,960
It was, and I never did a haunted house ever again after that.

1208
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,040
I guess it's a good reminder that like, you're not so tough.

1209
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,040
You may be like Mr. Scare.

1210
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,680
Oh, I see.

1211
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,520
Mr. Scare that night.

1212
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,560
But like, people will still fight.

1213
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,960
People can still fight you.

1214
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,920
I guess that's what I'm saying.

1215
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,280
So we should be careful.

1216
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:48,960
And you know what?

1217
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,040
That's also a pretty like hopeful message for humanity of like,

1218
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,320
yeah, it'll be scary when like the army of vampires attacks,

1219
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,240
but some of us will fight back.

1220
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,920
Listen, some of us will run.

1221
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,560
And as I'm sure I've discussed in this podcast before,

1222
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,440
the time I got scared by a werewolf, I did run away.

1223
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,760
And listen, I'm a runner.

1224
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,240
I get it.

1225
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,520
You have done your part, I think, in keeping these like modern day Spartans,

1226
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,280
keeping their instincts honed to a razor's edge.

1227
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,640
So when the real creature for the Black Lagoon shows up,

1228
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,480
this guy will be ready.

1229
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,080
He'll have practiced on you.

1230
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,720
So he'll be ready to save your bacon and you'll appreciate it.

1231
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,220
Yeah.

1232
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
That's what you should do is like mark them in some way

1233
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,960
and then have someone outside of the haunted house when they get out.

1234
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,640
They're just like, I see you're a fighter.

1235
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,680
Come with me, son.

1236
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,440
I'm going to recruit you to a very special like organization.

1237
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,120
You're going to help me fight monsters.

1238
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,040
But then really, you just like, I don't know,

1239
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,400
sue them for striking an employee.

1240
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,880
I want to recruit you to a very special well over here

1241
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
that I'm going to put you into because you're a dingus.

1242
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,960
Travis makes a great point.

1243
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,840
If you're being struck, that is still a crime.

1244
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,640
Like a haunted house is still a house.

1245
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,080
And in house, you can still do crime.

1246
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,560
You know what I mean?

1247
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:05,200
Like we don't suspend, we don't suspend our laws just because

1248
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,560
we're trying to LARP a little bit.

1249
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,120
You know what I mean?

1250
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,080
Why did you hit that person?

1251
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,360
Well, he was dressed like a werewolf.

1252
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,640
OK, but werewolves aren't real.

1253
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,680
So that was a guy.

1254
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,960
So it was a guy.

1255
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,400
You hit him.

1256
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,520
Please follow me to jail.

1257
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,120
This way to jail.

1258
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,480
I want to dress up for Halloween.

1259
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,560
Walk behind me, honor system.

1260
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,960
I want to dress up for Halloween, but my office at my new job

1261
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,200
doesn't seem to celebrate the holiday at all.

1262
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,840
How much of my Hogwarts uniform can I put on before it stops

1263
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,440
being business casual?

1264
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,320
That's from Bailey.

1265
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,640
I can say anecdotally, if you put on some jeans and a striped

1266
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,920
sweatshirt with a stick, people aren't going to know

1267
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,280
you're Harry Potter.

1268
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,160
So that much approximately.

1269
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,720
What if just like every time the boss walked by,

1270
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,880
you were a little more magical?

1271
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,520
Oh, I see.

1272
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,160
I like that.

1273
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,400
Yeah.

1274
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,880
So over time, the boss walks by at like four fifty five

1275
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,160
and the boss is like, have they always been Hermione?

1276
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,440
Have they always been Hermione?

1277
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,880
Where did they get the owl from?

1278
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,880
What the fuck's going on?

1279
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,000
Have you always had an owl?

1280
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,480
Yep.

1281
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,880
Hey, have you always been Voldemort?

1282
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,880
Yeah, I have always been Voldemort.

1283
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,520
You know this.

1284
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:11,920
Always.

1285
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,040
We talked about this at my quarterly review.

1286
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,520
Have you always been a ghost that lives in the bathroom?

1287
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,040
Yes, I have.

1288
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,200
Yep.

1289
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,080
There's always been a crying bathroom ghost at your office.

1290
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,240
Last one.

1291
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,440
Okay, so for Halloween, I'm going as a skeleton with a jack-o'-lantern mask.

1292
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,400
Fuck that's scary.

1293
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,240
But the onesie my mom got me is just so apparently crunchy.

1294
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,480
Like I just slightly move my arm and the fabric paint that was used

1295
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,040
to paint on the bones just crunches so loud.

1296
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,960
Did I fix this?

1297
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,280
Can I make it not so annoying?

1298
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,280
Can I try to make it sound like the crunchiness is on purpose?

1299
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,280
That's from Matt.

1300
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,000
Thank you, Matt.

1301
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,200
Matt?

1302
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,960
You just have to jump out and say like, I'm the crunchy ghost.

1303
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,920
Yeah, crunchy.

1304
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,640
You're essentially able to scare in two senses.

1305
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,600
And I think you could rub some stinky onion or blood smell on yourself.

1306
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,120
Go for a hat trick.

1307
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,280
Maybe like a bitter taste?

1308
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,480
A bitter taste, like a spray.

1309
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,800
In case anyone accidentally licks you.

1310
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,520
Or just a bitter spray that you put on people.

1311
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,920
And then what feels scary?

1312
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,000
Ooh, you could say like, trick or treat, close your eyes.

1313
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,040
I'm going to do like the egg on your head and spiders crawling up your back.

1314
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,720
Spiders crawling down your back.

1315
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,200
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

1316
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,480
Thank you so much for joining us.

1317
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,320
We hope you're going to have a very spooky Halloween time.

1318
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,120
And a safe Halloween time.

1319
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,760
Next week.

1320
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,560
We definitely have an episode that's going to go out before Halloween.

1321
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,480
Oh.

1322
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,040
Travis.

1323
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,720
Why is this a Halloween?

1324
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,120
You know what, timing wise, I guess you're right.

1325
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,120
I wanted to have more of a build up to it.

1326
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,680
So people could listen to this over and over again.

1327
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,120
We definitely can't do another Halloween episode on the 29th.

1328
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,400
You know what you've condemned us to?

1329
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,160
We have to do a Christmas episode next week.

1330
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,080
That's what you've done.

1331
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,040
How could you do this?

1332
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,040
That literally just occurred to me for the first time, as I'm saying it.

1333
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,000
I know, it's astonishing.

1334
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,480
It actually occurred to me yesterday and I still went ahead with it.

1335
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,000
Because I've already gotten the questions ready.

1336
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,480
You monstrous.

1337
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,280
Yes, thank you so much for listening.

1338
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,320
Happy Halloween.

1339
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:24,960
Yeah, I guess so.

1340
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,160
In 10 days.

1341
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,480
Yeah, if you want to be the hit of the neighborhood, you should go to Amazon

1342
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,040
and buy enough copies of the Sawbones book to give to all the different trick or traders

1343
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,840
that are going to show up.

1344
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,480
I'd really appreciate it if you buy that.

1345
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,560
And if you already buy it, please review it.

1346
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,680
My wife, Sydney McElroy, and I worked really hard on it.

1347
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,360
And we hope you really enjoy it.

1348
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:57,120
And also go ahead and go to theadventurezonecomic.com and pre-order the second book.

1349
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,080
Enough copies to give next Halloween.

1350
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,800
For that second book of the graphic novel, Murder on the Rockport Limited.

1351
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:05,920
It's great.

1352
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,560
And we think you're going to love it.

1353
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,880
This isn't a plug, but just wanted to remind everyone that election day is November 6th.

1354
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,400
Please get out and vote.

1355
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,440
You can get an absentee ballot or vote by mail.

1356
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,880
There's also, like, I think Lyft and Uber are running deals where they will get you

1357
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,800
to the polling place and back.

1358
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,400
And there's a lot of different options.

1359
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,760
So please get out and vote.

1360
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,120
Vote or die.

1361
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,480
Remember that, guys?

1362
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,840
Do you remember that?

1363
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,560
Damn.

1364
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,080
He was like, here's your two choices.

1365
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,760
You can vote or you can die.

1366
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,880
Why was that the name of the thing, huh?

1367
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,960
Yeah, it's a good question.

1368
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,640
Do you guys want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

1369
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,320
instead of part drop the album putting the days to bed?

1370
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,040
Yeah, thank you.

1371
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,760
Absolutely.

1372
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,560
Check out all the other amazing shows on MaximumFun.org.

1373
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:59,360
Oh, also, I think Sawbones has a book signing coming up on the 27th in Charleston at Books

1374
00:56:59,360 --> 00:56:59,760
a Million.

1375
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,840
Yeah, it's the Dudley Farms Plaza Books a Million.

1376
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,560
If you want to get your book signed or whatever signed, you just got to buy a copy of the book

1377
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
on the day of at that locale.

1378
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,600
I am such a dummy.

1379
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,640
We almost forgot.

1380
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,480
So we're starting a macro day newsletter.

1381
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:12,800
Thank you.

1382
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,360
Oh, yes.

1383
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,920
Yes.

1384
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,200
Because we keep having more and more stuff that we're working on.

1385
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,800
And stuff falls through the cracks and we don't want it to end up being like a 10 minute plug

1386
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,000
at the end of every episode.

1387
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,720
So if you go to bit.ly slash McElroy Mail, M-A-I-L, and I don't know why I keep feeling

1388
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,480
the need to clarify that, but McElroy Mail, you can sign up for that newsletter and you'll

1389
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:41,200
get a lot of information that you'll only see there, including the date and link and

1390
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,440
stuff for the Candle Night Show.

1391
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,000
I'm sure we'll announce it later, but you'll see it first in the newsletter.

1392
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,680
So if you go to bit.ly slash McElroy Mail, you can sign up for it.

1393
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,320
And it's not a pyramid scheme, even though people keep talking about that.

1394
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,960
I don't know where that got started, but it is not a pyramid scheme.

1395
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,960
It's just a regular mailing list that's not in any way, shape, or form a pyramid scheme.

1396
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,920
Here's that final sent in by Michelle.

1397
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,640
Thank you, Michelle.

1398
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,920
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1399
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,600
Come on, load.

1400
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,100
Load.

1401
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,260
Load.

1402
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,020
Damn it.

1403
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,640
It's from Yahoo Answers.

1404
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,320
No, it's from Yahoo Answers user.

1405
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,360
I'll call him Cedric.

1406
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,640
Cedric asks, does Oscar the Grouch have legs?

1407
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,960
And furthermore, a ding-a-ling.

1408
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1409
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,080
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1410
00:58:42,080 --> 00:59:11,120
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1411
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,280
One, two, one, two, three, four.

1412
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,760
Hi, everybody.

1413
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,440
My name is Justin McElroy.

1414
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,560
And I'm Sydney McElroy.

1415
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,560
And together, we're the hosts of Sawbones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

1416
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,280
What does that mean for you, the podcast consumer?

1417
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,720
Well, it means that you're going to get a lot of stories about how we used to do

1418
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,760
weird stuff to people in order to try to fix them.

1419
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,280
Do you know that we used to think diseases were caused by bad smells

1420
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,720
and that we used to eat mummies for medicine?

1421
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,640
That's super funny.

1422
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,560
I kind of like it.

1423
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,200
Well, thanks.

1424
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,520
And we hope you'll kind of like our show,

1425
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,640
Sawbones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

1426
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,560

1427

1429
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,000
All right.

1430
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah.
