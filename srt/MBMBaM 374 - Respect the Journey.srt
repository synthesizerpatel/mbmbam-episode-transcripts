1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,720
era, as if we never left. It's your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. It's your middle-est

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,720
brother and responsible homeowner, Travis McElroy. It's your sweet baby brother and 30

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,480
under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy, and I do just need to point out that we did leave

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,200
for like a month. We left for a grip. So long as we've gone without recording

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
on My Brother, My Brother, and Me since April 2010 when the show launched, I believe.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,120
And there are a lot of reasons for that. Travis is now a proud homeowner,

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:25,440
and I'm very excited about that. I had diarrhea for like two weeks, and I died on the Oregon trail,

13
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:37,840
and Justin's just been exploring his body. I finally got my middle school body,

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,040
and I'm exploring all the different hair that I have now. Just so everybody knows,

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,760
as we're doing more live shows and stuff, the situation going forward will not be that we'll

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,200
just dump them all at once. We did hope to keep some of this in the coffer. It's just life gets

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,440
in the way. It was literally a bad situation for a month.

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,760
Just a bad situation. So we're here with you now. I wanted to tell some exciting news.

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,840
This past weekend at the Charleston West Virginia Clay Center for Performing Arts,

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:21,760
I saw PJ Masks' live stage show live in concert. Is PJ Masks one person?

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,440
Good question. I don't know anything about what you're saying.

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,720
PJ Masks is a superhero team. This is a show on Disney Junior. PJ Masks is a superhero team

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:43,680
of three kids. Catboy, there's Gekko, and there's Owlette. They are regular kids who,

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,360
in the nighttime, transform into superheroes via their magical pajamas.

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Okay, so this teaches kids like, don't go to sleep. Party all night. You get superpowers.

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Go out and fight crime. Don't worry about going to sleep, little baby. Get on out there.

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Now, Justin, this is all new to me. This is a very important question I have.

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,720
These kids, when they fight crime, is the crime like, we lost the basketball. Where is it? Or is

29
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,720
it like, somebody's been kidnapped and we gotta go beat up some bad guys?

30
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,280
And follow up question, do they have a sort of self-imposed Batman-esque moral code where

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,440
they do not kill the bad guys? Good question. They only punch and beat them up very badly, but

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,280
the PJ Masks kids never kill. How many people do they hang off the sides of buildings?

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,160
Important question, all. So PJ Masks, you two have hit upon, I think,

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,360
the most interesting parts of bringing PJ Masks live to the stage.

35
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,080
They do kill. They do kill, huh? They don't actually usually do anything.

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,440
The PJ Masks have superheroes, but of course there's never any punching, right?

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,960
When you bring this, this is a show where the episodes, of course, are like

38
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,800
like any kids show, they're like, you know, 11 minutes long. 45 seconds long, yeah.

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah, it's like 11 minutes long. This fucking show kicked off at

40
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,280
3 p.m. and they can't do any- They can't do anything.

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
They can't do anything. They can't fight.

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,000
They have, their costumes have, it's like 20-somethings playing the kids,

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
but their costumes have these large misshapen heads to replicate the experience of

44
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
them being kids, I guess, to give them that kid look.

45
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,960
And they can't do, like there's no pyrotechnics, there's no flying, obviously.

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,480
So Owlette just sort of like runs around with her wings.

47
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,920
And like literally half the things in this show were her flapping her wings so hard

48
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,920
that she blew bad people off the stage. Gekko, who has super strength,

49
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,440
as near as I can tell, only uses super strength to strike things from the stage

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,560
that no longer needed to be included in the episode.

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
It was Gekko wearing a black turtleneck and black slacks,

52
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
and was he maybe just the stage manager?

53
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,960
And he took lots of breaks and came back smelling like cigarettes.

54
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,040
Gekko, there's another one with the sticky splats, and he would pick it up

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,920
and he would throw it stage right just to keep the show,

56
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
we just have to keep the action moving.

57
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,000
And- Well, he couldn't do more than that, he's Union.

58
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,760
The three villains like claimed a playground for their own,

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,160
and the PJ Masks were like not down with that.

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
And then the villains decided that they should team up for once.

61
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,480
Thank you for finally realizing that.

62
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,640
And their first order of business was to steal the PJ Masks headquarters,

63
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
which seems like a pretty big ass for your first show.

64
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a good crime.

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah, it's a really good crime.

66
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
Anyway, they can't attack each other, literally they can't.

67
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,240
And there's no like things moving on the stage

68
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
because it's a pretty simple touring production.

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,960
So it's literally just kids like running around and flapping wings

70
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
and then throwing things off the stage.

71
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,920
It got to be 350 and there was a magnificent battle

72
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,720
by which I mean Catboy ran around in circles

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,920
and Owlf flapped her wings at people and Gekko struck the stage.

74
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,840
Climactic battle between the three and then the lights went down

75
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
and a voice said,

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,480
all right, kids, we're gonna take a 20 minute intermission

77
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,760
and then we'll be back.

78
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Are you fu- How could there be more?

79
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,760
They were tearing chairs in half, they were ripping nameplates off.

80
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm sorry, Dr. Robert Lingan who bought this chair.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Gave his life for this theater.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,840
A beam fell on him, we love him.

83
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,920
A kid is just eating the carpet.

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,240
They run us, they go us.

85
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,960
This motherfucker was literally an hour and 45 minutes long.

86
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,680
This show barely maintains its narrative momentum for 11 minutes

87
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,920
and you're gonna stretch this shit over an hour and 45 minutes long.

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,280
The last- How many parents do you think, Justin,

89
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,600
like the kids went out into the lobby

90
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,880
and the kids are like, what's going on?

91
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
And the parents like, that's the end.

92
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,600
Intermission's a fancy word for it's done.

93
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,320
It's Latin for go on home, Jeremy.

94
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,120
I will say at least one third of this podcast tried it.

95
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,080
For sure, for sure.

96
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, we're done, sweetie.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,920
And here's, and get this, because it's like a fancy schmancy place,

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,720
you can't bring drinks or snacks into the theater.

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,880
So what you had was kids had been bought sodas,

100
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
were told they couldn't bring them into the theater

101
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,240
and then just stood outside before act two,

102
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,960
just pounding soda and sugar

103
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
and then putting them back in for act two.

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,640
By the end of this show, the mass exodus and hysteria

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,760
was as if the PJ Masks had suddenly started doing

106
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,080
like deeply racist material.

107
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,680
Just like shouting at people, people walking out,

108
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,880
kids just like, one kid had a conch shell

109
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,400
and another kid killed him for it.

110
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,560
It was fucking pandemonium.

111
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,440
And what kills me is like,

112
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,440
who did you make this two hours for?

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,960
Who was your target in making this a two hour long production?

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
Because it certainly wasn't the parents.

115
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
I could have showed up and just taken a picture with the PJ Masks

116
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,040
and feel like I had done my duty.

117
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,840
It wasn't the kids, they want this shit to be 15 minutes long

118
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,200
and that's barely, like that's hanging by a thread

119
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,560
and you're gonna make it two hours long.

120
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,160
It's for the performers, Justin,

121
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,240
so they can really stretch their chops.

122
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,280
Who is Catboy?

123
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,600
It may be the only time they let them off the bus,

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,840
so maybe it's like a humanitarian thing.

125
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,200
Like we do have to give them two hours.

126
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
You watch them walk up the stage,

127
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
they do the curtain call, they do a bow

128
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
and then as they're walking off the stage,

129
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
you can actually see them putting the shackles

130
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
back around their neck.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,840
As the sheep dogs start herding them.

132
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,800
Yep, yep, back on the bus, yep, back on the bus, yep.

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,360
Anyway, PJ Masks were pretty good.

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,400
This is, as you've almost certainly guessed by now,

135
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,080
this is an advice show where we take your questions

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

137
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,400
Again, really sorry about the absence.

138
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
It's not gonna be a recurring thing,

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,680
it's just been a rough.

140
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
I hear it makes the heart grow fonder.

141
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,720
And it makes the download counts go down,

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
much very down, very, very down.

143
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
So please download the show a bunch of times,

144
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,440
tell your friends.

145
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,280
I recently attended a symposium at a large opera house

146
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,240
in Denver.

147
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,560
As the lights dimmed and the PJ Masks began

148
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,800
to take the stage, I heard an odd scrubbing sound

149
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
on my left and turn to see the person next to me

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,960
was brushing her teeth.

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,400
She was using a full-sized toothbrush

152
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,800
with no toothpaste that I could see

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,520
and she was brushing very actively.

154
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,480
Well, you got to.

155
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
And making a lot of noise.

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,040
After a few minutes, she threw her toothbrush loose

157
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,240
into her purse, turned to me and said,

158
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
I really thought I was late to this,

159
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
but I guess I was just on time.

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
I was speechless and I just stared at her.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,520
What would have been the appropriate response

162
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,160
to this heinous opera crime?

163
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
This is, is there an appropriate time for you

164
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,960
to brush your teeth at an opera house?

165
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
If you had gotten there early, does that justify it?

166
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
Certainly being on time or late,

167
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,880
neither of those is acceptable.

168
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,360
Toothbrushing like, oh, oh, sorry, excuse me,

169
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,800
excuse me, what did I miss?

170
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

171
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
It's not a time thing, it's a place thing

172
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
because you can't brush your teeth at the opera

173
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,280
or outside of your house bathroom only.

174
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,440
I would also, I would pause it

175
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
that while all of this is very upsetting,

176
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm in some ways very glad she was brushing very actively

177
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,400
because I think it would be way stranger

178
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,440
if she was brushing very lackadaisically.

179
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,920
Yeah, sure.

180
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
Very lazily brushing, just shh, shh.

181
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,400
Yeah, gingivitis ain't nothing to fuck with

182
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,640
and I get that and if you're gonna go to town,

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
if you're gonna brush your teeth in public,

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,280
you may as well get the job done.

185
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,600
If you're gonna go to town, you may as well go into Lincoln.

186
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
I get it, but I don't get it

187
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
because you're outside your house bathroom

188
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
and that's where the toothbrush lives.

189
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
I think toothbrushes should have

190
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
those little electric dog collars on them,

191
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
but facing outwards or if you do try

192
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
to leave your house bathroom for it.

193
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
I see people in the bathroom at the airport

194
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,160
brushing their teeth and it's like,

195
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,840
you couldn't wait, maybe the big job interview, maybe, okay.

196
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Those might be midnight riders though, Griffin.

197
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,880
Those people might-

198
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
You get a red eye, that can feel pretty humanizing.

199
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,920
They've only touched ground twice in a month.

200
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
You should have to get a permit from,

201
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,840
I had to do the TSA pre-check

202
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,920
and I think there should also be a TSA toothbrush okay

203
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,800
outside the airport, go for a free hall pass.

204
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,840
It's a cloak, right?

205
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
It's definitely a cloak.

206
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
You caught me, it's a Buckwild cloak,

207
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,240
but it's a cloak all the same.

208
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,840
You caught me brushing my teeth in this room

209
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,000
and that's how late I was.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,680
That's what a rush I was in

211
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,280
that I couldn't brush my teeth at home,

212
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
so I had to brush them.

213
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,840
You're suggesting they always carry a toothbrush

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
so that if they're late for a thing

215
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,800
they run into the big meeting like, shh, shh, shh.

216
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
Sorry guys, it's one of those mornings,

217
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
my fucking kid stole my car.

218
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,760
No, I'm in no way suggesting what you're saying.

219
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,520
That's a good strat.

220
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,400
You've done it again.

221
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
That's a pro strat, I'm very into that.

222
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,480
Bring Mr. Matthews, you're late for first period again.

223
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Shiki, shiki, shiki.

224
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,960
I know man, fucking, the little one stole my car again

225
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,560
and my backpack died.

226
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,440
I think this is what I, okay,

227
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
because I think this falls in the same category.

228
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
You remember in cartoons and TV shows

229
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
to signify someone was late,

230
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,960
they had like an electric razor in the car?

231
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,080
Yeah.

232
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,800
Has anyone ever fucking really done that?

233
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,120
Probably.

234
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,360
If I was driving and I looked over

235
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,280
and saw somebody in the car to my left shaving their,

236
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,360
I would park by the side of the road

237
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,400
and wait half an hour to make sure that person was gone.

238
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
Citizen's arrest, absolutely.

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
I do have to pause it.

240
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,040
There is a possibility, I think,

241
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,080
and hopefully this will help guide you.

242
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,760
There's a possibility I think that this person maybe,

243
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
we don't know their journey,

244
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
but perhaps they are living with obsessive compulsive disorder,

245
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,640
in which case excessive grooming, as I understand,

246
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
can be a component of that.

247
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,280
Sure.

248
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
And in which case, I would say,

249
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,720
maybe just let people have their fucking journey.

250
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,920
You know what I mean?

251
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,000
When you see people who are doing things

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,120
a little bit out of the norm,

253
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
maybe just what you gotta start thinking is like-

254
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,840
Respect the journey.

255
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
Respect that journey.

256
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,400
2018, respect the journey.

257
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,160
Okay, I can get behind that.

258
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,120
I do want to say though,

259
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,720
the one element of this though to go against that

260
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,080
was just throwing the toothbrush loose in the purse.

261
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,600
Yeah, that's probably, I don't know.

262
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
If this person did this on a regular basis,

263
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
they would have like-

264
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,400
A special thing that they could travel.

265
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,680
A travel case would make sense.

266
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,480
A holster.

267
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,720
Yeah.

268
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,320
Yeah.

269
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
Like a bandolier like John Popper has of harmonicas

270
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,400
with toothbrushes just-

271
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm not trying to project obsessive compulsive disorder

272
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,360
onto this person.

273
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,640
What I'm saying is like,

274
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,520
if you listening at home, if that's your fucking journey,

275
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,800
own your journey.

276
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,360
Respect the journey.

277
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,080
Damn, that's good.

278
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,440
How about a Yahoo?

279
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,480
Okay.

280
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,280
This Yahoo was sent in by the deliveryman Seth Carlson.

281
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,760
Thank you, Seth.

282
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,520
It's the Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

283
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,120
We're gonna call him Marcus asks,

284
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,040
is it awkward for actors and actresses to do kissing scenes?

285
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,880
Oh, the kissing scene though.

286
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,920
Oh, no.

287
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,720
Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, last day of shooting.

288
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
You had me at hello.

289
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,640
Happy New Year's.

290
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,520
Get over here.

291
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,160
And then they put their faces close

292
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,280
and Billy kind of grimaces and Meg looks a little,

293
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,760
she starts sweating and the director's like,

294
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,920
stop, you did such a good job delivering the lines,

295
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,520
but where's the smooch?

296
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,480
Real quick side journey.

297
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,080
Can I tell you why when Harry Met Sally

298
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,960
is a fucked up movie?

299
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,280
I mean, I guess so.

300
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,360
As long as it doesn't derail the great momentum

301
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,080
I was building there.

302
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,760
Now we'll come right back to your momentum.

303
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,800
Pin momentum.

304
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,520
Not how momentum works.

305
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,680
Pin momentum pinned.

306
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,880
In when Harry Met Sally, at the beginning of the movie,

307
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
Harry posits that men and women can't be friends

308
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,080
without wanting to sleep together.

309
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,560
And then Harry and Sally become friends

310
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,280
and then they sleep together and enter a romantic relationship.

311
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,600
Incorrect, because their friendship takes on new levels

312
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,640
and depth and spice over time

313
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,040
when they are no longer lovers.

314
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,280
Their friendship persists despite the fact

315
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,720
that they are no longer lovers.

316
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,920
And that is what is so beautiful

317
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
about the story of when Harry Met Sally.

318
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,600
You missed the whole point.

319
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
But then they end up in a romantic relationship, Justin.

320
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,400
No, Travis, I'm sorry, you burnt.

321
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,040
Moving on to the next Rob Reiner film, North.

322
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,520
Now, okay, so mistakes were made.

323
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
They probably lean in, Billy and Meg,

324
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,800
and it's just like, it was always you, kid,

325
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,280
and then you lean in and then they just start laughing

326
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,320
because it's funny.

327
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
This is a stranger.

328
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
I've worked along Billy for a few months now

329
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,760
while we've made this romantic film.

330
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,200
Wait, you, Griffin?

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,280
Yeah, I've worked, I mean, we did some work together

332
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,440
and we did have that one very passionate kiss

333
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
in City Slickers 1.

334
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,480
And I just leaned into Billy, lips a puckered,

335
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,400
and I was ready because I keep it professional.

336
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,640
I wanted to get the job done, go back to my trailer,

337
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,320
and I just leaned in and me and Billy

338
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,560
just started just corpsing right there.

339
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,840
Couldn't stop cackling because it's funny.

340
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,080
I don't know you, but we have to kiss?

341
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
What a weird job this is.

342
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,280
You know what I bet is also weird

343
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,360
when it happens in the smooching scenes?

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,840
Like you've been doing the scene, right?

345
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,360
And it's like, oh, it's so dramatic.

346
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,040
Oh, the passion, I can feel it.

347
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,520
And then they go into kiss and it's just like, meh.

348
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,080
You know what I mean?

349
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,640
Like, they just kiss weird.

350
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,760
Definitely, there's got to be actors who's bad kissing.

351
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,400
Who's bad kissing.

352
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,280
Right, and it's just like, and you're the director, right?

353
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
And maybe you're also like, well, you're not a tourist.

354
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,600
You're the director, maybe director of photography too.

355
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
You did it all, you wrote the script,

356
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,680
and you're watching it and you're like, yes, yes,

357
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,160
this is it.

358
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,520
And then they just kind of like do that thing

359
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,040
where it's like, they just kind of catch the corner

360
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,120
of each other's mouths and maybe their noses bump

361
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,400
and you're like, oh.

362
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
Now what you don't realize, a lot of these movies these days,

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
they just get Andy Serkis in there.

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,040
So for instance, Ashton Kutcher doesn't know,

365
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,040
never learned how to kiss, never really did it.

366
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,480
And so in 70s show and in Fuck Buddies

367
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
and his great show, The Ranch that everybody loves

368
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,560
on Netflix, anytime he has to do a kiss scene,

369
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,520
a two and a half man, the later college years,

370
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,000
just Andy Serkis, they would call cut, one frame,

371
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,600
you would look over and be like,

372
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,880
did he get a little bit shorter?

373
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
And also did you get a complete digital recreation

374
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
of A plus K?

375
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,680
And now they have the technology

376
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,000
that they can have Andy Serkis kiss Andy Serkis.

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,680
And he's good at it, he's good at kissing himself.

378
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,880
And a lot of people don't know this,

379
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,800
but their racist pistachio commercial,

380
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,080
that was Andy, that was Andy doing Ashton.

381
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,360
So it's time to forgive, I think it was Andy doing Ashton.

382
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,120
I think there is very little more pleasurable to me

383
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,520
than the idea of Ashton's about to kiss his leading lady

384
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,440
and then cut so Ashton can go put on

385
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,800
his crazy black lycra suit with the white balls all over it

386
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,560
just to make sure we get the capture

387
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
exactly right for the body.

388
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,320
And then Andy Serkis is looking over his shoulder

389
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,160
with a smaller black lycra on his face that is mapped

390
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,800
and he's sort of modeling the actions.

391
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,040
So it's Ashton's body being captured,

392
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,080
but Andy Serkis' face handling the actual smooch.

393
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
And he just, he parts his lips

394
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,920
the scientifically perfect number of millimeter.

395
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,440
Like it is mouth moisture, perfect moisture,

396
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
and Andy Serkis' perfect CGI mouth.

397
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,560
And the nice thing about it

398
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,080
is that it leaves Ashton's face available

399
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
so that he can tweet with his nose.

400
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
He has his assistant reach up

401
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
and lets him peck out a couple of good ones on there.

402
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,960
And they just put the iPad

403
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
right in front of the person's face too.

404
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
So you know what, here's the thing.

405
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
If you're on set, you look at it and you're like,

406
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
I don't see how this would ever come together.

407
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,400
And really who this comes down to, it's those techs.

408
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,000
You know, and this is why I'm saying

409
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
we have to keep the technical Oscars going.

410
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,440
We have to keep them going.

411
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,360
Respect the techs, respect the journey.

412
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,280
I think that Andy Serkis

413
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
basically has been troned at this point.

414
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,200
I think he has been transcendent at this point.

415
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
And I think he is entirely a digital construct

416
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
at this point to discuss.

417
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,460
Yes.

418
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
Do you think that the greatest technical achievement

419
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,720
in the 2018 Oscars will be if they can recreate

420
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,200
the Wild Things three-way kiss all Andy Serkis?

421
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,320
All Andy Serkis?

422
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,080
Justin, how about another question?

423
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

424
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
So I got a new joke.

425
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,440
Just a full remake of The Notebook

426
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
with him playing both roles.

427
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,720
If you're a bird, I'm a bird.

428
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm Andy Serkis.

429
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,480
He's playing young and old both sets.

430
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,160
Let's die at the same time.

431
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm Andy Serkis.

432
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,560
His Benjamin Button was really good

433
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,200
because it's like, this is the easiest gig I've ever had.

434
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,040
Do it around me.

435
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,920
In some ways, it's actually kind of sad

436
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,200
because Andy Serkis has single-handedly put out of work

437
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,720
every actor in the world.

438
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,920
Yeah, it's just him.

439
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,480
Because he has lawnmower manned himself throughout all of-

440
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,920
Lawnmower man, it's a great example.

441
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,960
I should have used earlier.

442
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,640
Justin, how about another question?

443
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
Here's looking at you, Andy.

444
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,040
Thank you, Andy.

445
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,000
Very kind.

446
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,720
And the Oscar for best actor goes to me again.

447
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,520
Thank you, me.

448
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,720
You're welcome, Andy.

449
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,600
I'd like to thank all of me.

450
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,640
Do you motherfuckers remember

451
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,680
when Gollum presented an Oscar at the Oscars?

452
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,720
Oh shit, dude.

453
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,280
That actually did life beat us to that joke.

454
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,440
How are we all not always talking about the fact

455
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,760
that Gollum presented at the Oscars?

456
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,680
How is that not our every day?

457
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,600
Somebody watched the Kids' Choice Awards

458
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
and saw Bart Simpson give one out

459
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,080
and said, I'd like to do that

460
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,920
for the highest acting honor in the land.

461
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,680
Has Shrek and Donkey presented at the-

462
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,000
Shrek and Donkey have definitely done that.

463
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Shrek at the Vibe Awards was a kind of a landmark moment.

464
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,280
So I got a new job.

465
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,080
I got a new job fucking Andy Serkis.

466
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm keeping all the Cable-Ace Awards this year.

467
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,200
I've got a new job,

468
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
but it's been an excellent transition so far.

469
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,160
The pay is better.

470
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,520
It's a 20 minute commute

471
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
and my favorite restaurant is down the street.

472
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,040
There's just this one little thing.

473
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,520
My new boss is a really nice, fun guy

474
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,880
who I mostly get along with,

475
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
except it came up in conversation

476
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
that I had been mugged

477
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,440
and he thought that was the funniest thing in the world.

478
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
So he keeps popping out at me

479
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
and shouting, ah, don't get jacked

480
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,200
and running up behind me,

481
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
telling me to stick him up and give me the goods.

482
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,760
It's alarming to say the least.

483
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
What should I do, boyos?

484
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,840
That's from Just A Cool Kid Employed Dangerously.

485
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,600
That ain't good.

486
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,080
That sucks in a major way

487
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,040
because that shit will fuck you up, man.

488
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,400
Like, that's no good.

489
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,360
That's a really bad.

490
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
That's a, that is a,

491
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,840
I mean, it sounds like you enjoy it.

492
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
I get, oh, it says alarming.

493
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,560
I thought it said amazing.

494
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,080
Okay, so it's alarming to say the least.

495
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,960
Yeah, it's not good.

496
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,160
It's a bad behavior.

497
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,640
I think the good solution for this

498
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
is next time he tries it,

499
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
throw him your wallet and piss your pants.

500
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,760
I thought you were going to say

501
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
what I was going to say when you said throw

502
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,360
because I was going to say like throw him,

503
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,480
like judo throw him.

504
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,520
In fact, I'm so sorry.

505
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,360
I've trained myself as a human weapon

506
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,000
so that this could never happen again.

507
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,680
I actually like Justin's better.

508
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,840
Or just throw him into a garbage can

509
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,160
where it sounds like maybe he belongs,

510
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,720
which is right there in the garbage.

511
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,440
But he's a nice, fun guy, Griffin.

512
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,680
My impulse is to tell people

513
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,200
something we've been kind of on,

514
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,920
I think since about 350 or so,

515
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,480
which is like, just fucking tell him.

516
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,760
Don't do that.

517
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
But when I realized that,

518
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,040
when I realized you'd be telling your boss like,

519
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,560
hey, don't mug me,

520
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,720
which you shouldn't have to tell people

521
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,840
not to mug you.

522
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
Can you pay your dad to dress up as Batman

523
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,760
and hide in the ceiling tiles?

524
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,520
Because I think just one time of him pulling this

525
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,840
and then your dad falls through the ceiling

526
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,360
with like that triumphant Tim Burton music behind him

527
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
and just like takes your boss out.

528
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,080
Yeah.

529
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,040
I feel like that would be-

530
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,800
Sorry, false alarm.

531
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,080
Sorry, but it's hard to discern.

532
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,320
My computer algorithm doesn't catch sarcastic mugging.

533
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
I've been sensing a lot of muggings in this area of late.

534
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,960
Because who does that?

535
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,400
Who does sarcastic mugging?

536
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
You fucking jag.

537
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,760
I'm Batman.

538
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,560
I cuss now.

539
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,360
Now get back to collating or whatever.

540
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,920
Bye.

541
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
I've never worked a real job.

542
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,760
Could you actually bring a smoke bomb with you?

543
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Could you actually bring a smoke bomb with you?

544
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,080
So your boss goes to mug you and you're like,

545
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
oh yeah, let me just grab this out of my...

546
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,720
Done.

547
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,280
Gone.

548
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,000
Where is he?

549
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,040
He's not working today.

550
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,920
That's for sure.

551
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,640
And why?

552
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,080
Because you tried to mug him.

553
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,880
So good luck explaining that to the higher ups.

554
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,800
Why Dylan isn't at work today.

555
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,080
Because I tried to mug him.

556
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,120
Or talk to HR.

557
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
That should be another go-to piece of advice

558
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,640
that we start incorporating,

559
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
which is there's a fucking...

560
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,520
There's a person you talk to

561
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,000
about complicated social stuff like this.

562
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Okay.

563
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:18,880
Okay.

564
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,840
Yes, Griffin.

565
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,240
But like that implies that there's a way

566
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,760
to handle this anonymously.

567
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,800
So you go to HR and they send out a company-wide email.

568
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,000
We've had some issue with fake mugging

569
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,560
in the office of if you know anybody

570
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
that has done fake mugging on Dylan.

571
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,120
No specific examples.

572
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,400
We've just heard there's been a bit of a trend.

573
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,440
Yeah.

574
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,200
It's kind of caught on lately.

575
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,360
You may have been reading some headlines recently

576
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,600
about fake muggings in the office.

577
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,040
Just want to let you know this behavior

578
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,160
that will not be tolerated is against our corporate spirit.

579
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,320
Should we go to the money zone?

580
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,920
I forget how to get there, Griffin.

581
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,480
Show me the way.

582
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,520
It's just the seconds.

583
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,040
Okay.

584
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,680
We'll do your thing.

585
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,760
I was going to do like a second star on the right

586
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,160
and fly straight to home.

587
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,360
No, please keep going.

588
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,240
I thought my favorite...

589
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,920
It's one of my favorite stick songs.

590
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,160
Show me the way.

591
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,480
Show me the...

592
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,200
Oh, you know what?

593
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,800
You know why I know that song by heart

594
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,720
is because one time at Christian camp,

595
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,960
we had to choreograph a song to it about Jesus.

596
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,840
Oh!

597
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,040
Oh, really?

598
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,080
Oh, yeah.

599
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,120
Oh, really?

600
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,640
It was a pantomime to that Stix's show me the way

601
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
except there was a Jesus and they...

602
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,120
There was a Jesus.

603
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
And they seem very proud of themselves

604
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,720
for using secular music.

605
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
Like, you know, like you kids like Stix.

606
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,040
Oh, was this like the guy who did the Weird Al style parody

607
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,920
of walking in Memphis, but walking with Jesus?

608
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,360
Walking with Jesus.

609
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,920
I don't think Weird Al works with that particular palette.

610
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,480
I don't think that's a color that he paints with.

611
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,200
Did we already talk about walking with Jesus?

612
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,240
Definitely no.

613
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,200
It had the worst perversion,

614
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,360
like the worst parody perversion of a line.

615
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,320
I've never heard my entire life.

616
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,080
I guess parody is not technically accurate,

617
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,560
but anyway, repurposed secular music

618
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,240
for Christianity's purposes.

619
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,800
This cat put in this lyric.

620
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,160
She said,

621
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,440
Son, are you a Christian child? And I said,

622
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,600
Ma'am, I am for life.

623
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,240
Can you not?

624
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,680
Can you not ruin one of the best fucking lines in any song

625
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,160
with that, like, that's please.

626
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,120
So here come those commercials.

627
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:49,440
My Brother, My Brother, Me is sponsored in part by Casper,

628
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,160
which is an online retailer of premium,

629
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,320
obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction of the price.

630
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,000
We have a Casper in our home.

631
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
Travis, do you sleep on a Casper?

632
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,200
I do.

633
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,320
I actually have two.

634
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,080
I got Casper in the guest room and a Casper in my bedroom.

635
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,920
Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

636
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
You can try sleeping on one for a hundred days.

637
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,360
And if you don't like it, there's painless returns,

638
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
but you're gonna like it.

639
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,320
And Casper mattresses feature supportive memory foam

640
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,840
for a sleep surface that's got just the right sink

641
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,280
and just the right bounce.

642
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
And they're already really affordable,

643
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,640
but, but, but they get even more affordable

644
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,160
if you're a listener of ours.

645
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,800
You can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

646
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,000
by going to Casper.com slash My Brother

647
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,240
and use the promo code My Brother,

648
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,160
that's all one word, at checkout.

649
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,280
Terms and conditions apply.

650
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,120
I want to tell you all about Wink.

651
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,800
That's W-I-N-C.

652
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,080
They are a retailer of good, good wine,

653
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,280
which I enjoy that beverage of wine,

654
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,920
which is French for the old grapes,

655
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,280
but I don't know anything about wine.

656
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,680
I can barely tell a red from a white.

657
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,320
I can't tell a Chiraz from a Chardonnay,

658
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,720
but I know that if I go to trywink.com,

659
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,560
it's T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com,

660
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,200
and I answer a few questions about what I find tasty,

661
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,320
their recommendation engine will pick distinct

662
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,480
and interesting wines customized to my taste

663
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,320
to be shipped directly to my door every month.

664
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,880
And I used the, the my pronoun there a lot,

665
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
but it'll work for you the same way too.

666
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,400
Our recommendation engine, by the way,

667
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,920
is powered by Andy Serkis,

668
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,720
who is inside of all of our machines.

669
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
So that's very exciting.

670
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880
Do you like earthen flavor notes?

671
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,360
Why did we decide that he sounds like that?

672
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
I don't know.

673
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,280
Wink will even introduce you to new, rare,

674
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,320
and custom wines that are not available anywhere else.

675
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,640
We've gotten a bunch of bottles of Wink wine,

676
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,200
and it's just like, it's nice having wine around the house

677
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,160
for when people come over,

678
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,480
or I cook a fancy dinner or something,

679
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,400
and they've all been really tasty.

680
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,280
There's no membership fees.

681
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,120
You can skip any month you want and cancel any time,

682
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
and they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee,

683
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
so you never pay for a bottle you don't like.

684
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
And right now, Wink is offering listeners

685
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
$20 off your first order

686
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,680
when you go to trywink.com slash my brother.

687
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,920
That's trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother

688
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,840
to get $20 off your first order now.

689
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,440
Trywink.com slash my brother.

690
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,920
I have a personal message here for Allison.

691
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,520
It's from Daniel, and it says,

692
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,800
happy 24th birthday, honeybee.

693
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,520
I sure hope you still listen to this podcast.

694
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:33,760
I heard they did like a month of live shows.

695
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,880
That must've been harrowing.

696
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't blame you for bouncing.

697
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Being apart has been tough,

698
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
but listening to these soft, sweet boys

699
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,800
has helped shorten the distance between us.

700
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,520
I know we'll always be on the same wavelength.

701
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,920
All my love, Fluffbutt.

702
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,760
Now it is worth noting that October 8th.

703
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,800
Okay, that's not that far.

704
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,440
Oh my God.

705
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,680
I read October 8th, and I thought,

706
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,240
man, that's like six or seven months away.

707
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,280
Hachi-machi.

708
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,160
Nah, that's next.

709
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,200
That's the next week.

710
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,560
That's next week.

711
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,200
I got a message for Daniel from Hannah.

712
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,120
Whoa, wait, do you think it's the same Daniel?

713
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,760
Hold on.

714
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,840
Hold on, okay, Daniel.

715
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,280
All right.

716
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
My sweet, probably not.

717
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,920
My sweet, soft boy, I cannot wait to marry you,

718
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,600
or I'm so glad to be married to you

719
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,280
if this airs after October 22nd.

720
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,320
It didn't.

721
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,280
We crushed it.

722
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Hannah, cheers.

723
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,560
Cheers to our years together so far

724
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,920
and the bright future ahead.

725
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,960
All my love, Hannah.

726
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,960
And that's from Hannah for Daniel.

727
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,320
So I'm glad that you all,

728
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,880
hope you all had a happy ceremony.

729
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,160
I'm glad you found each other.

730
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,720
Hold tight.

731
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,800
A lot of lucky Daniels out there.

732
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,680
Lucky Daniels.

733
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,160
Today.

734
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,280
We got a lot of love.

735
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,720
Or maybe one Daniel.

736
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,160
Or maybe one lucky, but complicated.

737
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,600
Not faithful, Daniel.

738
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,240
Yeah, so let's not maybe suggest that, Travis.

739
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,800
One fortunate, yet problematic Daniel.

740
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,680
Or two just regular Daniels.

741
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,800
I think it's a two regular Daniels situation.

742
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,960
And also there's lots of lucky Daniels out there.

743
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,920
Daniel Stern is having sort of a renaissance,

744
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,000
a career revival, which I'm very excited about.

745
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,240
He was in-

746
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,960
Is he back?

747
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,760
Yeah, man, he was in Christmas Story 2 about 10 years ago.

748
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,760
I actually have a third Gembatron here,

749
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,480
and it's from Travis to Teresa.

750
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,320
Yeah, and it says, happy fourth wedding anniversary.

751
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,680
I love you very much.

752
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,360
Love your husband, Travis.

753
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,840
Now did you-

754
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,800
No, I do want to say,

755
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,320
because I think this was just like a cute thing

756
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
that you just did, but I do need that $100.

757
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,320
I actually, I did pay for it

758
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,520
because I don't want to take food out of my own mouth, ever.

759
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,080
I love putting food in my mouth.

760
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
Why would I take it out?

761
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,000
How's it going, everyone?

762
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,040
I'm Oliver Wang.

763
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,080
And I'm Morgan Rhodes.

764
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,480
We have a brand new show on the Maximum Fun Network

765
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
that we'd love to share with you.

766
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,040
It's called Heat Rocks.

767
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,680
Morgan, we should probably explain what a heat rock is.

768
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,720
It is a banger, a fire track, true fire.

769
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,760
Right, dope album.

770
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,560
Each episode, we will bring on a special guest to join us

771
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,080
to talk about one of their heat rocks.

772
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,200
It might be a musician.

773
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,920
A writer.

774
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,720
Maybe a scholar.

775
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,640
I mean, I would have been happy to just talk to you

776
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,040
about your heat rocks, but this is a different show.

777
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,720
Yeah, I think people might enjoy hearing

778
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,000
maybe the guests instead.

779
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,240
To do that, you'll have to go to MaximumFun.org.

780
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
So if you want to talk about hot music,

781
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,720
you should check us out.

782
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,360
Heat Rocks.

783
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Yes, I bet if that cat ever tries to stand still in Memphis,

784
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,560
it's fucking miserable for him.

785
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,360
Oh, it's awful.

786
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,800
Cannot get into a line.

787
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,640
Cannot wait for a bus.

788
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
Or I mean, it's probably equally bad if he is walking in Memphis

789
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
because just everyone down the street like,

790
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,920
I got him.

791
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,320
I see you.

792
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,960
There he goes.

793
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,160
Got you, motherfucker.

794
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,800
Like the song, douchebag.

795
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
This is, of course, from one of our Elseworlds

796
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
alternative universe fictions

797
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,960
where anybody knows what Mark Cohn looks like, but still.

798
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,120
He probably can't even go to Memphis, huh?

799
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,520
It's probably just over for him.

800
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,880
It's probably done.

801
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,760
No way he can't.

802
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,640
No, no way.

803
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,320
I got a Yahoo here.

804
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,960
It was sent in.

805
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,080
Oh, I don't know who sent it in.

806
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,120
Hold on.

807
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,400
I hate this fucking website so much.

808
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,800
It was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

809
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,200
God, he's fucking owning this shit right now.

810
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,000
Thank you, Seth.

811
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,720
It's another Yahoo Answers user who didn't choose username,

812
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,840
so we'll call him Mark Cohn.

813
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,360
Asks, how does one end a griffin's occupation of a castle?

814
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,800
Wait, what?

815
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,560
And then there's a picture of the lion bird griffin.

816
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,840
Not you.

817
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,800
Well, I mean, I think I could occupy a castle-

818
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,280
Griffin, did you pick this for yourself?

819
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
I think I could occupy a castle pretty good

820
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,120
to the extent where you two couldn't get up in my castle

821
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,720
because I have all kinds of traps and gates and walls

822
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,000
and armaments and pots of hot fluid

823
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,240
and catapults and trebuchets.

824
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,200
You ever think about moats and how gross they must have been?

825
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,640
Because that's just like fucking stagnant water.

826
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,040
It's stink water, probably Mosquito City,

827
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,280
which is another sort of defense mechanism.

828
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,240
We got deet in here.

829
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,440
You don't got deet out there.

830
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,760
But wouldn't you be lonely, Griffin?

831
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,520
I don't care about that.

832
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,080
I got the safest castle in the whole land.

833
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,920
Wouldn't you be lonely?

834
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,800
Loneliness would eventually siege my castle, yes.

835
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,520
And then I think you'd welcome some other people in

837
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,600
and that's when we get you.

838
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,960
Oh, no.

839
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,000
You shouldn't have dropped your guard, motherfucker.

840
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,800
Why'd you let us in?

841
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Why'd you open the portcullis?

842
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,640
Um, all right, let's do-

843
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,080
Friendship is a weakness!

844
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,440
We can do a different one.

845
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,720
All right, let's do a different one.

846
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,920
This one is an emb-

847
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,480
Oh, fuck.

848
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Fuck.

849
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,920
I never thought it would end like this.

850
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,240
I want a Munch Squad!

851
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,080
I want two Munch Squad!

852
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,120
Welcome to Munch Squad.

853
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,640
It's a podcast within a podcast.

854
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,160
McDonald's.

855
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,120
Good start, good start, good start.

856
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,480
I know it's gonna be good if my boy Ronald's in the mix.

857
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,880
This headline's gonna take you on a journey.

858
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,480
And things are gonna seem normal

859
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,840
and then things are gonna pivot.

860
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
McDonald's introduces buttermilk crispy tenders.

861
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,040
Art posters.

862
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,540
Guys.

863
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,680
Whoa.

864
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,440
McDonald's introduces buttermilk crispy tenders comma art poster.

865
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,800
Okay, the comma is so important there because,

866
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,160
I mean, it's still Buckwild,

867
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,960
but I thought it was come get these posters of the tenders.

868
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,160
It's still Buckwild.

869
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
So these tenders are seasoned and battered

870
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,440
and breaded to perfection.

871
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,400
Perfection and they pair perfectly with nine McDonald's sauces.

872
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,040
And here's the quote from McDonald's chef,

873
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,000
Michael Harkas.

874
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,080
Our new buttermilk crispy tenders are another example

875
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,000
of how we're giving customers the food they love.

876
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
We also know they have a lot of passion for our sauces.

877
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,240
So we created a brand new signature sauce

878
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,400
that perfectly compliments buttermilk crispy tenders

879
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,640
with the ideal balance of sweet and tangy flavors.

880
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,200
It might be my new favorite.

881
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,960
Please don't tell Honey Mustard,

882
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
which is of course the name of his wife.

883
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,960
You said that?

884
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,240
Oh, I was gonna say.

885
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,160
Or, I mean, on the inverse,

886
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,200
this dude fucks a big bucket of honey mustard.

887
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,920
That's possible.

888
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,880
Okay, so Chef Mike is far from alone

889
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
in his dipping sauce devotion.

890
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,320
Is this, wait, wait, oh God.

891
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,880
So many questions.

892
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,360
Is this like the Joanie Ive of McDonald's?

893
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,720
Is there just, today.

894
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,280
Hey, I'm proud to, this dipping sauce is tangy

895
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,200
and it has a nearly invisible bezel.

896
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
By the way, they don't describe this new sauce.

897
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,760
So it's a fucking cliffhanger in the press release.

898
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,000
Great.

899
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,520
You just gotta go and see for yourself.

900
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,880
It's the latest addition to an already legendary

901
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,960
McDonald's sauce lineup that's so beloved

902
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,840
you might even say fans are obsessed.

903
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,640
You might say that.

904
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,240
You shouldn't.

905
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,280
You shouldn't.

906
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,240
You didn't.

907
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,200
So here we are.

908
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
McDonald's is celebrating the launch

909
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
of Buttermilk Crispy Tenders

910
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,280
by letting sauce fans show their appreciation

911
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,320
as they would for any other pop culture phenomenon

912
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,880
with limited edition, custom screen printed,

913
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,800
gig style posters.

914
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,120
Oh God.

915
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,760
So the thing, is this because Rick and Morty

916
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,560
made everybody horny about Szechuan sauce for a little bit?

917
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,200
I guess.

918
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,360
They're like, they think people care all of a sudden,

919
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,680
except they don't have, unless it's that one.

920
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,480
They're trying to tease that, I think,

921
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,000
as like the hot new thing that they're doing.

922
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,360
I would also say that like, when was the last time?

923
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,880
I mean, maybe, but like, if I go to a fast food place

924
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,400
and they offer like ranch and honey mustard and ketchup,

925
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,320
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

926
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,640
I've seen those before, but this is suggesting

927
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,280
they're offering ranch, honey mustard, ketchup

928
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,080
and a gig style art prints, custom hand printed poster.

929
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,000
This is a quote from Billy Bauman,

930
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
co-owner of the Delicious Design League,

931
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,800
a graphic design studio and print shop.

932
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,080
Limited edition, illustrated screen printed posters

933
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,920
have really taken off in recent years,

934
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,000
expanding from music to TV, movies, games,

935
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
and now apparently fucking McDonald's sauce.

936
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,120
So I guess those are over with now.

937
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,480
They're a collectible way for fans

938
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
to express their unique fandom.

939
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,600
Are you fucking, what universe is this?

940
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,080
No one cares as much about McDonald's sauce.

941
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
When creating these posters, we approach them

942
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,240
as we would any intellectual property.

943
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,160
Shut up, trying to capture the feeling

944
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,640
and defining characteristics of each sauce

945
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,960
in one eye popping visual.

946
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,200
Just wet and salty, how do you get that?

947
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,960
It's just wet and salty.

948
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,600
Hey, so I hear you saying you want one and I hear you.

949
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,160
Customers will have the chance to receive

950
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,040
their favorite limited edition sauce poster

951
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,520
at participating McDonald's restaurants

952
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,600
on Saturday, October 7th.

953
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,920
So here's the thing, here's the thing.

954
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,040
There's probably never been a more important participating

955
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,280
in the history of English language

956
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,000
because if you walk into the wrong McDonald's

957
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,600
and you say, hi, I would like a poster of Buttermilk Ranch

958
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,560
please, you will be escorted out.

959
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,800
You will not be welcome at that McDonald's anymore.

960
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
It's just, can I play this off

961
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,960
where you come into my house

962
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,080
and you see the hot mustard poster

963
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,360
and somebody says, what's that?

964
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,440
And I say, oh man, ACL Fest last year,

965
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,960
you had to see hot mustard.

966
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,360
I skipped Wilco to go see hot mustard

967
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,800
because they're so good music players.

968
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,480
Justin, you haven't talked about this.

969
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,920
Nine of these fucking things.

970
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,840
Gotta catch them all, gotta catch them all.

971
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,560
Whoa.

972
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,240
Yeah, I just linked you guys.

973
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,960
You can go to buttermilkcrispytenders.com

974
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
and check out all these posters.

975
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
They do have a very tasteful McDonald's logo

976
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,640
in the bottom left-hand corner

977
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,240
just in case there's any dispute

978
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,280
about where you got your Buttermilk Honey Mustard poster from.

979
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,120
I'm currently checking for my closest

980
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,240
participating McDonald's

981
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,000
where I'm going to just wander in.

982
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,360
None in Huntington.

983
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,440
Great, I guess I don't get one.

984
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,640
I'm sure the PO box will be filling up with these

985
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
because now that I see them, it's literally all I want.

986
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,720
The only thing I want in my entire life.

987
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,520
You know what?

988
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,840
I dig the shit out of these posters.

989
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,880
Damn it, Travis.

990
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,120
They're so cool and they have sauce names on them.

991
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,920
I waited-

992
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,120
Sauce names on them.

993
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,200
Spicy Buffalo looks great.

994
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,840
I waited in line to get an SNES Classic this morning.

995
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,440
I would happily trade it away

996
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,960
for one of these beautiful posters.

997
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,040
Also, sub-question, is it bad form or good form

998
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,720
after you secure one of these posters

999
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,640
at a participating McDonald's?

1000
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,760
And by the way, you know this is a fucking Austin thing.

1001
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,400
Definitely live music capital of the world.

1002
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,560
You know that they are all over this spot.

1003
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,280
Is it possible to get everybody who works at the McDonald's

1004
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,000
to sign it?

1005
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,560
Oh, that's a good call.

1006
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,000
That's going to be worth something someday.

1007
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,760
I've been watching Antiques Roadshow.

1008
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,040
I know how this shit works.

1009
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,960
Can you imagine putting one of these posters on your wall

1010
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,320
and then just shrooming so hard and staring at it

1011
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,240
until you can taste the poster?

1012
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
Is taste a factor?

1013
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,920
Did they put that in the ink somehow?

1014
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,400
If we're talking about some Snosberry

1015
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,080
tastes like Snosberry situation,

1016
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,600
yeah, I think I would actually get into these.

1017
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,440
A hot mustard poster that tastes like hot mustard,

1018
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,000
I think so.

1019
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,480
So they have vinyl stickers too.

1020
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,000
And I do want those on my laptop post-taste.

1021
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,880
They're so good.

1022
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,240
I've gone full 180 on this.

1023
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,680
I think this is a great promotion.

1024
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,320
I'm so excited about it.

1025
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,080
There's one that's just for honey.

1026
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,280
It makes me so happy.

1027
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,000
It's just honey.

1028
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,720
The sauce is just honey.

1029
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
And I really like the poster.

1030
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,480
This is so good.

1031
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,320
I still, though, even if I knew for a legal fact

1032
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,640
that it was a participating McDonald's,

1033
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,000
I still cannot imagine going to the counter

1034
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,960
and being like,

1035
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
can I have a poster about your tangy barbecue sauce, please?

1036
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,640
Is that available?

1037
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,520
Apparently, they're free

1038
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,440
with the purchase of Buttermilk Crispy Tenders.

1039
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,880
I mean, I hope that falls on a cheat day

1040
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,280
so I can just go for it.

1041
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
This morning, I was walking out to my car

1042
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,920
so I can go to work, and in my lawn,

1043
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,320
there was an entire bowl of Froot Loops just sitting there.

1044
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,160
It had a bowl, milk, Loops, middle spoon, and all.

1045
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,080
It wasn't from anyone in our family,

1046
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,520
and I don't have any friends

1047
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,920
that would, for some reason, do this nearby.

1048
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,440
I'm so confused.

1049
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,720
How did it get there?

1050
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,480
Was someone walking down the sidewalk

1051
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,000
eating an entire bowl of cereal?

1052
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,800
Why on the ground, in my yard,

1053
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,920
of all places to leave it?

1054
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,320
Do I clean the bowl and spoon

1055
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,760
and leave them in my yard for the perpetrator

1056
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,960
to pick it back up?

1057
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm so confused.

1058
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,880
Please help.

1059
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,960
That's from Lily in New York.

1060
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,460
Man.

1061
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,640
Wow.

1062
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,720
So many possibilities here.

1063
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,360
First one, viral marketing for...

1064
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,040
I don't know, man.

1065
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,880
Maybe they got lime once again.

1066
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,600
They got lime.

1067
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,360
I mean, you're suggesting it's Froot Loops.

1068
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,520
It could be for, you know,

1069
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,000
Hacksaw Ridge now on Blu-ray

1070
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,080
because the guy ate Froot Loops in that one.

1071
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,160
I haven't seen it, but that's just an example.

1072
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,520
It. Maybe it's a it thing.

1073
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,640
The kids love Froot Loops

1074
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,320
before they're hurt by the clown.

1075
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,840
Another possibility.

1076
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,640
Another option,

1077
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,320
and this is probably the more likely one,

1078
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
is it's a Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs

1079
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,560
or Kazam-style food miracle.

1080
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,440
Fell down from the sky

1081
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,640
and it was very limited scope

1082
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,120
or perhaps the...

1083
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,800
Very specific, Griffin.

1084
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,600
Very specific.

1085
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,200
Or I mean, perhaps the food miracle struck downtown

1086
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,800
and there was a crosswind

1087
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
and this one bowl of Froot Loops

1088
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,040
did make it all the way down the street.

1089
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,160
And now that I've said that,

1090
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,800
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what we're dealing with here.

1091
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,920
It's sort of just a...

1092
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,040
Just it got picked up in a westerly

1093
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,800
and ended up in your lawn.

1094
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,880
I would like to pause it.

1095
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,000
I would like to pause at one other possibility, Griffin.

1096
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,760
Better than a child made a shack wish

1097
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,280
and then a stiff wind caught it?

1098
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,400
Absolutely not.

1099
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,760
But another possibility.

1100
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,800
And then we'll get back to shack wish.

1101
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,960
Momentum pinned.

1102
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,460
Yeah.

1103
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,040
Do you ever set your keys down

1104
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,640
and then you did it without thinking

1105
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,120
and then you can't remember where you put your keys?

1106
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,680
Maybe Question Asker did this themselves.

1107
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,000
You mementoed a bowl of looped cereal into your yard

1108
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,320
and didn't think about it.

1109
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,280
You were eating cereal.

1110
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,600
You said, oh, I left my work papers inside

1111
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,840
and you thoughtlessly sat your cereal down

1112
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,280
in the middle of your lawn,

1113
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,960
went back inside, grabbed the papers,

1114
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,080
came back out and you're like,

1115
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,440
who put this cereal here?

1116
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,320
But it was you.

1117
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,280
Yeah, it was you.

1118
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,760
You did it.

1119
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,720
Who put the cereal there?

1120
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,600
You be tempted at all to eat this bad boy or what?

1121
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,080
This is a no.

1122
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,520
Probably not.

1123
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,360
This is probably a hard pass for me.

1124
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,640
If it touches the lawn, it's probably a no

1125
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,680
because I've got ants.

1126
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,600
Oh, the biggest clue that you didn't include.

1127
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,760
Was the cereal still in a crunchy form?

1128
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,080
Right.

1129
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,440
Or had it been sitting there long enough

1130
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,960
to absorb all of the liquid?

1131
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,320
One time I dropped Henry off at daycare in the morning.

1132
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,760
I came inside and I saw a plastic lid

1133
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,720
of a fountain drink cup sitting in my driveway

1134
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,880
and I thought, I'll get you on the flip, my dude.

1135
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,000
You're gonna stay right there

1136
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,840
and when I go to get Henry this afternoon,

1137
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,800
I'm gonna get you.

1138
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,880
And when I came back, the lid wasn't there

1139
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,760
and it was in fact on top of an anthill in my yard,

1140
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,160
probably about 15 feet away.

1141
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,200
And some ants, some ambitious ants came,

1142
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,120
put a little moon roof on their situation.

1143
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,240
And I respect the hustle is what I did.

1144
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,080
And I think that this might have been like

1145
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,600
the biggest fucking haul ever for these big powerful

1146
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,720
and hungry ants.

1147
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,240
Can you imagine being an ant that's like,

1148
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,360
oh, dunk, somebody left a full bowl of Froot Loops

1149
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,560
up on their front porch.

1150
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,480
Let's get that shit and then get it back to the hive queen

1151
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,440
or however ants work.

1152
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,720
Nobody's quite sure.

1153
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,080
And have a bowl of Froot Loops as an ant colony?

1154
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,760
That's awesome.

1155
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,200
Ah, I love thinking about that.

1156
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,640
There's no way that that's not what happened.

1157
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,000
It's definitely ants.

1158
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,040
It's definitely ants.

1159
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,720
100% ants.

1160
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,440
Or?

1161
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,400
I'm sorry, ants.

1162
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,720
Unless.

1163
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,400
Unless.

1164
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,560
Unless you live next to maybe a lazy or cash strapped

1165
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:48,560
big game hunter that really wants to kill a toucan.

1166
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,320
And that's an easy con.

1167
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,360
And it's kind of against the spirit of the hunt.

1168
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,400
And you just hear like a folly from outside.

1169
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,920
You hear like, folly it is.

1170
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,440
It's like, oh, shit, get him.

1171
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,240
Go, go, go, go, go.

1172
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,120
Now quick.

1173
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,320
The trap is sprung.

1174
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,200
Got you, Daniel.

1175
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,280
Look around at other yards in the neighborhood.

1176
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,600
And if you see like a bowl of Frosted Flakes.

1177
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,640
Yeah.

1178
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,640
And like, I don't know, maybe some Honeycrisp.

1179
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,720
I think there was a bear associated with that one.

1180
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,840
And Griffin, in this fantasy scenario,

1181
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,320
the reason that it's in the neighbor's yard

1182
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,040
is that they didn't want to kill an endangered bird

1183
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,080
on their own land.

1184
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,960
Is that the idea?

1185
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:27,920
Yes.

1186
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
To maybe cook up a cockamamie story

1187
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,880
that they were like defending their neighborhood or something?

1188
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,760
The toucan is a vicious beast.

1189
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,440
It'll use that big powerful beak.

1190
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,720
Take your neck right off.

1191
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,400
Bite your whole neck off.

1192
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,040
And so you-

1193
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,800
And then you'll be left without a neck.

1194
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,320
Now you're gonna live without your neck.

1195
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,720
Yeah, it's real hard.

1196
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,280
And so you do it in your own yard.

1197
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,040
And it's obviously entrapment.

1198
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,160
You do it in a neighbor's yard.

1199
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,440
It's a good Samaritan.

1200
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,520
Yeah, I was protecting him from a toucan Daniel.

1201
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,600
But really, you just wanted that toucan Daniel

1202
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,720
to hang up on your wall.

1203
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,760
And I will say one thing.

1204
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,560
That's one-

1205
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,400
You know his name is Toucan Sam, right?

1206
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,960
Is it Toucan Sam?

1207
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,280
It's not Toucan Dan?

1208
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,080
Toucan Dan was the dumb monster factory thing me and Justin made.

1209
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,840
Damn, dude.

1210
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,560
My own IP has become so fucking rich.

1211
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,760
I can't even keep track of it.

1212
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,260
Damn.

1213
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,840
Damn, Daniel.

1214
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,800
Damn, Daniel.

1215
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,160
Do you guys remember damn Daniel?

1216
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,080
We leave out seeds for birds.

1217
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,360
We leave out big blocks of salt for deer.

1218
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,520
Why aren't we leaving anything out for stoned colleges?

1219
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,280
Leaving out for stoned college kids who are just wandering around.

1220
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,280
I think it's nice that you want some like-

1221
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,040
Honey, I love being out here on the terrace.

1222
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:51,360
Wouldn't it be nice though if we could watch some fucking college kids just wander around

1223
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,160
and listen to Rusted Root and eat Froot Loops out here?

1224
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,520
I want to put out some Froot Loops and see if we can't get some.

1225
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,680
Because I think that would really complete the Vista.

1226
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,280
Wouldn't it be great if we could look out the window and see a gaggle of shaggies

1227
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,080
just eating all the Froot Loops we've left?

1228
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,080
Yeah, a murder of shaggies swing by and just like nest in the tree

1229
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,160
where we've hung a bunch of Froot Roll-Ups.

1230
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,360
Look at them.

1231
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,880
They're beautiful.

1232
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,200
Why haven't you migrated, little fella?

1233
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,700
Aww.

1234
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:26,320
We built this special stand so that the squirrels can't climb up and get the Hot Pockets we've left.

1235
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,560
He's so cute.

1236
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,360
He stinks like shit, but I love him.

1237
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:38,240
Do you think cartoon shaggy ever tried to get people to call him Mr. Boom-Bastic?

1238
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,440
Shaggy, who unmasked this ogre?

1239
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,240
Was it me?

1240
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,440
It wasn't me.

1241
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,280
Was there ever an episode where that cartoon man smoked a bunch of weed?

1242
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,600
Because it was always implied but never seen.

1243
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,080
But there was probably situations where he just, you know, ripped one right off.

1244
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,360
The better question, I get what you're saying, Griffin.

1245
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,760
I think the obvious connotation is that anytime he is not directly in frame,

1246
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,560
shaggy is smoking weed.

1247
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,160
I mean, that's like anytime you're not directly looking at him, he's smoking weed.

1248
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:24,720
The question for me becomes, do you think shaggy has taught Scooby-Doo to smoke weed?

1249
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,720
Because that would be my bigger question.

1250
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,480
It's like, they're so close.

1251
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,840
They're such friends.

1252
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,480
Shaggy would want him to share in his kind conch.

1253
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,720
Maybe he gets Scooby-Doo to smoke weed with him is my question.

1254
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,320
That sounds like animal cruelty.

1255
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,480
Yeah, it's not responsible.

1256
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,240
It's irresponsible.

1257
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,200
It should be noted also that Scooby-Doo has glaucoma.

1258
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,680
Oh, okay.

1259
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,240
Folks, that's going to do it for us this week.

1260
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,760
We hope you have enjoyed yourself.

1261
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,120
Sorry for being away again for so long.

1262
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,200
We had a few things we wanted to talk about.

1263
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,800
Yeah, so the first one, and this is a little more serious than we normally deal with on the show,

1264
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,480
but America recently has been hit by a lot of natural disasters,

1265
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,080
and especially Puerto Rico has been hit and hasn't really been receiving the help

1266
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:26,720
that maybe some of its more mainland American counterparts, thank you, have been receiving.

1267
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,200
So our friend and amazing person, Lin Manuel Miranda,

1268
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,640
has been helping to lead the charge on getting some aid and getting some help for Puerto Rico.

1269
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,480
So if you would like to help out and make a donation,

1270
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,400
you can go to hispanicfederation.org slash donate.

1271
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,400
And I would also suggest checking out Lin's feed on Twitter

1272
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,240
to see all the stuff that they're working on to try to get some help for Puerto Rico.

1273
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,160
And just do what you can.

1274
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,160
And just in general, anytime you see people needing some help,

1275
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,680
do what you can and help them out.

1276
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,400
Also wanted to let everyone know that at New York Comic Con this year,

1277
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,560
we are going to be doing a panel about the Adventure Zone graphic novel.

1278
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,400
It's gonna be me and dad and Carrie Peach,

1279
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,880
who is the artist working on the graphic novel,

1280
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,200
and it's gonna be moderated by Patrick Rothfuss.

1281
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So that's gonna be, I think, a whole lot of fun.

1282
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,480
And it's Friday morning at 10.30 at the Hudson Mercantile, 10.30 on Friday morning.

1283
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,760
So come out, check it out.

1284
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,200
And then we're going to be doing a ticketed signing afterwards.

1285
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,480
So the first 75 people who show up to the panel

1286
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,360
are gonna get tickets to the signing afterwards.

1287
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,480
So come hang out with us and say hi.

1288
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,040
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1289
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,160
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1290
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,040
It's a very, very good album, and it's like one of my fall favorites.

1291
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,600
So if you haven't listened to it or any of the Long Winters music,

1292
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,440
all the albums are very, very good, and they're gonna get you in that autumnal mood.

1293
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,520
Also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1294
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,160
You can go to MaximumFun.org, check out all the great podcasts there.

1295
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,120

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,840
The Greatest Generation,

1297
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:19,040
which is also doing a new show about the new series called The Greatest Discovery.

1298
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,080
We have two Star Trek podcasts on our network.

1299
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,440
Fucking step off.

1300
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,160
All great shows all at MaximumFun.org.

1301
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,960

you can go to McElroyShows.com.

1303
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,560
I wanna mention real quick that Rachel and I have a new show called Wonderful,

1304
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,440
which has replaced our Bachelor recap show Rose Buddies,

1305
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,680
that I've really enjoyed doing.

1306
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,040
We're only four episodes in, and it's just a podcast where we talk about stuff that we like

1307
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,880
and try to stay positive about everything.

1308
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,240
So go check out Wonderful if you want.

1309
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,360
Along those same lines, I wanna let everyone know that my friend Tybee and I

1310
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,280
have started a new podcast called Run,

1311
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,160
a Doctor Who fan cast to replace Interrobang, the show we used to do.

1312
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:08,720
It's kind of a rewatch Doctor Who discussion news kind of thing.

1313
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,520
So far, we've watched the first three of the Eccleston series,

1314
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,400
as well as the eighth Doctor Paul McGann movie.

1315
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,600
So if you wanna check that out, you can find it on iTunes

1316
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,960
or just by searching Run, a Doctor Who fan cast.

1317
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,840
Justin, you got anything you wanna plug?

1318
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,960
I'm on my grind.

1319
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,280
Just every day, you know it's your boy.

1320
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,120
I'm on my grind 24, 24 eight, that's me.

1321
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,520
So here's a final Yahoo is sent in by like five different people.

1322
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,600
It was sent in by a lot of folks.

1323
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,800
Thank you, it's from another.

1324
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,560
Oh, wait, sorry, one more thing.

1325
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,760
We do have something to plug.

1326
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,000
The Adventure Zone is gonna be starting the new arc coming next week.

1327
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1328
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,440
Well, starting this week, we're gonna be doing our world building episode.

1329
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1330
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:00,560
So if you wanna get on board, get on the ground floor of a new adventure,

1331
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,160
then come join us on Thursday.

1332
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,520
Yeah, Thursday, October 5th, we're gonna have our world building episode.

1333
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,840
We're gonna be doing a few like mini arcs.

1334
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,360
So like little two, three episode arcs where we're all gonna be taking turns

1335
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,440
telling new stories and playing new games and exploring new genres.

1336
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,520
Dad has a superhero story planned out.

1337
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,440
We're gonna be playing the fate system.

1338
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,480
I'm very excited about it.

1339
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,960
We've got our characters ready and I'm super psyched for y'all to hear it.

1340
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,640
So yeah, this Thursday, we're gonna be doing like a preliminary world building episode

1341
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,480
so you can find out what we're gonna be doing

1342
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,880
and who we're gonna be playing and it's gonna be really fun.

1343
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,000
Also wanna mention that we're gonna be adding another My Brother, My Brother and Me show

1344
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,360
in Chicago when we're doing our Midwest tour this November.

1345
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,440
We're gonna be there one day early at the Chicago Theater.

1346
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,640
That's November the 16th at the Chicago Theater

1347
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,560
and tickets for that are gonna go on presale this Wednesday the 4th

1348
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,280
starting at 10 a.m. central time.

1349
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,560
I think we'll probably be sharing the link whenever the site is available

1350
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,960
but you can find out details on the Chicago Theater's website.

1351
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,400
But in order to get tickets in the presale,

1352
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,440
you're gonna have to use a special password and that special unhackable password is...

1353
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,040
See that bike just drove by trying to get the password.

1354
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,280
The password is My Brother, all one word.

1355
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:17,360
That's gonna get you the presale Wednesday, October the 4th at 10 a.m. central time

1356
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,880
and then they're gonna be on sale for the public this Friday the 6th at noon central time

1357
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,800
but go ahead and get on there.

1358
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,320
Get the presale tickets going and keep an eye out for the link and come see us November 16th

1359
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,400
in Chicago and we're gonna be doing My Brother, My Brother and Me so come see us.

1360
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,280
All right, Griffin.

1361
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,160
Yeah, final Yahoo.

1362
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,520
This one was sent in by a bunch of folks.

1363
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,280
Thank you everybody who sent this one in.

1364
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,960
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to name Michael.

1365
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,080
Asks, who named the moon the moon?

1366
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,480
My name is Justin McElroy.

1367
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,600
I'm Travis McElroy.

1368
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1369
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,920
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1370
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,200
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1371

Maximum fun dot org.

1375
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,160
Every week on Inside Pop we take turns recommending something great

1376
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,320
from the world of pop culture to each other.

1377
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,120
And in the month of October we're going big, very big with the Big Cell 30.

1378
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,360
Every day for 30 days we're going to suggest some type of pop culture to check out.

1379
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,200
Things that may not be on your radar but will be well worth trying.

1380
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,760
From TV to music to movies and more, the Big Cell 30 is as irresistible as a Jedi mind trick.

1381
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,040
As convincing as an Annalise Keating closing argument.

1382
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,920
And as seductive as Miguel singing a ballad shirtless and slightly sweaty.

1383
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,440
Follow us on Twitter at Pop Insiders for daily Big Cells

1384
