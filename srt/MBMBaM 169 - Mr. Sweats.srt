1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,280
Welcome, my brother, my brother. I made an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,320
oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm your baby-est preteen brother, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,920
Griffin McElroy, fresh from the land of the rising sun, back with us here in America.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,880
Fresh off the plane. Why did he come back, you ask? Well,

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,680
this is an exciting time of year. Not only am I currently enjoying my first salted caramel mocha

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,200
of the year. Sorry, pumpkin spice latte, you've been usurped in my heart.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You know what, I like drinking them both at the same time.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:26,240
Yeah, and then getting just the harshest squirts. You just drank a gallon of sugar milk.

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,280
Is that good for you, intestinally? It's not bad for me.

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,040
But the bigger news this year, and boy, guys, I cannot tell you how exciting this all is.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,360
Monster cereals are back. Of course, monster cereals are a sort of a Halloween-time staple.

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
As uncomfortable as I am with Christmas creep, I'm really into Halloween creep.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,000
Because if you think about it, if Halloween creep continued ad infinitum,

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,920
eventually life itself would just be a nightmare horrorscape that was obsessed with death and

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
morbidity and terror. Sure, it'll be a full-blown

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,320
nightmare before Christmas where everything is all about those spooks.

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
But I think this is a logical result of the Christmas creep, right?

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,120
Because Christmas is stretching into the middle of October now, so it's obviously like,

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,880
by the time you get to Halloween, you are so into Christmas that you don't think

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,480
about all the spooky pumpkins and stuff. So Halloween as a natural result has to

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,680
stretch back into late July. I shit you not.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,080
I was just at Hobby Lobby last weekend, and they already have their Christmas stuff up.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,000
But in a seeming fighting back kind of moment, there's a Christmas tree decorated

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,680
with fall and Halloween decorations. That's just a Halloween tree.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,280
I think that's just a tree. I don't think it could be a Christmas tree

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
without some picture of Jesus or Santa or something or candy canes.

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,760
Yeah. When they say deck the halls, they mean with pictures of Jesus and Santa.

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
What are you talking about? The inevitable conclusion is that

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
Halloween and Christmas spread to the point where we do reach a single day

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,440
that's like spooky baby Jesus in a skull mask. Or it's more like holiday equinox,

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,720
where there's an equal amount of Halloween and Christmas in the same day.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
You get 12 hours of Halloween and 12 hours of Christmas.

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,800
But this is not the most important thing. This is not why I want to bring this up.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,720
Monster cereals are back. That's thrilling. What are you talking about?

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,520
Choco zombie? Okay, we got Frankenberry, Boo Berry,

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,160
Count Jocula. Fruit Brute? No Fruit Brute?

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,560
No, but Travis, here's the thing. Fruit Brute's been discontinued,

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,600
obviously, since the 70s. This year, first time ever, Fruit Brute

45
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,080
and Yummy Mummy fucking back on the scene. Couldn't be done? They done did it.

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
I've never even tasted Fruit Brute. I'm so fucking excited.

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Fruit Brute, of course, is all about cherry frosted cereal

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,240
with spooky fun marshmallows into it. Yummy Mummy, which is actually

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,760
labeled the return of Yummy Mummy on the packaging.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,640
Starring Brendan Fraser. Starring Brendan Fraser, artificial

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,000
orange cream flavored frosted cereal with spooky fun marshmallows,

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,760
all shaped like Brendan Fraser, I would assume. That sounds disgusting,

53
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,520
but simultaneously, I'm going to eat it. They are both back.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,040
If you go to Target, you can get retro packaging in these jams.

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,080
I don't really care for what they have currently. It's kind of neo-futurist.

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,080
I don't know. It's very monster movie. Very impressionist.

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
Yeah, very cubist, I think you could say. I don't really care.

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,880
What's that one with all the dots? A dotty?

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
It looks like a dotty. Dotty, but they're back.

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,360
Now, did they bring back, because they are trying to modernize it.

61
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
I think I saw this in a commercial. The Target is selling Torture Killer Crunch.

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
Torture Killer Crunch is out.

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,440
Torture Killer Crunch, it's sort of the more realistic take on more modern,

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,160
high tension. They made the high tension breakfast cereal and the kids,

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,760
let me tell you, the kids loved that. The kids couldn't get enough of it.

66
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:07,760
They don't this year have that one. They do have Unabomber Berry,

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,480
which was one of my favorites in the 90s with real beard flex,

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,320
which was great for me as a kid growing up because those are full of niacin,

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
which you have to have.

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,400
And tell me, does it come with lost boy milk?

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
I don't think lost boy milk is available anymore.

72
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
This is not based on the film. This is boy milk that has been,

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
somebody misplaced it and somebody found it and then sold it in a grocery store.

74
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,000
It's very pricey, but well worth it for the calcium alone.

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Boys got lots of calcium up in them.

76
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,080
We get so many bad things in our mail, PO Box 54,

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,600
Heinz, West Virginia, 2576. We get so many bad things,

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,160
but no one will just send us monster cereals. That's it.

79
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
That's all you have to do to get into our heart.

80
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,840
Those are your weird clipped up psychopath letters. Just send some fruit brutes.

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,200
People aren't still sending those, are they?

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,400
No, not anymore. Of course, I haven't checked in a little while.

83
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
If you're going to send us food stuffs, by the way,

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
give me a heads up because I don't go by there often.

85
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Boy milk only keeps for like, I don't know, a week and a half.

86
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
Yeah, 15 minutes.

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
Once it's been extracted from the boy, it's already-

88
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,040
It's like that midnight orchid, you know, where it just blooms for like 15 minutes.

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,160
Once it leaves their nubile lactose sex.

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
Sure. Now, the midnight orchid you're referencing,

91
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
that is the one from Dennis the Menace, right?

92
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,600
Yes. That is the pop culture reference I was making.

93
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
I just assumed everyone would get it without the footnote.

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
Sure. Yeah, I mean, I did. So that's a pretty good sample size, I guess.

95
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,720
Listen, I'm really hungry now and I really want to find these cereals.

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
I literally drove to Target looking for them. Not there yet.

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,760
Where's the fruit brute? Sir, sir, please calm down.

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,640
I'm going to Target's place of work.

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,880
Excuse me, I am gasping for lost boy milk.

100
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,160
You owe me money?

101
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
What? Excuse me? Excuse me, sir.

102
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,720
So, let's get to the helping people because I feel like we've stalled long enough.

103
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,640
We've just been stalled because we know we're not good at it.

104
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,200
Not good at what?

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,560
Helping people.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
I know. With their problems.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,240
We helped if you had a problem of what cereal to go look for today and not find.

108
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,640
If you had a problem with not enough diabetes.

109
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,400
If you had a problem with your milk not tasting enough like lost boys.

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm a lady who's extremely skilled at ping pong.

111
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,200
My problem is that sometimes I feel like a jerk when I'm playing with someone

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,640
that is not so good at the game.

113
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,120
How can I sustain my winning record while at the same time maintaining my opponent's dignity?

114
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,920
That's from TT in VT.

115
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,400
This is a, I can sympathize with this.

116
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
I have this exact problem with every sport backwards.

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
But backwards, dip, but a polar opposite.

118
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,480
But I understand what you're saying.

119
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,280
Ping pong is tricky.

120
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,920
This question is coming from a very, I feel like this happens to a lot of people

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,520
because either you're very good at ping pong or you're very bad at ping pong.

122
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
There's nobody who's just like right there in the middle.

123
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,320
There are echelons of how good you are once you're really good.

124
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,240
Like I'm pretty good at ping pong and then there are people that can just destroy me.

125
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
But like 80% of people, it's just shut out.

126
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,760
It's a joke.

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
Yeah, that's me.

128
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,880
That's kind of my area of ping pong is like in that 80% of like,

129
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,280
which side, hold on, I wasn't ready.

130
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,880
Yeah, and like I feel bad for you that like just put in the work, I guess.

131
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
Just put in the work to like get better at it.

132
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,040
To be fair, there's other areas of my life in which I feel very successful and happy.

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,680
So you beating me at ping pong doesn't really like take anything away from the rest of that.

134
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
Gotta bring me down about this one thing.

135
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
No, I'm just saying like I understand that our question asker is concerned here,

136
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,400
but I'm betting that some other part of their life has grown to compensate

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,840
for their lack of ping pong skills.

138
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,720
I actually think that in a weird sense,

139
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:24,080
that there is an element of classism attached to being good at like certain table games,

140
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,280
like ping pong or billiards.

141
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,840
Like you're good at this because your daddy was rich and bought you a billiard.

142
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,920
Exactly, I feel like that's the implicate.

143
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,720
I feel like that's the sort of, especially at a younger age,

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,640
it's like there was a really clear divide when I was growing up

145
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,800
and someone would have a pool table of like the kids who were like,

146
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,000
it's in the way that you're using it.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,400
And me, I'm like wildly spinning a pool cue like Donatello and then falling on the table.

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,360
Is this good?

149
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
Did I pool?

150
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
Am I doing it?

151
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,080
Rack them.

152
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,800
Let me rack them.

153
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,520
I'm good at that.

154
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,120
We're still, we're like halfway through a game.

155
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm just going to rack them up.

156
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
We're playing, we're like playing the game right now.

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
Like the balls have to stay where they are.

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,840
I'll just be designated Racker.

159
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
I'll collect them as they go in the hole.

160
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
So I'll just be super ready to rack them.

161
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
How many mulligans do I get?

162
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
What's house rules on the mulligans?

163
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,920
I just comment after they're broken, like, that was a good rack.

164
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
I guess I really racked them good that time.

165
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
I guess I'm the best Racker.

166
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Can I still, next Saturday night?

167
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Are we like, is that the plan?

168
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
Is there a lean on this table?

169
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
Feels like it's like a slight angle.

170
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,720
Just a slight angle.

171
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,200
It's throwing off all my hits, all my shots hits.

172
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
Oh, I'm just used to playing on real grass.

173
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,320
So what was the last time you got this table?

174
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,960
Returfed.

175
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm used to playing on tournament ready tables.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,560
Here's the debt.

177
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
There's such a huge difference though, between ping pong and pool.

178
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,560
Cause if you're playing against someone who's just really awesome at pool,

179
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,880
you are maybe going to have to like suck at hitting the ball like twice.

180
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,920
You know what I mean?

181
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,280
Cause they're just going to like run the table and just like, you know,

182
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,920
they're going to win without you probably getting a shot.

183
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,600
Is there any moment in games that you guys can think of

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,840
that is worse than when you have to break?

185
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,520
It's like the most hype.

186
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm the shittiest at it.

187
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,640
Like I play pool, I don't know, maybe once a month or so.

188
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,200
There's a lot of really cool pool places here in Austin,

189
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,240
but like I'm the worst at breaking ever.

190
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,080
And it's fucking humiliating when you hit it and like two balls on the back roll,

191
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,240
like a quarter inch and nothing else moves.

192
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
And it's like, ugh, we have to play this whole fucking game

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,960
with all these balls right there.

194
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,360
Good going, Griff.

195
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
I would have played it to when you're playing beach volleyball with friends

196
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
and it rotates to your turn to serve.

197
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
And you have that moment of like,

198
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
oh, well, does someone else want to take this?

199
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Do I need a designated hitter?

200
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
Listen, man, you break.

201
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
You've earned it.

202
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,560
Listen, listen, I just, I think it'll be,

203
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
I think we'll have more fun if you break.

204
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,160
Please just break.

205
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,600
Please just do the break.

206
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,400
I feel it's the same.

207
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
I wish that in ping pong,

208
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,520
like if you are very clearly like the outmatched opponent,

209
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,920
that you have the option to just stand aside

210
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
while they just like bounced,

211
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,720
you know, while they just scored points on you.

212
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,960
Without you having to do the weird like, ugh,

213
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,400
you know, that like jump to the left,

214
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,120
jump to the right, like time warp of failure.

215
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
Darts is really bad too.

216
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
You get two people playing cricket.

217
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
You get two people playing cricket on darts,

218
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
like who are shitty at darts.

219
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
That's your whole day.

220
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
Like one of us is going to hit a bullseye eventually.

221
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,880
I know it.

222
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
I can feel it in my bones.

223
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
Oh, that one went in the ceiling fan.

224
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
My favorite, cause I usually try to be this guy

225
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,080
when playing darts is like, you know,

226
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760
six shitty rounds in a row

227
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
and then like one accidental bullseye

228
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,960
and tried to play it off like,

229
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
that's what I was aiming for.

230
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
I mean, all those other times I was just dicking around.

231
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,240
It's all about triangulation.

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,280
I was honing.

233
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,240
I mean, you just gotta focus

234
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,960
and then go about two inches above it and aim for that.

235
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,080
And then you hit it every time.

236
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm going to start in on my six beer now.

237
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
It's all about expanding it in your mind's eye

238
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,000
sort of like in three ninjas.

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,880
You got to lead it.

240
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,960
I think the problem with, with a ping pong,

241
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
especially it's like, there's no,

242
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,480
you really have no control over whether or not

243
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,240
that person's going to return your hit.

244
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
You could slow play it as much as you want,

245
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,280
but I mean, you can confidently get it over the table

246
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,920
and there's just no way to,

247
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
there's no way to make sure they return that to you.

248
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,400
You know, my dream would be to my dream game of ping pong

249
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
would be an evenly matched player.

250
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,240
And also both of us have infinite buckets of ping pong balls

251
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
because that's what's so fucking frustrating.

252
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Like in Captain Kangaroo.

253
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,600
One person is really good.

254
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,400
One person is really bad.

255
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,080
The bad person serves to the good person.

256
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,240
The good person puts the stankiest cheddar on that ball

257
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,200
and sends it into the goddamn like stratosphere,

258
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,640
sends it over the county line.

259
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,960
The other person is like, all right, I'll go get it.

260
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,560
And then chases it down.

261
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,240
They're back 30 minutes later.

262
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,560
They'd fucking map quest directions to the ball

263
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,680
and then repeat, repeat ad nauseam.

264
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
Like the other person's getting a fucking workout.

265
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,840
There's only one solution.

266
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,760
Next time you win at ping pong,

267
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,320
after the last hit you win, it's clear you're gonna win.

268
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,920
Maybe you're about to win

269
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
and you're about to finish them off.

270
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
You gotta take the ping pong ball

271
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,920
and jam it down your throat so you're choking on it.

272
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,400
And then they rush over and it's like Heimlich save your life.

273
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,960
Then it's like, well, I mean, I don't want to ping pong,

274
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,880
but that hardly seems in any way relevant to this anymore.

275
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,320
You're the real hero of the day, I think.

276
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
Justin, I gotta say that maneuver seems high risk, low reward.

277
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
Okay, let me throw this out.

278
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,880
What about this scenario?

279
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,520
Last point of the game, you're clearly gonna win.

280
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,920
You start complaining about your paddle

281
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
and you convince them to switch paddles with you, right?

282
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,400
For the last point.

283
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,320
And then you score the last point and you beat them.

284
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
But then you have an associate.

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,520
You have a plant, right?

286
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,200
Who says, well, hold on one second.

287
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Let me check something.

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
And they pull out a book that's labeled The Rules of Ping Pong.

289
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
And they discover an archaic rule that says

290
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,400
that the winning paddle is the winner,

291
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,680
not the person holding the paddle.

292
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,120
Are you doing some elder wand fucking Harry Potter,

293
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
like chain of ownership?

294
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
Then you award the person.

295
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
So then you and your compatriot know that you've won the game,

296
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,680
but the person feels some sense of triumph.

297
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
By disarming the winning player,

298
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,360
the paddle recognizes you as its natural owner,

299
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,600
meaning you scored 20 points with it.

300
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
You crack open the ping pong ball

301
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,560
and inside is written your opponent's name.

302
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
And a Phoenix feather.

303
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,800
Seeing as Travis has constructed the situation

304
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,200
where I'm going to have to have a book published,

305
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,320
I think this is low risk, high shitty.

306
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,400
Like just really don't want to do any of that.

307
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,440
Or you could just embarrass your friend

308
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,720
by beating him really badly

309
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,400
and then they'll never play again.

310
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,480
Yeah, yeah, but then you're taking someone shitty

311
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,760
sort of out of the pool.

312
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,440
And if we continue this filtering process,

313
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,520
then eventually only good people will remain.

314
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,960
It's probably more important to TT

315
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,360
to have people to play ping pong with.

316
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
They do it for the love of the game.

317
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,120
They don't care so much about winning and losing,

318
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,960
but if they beat everybody to the point

319
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,240
where it's annoying to play them,

320
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,400
then they're not gonna have any ping pong buddies.

321
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,520
You want a yahoo?

322
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah, please.

323
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Let me pick the best one.

324
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
Do you want me to pick the best one?

325
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,360
No, you don't know what they are.

326
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
This yahoo was sent in by Julie Kin.

327
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,680
Thank you, Julie.

328
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,840
It's by yahoo answer user Rosa who asks,

329
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,800
if you could turn your pet into a human,

330
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:52,080
would you date them?

331
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,560
Um, I, um, oh man.

332
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,880
I like, first of all, like, okay.

333
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Well, we are all, obviously all three of us

334
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
are gonna be talking in the hypothetical here

335
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,840
because we're all pretty much happily married.

336
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,800
I say pretty much because-

337
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Don't try to, don't try to, all right.

338
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
You got a, you got a few more steps to go,

339
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,360
both of you Pauwans, before you can get into my game.

340
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,280
Um, I think it would be kind of weird

341
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
to date somebody named Pringles.

342
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,960
That's the, that's one thing.

343
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,240
That's, I think-

344
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
I think it would also be weird to date someone

345
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,080
whose anus I've expressed.

346
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,600
You've expressed, you've expressed

347
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,680
one of your pets, ain't I?

348
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,760
But I will let you guess which one.

349
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,800
I don't think that game sounds like a good game.

350
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,120
It's the worst game ever.

351
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,880
What?

352
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,960
Okay, let me say, okay, let me jump back and say

353
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,120
whose anus I've had expressed.

354
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
Okay, all right.

355
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,240
I've not done it manually.

356
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,040
Okay, that's what, that's a very important verb

357
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,720
that you just added in there, Travis.

358
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
You can understand, you can understand

359
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,480
why I was so upset by it.

360
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
How, what do you mean by expressing an anus?

361
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,920
Like you look at the anus and you go like,

362
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,880
he looks, he looks pretty excited today.

363
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
Well, it, cat, dog, bird, what kind of human,

364
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,520
what kind of animal would make the best human today?

365
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,000
Lizard.

366
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,240
I'm sorry, what?

367
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,280
Lizard.

368
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,800
I would fucking, are you kidding me?

369
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,080
Chill-ass motherfucker.

370
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,400
Just like chilling, waiting to eat some bugs.

371
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
Just like chilling.

372
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,160
Cat wouldn't do it.

373
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,680
I feel like a cat would be too like-

374
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,200
The worst would be a cat.

375
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
A lizard would just be sitting on a rock

376
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
in the sunshine, 24-7, telling you to relax.

377
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
Oh my God, guys, I think Matthew McConaughey

378
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,240
is a lizard man.

379
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,600
I think Matthew McConaughey is a man made from lizard.

380
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,480
Think about it.

381
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
Think about it for a second.

382
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,360
Vaguely reptilian features,

383
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,680
especially when his hair is like swooped back,

384
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,360
a la Ghosts of Girlfriend's Pass.

385
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,080
Dennis Hopper in Super Mario Brothers, maybe?

386
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,640
Yeah.

387
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,360
That's a little on the nose because he was playing King Koopa.

388
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,320
Yeah, a little bit.

389
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,800
And he wasn't Matthew McConaughey in the moment.

390
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,920
Stick with me.

391
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,520
It was a good shot other than that.

392
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,080
Do you have any other celebrities you want to say

393
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,440
looks like Matthew McConaughey in a fictionalized metaphor

394
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,560
in which he is a lizard man?

395
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,520
And you can't say Deborah Messing, that's too obvious.

396
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
Oh God.

397
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,880
Oh, that guy.

398
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Who is that one guy, Rob Schneider?

399
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,600
Yeah, Rob Schneider was probably a frog.

400
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,520
Like probably a frog made human, a pet frog turned man.

401
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,120
Really?

402
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,840
Because he strikes me more as like a guinea pig turns man.

403
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,160
DJ Qualls strikes me as like a frog turned man.

404
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,760
DJ Qualls could be.

405
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah, he's like frog prince material.

406
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,640
Oh, Bushimi.

407
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,040
Bushimi is definitely like a frog turned man.

408
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,080
Oh, the raccoon, yeah.

409
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,600
No, Bushimi's a raccoon.

410
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,880
Yeah, raccoon turned man.

411
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
It's because you let Steve Bushimi in your flower bed

412
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,240
forget about it.

413
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
But no one has a pet raccoon.

414
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,680
So that's why Steve Bushimi is feral, technically speaking.

415
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,120
Somebody probably has a pet raccoon.

416
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
I shouldn't say that.

417
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,240
There's, it would be like dating your kid, right?

418
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,520
I mean, I get it.

419
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,640
Like you're close to them.

420
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
You're close to these animals.

421
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,560
I mean, first of all, this is obviously somebody

422
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,920
who wants to boogie down on their pet.

423
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,720
We can all agree about that, right?

424
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
The person who asked this question is somebody

425
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,960
who is ready to take their pet.

426
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,040
To the next level.

427
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,200
To the fucking end of the road.

428
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,760
You know what I mean?

429
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah, I do, sadly.

430
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
This question makes me so sad.

431
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,880
Don't be sad.

432
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,720
Be happy and let's try and fix it.

433
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
Maybe go out there and meet some human beings.

434
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,480
No, come on.

435
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,080
Why would you do that when you can magically

436
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,680
turn your pets into animals?

437
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,640
You've got me there.

438
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,560
Your pets are already animals.

439
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,640
Your pets, humans are animals.

440
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,360
Whoa.

441
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
Whoa, that's a good point.

442
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,800
Whoa, got a little metaphorical.

443
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,960
I guess we're all, I guess we're all B-Steel.

444
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,000
You know what I mean?

445
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,440
I guess we're all somebody's pets.

446
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,880
Maybe we're the aliens.

447
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,440
Think about it.

448
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,920
I mean, you guys think about it like cats and dogs.

449
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Really, who's the master, right?

450
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,160
And who's the pet?

451
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,320
Because all they do is like lay around

452
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,840
and get fed and where are you guys?

453
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,400
Marmaduke.

454
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,920
The great conspiracy, the fallacy

455
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,760
with this question is the idea that animals,

456
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,600
if given the opportunity, would ever willingly

457
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
be turned to humans.

458
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,600
My cat has a lifestyle where it is sheltered,

459
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,320
it is fed, it is watered.

460
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Some would say to grotesque excess.

461
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,160
Some would say that.

462
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,240
Judgmental people who can't see past fur.

463
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,240
Oh, is that it?

464
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,800
She's fluffy.

465
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,720
Is it 56 pounds of fur?

466
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,360
Is that what it is?

467
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,840
Fluffy.

468
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
She's got heavy fur.

469
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,760
It's not her.

470
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,720
It's heavy furred.

471
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,000
She's just big furred.

472
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,680
She's just big furred.

473
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,600
Can you imagine the horror of becoming a fleshy mess

474
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,840
of appendages that have to wear clothes?

475
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,800
Like that would be horrifying.

476
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,680
My dog gets applauded simply for sitting down.

477
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,200
Can you imagine that life where you're just like,

478
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,800
I sat down and everyone's like, yes, here's a treat.

479
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,680
You did it.

480
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,080
You did it.

481
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
You sat down again, Travis.

482
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
That sounds awesome.

483
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,760
Yeah.

484
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,480
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

485
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,040
I know.

486
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,520
But once you turn human, you give all that up.

487
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,160
You have to start worrying about bills and genocide

488
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,720
and your mother-in-law in Syria.

489
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Yeah, but also you don't die when you turn 16.

490
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,840
Like there's some pretty sweet trade-offs.

491
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,520
No, but that's the twist.

492
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
You do absolutely die when you're 16.

493
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,680
You still like age like Jack.

494
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Pets turn human have Jack disease.

495
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,560
Yes, thank you, Travis.

496
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:48,960
Correct.

497
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,760
You're welcome.

498
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,720
And they age.

499
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,360
Progenitals?

500
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
No, not like literally.

501
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah, they got Jack disease.

502
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,280
No, I'm saying that I think the disease is called progenitals.

503
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,400
I think it's called Propecia.

504
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,240
I have another question.

505
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,520
One of my best friends doesn't have his own car.

506
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,960
As a result, I usually end up picking him up every day

507
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
so we can go hang out.

508
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm getting tired of having to drive him around everywhere.

509
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,600
It's inconvenient and he doesn't give me gas money.

510
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
But anytime I ask him to be saving up to buy his own car,

511
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,200
he gets mad since it's none of my business how he spends his money.

512
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh my God.

513
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,160
I want to just stop giving him rides places,

514
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,640
but that would mean I couldn't hang out with him anymore

515
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
since he doesn't have his own transportation.

516
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,000
What should I do?

517
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,280
That's from the friend with a car in Indianapolis.

518
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
There's a deeper question here, though, that I just realized,

519
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,160
which is what is your friend doing with his money

520
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
that he's so secretive about?

521
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,440
Hey, are you saying Dora?

522
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
No, it's none of your business.

523
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,040
You basically find yourself driving your friend to a place

524
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,880
where he can buy hard drugs.

525
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
I didn't know that that was an option

526
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,360
when like Griffin, you owe $3,500 in taxes.

527
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,680
It's none of your business how I spend my money, government.

528
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Like you super owe us this money.

529
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,720
It is kind of my biz.

530
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,640
Yeah, because I'm driving you every day to Subway

531
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,840
so you can hone your art.

532
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,280
Is he like calling you to like have you pick him up from his place

533
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,440
and drop you off at a different and drop him off at a different place?

534
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
And that's the hang while you're in the car

535
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,040
is the sweet hang that you're getting?

536
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,480
Hey, I really need to go to Jimmy John's.

537
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
You want to hang out for eight minutes?

538
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,320
Yep, definitely.

539
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
You're such a good friend.

540
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,080
Why are you hanging out with such a fucking scrub?

541
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,800
You are hanging out with the dictionary definition of a scrub

542
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
as laid out by TLC.

543
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah, I bet if he did have a shorty,

544
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,160
he would not show him or her love.

545
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,200
Does he often hang out the passenger side of your ride?

546
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,920
Of your ride.

547
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,440
And he's trying to holler at girls,

548
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
but he's hollering like, hey, can I borrow like a buck 50?

549
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,080
Don't ask me what I'm going to spend it on.

550
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
Because it's none of your fucking business.

551
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm a block away now.

552
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,760
I got to come up with a shorter spiel.

553
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,680
Or you have to start driving slow.

554
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,000
Could you run faster beside the car?

555
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,240
Hey, keep up.

556
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,680
Just till the pitch is done.

557
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,040
Just till the pitch is done.

558
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,160
I mean, it might be just your friend needs to get a fucking car.

559
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,440
And why does it-

560
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,560
Or like learn how the public transit system works.

561
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,280
Yeah.

562
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,360
There are people in this world that exist without cars

563
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,040
and they ride bikes or they take the bus

564
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,440
or, you know, whatever they walk, God forbid.

565
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,160
But like, I'm not one of them because I'm an American.

566
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,000
But I mean, your friend will find other ways to get around.

567
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,720
He won't like die on his floor of starvation

568
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,880
because you didn't drive him to the Paley Wiggly's.

569
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,600
Or he might.

570
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,080
He might.

571
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,320
And that's just nature's way.

572
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,520
That's nature's way of telling you

573
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,960
you need to have a better friend.

574
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,840
I think you need to break this cycle.

575
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,320
Tell your friend that if it's-

576
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
If you really want to get a hang going,

577
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,400
you have to meet in a place that's

578
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,920
equidistant from your homes

579
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,200
and you're not going to pick him up.

580
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,240
Triangulate it.

581
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,120
And then you do that.

582
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,520
It's like Waffle House is the only-

583
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,080
There's a J Crew.

584
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,600
I guess we'll just hang out at J Crew.

585
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,240
But only in this one corner

586
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,160
because if we head over towards the sweaters,

587
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,080
then it's closer to my house

588
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
and it's not really fair to anybody.

589
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,600
Exactly 2.75 miles between both of us is a curves.

590
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,040
I'll meet you at curves at 11.

591
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
We're going to get fit.

592
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
We're going to get fit, I guess.

593
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,360
And then probably get kicked out.

594
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,680
Probably get kicked out because I do not think that-

595
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,800
I don't think we'll mesh very well.

596
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,160
I don't think that we'll slot into

597
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,000
that particular organization very well.

598
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,160
Even if your friend doesn't want to tell you

599
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,840
if he's saving up to buy a car,

600
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
I think it's completely fair too to be like,

601
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,760
hey, how about you toss some gas money my way

602
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,920
since I'm your only means of conveyance.

603
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,120
Maybe he's saving up to buy you a sweet present.

604
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
Did you ever think about that, Rude?

605
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,760
I bought you a new car.

606
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,360
I bought you a new car.

607
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,080
Now you have two.

608
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,680
I don't want either of them.

609
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,400
Can you pick me up?

610
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,000
Can you pick me up for curves?

611
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,280
I know we said we'd meet in the middle,

612
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,600
but it's 2.75 miles.

613
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
I'm trying to lose weight there, not on the way.

614
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,760
You know what I mean?

615
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,480
If I lose too much weight, I won't have curves

616
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,840
and then they definitely won't let me in.

617
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,600
Think about it.

618
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,320
Think about that.

619
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
There's a bell curve for curves.

620
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
You're supposed to stick it right in the middle.

621
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,760
If you land too far on either side,

622
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,880
they're like, sorry, too curvy or not curvy enough.

623
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
Get the fuck out.

624
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,400
I want to open a gym called Bell Curves

625
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,760
in which there are two members

626
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
that are just stunningly attractive

627
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,160
and two members that are like grossly scary obese.

628
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,920
And then you feel more comfortable

629
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,280
being in the middle when you're there.

630
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,560
No, because you know the grotesquely fat people

631
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,680
never show up.

632
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,120
They might come for a week.

633
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,000
No good news.

634
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,800
They can't leave.

635
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,800
We built it around them.

636
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,880
Yeah, they have a thing like this called jail.

637
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,280
Listen, guys, do we have another question on the Yahoo?

638
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,080
What do we want to do?

639
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,840
God, I feel like the world's our oyster.

640
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,480
I have a Yahoo that was sent in by Chucky V.

641
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:46,960
Thanks, Chucky.

642
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Neil who asks,

643
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,120
sword making resources?

644
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,200
I am looking into making a pair of swords

645
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,080
for me and my friend.

646
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,920
As a heads up, these are not wall hanger swords.

647
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,080
They will be used for the purpose they are intended,

648
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,200
swinging them at each other.

649
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,400
Like God intended.

650
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,160
I know the basics of what I am doing,

651
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,920
but have run into a few problems.

652
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,520
One, I do not have a forge.

653
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,800
This means I cannot personally heat treat it.

654
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,080
Is heat treating necessary?

655
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
I know it helps make the sword harder and less brittle,

656
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
but would a sword still function safely without it?

657
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,120
If not, where could I send the steel off to be heat treated?

658
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
Two, basic question.

659
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,520
What kind of steel is good?

660
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,920
I've heard O1 steel, tool steel is one of the best,

661
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,280
but it is very expensive.

662
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,880
What are some other high carbon steels

663
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,080
that make good swords?

664
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,680
Three, edge beveling.

665
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,360
Like I said, I don't have a forge.

666
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,880
This means I cannot heat the sword

667
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,400
and bevel the edges with a hammer.

668
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
There's a forge shop near me,

669
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,160
but I am not as confident with my hammering

670
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
as I would want to be for beveling.

671
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,600
Would a belt sander be able to do it?

672
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Thank you so much for your help.

673
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:49,840
Okay.

674
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,080
I know the basics of sword,

675
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,680
but man, do I not have fucking anything for it.

676
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,080
Can I use an oven?

677
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,320
You're gonna wanna use crucible steel.

678
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,720
What is that?

679
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,240
Step one, crucible steel.

680
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,960
It's where you heat the steel in a crucible

681
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,080
and it makes it so hot

682
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,920
that all the extra particulate stuff.

683
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,760
I just watched Legend of the Viking Sword,

684
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,520
you guys, so I'm a bit of an expert on this.

685
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
You take that molten steel

686
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,560
and you throw it on someone you think is a witch.

687
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,680
You gotta pour it out in kind of a sword shape.

688
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,240
Okay.

689
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
But how are they gonna super heat this fucking,

690
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,720
they put it in a kettle and then put it on like a-

691
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,000
On like your mom's oven.

692
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,520
Just put it on the cleaning cycle.

693
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,960
Toss that steel in the crock pot.

694
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,760
That's the thing is you gotta compensate

695
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,520
for not being able to get the heat with time.

696
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,320
So you throw it in the crock pot for like 18 days

697
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,120
at like 350.

698
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,440
And listen, I had a metal molder when I was a kid

699
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,840
and I used to make little wizards

700
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,200
with some of those fake gems in it.

701
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,640
That's basically the same as the sword

702
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,680
you're gonna swing at your friend.

703
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,280
Yeah, them shits with sword fight ready, Trev,

704
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,960
that pewter, those little-

705
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
Yeah, I mean, you had to be very dainty with it

706
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,840
and you make sure you cast.

707
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,360
You don't wanna like swing through.

708
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,600
Yeah.

709
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,680
But with your tiny wizards.

710
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,880
Wizards at dawn.

711
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,680
If you use stainless steel,

712
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,920
then you don't need to like use high carbon steel.

713
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,040
You need to heat it and heat treat it.

714
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,360
You can just stick with stainless steel.

715
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,760
Wouldn't essentially like a polycarbonate nonstick steel,

716
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
wouldn't that just like cut,

717
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,560
like clean through your friend's neck

718
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,160
and like completely decapitate them

719
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,480
and then like just like slide through like butter

720
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,920
because it's not like sticking to anything.

721
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,960
It's like frictionless.

722
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
Does that make sense?

723
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,080
Yeah, wouldn't it just murder your friend

724
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,800
where one of you two say not be good at sword fighting?

725
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
I think the important thing here

726
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,560
is to start with a wooden sword.

727
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:36,880
You gotta make-

728
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
Or just like a wooden stick.

729
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,560
Make a wooden stick first and say,

730
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,320
this is a sword that I made.

731
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,400
And then if you can say that with a straight face,

732
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,320
you're ready for the world of sword craft.

733
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,440
Because here's the thing,

734
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
fighting with two sticks you pick up off the ground

735
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,080
will accomplish the same thing with less negative results.

736
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,920
Well, it makes sweet clanging noises though.

737
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,560
Like when they do it-

738
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,680
No, you have to do that yourself and go clang, clang.

739
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,440
Clang, clang.

740
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,120
On guard, clang.

741
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,640
I just don't think-

742
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,720
Repost, clang.

743
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,240
It sounds like this person,

744
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,680
maybe they can get the metal,

745
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,640
but then they can't do it.

746
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
They're just gonna have two big steel pipes.

747
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
And it's like, this is a sword.

748
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,360
It's a super non-sharp sword.

749
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,120
But I also don't know how to tell this person,

750
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,720
but the small, just infinitely small bit

751
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,520
I know about like forging and like blacksmithing.

752
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,840
You don't start off with like a sword shaped piece of metal.

753
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,720
You start off with like a brick shape like, or-

754
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,280
Can I get just like a piece of metal

755
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,640
already in the shape of the sword?

756
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,040
And can you like put it on like a sword handle

757
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,960
and make sure it's balanced and super sharp?

758
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,600
And then I will, I'll just take it from there.

759
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
And then I'll just hammer on it a couple of times

760
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,040
and proclaim it done.

761
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,280
And then have it rise out of like a lake or something.

762
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,720
And I'll pick it up and I'll go insane.

763
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,520
Oh my God.

764
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,240
Oh my God, so I was, I've been researching extensively

765
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:05,040
to try to find some information about making swords.

766
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,640
And I found this page from anvilfire.com.

767
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,440
And they have sword myths slash fiction.

768
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,000
So let me hit you guys with some sword myths.

769
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,360
Yeah, what have I been getting wrong

770
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,640
about swords this whole time?

771
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,320
Is it actual slash fiction?

772
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,800
Because I feel like that's really appropriate with swords.

773
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,320
Swords myths and sword fiction.

774
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,400
The buster sword from Final Fantasy VII

775
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,520
and a samurai sword, they met one day.

776
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,080
He said, you looking really good buster sword.

777
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,040
And then they clanged.

778
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,280
They clanged and clanged.

779
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,400
I'm gonna clang.

780
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,960
I'm gonna clang all over your sheath.

781
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,160
Blood does not make a superior quenchant.

782
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,120
This is an old myth.

783
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,240
Neither virgins or slaves have been used to test swords.

784
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,520
That is a children's story.

785
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,240
That is my favorite children's story.

786
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,040
What?

787
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,920
Children's story.

788
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,880
That is my favorite children's story.

789
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,440
Gather round, gather round.

790
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,120
Who will help me test the blades?

791
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,560
How many of y'all fucked?

792
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,120
None of y'all?

793
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,760
Let me tell you, you'd be good sword fodder.

794
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,840
You cannot chop a machine gun barrel in two

795
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,360
with a Japanese sword.

796
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,320
Modern myth.

797
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,680
No, I saw that on Mythbusters.

798
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,320
Myth busted.

799
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,480
Ancient steels were not superior to modern alloy steels.

800
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,720
Yeah, no shit.

801
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,240
Another modern myth.

802
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
It's cause our steels are like genetically

803
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,920
like superior in every way.

804
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,880
They've been modified and enhanced and chopped and screwed.

805
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Here's where things go weirdly askew.

806
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,600
Atlantis was not in the Atlantic.

807
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,560
The story of Atlantis was based on rumors of the demise

808
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,880
of Minoan Island culture in the Mediterranean

809
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,320
by volcanic eruption.

810
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,560
The story was handed down by Egyptians to Plato

811
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
who turned the little truth into a myth.

812
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,200
Listen, Anvilfire, I'm not gonna tell you

813
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,680
you're straying from the path of sword myths,

814
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,760
but throw the word sword in there somewhere.

815
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,640
Yeah, they sometimes had swords.

816
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,680
Somebody in there.

817
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Adamantium is a fictional comic book element

818
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,760
without any basis in reality like kryptonite.

819
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,160
It's just another unobtanium.

820
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,880
JFK was not actually assassinated by a sword.

821
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,240
Like yeah, dog, like I know.

822
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,000
I know that one.

823
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
Swords are not good food.

824
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,120
Yeah, okay, thank you, Anvilfire.

825
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,440
Clouds are not made of small white swords.

826
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,560
Like thanks, website.

827
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,320
Mythril, J-R-R token, is another myth-ical metal.

828
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,920
Myth is all caps.

829
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,480
Thank you.

830
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,880
Last one, you cannot, and this is the one

831
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,600
that I find very confusing on several levels.

832
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,120
You cannot cold forge a sword from a leaf spring.

833
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,920
Modern web myth slash parody.

834
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,160
What's the most hilarious parody on the web?

835
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,600
There's a guy who cold forges a sword in a leaf spring.

836
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,480
Everyone gets a real kick out of it.

837
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,400
I think that's a weird idea.

838
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,120
Does it say anything on there, Justin,

839
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,440
about whether or not steak knives are just little swords?

840
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,560
Aren't cocktail swords real swords?

841
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,440
True or false?

842
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,600
I feel like we all learned a lot about swords today.

843
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,760
Sword wisdom, sword wisdom.

844
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
Mythril is not a blade metal.

845
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
It is not intrinsically sharp or hard

846
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,320
as recent TV commercial for razor blades indicates.

847
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,960
It's more Hollywood hype and bad science

848
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,560
written by advertising executives

849
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,720
that know nothing about allergy.

850
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,400
Big corpos selling out.

851
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,720
Well, what are you gonna tell me next?

852
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,200
That adamantium's real?

853
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,960
Ugh, shills.

854
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,000
Hugh Jackman myth.

855
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,520
You cannot cop, this is the last one, I promise.

856
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,360
You cannot, and he has one,

857
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,080
he has a whole section about myth

858
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,160
and then one section about Highlander

859
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,560
that is exactly one fact long.

860
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
You cannot chop into a concrete column

861
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,520
with a sharp sword without seriously damaging it.

862
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,600
You cannot chop steel railings or beams

863
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,280
into with any sword.

864
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,800
Any sword.

865
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,240
Swords do not make showers with sparks

866
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,040
when slated against other items or other swords.

867
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,800
Listen, you just spent a whole page

868
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
teaching me how to make swords

869
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,480
and then you're spending the rest of the page

870
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,960
dissuading me from wanting to make the sword

871
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
in the first place.

872
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,160
Listen, dog, I just finished watching Highlander

873
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,400
for the first time, do not kill my buzz.

874
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,840
Electricity does not shoot out of someone's severed neck

875
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,680
and empowering the person who did the severing.

876
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,160
This is a myth, a Hollywood myth made to sell tickets.

877
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,240
Immortals are a peace loving people.

878
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,080
They're not violent in any way.

879
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,000
Swords have never directly killed somebody.

880
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,320
That is a myth, that is a myth.

881
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,240
Every time you see someone killed with a sword,

882
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,960
it is a myth.

883
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,640
Guess how many people alcohol has killed?

884
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,280
Billions.

885
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
Regulate, why don't you regulate that

886
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
before you regulate all my swords?

887
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Everyone you know has been killed by alcohol.

888
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,120
It's my 30th or so amendment right

889
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,600
to carry a sword around in public, unsheathed.

890
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,760
Right to cut off arms.

891
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,160
I have a concealed carry permit for my sword.

892
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,480
It is basically just like we're talking about

893
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,360
from my right shoulder blade down my left pant leg.

894
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,000
That's where I keep it.

895
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,440
Also, I'm a wandering soldier, righting wrongs.

896
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,520
Dave walks with a really weird limp.

897
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,400
Have you noticed that?

898
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,080
It's almost like he's got a sword down his,

899
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,120
shh, it's concealed, it's concealed, it's concealed.

900
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,760
If shit goes south, he's gonna be the one

901
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,880
that fucking saves us.

902
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,120
Although shit, swords have never killed anybody.

903
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,880
Fuck.

904
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,280
Swords are actually physically incapable.

905
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,560
If some fool comes up here with a gun,

906
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,600
we're not gonna be able to do anything

907
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,200
because swords are fairly normal.

908
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
Don't worry, he can just cut the gun in half.

909
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,640
Oh, no, no, no, I read on Anvil Fire

910
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,080
that that's a myth, damn.

911
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,040
What does he use it for?

912
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,000
I don't know, like celery?

913
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,800
Is there celery that needs chopped?

914
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Like that's Dave, Dave with a bullet.

915
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,100
You know what I mean?

916
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,160
I mean, it's sword.

917
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,280
Dave has a gun?

918
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,080
No, no, no, no.

919
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,800
No, no, no, no.

920
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,120
It's just a saying that I made up just now.

921
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,160
Gunswords are real, and in fact,

922
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
half of swords have guns in them.

923
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,440
This is a true statement.

924
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But there's no way to tell if it's a gunsword

925
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,040
just by looking at it.

926
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,320
No, no, no, the truth will be discovered in the moment.

927
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,640
When the time is right and you need it the most,

928
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,240
the gunsword will present itself.

929
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,800
Guns are basically just swords

930
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,160
that throw little swords.

931
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,840
They're just really bad swords.

932
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,680
They're just bad swords, really.

933
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,840
This gun's so, oh, I see.

934
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,680
Yeah, your sword goes super fast,

935
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,120
but can it cut through concrete?

936
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,600
Nope.

937
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,840
I read on another website that swords can.

938
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,440
I'm getting some disputed claims

939
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
about my ability to cut into concrete.

940
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,120
Can we fact check internet, please?

941
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,320
Let me check Yahoo Answers.

942
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,520
All right, I'm actually literally-

943
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:37,200
What can I cut with a sword?

944
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,120
I got a message for you from Dan Ramble

945
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,360
and Zilla's Fiesta Party on the house.

946
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,920
I feel like it wasn't Zilla.

947
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,640
What was it?

948
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
It's not, but I think Zilla-

949
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,200
It was Larry.

950
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

951
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,520
Yeah, but I think Zilla's an actual human here

952
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,800
who's injected herself into

953
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,840
the Fiesta Party on the house.

954
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,840
Christine, I have no clue

955
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,040
which wife got you for your birthday

956
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,440
because quite frankly-

957
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,840
Of the new Hampshire Fiesta Party on the houses?

958
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
Christine, I have no clue

959
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,600
what my wife got you for your birthday

960
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,320
because quite frankly,

961
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,840
this shout out is way better.

962
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,760
We've bonded over NBNB AM

963
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
and I'm always pumped to text you

964
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,520
the latest silly goof from the brothers.

965
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,880
I hope you are paying us for those.

966
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
As you know, we have a copyright on all our bits.

967
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,640
So let's just keep this a secret.

968
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,760
Happy birthday and good luck in university.

969
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,680
New little sister from us.

970
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,640
So that's lovely.

971
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,600
This is so nice.

972
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,760
I'm very confused as to the relationship

973
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,960
between these two people.

974
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,280
But it's not-

975
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,320
Don't get too bogged down.

976
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,440
It's very Dawson's Creek.

977
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,320
If you think about it too much,

978
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,280
it's just gonna get confusing.

979
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,080
Griff, you got another message for us?

980
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,400
I do.

981
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,720
This message is for David Leavenworth

982
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,760
from Jacob McClintic who says,

983
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,960
happy birthday, Davo.

984
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,840
What a clever nickname.

985
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,120
Come on, Jacob.

986
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,160
You can do better than that.

987
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,040
You're better than that.

988
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,160
Thanks for coming to us for critique

989
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,200
on this nickname choice.

990
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,000
Let me try, can I try my own here?

991
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,240
Yeah.

992
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,280
Happy birthday, Mr. Sweats.

993
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,600
No, it's important that he always wears sweats.

994
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,320
Happy birthday, Mr. Sweats.

995
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
I hope this shout out on our favorite podcast

996
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,120
makes up for the fact

997
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,040
that I didn't get you anything tangible.

998
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,240
Thanks for being there for me

999
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,200
when times are tough

1000
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
and being the best friend a guy could ask for.

1001
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,640
Also, you piece of shit.

1002
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,760
I fucking hate you.

1003
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,200
Whoa.

1004
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,400
Fuck off, Mr. Sweats.

1005
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,600
That's a harsh turn.

1006
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Listen.

1007
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,720
Twist.

1008
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
You do a lot for David.

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,520
You get him through some hard times,

1010
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,240
cocksucker.

1011
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,120
Wait, David is Mr. Sweats.

1012
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,720
Wait, have you ever seen David and Mr. Sweats

1013
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,640
in the same place at the same time?

1014
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,880
Have you also noticed how much Dave perspires?

1015
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,920
It's crazy.

1016
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,800
Guys, I do not think that Unbreakable 2

1017
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
has the same high stakes tension

1018
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
with Mr. Sweats as the lead antagonist.

1019
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,360
They called me Mr. Sweats.

1020
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,200
I know that you never sweat.

1021
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,480
It is almost like you are my foil.

1022
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,960
Unmoistable was that one.

1023
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,360
That dude's been running for like two hours.

1024
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
Honey, have I ever been sweaty?

1025
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,240
Uh, let me think about it.

1026
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,160
I swear we have a picture-

1027
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,440
I've never done your laundry.

1028
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,000
We have a picture of you being sweaty somewhere.

1029
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,160
Yeah, it's sweet.

1030
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,680
My dad never sweats.

1031
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,720
I don't understand it.

1032
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,160
His only problem is that he can't see.

1033
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,720
He's blind.

1034
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,160
Drop it.

1035
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,880
I'm in a maze.

1036
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,600
Someone help me.

1037
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,400
Who saved me?

1038
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
Mr. Sweats did.

1039
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,280
That's the twist ending.

1040
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,040
Mr. Sweats hates you, but he loves you.

1041
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,960
What a twist!

1042
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
What a twist from the makers

1043
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,600
of that one devil elevator movie.

1044
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,800
You know what though?

1045
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
He could make this exact movie verbatim.

1046
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,280
It would still be better than The Happening.

1047
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,080
It's true.

1048
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,480
Well, by better you mean like quality-wise,

1049
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,320
not in terms of like enjoyment of watching

1050
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,160
because there is no more enjoyable movie

1051
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,280
than The Happening.

1052
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,000
Fair enough.

1053
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,360
Are you eyeing my lemon drink?

1054
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,000
No, I'm not.

1055
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,640
I can't see.

1056
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,680
Like I can't fucking see.

1057
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,960
I can't see.

1058
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
You look like you need refreshment.

1059
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,760
Obviously I don't.

1060
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,640
Clearly I don't.

1061
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,480
No way of regulating my body temperature.

1062
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,240
Travis, you got one more message?

1063
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,040
Yes, this is for Nancy from Spencer,

1064
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,520
Stefan, Sabrina, and Kara.

1065
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,960
Hey, Nancy.

1066
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,080
Hey there, Nancy.

1067
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,120
Guess what, Nancy?

1068
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,160
It's your birthday.

1069
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
You're the coolest gal in Birthday Town

1070
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,400
and one of a kind IRL friend

1071
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,440
with a voice made to sing and a heart made to care.

1072
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,800
Your friends all appreciate you

1073
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,200
at least $100 more than you could ever know

1074
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,800
and they want you to know that.

1075
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,280
So enjoy your strawberry-free B-day.

1076
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,080
You deserve it.

1077
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,280
A voice made to sing and a heart made to care.

1078
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,240
Is your friend, Nancy, like a heroine

1079
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,120
in a noir crime novel?

1080
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,880
I think it's Nancy Sinatra.

1081
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,600
Oh, okay.

1082
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,760
Happy birthday, Nancy.

1083
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,400
Gosh, what a storied career you've had.

1084
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,360
And I'm glad that your friends

1085
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,040
finally got rid of all those strawberries.

1086
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,080
You think she's allergic or just like...

1087
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,120
She's fucking hate them.

1088
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,280
This birthday, fuck strawberries.

1089
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,400
They're not even a real fruit.

1090
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,920
The fruit is the seed on the outside.

1091
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,120
Get that shit out of here.

1092
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,200
Listen, Nancy is turning 68 years old.

1093
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,600
She is running out of themes for her birthday.

1094
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,360
This year's theme, Nancy, we need a theme.

1095
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,560
I don't know, fuck strawberries?

1096
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,760
I guess.

1097
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,480
It's better than nothing.

1098
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,320
You've all tried Hulu.

1099
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,360
Everybody knows about Hulu,

1100
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,760
but have you guys gotten into Hulu Plus yet?

1101
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,880
You know we have.

1102
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,360
I've been trying-

1103
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,720
Plus-sized Hulu, right?

1104
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,640
I've been using Hulu Minus lately.

1105
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,200
I do not know that it is getting the job done for me.

1106
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,440
For me, there is only Hulu and Hulu Minus.

1107
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,240
Hulu Plus is Hulu, as far as I'm concerned.

1108
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,680
You can see exclusive content,

1109
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,960
like Hulu Originals The Awesomes with SNL Seth Meyers

1110
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,320
and Moon Boy starring Chris O'Dowd from Bridesmaids.

1111
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,800
That's a good one.

1112
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,680
It's a charming little Irish television program.

1113
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,640
He's a great talent.

1114
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,600
He's a great find.

1115
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,040
But listen, with all this awesome stuff,

1116
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,400
it's got to be super expensive, right?

1117
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,160
No, you idiot.

1118
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,360
It's only $8 a month.

1119
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,040
They say $7.99.

1120
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,360
I'm not going to buy into this hypocrisy.

1121
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,120
It's actually $7.99 repeating.

1122
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,400
It's $8, okay?

1123
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,640
But for $8, that's a value.

1124
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,080
You're not going to care about that extra penny.

1125
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,960
I just admit it.

1126
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,320
Because you can stream as many TV shows and movies as you want.

1127
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,320
And we're going to give you,

1128
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,960
let's call it two free weeks

1129
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,120
when you go to huluplus.com forward slash my brother.

1130
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,880
It's a special offer for listeners.

1131
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,160
Huluplus.com slash my brother.

1132
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,760
And you get a free trial

1133
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,480
and they know that we have a lot of power over you.

1134
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,120
We control you.

1135
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,520
And it's worth it just to see the hug melt moment

1136
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,320
in America's next-

1137
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,280
Oh, yes.

1138
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:55,840
You watched it.

1139
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
I really got into it now and I can't stop watching it.

1140
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,480
Did you just watch my best-selling Vine?

1141
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,760
I do love it.

1142
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,360
I also love the sorry about the clowns moment.

1143
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,560
That's just torn the internet apart.

1144
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,080
Greatest line on the TV is,

1145
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,760
I'm sorry about the clowns.

1146
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,320
I fucked up.

1147
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,680
And if you don't know what you're talking about,

1148
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,200
you need to go on Hulu Plus,

1149
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,560
watch America's Next Top Model,

1150
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,160
2.0, Boys in the House.

1151
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,800
This week was nut bars.

1152
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,560
The clothes at the end, they were like,

1153
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,360
you're out.

1154
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,000
Guess what?

1155
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,280
This person's back in.

1156
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,800
This other person's back in too.

1157
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,520
And guess what?

1158
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,720
You're also out.

1159
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,280
Fuck it.

1160
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,080
Fuck the rules.

1161
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,800
There are no rules with 2.0, baby.

1162
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
2.0, Boys in the House.

1163
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,680
Boys in the House.

1164
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,040
Game done changed.

1165
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,280
Hey, this is Aaron and Brian from Throwing Shade,

1166
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,160
and we would love to throw some shade on you this summer.

1167
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,560
Every Tuesday, we inject all sorts of news stories

1168
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,720
concerning ladies and gays with silliness and sexiness.

1169
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
Just in time for bikini season.

1170
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,960
Check us out on Max Fun under Throwing Shade.

1171
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,080
Okay, they're not stupid.

1172
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,680
I know, but yeah, they could be.

1173
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,880
Why would you spell it out like that?

1174
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,120
Because I was the spelling bee champion of the world.

1175
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:07,920
I have both a co-worker and a friend that are very much into creating their own music.

1176
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,320
They talk about it often and give me CDs to listen to.

1177
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,840
I do not enjoy either one's music.

1178
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,080
Strangely enough, both musicians' music reminds me of elevator music

1179
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,040
remixed with techno flair and dying cat's last howl.

1180
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,240
Needless to say, I want to avoid complimenting them on their sound crimes,

1181
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,920
but have to say something about the CD they just gave me.

1182
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,800
What is the right way to tell them the music they put their heart and soul into

1183
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,560
is not for me without hurting their feelings?

1184
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,240
And that's from Twin Cities Techno.

1185
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,480
And Twin Cities Techno, great news, there's an easy solution

1186
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,280
fresh off the assembly line at my bim bam co-industries.

1187
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,600
You lie.

1188
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,240
You're gonna lie.

1189
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,760
You're gonna lie about it.

1190
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,040
You're gonna just lie.

1191
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,160
You're gonna lie.

1192
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:50,960
And it goes like this.

1193
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,760
It's just as easy.

1194
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,720
Man, that was great.

1195
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,160
Thanks for letting me borrow that CD.

1196
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,640
It's awesome.

1197
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,080
Can't wait for the next one.

1198
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,400
Yeah.

1199
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,800
Done.

1200
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,760
Keep them coming.

1201
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,240
Listen, well- Just keep cranking out the jams, man.

1202
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,480
You should quit your job and just do this full time.

1203
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,080
You can just say what you told us, but like, spin it like a good thing.

1204
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,000
Like, it sounded kind of like elevator music with a techno flair

1205
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,840
with a dying cat's last howl over it.

1206
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,880
And like, I like that.

1207
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,200
Or just flip it to negative, like that mirror in Zelda.

1208
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,560
And you just sit there and just throw like, not and didn't into all of those.

1209
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,760
Like, it definitely didn't sound like elevator music

1210
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,640
remixed with the techno flair and not a dying cat's last howl.

1211
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,360
It was kind of like being in like a really cool elevator

1212
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,800
where techno music was playing.

1213
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,000
And also, there was like all kinds of sick cats around.

1214
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,440
They were dying.

1215
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,520
I don't do not enjoy either one of you.

1216
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,760
The beats are so sick that it's like the cats were like

1217
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,840
dying in this cool elevator.

1218
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,120
But they were like cool with it.

1219
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,400
Like, they kind of wanted to die.

1220
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,440
They're like Sylvia Plaskett.

1221
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,240
Yeah, it was like a bunch of-

1222
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,480
They led a good life and they were suffering

1223
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,760
and they were just happy to end it.

1224
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,840
Totally rad hospice cats in like this totally sweet elevator.

1225
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,440
And the elevator was like to heaven and like they knew that in some way.

1226
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,560
And you could just hear it.

1227
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,760
Yeah, in their chorus of meows.

1228
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,680
Oh, really good stuff.

1229
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,320
Really, really good stuff.

1230
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,920
I almost, my first listen to it was such like a profound moment for me

1231
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,960
that I'm not sure I could ever like really listen to it again.

1232
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,080
It's like Donnie Darko.

1233
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,520
You know, you watch it, you're so moved

1234
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,040
and I just don't know that I could stand it.

1235
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,520
Like, I can't-

1236
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,560
You know, the emotions.

1237
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,160
I can't watch American Beauty.

1238
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,440
Like, I can't go there.

1239
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,280
And to be like honest with you, like listening to it was such a personal experience

1240
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,120
that I don't really feel comfortable talking about it.

1241
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,620
I'm sorry.

1242
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,040
I'm sorry, it's like, why don't you ask me about my first time having sex?

1243
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,160
Why don't you have me describe that?

1244
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,400
And I would rather talk about that right now.

1245
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,120
Do you want to?

1246
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,240
Okay, so this is what it was-

1247
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,920
So I lost my virginity to your CD.

1248
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,120
It's great doing it music.

1249
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,720
Because like when I was like-

1250
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,880
I thought you meant like you fucked the CD.

1251
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,600
No, no.

1252
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:55,600
No, when I was making Love, it was that one track that sounded like all the hospice cats.

1253
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,240
And the person was like, I really like the sound of these hospice cats.

1254
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,520
I feel like I'm in like the coolest elevator making love to you for the first time.

1255
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,680
Oh, you want to meet this person that liked your music?

1256
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,520
Um, they don't-

1257
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,160
You shouldn't-

1258
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,920
They would be uncomfortable.

1259
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,400
I think they had such an intimate connection with you.

1260
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,160
And it's like we haven't been dating that long,

1261
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,280
so it's like I'm not really at that phase where I introduce one of my co-workers yet.

1262
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,320
But you know, it was actually so intimate and personal, this experience for me that

1263
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,960
I would prefer you not play your music for anybody.

1264
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,360
Yeah.

1265
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,520
No, that's my- it's my music now.

1266
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:35,120
I kind of want like a patronage style thing where like I pay you to make the music,

1267
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,280
but no one else gets to listen to it.

1268
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,280
And I may not just because it's really personal.

1269
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,120
Oh, I just had the best idea.

1270
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,800
Did you?

1271
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,040
Yeah, you need to- you need to like star-cross this.

1272
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,000
You need to like take your co-worker's CD, give it to your friend,

1273
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,120
give your friend's CD to your co-worker,

1274
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,760
then like put them together in the same room and say,

1275
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,000
oh yeah, you listen to that CD and you listen to their CD.

1276
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,520
Oh, I'm going to go grab a drink and then just let them like add it.

1277
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:05,920
And then-

1278
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,080
And either they're going to love each other and you're out,

1279
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,040
or they're going to be like, I kind of thought your music was dumb.

1280
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,680
Oh yeah, well your music was dumb and you don't have to say a word.

1281
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,360
And you get them caught in that feedback loop.

1282
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,800
That's how Steely Dan was formed.

1283
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,280
Think about it.

1284
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,440
I think you should say, it's pretty good.

1285
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,560
You mind if I make some edits?

1286
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,520
And they say, yeah, sure.

1287
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,960
I'd love to hear you put your own spin on it.

1288
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,320
I'd love to hear your remix.

1289
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,640
And then you just burn them a copy of Jazzy Jeff in the house.

1290
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,040
And then you give them that.

1291
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,200
And then they say, this sounds- this does sound a lot better.

1292
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,360
What if you say, I'd like to make some edits.

1293
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,200
And they say, sure, remix it.

1294
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,000
And then you just make them watch you snap the CD over your knee.

1295
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,000
There you go.

1296
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
That's much better.

1297
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,760
Is there any true facts that you can tell?

1298
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,360
Can you be like, I like- it's a very professional printing.

1299
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,640
I like how round it was.

1300
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,400
There were not any rough edges on the CD, which was nice.

1301
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:54,800
I like-

1302
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,600
I like that it was a CD-RW, which was nice.

1303
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,480
Because I reused it.

1304
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:11,760
I really liked how its circumference was like 3.14 the size of its diameter.

1305
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,440
I really kind of dug that about it.

1306
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,120
It was like a really clever take on it.

1307
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,560
I really like the disc art.

1308
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,840
I wrote on it with a sharp- yeah, it's like so minimal.

1309
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,360
So DIY, you know?

1310
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,040
Why did you write brain poison?

1311
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,520
It's art.

1312
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,560
It's like punk rock.

1313
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,040
You wrote brain poison.

1314
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,160
Do not listen to.

1315
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,880
Too personal.

1316
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,720
Too personal.

1317
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,760
Listen only once when you make love to your future wife.

1318
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,040
How did you meet mom?

1319
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,560
This is how I met your mother ends.

1320
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,560
You guys have eight years?

1321
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,360
Sit down.

1322
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,840
Sit down.

1323
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,960
My friend let me borrow this shitty CD.

1324
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,480
It was super round.

1325
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,120
But before that-

1326
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,400
His name is Rob Thomas.

1327
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
And now you know the rest of the story.

1328
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,920
Think about naming my band Matchbox 5.

1329
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,880
Too low.

1330
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,400
Keep going up.

1331
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,120
And listen, I say that I love Matchbox 20, you guys.

1332
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,880
So I don't want any of your hate mail.

1333
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,120
No, no, no.

1334
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,120
But you prefer Rob Thomas' solo shit.

1335
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,280
And when I say his solo shit, I mean that includes the Santana song.

1336
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,760
You can just-

1337
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,560
You can really see the Rob Thomas shining through his solo stuff.

1338
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,560
He's not as held back by the other 19 Matchbox members.

1339
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,640
That's why his second-

1340
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,200
His first solo CD was called Me and Santana, No Limits.

1341
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,240
And then he got that cease and desist letter from Santana.

1342
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,120
You'd never met him.

1343
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,960
Stop showing that video you made.

1344
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,240
I recorded this sweet CD with this guy named Satan.

1345
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,080
Did you meet him?

1346
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,400
Did you meet him?

1347
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,520
I don't think that's right.

1348
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,760
Yeah, it's called Smooth.

1349
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,600
He plays this sick electric Latin guitar riff that I've never heard.

1350
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,200
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're talking about Santana.

1351
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,680
Pretty sure his name was Satan.

1352
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,640
Satan, I think.

1353
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:49,680
Pretty sure.

1354
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,160
The weirdest thing, I heard this on VH1 Behind Music.

1355
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,920
During that whole recording process, Santana thought he was working with Rob Zalm.

1356
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,560
Hey man, I just wanted to say I love your work on Veronica Mars.

1357
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,120
Hey, what?

1358
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,600
You mean-

1359
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,880
No, that's the other Rob Thomas.

1360
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,160
Okay, I can see how this happened now.

1361
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,960
I really liked it when you made me that sandwich at Arby's.

1362
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,160
That was Bob Thomas.

1363
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,120
You're thinking of Bob Thomas, the Arby's attendee.

1364
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,120
I really liked when you were the president.

1365
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,160
That's Thomas Jefferson.

1366
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,680
You're getting further and further off.

1367
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,480
I like your morning radio show.

1368
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,000
Let me think.

1369
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,640
Bob and Tom?

1370
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,880
You were really off the reservations there, man.

1371
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,760
I like it when I put you at the end of my fishing line and then I can tell when I have a bite.

1372
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,440
Are you talking about a bobber?

1373
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,760
I couldn't tell if you were doing an impression of Santana or Rob Zombie for like half an hour.

1374
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,400
I really love how you govern the damned souls in hell.

1375
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,000
No, I don't think that's me, Bob.

1376
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,840
Bob Thompson.

1377
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,320
I really like how you're a merry fellow living in a small valley close to the Withlywine River.

1378
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Oh, that's Tom Bombadil.

1379
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,160
Killing me.

1380
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,520
You guys want Yahoo?

1381
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,480
Sure.

1382
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,640
This one is sent in by Sean Fagan.

1383
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,120
Thanks, Sean.

1384
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,120
It's by Yahoo Insta's user, Tommy, who asks,

1385
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,720
would it be weird to wear a shirt that says full-time baller for picture day?

1386
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,320
Part-time, occasional, seasonal baller.

1387
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,080
I go to a Catholic school and we normally have to wear a uniform,

1388
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,240
but we can wear whatever we want for picture day.

1389
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:43,200
And my mom says it would be weird to wear a shirt with words for a high school picture day.

1390
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,480
I just want to express myself, though, so I don't know.

1391
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,840
You got to be weird.

1392
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,840
You got to be careful when you wear a worded shirt for picture day,

1393
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,040
because if it gets cut off, it could just say like, this kid's a full-time ball.

1394
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,920
What kind of cutoff would there be on that shirt,

1395
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,480
given that it's kind of like one of the corners is angled?

1396
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,440
What do you think it says ball-er?

1397
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,560
It's the top of it, right?

1398
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,440
It could just say full.

1399
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,560
This kid has been satiated by the foodie today.

1400
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,400
You should send a threatening message to yourself in the future.

1401
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,680
What if you wore a shirt that just said like, I don't have a job.

1402
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,560
Where did you go wrong?

1403
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,560
Or just a shirt that just says wasted it.

1404
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,680
You wasted it.

1405
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,720
You wasted it all.

1406
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,800
So much promise.

1407
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,000
I blame you, older me.

1408
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,760
Are we an astronaut yet?

1409
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,080
Are you an astronaut?

1410
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,920
I think full-time baller gets that job done, because then he can look back.

1411
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,840
He can look back and say like, am I still balling it?

1412
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,680
Am I still balling it 40 hours a week?

1413
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,880
I feel like I've cut back to like 31.

1414
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,600
I'm definitely not hitting that 32 to 40 range.

1415
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,560
What if it said, what if your shirt said unpaid overtime baller?

1416
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,880
It's like you need to unionize, dude.

1417
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,440
Full-time baller with benefits.

1418
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,040
I'm not even balling enough to get health care under Obamacare.

1419
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,320
There's very little balling going on in my day-to-day.

1420
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,920
Baller can mean all kinds of things, right?

1421
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,000
It's not just like-

1422
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,760
I always assumed it was from like sports stars.

1423
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,240
That like that was the origin of the word.

1424
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,600
But it can also mean like sex, right?

1425
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,040
Like you just have a lot of sex.

1426
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,120
You play basketball and that's where the ball part of it comes from.

1427
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,760
But also you can like you can like ball somebody

1428
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,000
and that's like a gross way of saying you had sex with them, right?

1429
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,840
That is a disgusting way of saying you had sex.

1430
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,240
What does that mean?

1431
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,840
You just like put your balls inside of them?

1432
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,000
Why would you do that?

1433
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,400
Or you just kind of undramatically lay your balls on them.

1434
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,600
Like a shelf?

1435
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,840
More of like just like a brief respite.

1436
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,400
These dogs I might have barking.

1437
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,880
I'm gonna prop them up.

1438
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,240
Do you mind if I just put these here?

1439
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,360
Oh, were you gonna use that?

1440
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:53,840
I'm sorry.

1441
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,160
Were you not done eating that?

1442
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:56,640
My bad.

1443
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,040
My bad.

1444
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,480
Sorry, I put my balls on your waffle.

1445
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,280
I thought that's what it was there for.

1446
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,440
I mean read the shirt, ma'am.

1447
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,760
It is 3 30 p.m.

1448
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,440
It is obviously I'm on the clock.

1449
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,440
What did you think I meant?

1450
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,040
What if my fucking supervisor saw me not balling?

1451
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,240
That's my-

1452
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,040
Do you understand how competitive this fucking market is?

1453
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,920
In this economy?

1454
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,960
You want me unemployed?

1455
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,480
I'm already scraping by on fucking minimum wage.

1456
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,320
There's 10 other people waiting to put their balls on your waffle.

1457
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,640
I have a teen daughter I have to feed.

1458
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,120
This isn't where I saw myself when I took my high school picture day photo, but so be it.

1459
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,120
You don't put your balls on shit, you're shit.

1460
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,840
You're fired.

1461
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,880
A always B, B, B balling.

1462
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,440
Do you want the sweet leaves as to what to put your balls on?

1463
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,040
Coffee is for waffle ball putter honors or something.

1464
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,000
Second prize is a set of steak knives.

1465
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,400
Third knife is you still ball all the time because you're a full-time baller.

1466
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,360
I can't change that.

1467
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,280
I'm only Alec Baldwin.

1468
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,200
Baldwin.

1469
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,600
Sorry?

1470
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,520
What?

1471
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,800
Man, I'm just mad.

1472
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,320
Alan Alda probably is the biggest baller like to ever ball, right?

1473
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,840
Yeah, sure.

1474
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,040
It's not even a job for him.

1475
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,080
It's just like life.

1476
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,040
It's just like his life.

1477
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,240
He does it in his sleep at this point.

1478
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,160
It's probably easy for him to just like drape his-

1479
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,040
Stop it.

1480
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,400
I did it from over there.

1481
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,440
How did you do that?

1482
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,520
My wife will divorce me.

1483
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,720
I cannot do this with you.

1484
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,480
Thank you for listening, my brother.

1485
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,680
My brother and me, it's an advice show.

1486
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,160
We hope you've been-

1487
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,640
Got them.

1488
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,000
How'd you do that, Alan Alda?

1489
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,760
We were mid-conversation.

1490
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,040
This has been our show.

1491
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,920
We hope you liked it.

1492
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,840
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

1493
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:02,160
Jason O'Connor, Addie Schweiss, Slam Bam, Miriam, Steve Fallows, Cruz Flores, Cheater,

1494
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:09,200
Trey Smith, Corrin Porter, Krista, Cheese Mary, Nicholas, Lephart, Ian Oliver, Jake,

1495
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,640
Nate Hall, Reagan, Rogan, I guess, Samuel Newkirk, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1496
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:23,280
Chris Zuback-Skies, who said very, very accurately, I'd say this episode of MBMBAM was

1497
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,320
weird, but like, what am I comparing it to?

1498
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,200
Which is accurate.

1499
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,960
If you want to tweet about the show, make sure you use the MBMBAM hashtag and follow

1500
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,920
us on Twitter if you don't already.

1501
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,560
When you do tweet about the show, try to include a link to our sampler.

1502
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,520
It's bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM2013.

1503
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,920
If you're going to tumble the show, use that hashtag too.

1504
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,880
Sometimes I look at the Tumblr hashtags.

1505
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,080
OK.

1506
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,880
It's mostly slash fiction.

1507
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,760
Catch us on Grindr.

1508
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,280
Catch us on Grindr.

1509
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,120
Use the hashtag full-bodied brothers.

1510
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,760
Full-time baller.

1511
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,720
Full-time baller, bros.

1512
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,400
Oh, also, just because it just popped into my head, this week is banned books week.

1513
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,240
What the fuck?

1514
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,920
It's a week of, like, drawing attention to all these wonderful books that have been banned.

1515
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,000
No, I mean, everybody knows what banned books week is.

1516
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,920
Like, why are we talking about it?

1517
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,040
Because I want everyone to buy their kids some banned books.

1518
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,840
Stick it to the man.

1519
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,960
Some of those books are banned for a reason, though, Trav.

1520
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,000
They're pretty shitty.

1521
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,560
I'm not saying all-

1522
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,480
I wish that was the only reason the books got banned.

1523
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,280
Like, no, this is pretty shitty.

1524
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,680
I'm not saying all of them are, but I am saying that, like, Fahrenheit 451 espouses

1525
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,480
some pretty dangerous ideas.

1526
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,800
They read that one, then they're all about banned books.

1527
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,440
And then if they, like, start fighting against that, then they're going to get into some

1528
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,720
really dangerous ideas.

1529
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,080
So, anyway.

1530
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,960
And Susan Powder's Stop the Insanity is just nonsensical.

1531
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,480
I don't even understand.

1532
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,280
Banned.

1533
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,160
Ban it.

1534
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,760
But the number one banned books right now is Captain Underpants.

1535
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,160
Yeah.

1536
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,040
Really?

1537
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,520
Yeah.

1538
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,080
You want to look at some naked chubby dudes for a bit?

1539
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,600
You want your kids to look at that?

1540
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,200
How about you just go anywhere on the internet?

1541
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,920
Just throw a dart at the internet.

1542
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,600
Just search full-size brothers.

1543
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,400
Full-buddy brothers.

1544
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:04,880
Throw a dart.

1545
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,480
I want to say thanks to Hulu Plus, where you can binge on thousands of hit shows anytime,

1546
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:11,520
anywhere.

1547
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,920
You can get an extended free trial of Hulu Plus when you go to HuluPlus.com forward slash

1548
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,400
my brother.

1549
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,920
I just hit this switch on my chair that made it lower, which is why there was an odd peak

1550
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,200
in my voice there.

1551
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,200
And again, that address is HuluPlus.com forward slash my brother.

1552
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,160
You scare yourself a little bit?

1553
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,920
I got a little scared.

1554
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,040
My heart is racing.

1555
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,400
I want to thank John Roderick.

1556
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,840
As long as we're thanking people, I want to thank John Roderick of the Long Winters for

1557
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,960
the use of our theme song, It's a Departure, which is on the album Putting the Days to

1558
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,440
Bed.

1559
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,000
You can find that on Amazon, on iTunes.

1560
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,080
You can purchase it for a reasonable price.

1561
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,760
It's a good listen.

1562
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,880
It's a long listen.

1563
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,520
You know what I mean?

1564
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,360
It's got a lot of legs on it, because you can just listen to it over and over again.

1565
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,560
You can just do that.

1566
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,840
You can just go do that right now.

1567
