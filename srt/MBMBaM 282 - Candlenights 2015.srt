1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,540
Sing it.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,380
Do what Justin's doing.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,880
But I don't know what song you're doing.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
You were doing you.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,680
He's just, he's making holiday notes.

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm doing old legs on the news.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,480
Okay.

9
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,300
Okay.

10
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,180
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

11
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,100
Hey, everybody, it's Griffin McElroy from My Brother,

12
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,340
My Brother, Me Brothers.

13
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,340
And this is our annual candlelight special

14
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,120
live in Huntington, West Virginia.

15
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,060
Thank you to everybody who came out.

16
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,620
Apologies to the ones that couldn't make it.

17
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,860
We had a really great time.

18
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,440
You're about to hear us open up the show

19
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,440
with some beautiful carolers from Heart in the Park.

20
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,740
It didn't come out super good in the final mix,

21
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,920
but it was fun if you were there.

22
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,540
So share this episode with your family.

23
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,500
There's no, there's no swears in this episode.

24
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,840
There were a couple of swears in the live environment,

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,880
but we went ahead and nipped those in the bud.

26
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,260
So go ahead and share this with Pee-Paw, Poop-Paw,

27
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,720
Pump-Paw, and Pumper, your dog, Pumper.

28
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,720
And joyous candle nights.

29
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,480
That was just a nightmare.

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,980
The McElroy brothers are not experts.

31
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,980
And their advice should never be followed.

32
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,980
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

33
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,980
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

34
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,980
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only

35
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,980
so the babies out there will know how cool they are

36
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,980
when they see it.

37
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,980
What's up, you cool babies?

38
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:52,980
What's up, you cool babies?

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:20,980
What's up, you cool babies?

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:49,980
Hello.

41
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,980
Intimate.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,980
Joyous candle nights.

43
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,980
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

44
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,980
Welcome, my brother, my brother, main advice show

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,980
for the modern era.

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Feliz Navi candle nights.

47
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,980
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,980
I'm the sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy,

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,980
and I want to apologize for, after all that stuff we planned,

50
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,980
my introduction to you was I screamed the word intimate

51
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,980
into my microphone, thereby unraveling the scarf

52
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
of intimacy that we worked so hard to unravel.

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Griffin makes an excellent point, because what we've done

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,980
is we planned carolers, we made a video,

55
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,980
we had a whole thing, there was a grinch,

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,980
and what we did is we planned right up until the start

57
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,980
of my brother, my brother and me,

58
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,980
and then we didn't plan anything after that.

59
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Oh, I planned something.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,980
It's right here in this bottle.

61
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
I mean, I'm...

62
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,980
You have a can in your hands.

63
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,980
You planned poorly.

64
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
Oh, all right.

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,980
No, this, actually, this can is part of my new

66
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,980
keep it cool...

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,980
my new keep it cool live show lifestyle.

68
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,980
Let me tell you what folks about it.

69
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
It's called Wait to Make Some Room.

70
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,980
Here's how it works.

71
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,980
So let's say you do three shows as part of candle nights.

72
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,980
How is this tree back?

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,980
I bought that at the dollar store.

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980
What's up, house left?

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,980
It's called Wait to Make Some Room.

76
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,980
So here's how it works.

77
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
It's called what?

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
It's called Wait to Make Some Room.

79
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
So let's say...

80
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Is that Simlish?

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Is that the Sims language?

82
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,980
No, it's Wait till you make a some room.

83
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,980
Here's how it works.

84
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Let's say you do three shows.

85
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
You have a certain level of drunk

86
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,980
that you need to be for each one.

87
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,980
The first one, none.

88
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,980
It's perfect.

89
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
It's called Things So Much.

90
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,980
It's perfect.

91
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,980
Artistic creation that is a symbiosis of art and commerce.

92
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,980
It's perfect.

93
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
So you don't have to be drunk for that.

94
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Saw bones, drunk enough that I have to forget

95
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,980
that I married way above my class.

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
It's a certain level.

97
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,980
But then, okay, so Wait to Make Some Room.

98
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
Here's how it works.

99
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,980
You pour the liquor into the can of soda,

100
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
but here's the thing.

101
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Before you can pour the liquor in,

102
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
you gotta wait to make some room.

103
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,980
So you gotta...

104
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
You have a one in, one out.

105
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Get out of here, regular liquid.

106
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
You're pacing yourself.

107
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,980
You're saying, whoa, whoa, 10-year bullet bourbon.

108
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
I'm gonna enjoy some more of you.

109
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,980
And I do want to be clear here.

110
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,980
He's got 10-year-age bullet bourbon,

111
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,980
which he is going to pour into Diet Dr. Batman.

112
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,980
That's fine.

113
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Hey, eat a big'n, okay?

114
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,980
How much was that bottle?

115
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Can I say that?

116
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
Is this candlelight appropriate?

117
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,980
Yeah, big'n is fine.

118
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,980
That bottle, it's not important.

119
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,980
It's the candlelight.

120
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,980
So this is an advice show for the modern era.

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,980
This is an episode where we're not gonna swear at all,

122
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,980
we should point out, which is...

123
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,980
We are gonna try really hard not to swear at all.

124
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:15,980
Hi, Justin.

125
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,980
And suddenly our production quality jumps up to 10.

126
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
I was really worried when they started

127
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,980
because I couldn't see Griffin super good.

128
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,980
But then Jelson flipped that tiny plastic switch

129
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
on that tiny plastic street lamp

130
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
and suddenly all became clear.

131
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
I had to explain it to the people at home

132
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
who knew what we were talking about.

133
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
This has been, fellas, I don't know how you feel about it,

134
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,980
kind of a swearing day.

135
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980
Like if I made it to the end of this day

136
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,980
under normal circumstances, it would be 9 p.m.

137
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
I would put on my sweatshorts and I'd be like...

138
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
Sworts.

139
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Shorts, I guess you could say.

140
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Sworts.

141
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Sure.

142
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,980
And then I would just like kick up the ottoman

143
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
and I'd be like, time to do some swearing.

144
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Let's start with my favorite ones.

145
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
And then I'd say my...

146
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,980
I wish I could tell you what my favorite ones,

147
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
but I can't because it's Candle Nights

148
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,980
and that's not what we're going for here.

149
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,980
That's not what Candle Nights is about.

150
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
I don't know what it is about, but I know it's not that.

151
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,980
We'll find it by the end of the episode.

152
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
Going back, listening to old Candle Nights episodes,

153
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
I've realized they're beautiful

154
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,980
and we've pitched this holiday in the perfect way,

155
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
but none of us have had a moral revelation.

156
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Except maybe Justin at the end of Candle Nights 2014

157
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,980
when three ghosts visited and were like,

158
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,980
hey, drink less on stage.

159
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:37,980
Only they didn't get around to you until like January 16th.

160
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
You know what's funny?

161
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,980
We'd ruin Candle Nights by swearing the show,

162
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,980
but there's a lot of Christmas things that would be a lot better

163
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
if they had swearing in them.

164
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
I was thinking about this today

165
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,980
when I was watching Emmett Otter's Junk Band Christmas.

166
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,980
How much money would you give

167
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,980
to see one of those little otters just be like,

168
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,980
mother grabber.

169
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Like, but not, but they'd say the bad thing.

170
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
The bad one.

171
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
The bad one.

172
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Should we do some...

173
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
What if Scrooge...

174
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Oh, there's more. Okay.

175
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
What if Scrooge is just like, they're like,

176
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,980
can we have some money, Scrooge?

177
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,980
And he was like, son of a...

178
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,980
And then he said the rest of it.

179
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,980
The next word that comes in that usually at the end of it.

180
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,980
This is an advice show.

181
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Don't laugh.

182
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
My family is doing a gift exchange this year

183
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,980
and my sister-in-law, as of last March, is buying a present.

184
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,980
A cast iron skillet.

185
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,980
Spoilers, come on.

186
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
For my wife.

187
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Save that for the end of the question.

188
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
You don't know how to build suspense.

189
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,980
By the way, I know you've been wondering.

190
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,980
It's a cast iron skillet.

191
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
My wife's Christmas list did not specify

192
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
the type of cast iron skillet that she would like.

193
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Rookie mistake.

194
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,980
But knowing her, I have reason to think

195
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
she would prefer a different type

196
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
than the one that was purchased.

197
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Brief sidebar.

198
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,980
What character traits?

199
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,980
I know that she hates Mondays and loves chocolate.

200
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,980
So she wants a Dutch oven.

201
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Not a cast iron skillet.

202
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,980
It could be.

203
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,980
You could have a cast iron Dutch oven skillet.

204
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,980
That's what you have an issue with.

205
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Not that somebody wants a cast iron skillet.

206
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Just not that cast iron skillet.

207
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
If you can't figure it out on your own,

208
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
it doesn't mean anything.

209
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
It doesn't mean anything.

210
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
You know I only like ceramic handles.

211
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,980
That's one of the things about me is I love ceramic handles.

212
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
I said ceramic handles three times

213
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,980
because I worried it would sound like ceramic candles,

214
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
and that doesn't make any sense.

215
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
A sincere concern.

216
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
Thank God you cleared that up.

217
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,980
Welcome, by the way.

218
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Welcome behind the veil.

219
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
But I have reason to think that my sister-in-law

220
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
would prefer a different type than the one that was purchased.

221
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
I'm not about to ask my sister-in-law to return it

222
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
and get a different one.

223
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,980
But is it okay for us to return it

224
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
and get a different one ourselves

225
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
once the present has been opened

226
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
and thank yous have been given, et cetera?

227
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
It might not be an issue for most people,

228
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,980
but since my sister-in-law is relatively new to the family,

229
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,980
I don't want to do anything that might accidentally insult her.

230
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
And I know this is getting long, but hang in there with me.

231
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
There's a twist.

232
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,980
And she will know if we do this because my brother, her husband...

233
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,980
He's an octopus.

234
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,980
Why would she be an octopus?

235
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
It's just a better twist than the twisted.

236
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Go ahead.

237
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
My brother... You've ruined the tension.

238
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
This isn't you.

239
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Build it back up. Start at the beginning.

240
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,980
It was a dark and stormy night.

241
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,980
Call me Ishmael.

242
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,980
What's up with cast iron skillets?

243
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
It was the best of times.

244
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,980
It was the worst of skillets.

245
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,980
Okay.

246
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,980
Okay.

247
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
Pick it up.

248
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Let's take it from...

249
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
And she will know.

250
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Reset to one.

251
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,980
Let's take it from the exact word I stopped at.

252
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,980
She will know if we do this because my brother, her husband,

253
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,980
and I share an Amazon account.

254
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
What do you think, brothers?

255
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,980
Should I return the present and restrain the relationship

256
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,980
or should I leave well enough alone?

257
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,980
And that's from sauteing in South Bend.

258
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
Can I just say...

259
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Are you here sauteing in South Bend?

260
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,980
Are you?

261
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,980
No.

262
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,980
I'm deeply in love with the audience reaction.

263
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
Very much.

264
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,980
You guys reacted like a Spanish soap opera.

265
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
Ooh.

266
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Die off me.

267
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Ooh.

268
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Whoa.

269
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Because that's what I wanted you to do and you did.

270
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
You did.

271
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,980
I think it's busted how everybody thinks all commerce...

272
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
Why is everyone laughing?

273
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Did I swear?

274
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
I think it's busted how everybody thinks all commerce

275
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,980
has to go through Amazon.

276
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
I think they're laughing because you said busted

277
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:55,980
like a character on Ghost Rider.

278
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,980
Hey, gang.

279
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Hey, gang.

280
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
What's Ghost Rider spelling on the wall?

281
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
We've got to bust this...

282
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Anyway.

283
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,980
Take it from me, Sheldon Turnipseed,

284
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,980
the actual name of a person on Ghost Rider,

285
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Sheldon Turnipseed.

286
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,980
I forget what I was going to say, fellas.

287
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
I think it's...

288
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
Made some room.

289
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,980
I think it's bad and wrong.

290
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
You poured it into a cup.

291
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,980
That's a cheating version of making room.

292
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
I think it's...

293
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
No, I'm going to go with the original.

294
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
I think it's busted how everybody thinks all

295
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
monetary transactions have to go through Amazon

296
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,980
and you got to do a street return.

297
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,980
Just take this new cast iron skillet thing

298
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,980
into Pullman Square Plaza and just carry it around

299
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,980
saying like, who wants this skillet?

300
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,980
No.

301
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Your problem is no one wants...

302
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
And correct me if I'm wrong here, audience.

303
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,980
No one wants a new cast iron skillet.

304
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Right.

305
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Like, what's the fun of that?

306
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980
You need it preceded.

307
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,980
You want that stank fake thing.

308
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,980
You want your great-grandmother's old

309
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
busted skillet.

310
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,980
Travis Patrick!

311
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
Oh, no!

312
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,980
No, you can say that on TV.

313
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
No, three strikes.

314
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
Three strikes.

315
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
That's one.

316
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,980
You can say that on TV.

317
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
Three strikes.

318
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Your old donkey skillet.

319
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,980
You want a skillet so old that something in it

320
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,980
at one point had a racist slang name, right?

321
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Sorry, grandma, did you...

322
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Do you mean bacon?

323
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Sorry, wait, grandma.

324
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Did you mean to say bacon just then

325
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,980
instead of the thing that you did say?

326
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,980
Because that's not what we call it ever.

327
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,980
This is polite society.

328
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,980
Could you take it to like Cluckers or something

329
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
and have them just like...

330
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
DJ Cluckers.

331
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,980
You mean Roosters.

332
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
It's not...

333
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
No, we don't want to get sued.

334
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Anybody here eat at Roosters since you've been here?

335
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Yeah, what's up?

336
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,980
It's like half our audience.

337
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
How did that happen?

338
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Jason, don't raise your hand.

339
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Of course you've eaten at Roosters.

340
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,980
They got a lot of TVs, right?

341
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
You were saying?

342
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Yeah.

343
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
You were saying?

344
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,980
T-Fried TV.

345
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
We'll talk about hunting stuff later.

346
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Go ahead.

347
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
Take the pan to Roosters.

348
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
Say, can you just dunk this?

349
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,980
Give it a speedy crusting.

350
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,980
Maybe one of the chefs puts it down his shirt

351
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,980
for a workday and you get that natural...

352
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,980
That increases the price by 25 American dollars.

353
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,980
You got to put some sweat equity into it.

354
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,980
Literal, literal sweat equity.

355
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
Quick poll.

356
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,980
Quick poll of this table.

357
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Griffin, Justin.

358
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Yeah.

359
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
How much would you pay for a cast iron skillet?

360
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
Do not answer audience.

361
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Why can't they?

362
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
You're being really rude.

363
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Because...

364
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
I want you to answer.

365
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
There's hundreds of people here.

366
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
You just pull...

367
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
I'm going to pull them in a second.

368
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Okay, raise your hand.

369
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,980
This is going on.

370
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Okay, let's do this.

371
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
Raise your hand if you pay $10

372
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
and then we'll just go up in value.

373
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,980
No, why would we do this?

374
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
And put it down.

375
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Sia, okay, I see like one...

376
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Bad start.

377
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Bad long game.

378
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Okay, 20.

379
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Let's just get to the joke.

380
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,980
If there's a joke, God help me, please just say it.

381
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,980
No, my point was is that I think that in this day and age,

382
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
if you went up to someone and said,

383
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,980
I will sell you this cast iron skillet for $25,

384
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
they would be like, yeah.

385
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
On the street, homie?

386
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,980
What's your fear?

387
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,980
That you're getting a knockoff cast iron skillet?

388
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,980
That it's not name brand?

389
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Hey, why is Paula Deen spelled with four E's?

390
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,980
I like how her face is printed on it, for sure.

391
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
This is a Paolo Deen.

392
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
That can't be right.

393
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
This is one Pablo Deen.

394
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,980
It doesn't even make sense.

395
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Hey, does anybody want a Yahoo answer

396
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,980
from the Yahoo Answers website or service?

397
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
If you're unfamiliar,

398
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,980
we take questions from the Yahoo Answers service

399
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,980
and try to answer them before everybody on earth did it.

400
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Fallon.

401
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
I know he's here.

402
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
If you're here.

403
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
If you're here, Fallon.

404
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Eyes on you, buddy.

405
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
No, no, don't boo.

406
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
He's adorable.

407
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
He's a great guy.

408
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
All right, let's do the thing.

409
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
Send in by level 9,000.

410
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you.

411
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Sure you're here?

412
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
He's usually here.

413
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
No, that would be amazing.

414
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
No, that's too far for him to come here.

415
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
We'll find him out next year.

416
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
At the top of the Yahoo page,

417
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
there's a little promotion that says,

418
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
get double points throughout December on Answers.

419
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
Is it time for me?

420
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,980
Is this the time to strike and become an active member?

421
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,980
I take so much from Yahoo Answers.

422
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Is it time to put them back into the ecosystem?

423
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Give.

424
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
I worry that you'll draw too much attention to yourself.

425
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
That's a good point.

426
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
I don't want to poison the well.

427
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
This one's asked by a Yahoo Answers user.

428
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,980
It's anonymous and for good reason.

429
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,980
We'll call him Purvis Asks.

430
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
What?

431
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
It's a name.

432
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,980
Purvis Asks.

433
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,980
Why am I attracted to the weight gain belly scene

434
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,980
from the movie The Santa Clause?

435
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,980
I'm so happy.

436
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,980
How's your candle lights?

437
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Mine's good so far.

438
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
I'm a straight male.

439
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Always have been.

440
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
There's no doubt to that.

441
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,980
Maybe slight confusion.

442
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Wait, okay, maybe slightly what?

443
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
I'm a straight male.

444
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Always have been.

445
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
There's no doubt about that.

446
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,980
Maybe slight confusion.

447
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
Just like Oni.

448
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,980
There's a backspace key on your keyboard.

449
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
There's no doubt.

450
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
There is.

451
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
Too late now.

452
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,980
You know what?

453
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Don't read that last sentence.

454
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,980
I want that stricken from the Yahoo record.

455
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,980
Now that I think about it, I'm dated exclusively men.

456
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
I didn't see where that would be confusing.

457
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,980
Yeah, I can see why this would be confusing.

458
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,980
I'm attracted to the whole weight gain fetish thing

459
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,980
among women and only women.

460
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,980
Nothing crazy like serious gaining,

461
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,980
but a little bit of chub around girls' stomachs

462
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,980
that create a little gut is attractive to me,

463
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
and I didn't read this part,

464
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,980
and I'm uncomfortable on the stage now.

465
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:23,980
The next part's too gross to read.

466
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,980
When I say gross, all right, the humiliation factor

467
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,980
and seeing the girls act or whatever

468
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,980
and hearing dialogue or monologue gets me aroused a good bit.

469
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,980
All right, let the record show there were no bad words

470
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
in what Griffin just said.

471
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
But I would say mature concepts.

472
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Challenging ideas.

473
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Mostly just the idea of being aroused during a monologue.

474
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,980
You didn't specify the topic either.

475
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
My question.

476
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Can we take our robes off yet?

477
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
I need to warp.

478
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Pretty hot.

479
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Cool.

480
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,980
My question is why for that particular scene only

481
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
do I get a similar feeling?

482
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,980
If memory serves in the Santa Claus with any,

483
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,980
there are several scenes where Tim Allen.

484
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,980
No, there is one specific where I believe he turns,

485
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,980
I'm sorry, profile, and in the mirror watches

486
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
like buttons pop off his shirt as he like.

487
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Oh, slow down.

488
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Oh, mommy.

489
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,980
Again, again.

490
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,980
If you'll remember the scene,

491
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,980
he then turns full onto the camera

492
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
and does this for 15 minutes.

493
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
So you can understand where.

494
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,980
As he just gets bigger and bigger.

495
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Bigger and bigger.

496
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
Sorry, one second.

497
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

498
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Did everybody get that on Twitter?

499
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
I'll do it one more time.

500
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
Why?

501
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Why is any of this?

502
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Yeah.

503
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Justin is putting this on Twitter.

504
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
Get your cameras out.

505
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,980
That's because it's ethically bad.

506
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,980
It's ethically bad for them to do that thing you said.

507
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,980
So Tim Allen, I think what you've got here is a,

508
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,980
you've got a lot of ideas that we're growing up.

509
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
A lot of cross wires.

510
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
A lot of cross wires, right?

511
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,980
Everybody loves Santa.

512
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Ho, ho, ho.

513
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Green giant.

514
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
Well, stole that.

515
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,980
One of them stole it.

516
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
And everybody loves Santa.

517
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Kids grow up loving Santa.

518
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
And then Tim Allen.

519
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
Need I say more?

520
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
I hoped that you guys would say something else.

521
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
America's sexiest comic.

522
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,980
America's sexiest comic slash novelist.

523
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
Oh my God, why am I here?

524
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Changed my life.

525
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,980
It's why I'm a Zen Buddhist.

526
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
I wish that was not true.

527
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
Have you seen, yikes.

528
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,980
Have you seen.

529
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,980
Whoa, sorry, pump of the brakes.

530
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,980
I just found out Travis got his religious theology

531
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
from Tim Allen.

532
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Sorry, the show is canceled.

533
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
We're only talking about this now.

534
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,980
I believe I was 14 and his views really unlocked

535
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
something within me.

536
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,980
The first annual Allen Nights.

537
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Where's Travis?

538
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,980
The show has come to a halt until you tell us more.

539
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Well, there's a metaphor running through the book

540
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,980
of him trying to find the perfect hood ornament.

541
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,980
The perfect chainsaw.

542
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,980
And what's great about it and I feel truly moving

543
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,980
is he finds what he thinks to be the perfect hood ornament

544
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,980
like we all have.

545
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,980
And then when he sees it the next morning in a clearer light

546
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,980
he realizes it's not as beautiful as it was

547
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
on the show floor.

548
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,980
And he realizes that what is truly important in life

549
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,980
is his wife and kids.

550
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,980
And not a hood ornament.

551
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Okay, good.

552
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
And I think.

553
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,980
You read that and in the other hand.

554
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I was 14.

555
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
Yes.

556
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,980
In the other hand you were holding a big bag full

557
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
of hood ornaments and you were like,

558
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,980
what am I becoming?

559
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
No.

560
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Why did I sort through so many of these?

561
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,980
We are not talking about the matter at hand

562
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:13,980
which is this person's Tim Allen chub chub.

563
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,980
His double trouble chubble bubble.

564
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
And I guess we're just not gonna.

565
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,980
I would say this.

566
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,980
If it is confusing for you, my 35 years on this planet

567
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
have proven one thing and one thing only

568
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,980
and that is not that hard to not see a Santa Claus movie.

569
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I was going to say, how often is this coming up

570
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,980
that you're like in the middle of, I don't know,

571
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
getting your license renewed at the DMV

572
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,980
and you look up.

573
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Oh no, no.

574
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Excuse me.

575
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,980
Can you change your channel please?

576
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,980
That guy got too worked up.

577
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,980
Yeah, and specifically not that scene, right?

578
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
Like it's not the whole movie.

579
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,980
It's just the part where he gets large and in charge, right?

580
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
I got another question.

581
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,980
I've bought a book for a friend.

582
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
What time did we start by the way?

583
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
It's been like four minutes.

584
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Go ahead.

585
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
Okay.

586
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
I bought a book for a friend as a gift

587
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,980
this impending Candle Nights festivities.

588
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
While waiting for the approaching holiday,

589
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
I've been hearing amazing reviews

590
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,980
and have been seeing it on a number of years best list.

591
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,980
How morally reprehensible, sorry.

592
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,980
How morally reprehensible is it to read a book

593
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,980
prior to gifting?

594
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,980
That's from Dishonorable in Davidson.

595
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Hey, all the information's used up again.

596
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,980
There's only love left in this copy of Eat, Pray, Love.

597
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
This is garbage.

598
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Use of all the story.

599
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
Wait, why?

600
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,980
No, don't contextualize it.

601
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
The idea of if you said anything,

602
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,980
like I bought a sweater for my friend and I wore it first,

603
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,980
no one would be like, that's fine.

604
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
You can wear it again.

605
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
No, no.

606
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
It's a present you bought for someone

607
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
and you're not allowed to read it beforehand.

608
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
What's the alternative?

609
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Go get it yourself.

610
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,980
It's $6.99, it's a book.

611
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,980
And that's, hey, hey everybody,

612
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,980
if you're wondering why it seems a little hot this winter,

613
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,980
it's because old climate change Trav

614
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
is trying to just like waste,

615
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,980
a lot of wastefulness, I think.

616
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:19,980
In my book, in my America.

617
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Two more words about that, Paris Accord.

618
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
What?

619
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Trying to get it fixed up.

620
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,980
A little hot out there today.

621
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,980
Dad has his head in his hands right now.

622
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,980
That's not a joke.

623
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
It seems a little steamy out there in my America.

624
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
I don't know.

625
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Maybe everybody should like,

626
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
there's a picture of me reading a book.

627
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

628
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Maybe you bought a book and they cut a tree down

629
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,980
to make that book and they paved paradise

630
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,980
and put up a parking lot.

631
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,980
We got libraries for a reason.

632
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,980
Go to the library and get it pre-loved too.

633
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,980
Congratulations, Mr. McElroy.

634
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
He's your library card.

635
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
We're excited to have you.

636
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
Thanks.

637
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,980
I need books that nobody's touched.

638
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
I need your new shipments.

639
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
Well, you have like a new Highlights magazine.

640
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,980
I guess if that's it.

641
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Here's some books about how bad climate change is.

642
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Nobody's touched those.

643
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Apparently.

644
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Let's change some minds.

645
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
Let's change some minds.

646
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,980
I'm sorry, I spilled on the thing.

647
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,980
We got another Yahoo?

648
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,980
Yeah, sure.

649
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Hit me.

650
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,980
How about this one?

651
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,980
This one, oh man, there's so many good ones.

652
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,980
Thank you to everybody who sent these in.

653
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
This one was sent in by Don Ames.

654
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
Thank you, Don.

655
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

656
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

657
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm going to try refreshing the page.

658
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
Do you have a Wi-Fi?

659
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
I'm on that.

660
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
Those fat pipes.

661
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Thank you, big Sandy.

662
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,980
Sandy is the IT person here.

663
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Fun bit of trivia for people who live here.

664
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
When we tell people we were doing the show, the Big Sandy,

665
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
everybody was like, whoa.

666
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,980
And then we had to tell them it's like, no, not where the He-Man

667
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,980
live stunt show would be.

668
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Also, it's 1992.

669
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Yeah, not where they do World of Wheels and have all the trucks

670
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,980
and tractors come in, but like over here where they do.

671
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,980
In the prom crypt.

672
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
This actually might be the room I had my prom in.

673
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
Oh, yeah.

674
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,980
No, this place is a regular like teen boner storage facility.

675
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,980
There are prom boner ghosts all over this place.

676
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,980
Oh, I just walked into a cold spot.

677
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,980
I once saw American hero and West Virginia native Chuck Yeager,

678
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
first man to break the sound barrier.

679
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
What's up, Chuck?

680
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,980
All right.

681
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,980
I didn't make it, but you want to talk about cool intros.

682
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,980
I want to tell Chuck Yeager, come onto this stage in sweats.

683
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,980
Is my wife in this room?

684
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Am I lying, Sydney?

685
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Come on the stage in sweats and say, I got this video about me.

686
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,980
We're going to watch that first.

687
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
10 minutes.

688
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
What, Chuck?

689
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,980
Did you just start with a video about yourself that you started?

690
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,980
He introed a video about himself.

691
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Sydney, am I lying?

692
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
She says, no, I'm not lying.

693
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,980
No, for those of you at home, no, he is not lying.

694
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Also, for those of you at home, no, we literally

695
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,980
did that exact same thing when we introed our show, kind of.

696
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
OK, but wait.

697
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Hold on, wait.

698
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

699
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
It's fine because we're not wearing sweatpants.

700
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Oh, dang.

701
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,980
The difference is we were singing in Christmas pageants

702
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
and he was breaking the sound barrier.

703
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
So I feel like an a-hole.

704
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
OK, go ahead.

705
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,980
And now a 10 minute video of Chuck Yeager.

706
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,980
I wish.

707
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
He's a hero.

708
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
He's got to be so much better than our stupid show.

709
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,980
I don't know.

710
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,980
Fascinating life, that guy.

711
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Chuck Yeager asks.

712
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
Wouldn't it be great if he was like a 10 minute video of me

713
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,980
knitting my true fashion?

714
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:19,980
Chuck Yeager asks, who stole my Christmas goose?

715
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Who stole my Christmas goose?

716
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:33,980
I built a fence around him and it was 12 feet high.

717
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Just now.

718
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,980
Picture it now.

719
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Yeah, my reading comprehension is just now kicking.

720
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,980
That's a high A fence.

721
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
I built a fence around him and it was 12 feet high

722
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,980
so he couldn't jump out.

723
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,980
And I know he didn't run away, but he did.

724
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,980
But he know, but he know there.

725
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,980
And I can't find him anywhere.

726
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Who stole my Christmas goose?

727
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,980
It was the Hanukkah Fox.

728
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,980
The Hanukkah Fox snapped the neck of your Christmas goose

729
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,980
with his powerful jaws.

730
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
That's it.

731
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,980
That's the shortest sentence in the English language

732
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
that has all of the letters in it.

733
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:22,980
The Hanukkah Fox snapped the Christmas goose's neck.

734
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Well, that was good.

735
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Listen, a goose is not a VTOL bird.

736
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,980
It cannot just like, whoop, up and go.

737
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,980
It needs a running start.

738
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,980
If this is a small enough pen, then we have a locked room

739
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,980
mystery on our hands now.

740
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,980
When you first read this, I was literally picturing a fence

741
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,980
just wide enough for the goose to be at it.

742
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
Like the goose wouldn't even have room to turn around.

743
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,980
We're talking about the barrel of a goose gun.

744
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
Yes.

745
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,980
But then I saw it 12 feet high, the circumference of a foot,

746
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,980
tops, I don't know, the diameter of a bird.

747
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,980
You built a goose silo for your one goose.

748
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,980
This would all be a lot funnier if this wasn't how most

749
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,980
of the chickens we eat are raised.

750
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,980
Jiminy creaminy.

751
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
What's up?

752
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,980
And you know what we feed them?

753
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Fossil fuels.

754
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Think about it.

755
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
A lot of agendas.

756
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
Wake up.

757
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,980
Wake up, it's a hotter one out there.

758
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,980
We're boiling our geese alive.

759
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
This is my new character.

760
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,980
Guy laughing at a thing that isn't that funny.

761
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Who stole the Christmas goose?

762
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,980
Sorry.

763
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,980
Who stole the Christmas goose?

764
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,980
Justin, you made a lot of jokes, but no firm denial.

765
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,980
It was me.

766
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,980
I stole the Christmas goose.

767
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,980
I thought the goose stole it.

768
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,980
It's going to be okay.

769
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Yeah, I know.

770
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,980
It seems like quite the turn, but we got to end for it.

771
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Don't worry.

772
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
We're not like J.J. Abrams.

773
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,980
We got an actual outro for this thing.

774
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
What the?

775
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,980
What is going on?

776
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
No, no, no, no, no.

777
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Shut up.

778
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
It was a lost joke.

779
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
It wasn't like a Star Wars thing.

780
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
It was not topical.

781
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
Don't worry.

782
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,980
Don't get it twisted.

783
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
Here's a true story.

784
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,980
I ate goose for the first time two years ago.

785
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,980
My mother-in-law made it for Christmas.

786
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,980
And it tasted fine, but I realized that it is very hard to add a new animal to the list

787
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
of animals you eat.

788
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,980
Like, it's just like it moves them from one column into another column.

789
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
Like, welcome.

790
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
I'm eating you now.

791
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
Welcome to the things I eat.

792
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Welcome to the Justin Tummy Club.

793
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,980
Welcome to the Tummy Club.

794
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
Put it back in.

795
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Now when I see you flocking through the sky, I think, mm-hmm.

796
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,980
Yep.

797
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
Yep.

798
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
Why don't you flock on down here?

799
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,980
When you do that, does it push another one out?

800
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I added goose, and now I can't have fish anymore.

801
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
No.

802
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
No, that's the bad thing.

803
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Eventually, it just becomes me, like, mad eater lad.

804
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Just like, I'll eat the mic.

805
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,980
I don't care.

806
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,980
So it's kind of like a weird version of the most dangerous game where you just have to

807
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,980
keep eating until you've eaten the most dangerous animal, and then you have to eat man.

808
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
The most delicious game.

809
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,980
The most delicious game.

810
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,980
And, like, Justin's great-great-great-great-grandchildren will be like, all right, capybara, you're the

811
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,980
last one.

812
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,980
Come on, it's on.

813
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
The most elusive game, capybara.

814
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Come on, capybara.

815
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
Well, no, they're the cutest game.

816
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
Why would you want to eat one of those?

817
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,980
But then you eat them, and you're like, I caught them all.

818
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,980
I've had it all.

819
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Capybara, dolphin, bulbasaur, all of it.

820
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,980
Time to turn in my tummy decks.

821
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
All right.

822
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
All right.

823
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
This is moral.

824
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Science says that you're an animal, but I don't believe it.

825
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
But there's only one way to settle this.

826
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,980
Come on in.

827
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Come on in.

828
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
The tummy's fine.

829
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,980
Plankton, I'm just, I'm gonna hate this.

830
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,980
But I gotta know.

831
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
I can eat a billion of you at once.

832
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Think of the possibilities.

833
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,980
Hey, hope everybody's having a real good time at this live show we recorded.

834
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Before we thank any of our sponsors, I want to say a huge thank you to Heart, the theater

835
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,980
group that provided our carolers for us during the show.

836
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
You didn't come in so great through the final mix.

837
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,980
It was one of those, you had to be, one of those Patton and McElroy, you had to be there

838
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
moments.

839
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,980
But every summer they do theater in Huntington, and if you can get by, I think you're really

840
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
gonna enjoy it.

841
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
I love it.

842
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Two thumbs up.

843
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
I love theater.

844
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
I love Heart.

845
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
I love Huntington.

846
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Last year they did a play that our nanny wrote.

847
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,980
I want to say a big thank you also to Zip Recruiter.

848
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,980
When you're short staffed, there's no time to deal with dozens of different job sites.

849
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:43,980
With ziprecruiter.com, you can post to 100 plus job sites with one single click and be

850
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,980
instantly matched to candidates from over six million resumes.

851
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
I'm so hung over.

852
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,980
I'm just realizing I'm so hung over from last squats.

853
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
Look at me.

854
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
We're all together right now.

855
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Day after candle lights, day one, when we did our live show.

856
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,980
This is day zero.

857
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,980
It's day zero, and now we're all together, and my brothers are watching me do my post

858
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,980
hangover squats.

859
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
Watch me now.

860
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Squat.

861
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
That's one.

862
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
Two.

863
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
Reps.

864
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
You keep squatting.

865
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
Travis.

866
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
You are doing an excellent plie.

867
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Zip Recruiter has been used by over 400 businesses, and you can try it, right?

868
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
400,000.

869
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
Well, it is also over 400.

870
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,980
Okay, you are right, but the copy does say 400,000.

871
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,980
Go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

872
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,980
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

873
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
No, Travis, you do it.

874
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
Go.

875
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Burn it.

876
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
Okay.

877
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Well, we also are sponsored this week by Harry's.

878
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,980
You've heard us talk about Harry's before, but in case you haven't, Harry's Razors offer

879
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,980
high quality shaves.

880
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,980
It's better for your face and your wallet.

881
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,980
Maybe you've gone to like, I don't know, a Walgreens CVS, and you're like, I need to

882
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
get some razor blades.

883
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,980
And the dude's like, all right, well, first you have to find me, and he hides in like

884
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,980
the snack aisle, and then you gotta find him, and he unlocks the thing, and then he's like,

885
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,980
these razor blades are gonna be $100.

886
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
I haven't shaved in a long time.

887
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Okay, great.

888
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,980
And so Harry's, in fact, is much cheaper, but way better.

889
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,980
You can get a starter set for just $15, and that includes a razor, foaming shave gel,

890
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,980
or shave cream, and three razor blades, plus free shipping.

891
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:22,980
But if you go to harrys.com, you can get $5 off the starter set with the code MYBROTHER,

892
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
all one word.

893
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Start shaving better today.

894
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Got a quick text.

895
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
I got a message for Ian also.

896
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
It wasn't in the text.

897
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
Hey, it's Ian.

898
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
I'm texting you.

899
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
I got a message for Fiona.

900
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
All right, so let me try again.

901
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
I strike that, reverse it.

902
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Hey, it's Fiona.

903
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,980
I was reading the phone upside down.

904
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Hey, it's Fiona.

905
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
I got a message for Ian.

906
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,980
The text says, wishing you the most magical birthday, wiggling to that nice blonde girl,

907
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
and making prostitutes.

908
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Remember, someone is going to die today.

909
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
What is this?

910
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,980
It's not candle nights is what it isn't.

911
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
I'm sure they didn't mean for this to go up on our candle nights.

912
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
Travis is taking his shirt off.

913
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,980
I love you guys so much.

914
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
That's all right.

915
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Yeah, happy birthday, Ian, and a happy candle nights, and a happy wiggling, I suppose.

916
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Wiggling, happy wiggling.

917
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Travis, we got another message.

918
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Hit me, dude.

919
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:21,980
This message is for Just Fisher Parentheses Done, and it's from Johnny Lev.

920
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,980
To the best, best man there is, congrats on finally squeezing that baby out.

921
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,980
Now that the whole preggo thing is over, and you're free of responsibility, you can spend

922
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,980
all your time planning my bachelor party.

923
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
Good work.

924
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,980
You're the best.

925
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
Does this get me out of babysitting?

926
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
It does, Johnny.

927
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Congratulations, and joyous candle nights to everybody.

928
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Thanks again to everybody who came out to our show.

929
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
We hope you had a lot of fun.

930
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
We know we did.

931
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Let's get back into it.

932
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,980
So one of the things heading into candle nights we discussed on the show was that we didn't

933
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,980
know all that much about Hanukkah.

934
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,980
As represented by the decorations on stage, we tried, and we failed.

935
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
There's just none for sale.

936
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Dollar General, not a huge Hanukkah selection.

937
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,980
That's a regional problem, and not really our problem.

938
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
We tried.

939
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,980
I've seen one delightful person here in a Hanukkah sweatshirt, and I appreciate that.

940
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Thank you.

941
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Oh, it lights up.

942
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
How glorious.

943
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
How wonderful.

944
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
So I wanted to take a minute.

945
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,980
I constructed a report.

946
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
It wasn't even mine.

947
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
Honestly, it wasn't even mine.

948
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,980
I took it, I copied and pasted it from the internet, but it did have a lot of words that

949
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:41,980
I didn't understand, so I had to translate them, and I would like to read it for you

950
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
now.

951
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,980
It's titled, Hanukkah, colon, history.

952
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:56,980
Unlike many Jewish holidays, Hanukkah, also known as the festival of Lutah, is not mentioned

953
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
in the Bible.

954
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,980
The historical events upon which the celebration is based are recorded in Maccabees 1 and 2,

955
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,980
two books contained within a later collection of writings known as the Poopkins.

956
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Although Hanukkah is considered a minor Jewish festival, today it ranks, along with squeegee

957
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,980
and squelch, as one of the most beloved Jewish family holidays.

958
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:30,980
In the year 168 BCE, the hungover Syrian tyrant, Don Cheadle, sent his soldiers to Jerusalem.

959
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,980
The Syrians desecrated the pizza roll.

960
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Will you guys just raise your hands if it gets anti-Semitic, like a little, like when

961
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
you're anti-Semitic...

962
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Not you in the back.

963
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:48,980
Cheadle also abolished taters, outlawing the observance of Shabbat and the festivals,

964
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:54,980
as well as booty-touching. Altars and idols were set up for the worship of Greek gods,

965
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,980
and he offered Jews two options, conversion or Nantucket.

966
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:10,980
On the 25th day of the Hebrew month of croissants, in 168 BCE, the pizza roll was renamed for

967
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,980
the Greek god Tim Curry.

968
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:20,980
A resistance movement led by a priestly family known as Jingles, or Maccabees, developed

969
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,980
against the cruelty of Cheadle.

970
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,980
The head of the family was Bodacious, an elderly man.

971
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,980
I'm actually learning a lot from this.

972
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,980
His son, Hamilton, became the chief strategist.

973
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,980
That's not one that's added in.

974
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,980
That's just a word I can't say.

975
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,980
Yeah, just try to say strategist, but it makes it up.

976
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,980
Oh, I didn't say it. Never mind. I'm an idiot.

977
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,980
And military leader of the resistance, though outnumbered, Hamilton Jingles and his fighters

978
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,980
miraculously won two major battles, routing the Syrians sloppily.

979
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Hanukkah, which means moist, is the festival...

980
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,980
A lot of hands on that one. That one had an impact on the audience.

981
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,980
...is the festival that commemorates the purification and undulation of the Temple.

982
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,980
Following, and this, not a word, changed.

983
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Following the defilement caused by the Greeks during their occupation of the Holy Place.

984
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,980
Today, the holiday reminds Jews to rededicate themselves to stand against forces that would

985
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,980
destroy Judaism and to keep alive the flame of Jewish religion, culture, and people.

986
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
No, you really are just going full blown Wikipedia right now.

987
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,980
So that it may be passed on to the next generation.

988
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,980
The end.

989
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,980
According to the legend, when the Maccabees entered the Temple and began to reclaim it

990
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,980
from the Greeks, they immediately re-lit their nur-tamin, which translates to...

991
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,980
Yes, boo louder. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me that energy.

992
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:52,980
...which translates to lugubrious milquetoast, which burned constantly in the Temple and

993
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,980
has a parallel in our synagogues to this day.

994
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,980
In the Temple, they found a single jar of calamari...

995
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,980
There's whaling. There's actual whaling.

996
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,980
...which was sufficient for only one day.

997
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,980
The gallivant, who was sent to secure additional calamari, took eight days to gavort, and

998
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,980
miraculously, the single jar of oil continued to hogwash until his return.

999
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,980
I am feeding on it.

1000
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,980
The rabbis of the Talmud attributed the eight days of Hanukkah to the miracle of this single

1001
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,980
jar of calamari.

1002
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,980
The end.

1003
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,980
I'm gonna say something a little contentious here.

1004
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,980
I don't take it out of context, ever.

1005
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:44,980
But if it means that that hadn't just happened, then I wish Hanukkah had never been invented.

1006
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,980
That's how... I gotta hand raise on that. I guess that's fair.

1007
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,980
If you could save us from that, I think it would be worth it.

1008
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,980
I thought that was informative and insightful.

1009
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,980
You did go on a weirdly, like, educational run there.

1010
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Like a Christmas special from the mid-80s. I wanted there to be one moment where everyone

1011
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,980
went, huh, and then came back to hating it.

1012
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,980
And then Screech still does run in after they learn a lesson about drugs.

1013
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,980
And here's Screech right now.

1014
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,980
I'm sorry about booing you.

1015
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,980
That's all right.

1016
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,980
This past Thanksgiving, my partner and I celebrated Thanksgiving at my parent's parent...

1017
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,980
I'm sorry, partner's parent's house.

1018
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,980
The parents live locally, but since we wanted to spend Friday with them as well...

1019
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,980
You stuttered through a phrase that I really enjoy.

1020
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,980
My partner's parents...

1021
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
After that.

1022
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
I celebrated Thanksgiving at my partner's parents...

1023
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,980
Just do the whole thing.

1024
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,980
This past Thanksgiving, my partner and I celebrated Thanksgiving at my partner's parent's house.

1025
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,980
The parents live locally, but since we wanted to spend Friday with them as well, and since

1026
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,980
we don't have our own car, we thought it might be best to just sleep over Thursday night.

1027
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Thursday night is highlighted here on Travis's iPad in case he wants to make an appointment for them.

1028
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,980
However, maybe just stop by, see how things are going.

1029
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,980
However, we were informed by the parents that it is expected that we would not share a bed.

1030
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,980
My partner and I have been together for nine months.

1031
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,980
We're both well into adulthood.

1032
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,980
We have completely lost this audience.

1033
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,980
And the...

1034
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
Yeah, because it's like not funny.

1035
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,980
I was...

1036
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,980
Oh.

1037
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
Sad libs is a bad bit.

1038
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,980
Nobody likes it.

1039
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,980
So say we all.

1040
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,980
My partner and I have been together for nine months.

1041
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,980
We're both well into adulthood.

1042
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,980
Parents like me are progressive in most every other way.

1043
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,980
My partner and I are, of course, classy enough to not get busy on the family room futon during our stay.

1044
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,980
But we're not married and have no plans for it.

1045
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,980
So I'm not sure when circumstances would change the parents' mind about this.

1046
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,980
And the problem is certain to rear its ugly head again.

1047
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,980
Brothers, how can I convince them to let us sleep how we are most comfortable?

1048
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,980
Seeking the solace of shared slumber in Cincinnati.

1049
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,980
What if your partner's parents are just saving this for a gift?

1050
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,980
So maybe not like 2019 under the candle night's bush.

1051
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,980
What's that?

1052
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,980
Oh, it's an envelope.

1053
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,980
Oh, no, it's probably a gift card at a Home Depot.

1054
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,980
Boo!

1055
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,980
But then you open it up.

1056
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,980
It's not.

1057
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,980
It's a little letter from your partner's parents.

1058
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,980
And it just says, go for it.

1059
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:17,980
Connect 4, do it!

1060
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,980
What if it just says, we know and we're cool?

1061
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:27,980
Because you have to assume at that point, 2019, three years, four years from now, they know they're doing it.

1062
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
I like more of a demand.

1063
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,980
Go for it!

1064
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,980
Do it!

1065
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,980
No.

1066
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,980
What's worse?

1067
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,980
Like what?

1068
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,980
That's worse, right?

1069
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,980
Definitely that's worse than saying like, go for it.

1070
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,980
You're cool.

1071
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
I want to say that I do like...

1072
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,980
Aren't you excited to be able to sleep like with the room as cold as you want and the fan on?

1073
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,980
Because I'd be like a little excited about that.

1074
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,980
Like, oh, I'm just gonna make it like 40 degrees in here.

1075
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:01,980
And my question is, if the debate is whether or not you can sleep on the family room futon together,

1076
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,980
if you're not allowed to sleep together, where do you end up if the family room futon is the best option?

1077
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,980
You're in the garage.

1078
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,980
Like what's the other option that you get secluded to?

1079
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
You're in the dog bed.

1080
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:22,980
You have to sleep with the parents.

1081
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:29,980
Meredith and Joey, I had a bad dream.

1082
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,980
That you guys are closed minded.

1083
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:38,980
Jeremy, we've laid some blankets on the floor and now you'll listen to us do it.

1084
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Yeah, we just...

1085
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,980
No, no, no, no.

1086
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,980
This is how two adults make love.

1087
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,980
Take notes.

1088
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,980
Still no bad words.

1089
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,980
Just remember, no bad words.

1090
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,980
We're very progressive.

1091
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,980
We just want to make sure you know what you're doing in there.

1092
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,980
With it.

1093
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,980
Watch Meredith and Joey for a second.

1094
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,980
Sorry?

1095
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,980
You probably thought that was an affectation.

1096
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,980
Oh, that's her names with W's.

1097
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,980
We're very progressive parents.

1098
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,980
Well, now they're just...

1099
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,980
Yeah, that's doesn't mean.

1100
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,980
Do you guys want...

1101
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,980
How about we do one final yahoo and then we...

1102
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,980
Not the final yahoo.

1103
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1104
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,980
We'll do another yahoo.

1105
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,980
Okay.

1106
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,980
And then we'll turn it to the audience and do some audience questions.

1107
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,980
Okay.

1108
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,980
We'll just...

1109
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
Don't line up or anything.

1110
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,980
We'll just yell at you when you put your hands up and call you forward.

1111
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,980
Does everybody know the rule about questions at live shows?

1112
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,980
It's printed on the microphone.

1113
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,980
We brought no bummers with us, by the way.

1114
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,980
You can see it right there.

1115
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,980
And also no cursing.

1116
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,980
Yeah, no cursing.

1117
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,980
Yeah.

1118
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,980
I swan to John.

1119
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,980
You guys are going to think it's funny.

1120
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,980
I'm going to immortalize myself by ruining candle nights.

1121
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,980
No, I mean you will.

1122
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,980
Yeah, it'll work.

1123
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,980
For this room, but you don't make it on the recording or any podcast recording from now

1124
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,980
to the end of time.

1125
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,980
We got the juice to make that happen.

1126
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,980
You want to be on Marin?

1127
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,980
No dice.

1128
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,980
We'll find somebody who knows that guy and say, hey, they're off limits.

1129
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,980
I just want to send in...

1130
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,980
I just want to finish my plug.

1131
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,980
Thank you, Ear Trumpet Labs.

1132
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,980
They made that for us.

1133
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,980
Yeah, thank you.

1134
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,980
Beautiful microphones.

1135
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
No bummers.

1136
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,980
Sent in by Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder.

1137
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,980
Zoe Kinski.

1138
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,980
It's by Yahoo Answers user Passenger Wow Widow, which...

1139
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,980
Sorry?

1140
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,980
Oh, it's okay.

1141
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,980
World of Warcraft Widow is saying, okay.

1142
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
Wow.

1143
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,980
It's either ways, but it's better than like, wow, I'm a widow.

1144
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,980
Wow.

1145
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,980
Wow, you're a widow.

1146
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,980
Wow.

1147
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,980
Yeah, there's a little Christopher Walken in there.

1148
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,980
That's the only word I can do.

1149
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,980
If Dwight was here, he's got a pretty good walking, but my only walking is wow.

1150
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,980
Wow.

1151
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,980
All right.

1152
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:49,980
Passenger Wow Widow asks, if I am a super good girl, will Santa bring me Robert Downey

1153
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,980
Jr. for Christmas?

1154
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:59,980
What I love about this question is the thought of Santa showing up at Robert Downey Jr.'s

1155
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,980
house like, it's time.

1156
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:08,980
The bargain we made when I put you in Iron Man.

1157
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,980
Time to pay the piper who is Santa.

1158
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,980
And you know, I would like to think of RDJ the dude would go, I get it.

1159
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,980
You?

1160
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,980
I get it.

1161
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,980
RDJ.

1162
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,980
Sorry?

1163
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,980
Okay.

1164
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,980
RDJ.

1165
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,980
Your personal friend and mentor.

1166
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,980
I'm pretty Hollywood at this point.

1167
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,980
Yeah, sure.

1168
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,980
Then he would go, you're right.

1169
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,980
You're right.

1170
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,980
And just walk into the bag.

1171
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,980
No, this is on me.

1172
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,980
I've lived a good life.

1173
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,980
Could it be a?

1174
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,980
Tell Mark Ruffalo I said I love you.

1175
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,980
Could it be a Robert Downey Jr.?

1176
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,980
Hi, I'm Bob Downey the second.

1177
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,980
And I want to thank you for having me to your boudoir.

1178
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:51,980
I hope to show you some challenging yet comfortable lovemaking positions.

1179
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,980
Shall we begin with the smooches?

1180
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,980
Shall we begin with some heavy petty?

1181
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,980
I hear it's somebody's special day here.

1182
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,980
I heard you've been a very good girl.

1183
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,980
This beats the heck out of the tile store.

1184
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:11,980
Wow, I'm really excited to be the Bob Downey in your boudoir.

1185
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:17,980
Sorry, I don't know any other words for it other than boudoir.

1186
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,980
I meant to learn some, but I didn't.

1187
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,980
It's a busy season at the tile store.

1188
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:29,980
I was in a bicycle accident and I lost some words.

1189
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,980
Luckily not bicycle or accident, because can you imagine?

1190
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,980
How would I even describe my situation?

1191
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,980
I was in a two-wheeled mobile accident.

1192
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,980
You know pedal pedals?

1193
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,980
I did a bad on one of them.

1194
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,980
On a pedal pedal I did a bad and boom, ouchie.

1195
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,980
I'm Bob Downey the second.

1196
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
I have a head contusion.

1197
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,980
Bob Downey the second, I'm glad you're here.

1198
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,980
You're better than Robert Downey Jr.

1199
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:04,980
You've explained this to me 18 times, Bob Downey the second.

1200
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:10,980
Sorry, I had this bicycle, uh-oh.

1201
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,980
I think there's a sliding scale for how good you have to be

1202
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,980
and how bad Robert Downey Jr. has to be.

1203
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,980
Because it's like you can be as good as you want,

1204
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,980
but unless Robert Downey Jr. has failed Santa in some way,

1205
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:27,980
I don't think he can close on that deal.

1206
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,980
I don't know, I didn't like Iron Man 2 very much.

1207
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,980
So now he has to be someone's servant?

1208
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,980
Yeah, I guess so.

1209
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,980
That's a pretty high standard now that I think about it.

1210
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,980
I don't want to be held to that standard.

1211
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,980
We all have off days.

1212
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,980
Questions from the audience?

1213
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,980
Yeah, let's do it.

1214
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,980
Let's start on this side.

1215
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,980
You want it too much.

1216
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,980
You weren't the first hand up.

1217
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,980
Yes, with the finger pointing at themself, yes.

1218
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,980
Hi, hello, hey, hey.

1219
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,980
Not you, Michael Sullivan,

1220
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,980
stage manager for our live extravaganza.

1221
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,980
We'll do you later.

1222
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,980
Hello, sir, what is your name?

1223
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,980
My name's Jordan.

1224
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,980
Do you understand the rule?

1225
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,980
No bummers.

1226
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,980
How can we help?

1227
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,980
I travel a lot for work,

1228
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
and I have to be in a place for a long period of time

1229
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,980
on a project.

1230
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,980
Can you speak just right up in here?

1231
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,980
Like an old timey radio show.

1232
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,980
Pretend you're doing an ad for Ajax.

1233
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,980
You can just lean down.

1234
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,980
You don't have to do a weird squatty thing.

1235
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,980
You bend at the waist, right?

1236
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,980
I don't want to assume.

1237
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Can you stop kibitzing for a second?

1238
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,980
Sure can.

1239
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,980
I have to travel for work and be in a place

1240
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,980
for a long period of time.

1241
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,980
I'm living in a corporate apartment in New York City.

1242
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,980
I'm single, and I can't really decorate.

1243
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,980
I'll buy the rights to your TV show right now.

1244
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
How ready are you to mingle?

1245
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,980
How zany is your neighbor?

1246
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,980
The mingling is like mid-level ready to mingle.

1247
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,980
I am single and somewhat ready to mingle.

1248
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,980
So as I am ready,

1249
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,980
like I need to...

1250
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
Right now it's like filled with like Pier 1 imports,

1251
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,980
like gross furniture and stuff,

1252
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,980
because I didn't furnish it.

1253
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,980
So, but I also can't put anything permanent in

1254
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,980
because I'm leaving in March.

1255
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,980
So how do I put together an apartment that feels like me

1256
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,980
without spending any money

1257
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,980
and also...

1258
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,980
So let me understand.

1259
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,980
You can't spend any money on nothing permanent,

1260
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,980
but it has to really scream Jordan.

1261
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,980
Yes.

1262
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,980
That's exactly it.

1263
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,980
Can you write over the wall,

1264
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,980
to the door,

1265
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,980
on the outside of the door,

1266
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,980
Jordan's place.

1267
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,980
Well, I did that, so that's done.

1268
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,980
Done.

1269
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,980
Darn.

1270
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,980
Ooh, that was close.

1271
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,980
Can you...

1272
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Can you turn on the furniture upside down,

1273
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,980
just like Jordan lives here,

1274
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,980
he's a real free spirit.

1275
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,980
You know Jordan.

1276
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,980
He's a real free spirit.

1277
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,980
He doesn't like to sit on things.

1278
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,980
He doesn't like to sit on things.

1279
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,980
You know those noonie and noonie from that funny SNL skit?

1280
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,980
He's like those people.

1281
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,980
Cool.

1282
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,980
Yeah, Jordan,

1283
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,980
you're kind of tying our hands,

1284
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,980
because normally I just say,

1285
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,980
go out and just buy the most expensive rug.

1286
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,980
Right.

1287
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,980
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1288
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,980
Stop, everybody, stop.

1289
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,980
Wait, wait, wait, shut up, shut up.

1290
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
Unless...

1291
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,980
Okay, now there will be some investment in this,

1292
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,980
but you need to get a storage unit,

1293
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,980
move all the furniture into that unit,

1294
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,980
and then get nothing else in your unit.

1295
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,980
And then when people come in,

1296
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,980
you look at them in the eye,

1297
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,980
and you say, think about me,

1298
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,980
picture the furniture.

1299
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,980
Oh, my God.

1300
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,980
He is the pan.

1301
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,980
Yeah, and then, yeah, bang-a-rang.

1302
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,980
Oh, there you are, Jordan.

1303
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,980
Oh, there you are, Jordan.

1304
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,980
Knowing what you know about me,

1305
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,980
inflatable furniture.

1306
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,980
You're doing it, and then the furniture will appear.

1307
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Yeah, bang-a-rang, you did it.

1308
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,980
It's a futon made of dogs.

1309
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,980
What?

1310
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,980
I'm going to have a seat on it.

1311
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,980
Oh, God, I broke my tailbone.

1312
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,980
That's so Jordan.

1313
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
I feel so unsafe in Jordan's place.

1314
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,980
Jordan's always breaking tailbones.

1315
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,980
Okay, can you make them

1316
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,980
draw a picture and then decorate

1317
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,980
the apartment with the pictures that they drew?

1318
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,980
Like, this is what others have seen.

1319
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,980
What will you see?

1320
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,980
I'll be back in three hours.

1321
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,980
I hope we didn't have anything pressing to do.

1322
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,980
Did we help you, Jordan?

1323
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,980
That was so good. Thank you so much.

1324
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,980
Thank you, Jordan.

1325
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,980
I picked the last one.

1326
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,980
Travis, you pick the middle.

1327
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,980
Yes, you should.

1328
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,980
Yes, mustache.

1329
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,980
That was fun.

1330
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,980
That's a jaunty hello.

1331
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,980
Well, hello.

1332
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,980
Oh, boy.

1333
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,980
I see what we're doing here.

1334
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,980
What is your name?

1335
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,980
My name is Bobby.

1336
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,980
Bobby, do you understand the rule?

1337
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,980
No, gosh-darn-bummers.

1338
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,980
There you go, good.

1339
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,980
I travel in town for the holidays

1340
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,980
every year, and over the past couple of years

1341
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,980
my family's been moving Christmas

1342
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,980
back

1343
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,980
gradually. Now, because I'm traveling

1344
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,980
in, I can't necessarily get

1345
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,980
off work for the 18th.

1346
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,980
Oh, whoa.

1347
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,980
How do I stop Christmas from sliding into September?

1348
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,980
Okay.

1349
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,980
I must stop Christmas from coming for now.

1350
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,980
Have you already experienced

1351
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,980
Christmas, Bobby?

1352
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,980
It's been a little while.

1353
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,980
Okay. Like this year, 2015,

1354
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,980
has your Christmas come and gone yet?

1355
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,980
Oh, I missed it.

1356
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,980
Oh, you missed it. Cool.

1357
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,980
Oh, wait, hold on.

1358
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,980
I've got this. Do you know what's great here, Bobby?

1359
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,980
Whenever you roll up is Christmas.

1360
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,980
Yeah.

1361
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,980
You didn't miss Christmas. They did

1362
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,980
Christmas early.

1363
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,980
That's what we learned from the Grinch who stole Christmas, actually.

1364
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,980
If it's not the exchanging of gifts,

1365
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,980
it's the people around you.

1366
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,980
I would legitimately say, like,

1367
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,980
I don't think you did have Christmas

1368
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,980
because Bobby wasn't here.

1369
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,980
Check the pictures.

1370
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,980
Do you see Bobby?

1371
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,980
Let's go to the videotape.

1372
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,980
Yeah, I'm seeing no Bobby here.

1373
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,980
Yeah, no Bobby. I don't think

1374
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,980
you had Christmas because it's about the people.

1375
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,980
I've only known you for 110 seconds,

1376
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,980
but I just know you are

1377
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,980
Christmas.

1378
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,980
I'm not convinced you're not a bunch

1379
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,980
of presents stacked up in jeans

1380
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,980
and a shirt.

1381
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,980
Well, you don't have to...

1382
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,980
I'm not looking at your naked

1383
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,980
boxes.

1384
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,980
Well, now I am.

1385
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,980
He was unwrapping me with his eyes.

1386
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,980
Can you imagine

1387
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
anything more... I think you do a protest

1388
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,980
Christmas on December the 25th.

1389
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,980
Can you imagine anything more rad than

1390
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,980
Bobby sitting on the floor,

1391
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,980
little Santa hat, pile of presents in front of

1392
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,980
the tree by himself, just like,

1393
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,980
Well, this one's the sandwich maker.

1394
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,980
Thank you to whoever

1395
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,980
got this for me.

1396
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,980
If anyone would like to join me, I'll be in the living room

1397
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,980
while his family's in the kitchen.

1398
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,980
I don't know where we went wrong.

1399
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,980
It's New Year's Eve already.

1400
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,980
Over here, we're a week

1401
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,980
ahead.

1402
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,980
Oh, wait till they lap you, and then it's

1403
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Christmas again.

1404
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,980
The

1405
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,980
stupid thing is they should be pushing it later

1406
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,980
because they can get all the decorations that

1407
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,980
like 50% off.

1408
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Hence our entire like

1409
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,980
scene right now.

1410
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,980
Bobby, does that help?

1411
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,980
Very much so.

1412
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
Justin, pick somebody from the right.

1413
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,980
My turn. If you're a

1414
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,980
non-dude,

1415
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,980
can you raise your hand?

1416
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,980
I want to get a non-dude. There you go.

1417
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,980
Right here. Come on up.

1418
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,980
The mic is so far away.

1419
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,980
This Christmas...

1420
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,980
Alright, let's give him a big round of applause.

1421
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,980
Hello,

1422
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,980
and what is your name? Hello, my name's

1423
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,980
Nathania. Hi, Nathania.

1424
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,980
Is that with an N? Nathania? Yes, it is.

1425
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,980
Okay, welcome. And do you know the

1426
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,980
rule? Yes, I do. No bummers.

1427
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,980
Okay. Okay. How can we help?

1428
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,980
So, my husband, he's the best.

1429
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,980
Okay. Alright!

1430
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,980
Sounds like you don't need any help.

1431
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,980
Yeah, sounds like you're fine. I don't.

1432
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,980
He's awesome. I've been

1433
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,980
waiting for the results of that contest

1434
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,980
all day.

1435
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,980
And to find out like this, Nathania?

1436
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,980
Yeah, I know.

1437
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,980
This how you do me?

1438
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,980
Steve Harvey should

1439
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,980
come out and announce the results, right guys?

1440
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,980
Tabagal!

1441
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,980
And the best husband is

1442
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,980
Griffin McElroy. No, wait a minute.

1443
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,980
I'm like on

1444
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,980
news alerts, like, what just happened?

1445
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,980
So I can reference that. Freshest ref.

1446
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,980
Freshest ref award goes to

1447
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,980
Griffin. No, wait, it went to Travis.

1448
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,980
Steve Harvey, not again!

1449
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,980
Nathania, how can we

1450
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,980
help?

1451
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,980
So, he

1452
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,980
knows what he likes.

1453
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,980
And it's hard to get

1454
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,980
him gifts. Sure.

1455
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,980
So I don't want any advice

1456
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,980
on what gifts to give him. Good.

1457
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,980
I want to know, how

1458
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,980
can we, myself

1459
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,980
and his family, make him

1460
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,980
like whatever gifts we give him?

1461
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,980
Nathania,

1462
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,980
is your husband here right now?

1463
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,980
He is. He brought me here.

1464
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,980
This is my Christmas present.

1465
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,980
Oh, man, he won. Nice.

1466
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,980
That's hard to beat. He's the best.

1467
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,980
Mr. Nathania?

1468
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,980
Can I give you...

1469
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,980
Did you raise your hand? Yes.

1470
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,980
Sorry, what? No, we're singing with

1471
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,980
Mr. Nathania. Yeah, it's not that important.

1472
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,980
You're not at the microphone.

1473
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,980
I'm gonna

1474
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
tell you a lesson that I learned

1475
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,980
when I was about eight years old.

1476
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,980
And that is that gifts

1477
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,980
given to you are

1478
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,980
not for you.

1479
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,980
They are for the person who gave them

1480
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,980
to you so that you can be thankful

1481
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,980
for all the love that they showed you

1482
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,980
in that gift. And if you look up from the gift

1483
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,980
and go, you're

1484
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,980
the worst.

1485
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,980
I learned that

1486
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,980
at eight. I doubt very much he does that.

1487
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,980
But there is

1488
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,980
some nuance to the situation that Travis does not.

1489
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,980
That is impossible.

1490
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,980
But this is the lie in what you

1491
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,980
just said is that if you

1492
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,980
really love somebody and you cannot

1493
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,980
tell instantly

1494
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,980
that they don't like something,

1495
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,980
right away, everybody...

1496
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,980
Oh, it's a lie we tell each other.

1497
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,980
It's a lie we tell each other like, oh, you hated that

1498
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,980
and I know you hated that, but that's not what this

1499
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,980
is about. I get it. Yeah, you have to

1500
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,980
go to your grave like, no, absolutely not.

1501
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,980
I loved it, and it was the best coffee maker

1502
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,980
I ever got in my entire life. I never used it.

1503
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,980
It was great.

1504
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,980
Get a present-receiving

1505
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,980
catchphrase.

1506
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,980
What? No, listen.

1507
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,980
It's something I've been

1508
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,980
doing for years, and you guys probably haven't noticed.

1509
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,980
I'm kind of part of the kimono right now, but...

1510
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,980
Don't look!

1511
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,980
Get a

1512
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,980
present-receiving catchphrase.

1513
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,980
So every time you get a present, no matter what it is,

1514
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,980
it doesn't matter. This is a

1515
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,980
gift-agnostic

1516
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,980
idiom, and don't steal mine because

1517
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,980
I need it, but just be like,

1518
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,980
oh, tight!

1519
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,980
That makes so much sense

1520
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,980
now.

1521
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,980
But everybody has one

1522
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,980
of those, right?

1523
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,980
Mine is like,

1524
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,980
I'll open it.

1525
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,980
That's a whole

1526
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,980
run!

1527
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,980
I do it every

1528
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,980
gift. Mine is just this.

1529
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,980
Ooh, Travis like!

1530
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,980
We all really don't like Travis.

1531
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,980
Christmas is a real horror show.

1532
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,980
We don't use Travis

1533
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,980
gifts anymore. Not even

1534
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,980
invited. Nathaniel,

1535
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,980
can you tape a 20 to

1536
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,980
it somewhere?

1537
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,980
Just tape a 20.

1538
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,980
Who doesn't like that? Yeah. Just hand

1539
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,980
him a 20. Just hand him a 20. Tape to

1540
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,980
like, whatever thing. And ask for five dollars

1541
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,980
back. Or a fake

1542
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,980
price tag on

1543
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,980
it. That's a big

1544
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,980
high price.

1545
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,980
Like one million dollars.

1546
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,980
Wait, Griffin, I'm worried that this side

1547
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,980
of the audience didn't see it. Could you do that one more time?

1548
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,980
Like a high price. Like one million dollars.

1549
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,980
You can purchase the GIF outside

1550
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,980
after the show. Don't worry, folks.

1551
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,980
Yeah, we got DVDs.

1552
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,980
Nathaniel, does that help? Absolutely.

1553
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,980
Great. Thank you.

1554
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,980
She's good at lying if she didn't like

1555
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,980
what she got.

1556
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,980
Let's go

1557
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,980
for one more from the back.

1558
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,980
From the way back. Flashy Hanukkah shirt.

1559
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,980
Flashy Hanukkah shirt, yes. You earned it.

1560
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,980
And I don't mean like

1561
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,980
ostentatious Hanukkah shirt.

1562
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,980
No, it's literally, it is

1563
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,980
illuminated. Hello.

1564
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,980
Hello.

1565
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,980
Did somebody just boo me?

1566
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,980
No. They said hello in a very

1567
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,980
Germanic manner. They said hello the opposite

1568
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,980
of booing you. They did a hello from downtown.

1569
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,980
Hello. What is your name?

1570
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,980
My name is Shaylin. Hi, Shaylin.

1571
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,980
Hey, Shaylin. Hi. Can you scoot over to the

1572
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,980
just close the door? Perfect. There we go.

1573
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,980
Let her rip. Okay. Hi.

1574
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,980
Go for it. I was wondering

1575
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,980
if I was to decorate my home

1576
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,980
for Candle Nights next year,

1577
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,980
what color scheme

1578
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,980
would you say is the official

1579
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,980
color scheme of Candle Nights?

1580
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,980
Whew.

1581
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,980
No, this is a good question.

1582
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,980
No, this is a good question.

1583
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,980
And it's honestly,

1584
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,980
it's honestly as

1585
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,980
one of the three dads

1586
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,980
of Candle Nights.

1587
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,980
It's one of the reasons

1588
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,980
why the holiday

1589
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,980
hasn't caught on as much as

1590
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,980
we would want it to.

1591
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,980
Because the problem is

1592
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,980
the color of Candle Nights

1593
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,980
is fire.

1594
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,980
And you hear,

1595
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,980
you just heard me say that and your brain

1596
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,980
thought like, oh, red. No, you

1597
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,980
misunderstand.

1598
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,980
It's

1599
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,980
fire.

1600
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,980
To do a house up

1601
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,980
like that is...

1602
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,980
Arson.

1603
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,980
I mean, it's arson.

1604
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,980
Everything you see in front of you is

1605
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,980
rigged to explode when the show's over.

1606
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,980
It's going to be quite

1607
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,980
the... Don't stick around.

1608
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,980
Don't stick around. Get out.

1609
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,980
I think that what we just did

1610
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,980
was illegal.

1611
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,980
No, there's nothing flammable.

1612
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,980
Just claiming fire in a big stuff building.

1613
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,980
But fine. No, that was a joke. Clearly

1614
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,980
it's parody fair use. Listen.

1615
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,980
That's how fair use works.

1616
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,980
It's tricky because inside

1617
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,980
you get some candles, whatever.

1618
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,980
Outside, what do you do?

1619
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,980
Outside of a controlled burn?

1620
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,980
Outside of like

1621
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,980
sick like butane

1622
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,980
fountains? Is that even a thing?

1623
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,980
You could also, I was going to say

1624
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,980
like project fire onto your house

1625
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,980
but I feel like that might go poorly.

1626
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,980
They have a name for that, Travis.

1627
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,980
It's somebody whose house is

1628
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
about to be gone.

1629
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,980
You can't project fire onto your house.

1630
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,980
Oh, you meant a picture. Okay, got it.

1631
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Got it. Not literal fire.

1632
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,980
I'm with you now.

1633
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,980
But still, the point

1634
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,980
stands, if somebody has a fire hologram

1635
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,980
on their house, your neighbor's not going to

1636
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,980
drive by and be like, oh, sick.

1637
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,980
I will say, they won't this year

1638
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,980
but maybe soon. They'll be like, oh,

1639
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,980
candle lights. Nice.

1640
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,980
That's all the holidays together.

1641
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,980
A controlled burn on the front facade

1642
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,980
of your house. Get an

1643
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,980
expert. Oh, get an expert to get this

1644
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,980
controlled burn going. But just have

1645
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,980
it spell out, it's cool.

1646
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,980
This is cool.

1647
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,980
This is cool is fine. Don't call the police,

1648
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,980
Dave.

1649
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,980
Again.

1650
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,980
Unless this, if this doesn't,

1651
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,980
if this stops spelling out

1652
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,980
this is cool.

1653
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,980
Call the police or the fire

1654
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,980
people. Unless this is also on fire,

1655
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,980
Dave.

1656
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,980
Then please tell me, Dave.

1657
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,980
I'm so scared.

1658
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,980
His house says it's all

1659
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,980
Oh, no, no, no.

1660
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,980
That's not a word.

1661
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,980
Stop being words. Get them.

1662
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,980
Get the fire.

1663
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,980
Is this a call about the house that's part way

1664
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,980
on fire? Yeah, we've heard about it. No, you don't understand.

1665
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,980
No, no, no. The worm has turned.

1666
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,980
It got worse.

1667
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,980
Does that

1668
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,980
help? That helps a lot.

1669
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,980
Cool. Don't do any of that stuff.

1670
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,980
Thank you.

1671
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,980
Yeah, I think that's

1672
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,980
going to do it. Okay, listen.

1673
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,980
All kidding aside,

1674
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,980
the fact that so many of you

1675
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,980
folks who raise your hand if you're not

1676
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,980
from West Virginia at all.

1677
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,980
Oh, my God. No.

1678
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,980
Anybody not from America?

1679
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,980
Curiosity. All right.

1680
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,980
All right. All right. Cool, cool, cool.

1681
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,980
Thank you so much for coming

1682
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,980
to Candle Nights. Did you have a good time?

1683
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,980
We

1684
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,980
sort of like

1685
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,980
tweet nice stuff to that effect.

1686
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,980
Tweet hashtag Candle Nights.

1687
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,980
Hashtag Candle Nights like I had a great time so we can keep doing it.

1688
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,980
Not that like

1689
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,980
the man is going to keep us from doing it.

1690
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,980
It's pretty much just us and Chase.

1691
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,980
And you can't shut us down, Obama.

1692
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,980
Thank you. By the way, thank you.

1693
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,980
Huge, huge, huge thank you.

1694
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,980
There's so many people I have to thank, but

1695
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,980
Chase Henderson put on this show.

1696
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,980
He's the promoter of our show, Chase Henderson.

1697
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,980
All of Chase's volunteers

1698
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,980
who helped out. Thank you so, so much.

1699
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,980
Thank you to Michael Sullivan,

1700
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,980
who was our stage manager. He did a great job.

1701
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,980
Thank you to

1702
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,980
Dwight

1703
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,980
Slappy. Am I saying that right? Dwight.

1704
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,980
Great.

1705
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,980
Dwight Slappy from Things I Bought Sheets.

1706
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,980
Thank you to Sydney Smurl McElroy.

1707
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,980
Is it McElroy? McElroy?

1708
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,980
McElroy from Sawbones.

1709
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,980
I would also like to say thank you to

1710
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,980
Theresa McElroy. And to Rachel McElroy.

1711
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,980
Let me put you back on this.

1712
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,980
And Clem McElroy and Carol McElroy

1713
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,980
who did all of the beautiful decorations

1714
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,980
that you see on stage.

1715
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,980
Thank you to Jason

1716
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,980
and Tyler Eldridge for being our

1717
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,980
for being the Druids who stole Dwight away.

1718
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,980
Thank you to Boyd Smith for being the Grinch.

1719
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,980
Okay, that's all. Oh wait, one more.

1720
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,980
Thank you to Josh and the folks at Billions for helping us set up.

1721
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,980
Yes, and all the Carolers.

1722
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,980
And the Carolers who named Dad.

1723
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,980
Dad!

1724
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,980
And thank you to Riley. Riley Smurl.

1725
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,980
Riley Smurl, thank you so much.

1726
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,980
I just want to like, I referenced this at the beginning

1727
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,980
about how this was a swearing day.

1728
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,980
It got really thorny there

1729
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,980
like right before we had to come here.

1730
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,980
My baby, about

1731
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,980
literally exactly the time

1732
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,980
we were supposed to leave, my baby threw up

1733
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,980
and had a temperature of 101.

1734
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,980
So it was like, whoa. She's fine now.

1735
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,980
She's fine now.

1736
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,980
I got a video of her playing Ring Around the Rosie.

1737
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,980
Like, she's good. But it was like, it was pretty intense there.

1738
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,980
So, thank you to

1739
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,980
we have another hand to Sydney

1740
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,980
who didn't really want to come, but did anyway.

1741
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,980
Because she loves you.

1742
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,980
And Charlie, if you're listening

1743
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,980
to this in the future,

1744
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,980
we're cool.

1745
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,980
You're fine. You made it.

1746
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,980
My point was it got really thorny

1747
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,980
and I got so stressed out because we got here

1748
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,980
and everything was running behind and I was like really worried

1749
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,980
that it was going to be terrible.

1750
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,980
But like all of our friends and family came together to help us

1751
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,980
put this on. It was real inspirational.

1752
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,980
It was a genuine Candle Nights miracle.

1753
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,980
Thank you all so much.

1754
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,980
And thank you to you, the people who

1755
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,980
like, if you came and stood in line

1756
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,980
I understood it was raining. I'm sorry about that.

1757
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,980
And if you came a long way

1758
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,980
to come see us, that's awesome.

1759
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,980
We're going to be

1760
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,980
over at a bar called

1761
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,980
The Lantern for a little bit.

1762
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,980
Big fans here.

1763
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,980
Some lantern heads in the house.

1764
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,980
It's a 4th and 8th, right?

1765
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,980
4th Avenue and 8th Street. Is that right?

1766
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,980
Yes. Thank you, Sullivan.

1767
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,980
So we'll be over there.

1768
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,980
It's a fun place.

1769
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,980
And is that going to do it for us too, though?

1770
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,980
I think so. You want that final yahoo?

1771
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,980
We're going to do a final yahoo.

1772
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,980
Yeah.

1773
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,980
Yeah, final yahoo and then...

1774
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,980
Then we've got a special Candle Nights carol.

1775
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,980
There's not a lot of Candle Nights carols.

1776
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,980
There is one.

1777
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,980
And we're going to perform that for you.

1778
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,980
But we do have a final yahoo for you.

1779
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,980
Calm down.

1780
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,980
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

1781
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,980
climbing that ladder, Zoe Kinski.

1782
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,980
Sorry, something's going wrong.

1783
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,980
Oh, no, this one was Chuck Yeager too.

1784
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,980
Chuck Yeager asks again.

1785
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,980
Man, he's active on yahoo.

1786
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,980
Did you think Mrs. Doubtfire

1787
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,980
was hot when you were a kid,

1788
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,980
or was that just me?

1789
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,980
Ladies and gentlemen,

1790
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,980
my name has been Justin

1791
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,980
Tyler McElroy.

1792
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,980
And I'm going to be

1793
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,980
Justin Tyler McElroy.

1794
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,980
My name has been and will always be

1795
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,980
Travis Patrick McElroy.

1796
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,980
I'm Griffin Andrew McElroy.

1797
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,980
This is a Candle Nights song.

1798
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,980
Strummin' my sixth string.

1799
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,980
No.

1800
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,980
You already goofed on it.

1801
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,980
The words are on the screen. Read them.

1802
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,980
Okay.

1803
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,980
I followed him.

1804
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,980
Wait, where are you starting?

1805
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,980
Where are you picking up?

1806
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,980
From the beginning of the song!

1807
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,980
Okay, go ahead.

1808
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,980
Go ahead.

1809
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,980
I would have been fine.

1810
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,980
I would have figured it out.

1811
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,980
I'm a frigging professional.

1812
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,980
No, no, no!

1813
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,980
He didn't finish it.

1814
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,980
I didn't finish it.

1815
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,980
I didn't finish it.

1816
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,980
I didn't finish it.

1817
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,980
Let me know when you're ready.

1818
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,980
Oh, my god!

1819
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,980
Livin' on sponge cake.

1820
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,980
Watchin' the sun bake.

1821
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,980
All of the tourists

1822
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,980
covered with oil.

1823
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,980
If you were in the show,

1824
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,980
come on up!

1825
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,280
I'm in my sixth straight.

1826
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,460
Come on, Dad.

1827
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,300
Riley.

1828
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,460
I'm on my front porch swing.

1829
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,360
Smell of the shrimp, they're beginning to boil.

1830
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,060
There's Sidney and Dwight Slappy.

1831
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,460
Wasted away again in Margaritaville.

1832
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,420
A druid.

1833
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:35,460
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

1834
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:39,020
Salt, salt, yes, sir.

1835
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:44,020
Some people claim that there's a wolf on the plain,

1836
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:50,380
but I don't, it's nobody's fault.

1837
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,340
Let's do the chorus one more time.

1838
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,940
We're gonna drop the guitar,

1839
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,220
and I just wanna hear everybody.

1840
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,460
Let's share this moment together.

1841
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,300
You ready?

1842
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,300
No, that's cool, I get it.

1843
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:05,300
Five, six, five, six, seven, eight.

1844
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:12,500
Wasted away again in Margaritaville.

1845
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,340
Let me hear you.

1846
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,300
Come on, everybody, it's Candle Nights.

1847
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,300
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

1848
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,740
Salt, salt, salt.

1849
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:24,940
It's a thing.

1850
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,940
Some people claim that there's a wolf on the plain,

1851
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:37,300
but I don't, it's nobody's fault.

1852
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,860
Wait, one more time, one more time.

1853
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:41,700
Come on, one more time.

1854
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,700
Wasted away again in Margaritaville.

1855
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,620
I wanna hear you out there, Bill.

1856
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,260
I wanna hear everybody, come on.

1857
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,660
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

1858
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,340
We actually sound like a drunk Jimmy Poppins concert

1859
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,180
right now.

1860
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:03,100
Some people claim that there's a woman

1861
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:08,100
on the plain, but I don't, it's nobody's fault.

1862
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,860
Joyous Candle Nights, everybody, goodnight.

1863
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:28,860
Hey, good girls, do you wanna just say you got water?
