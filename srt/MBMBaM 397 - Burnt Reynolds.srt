1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,400
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm the sweet baby brother and 30 under

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,320
30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Red, red wine.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,960
See me? It just is in my heart right now.

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,000
Really? I just feel great.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,960
Yeah, just so happy to be here recording this show with you,

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,480
my brothers, and that song, Gooby 40's cover of Red, Red Wine, is what is in my heart.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,560
Do you want to know what's in my- Stay close to me.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,240
Here's what's in mine, inexplicably. Now that you're gone, I just want to be with you,

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,920
Enrique Iglesias. No idea why. Woke up this morning, there I was.

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,680
Don't overthink it, Griffin. Open up your heart and let a song out.

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
Probably U2's Vertigo, the introduction to it, where he's like,

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,760
un, deux, trois, 14. That one gets me psyched out of my fucking mind.

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,680
And don't get me wrong, I hate the rest of the song and the rest of the band's music.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:58,720
How great would it be if that intro was eight minutes long and him just like, Ichi, seven,

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
green. Yeah, here's some more of my favorite words.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,080
Thano, that's my name. His name's the edge. Over there, that's Larry.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
I'd like to introduce you to my band. You know us.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,600
We're the Beatles. And of course, the final member, U2.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,440
U2. You are a Thano.

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,720
Special thanks to U2. We couldn't have done it without you.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,240
That's why the band's called that. So do you think Larry did have a moment

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
where he's like, you know what, you go and call yourself?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay. Bono.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,720
And you are the edge. Okay, and I'm going to be Lightning Man.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
Well, actually- No, you can't be the Lightning Man.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
You're actually going to be Larry. And you are Adam.

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,600
We're Larry and Adam. The thing, Justin, is actually

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,520
Larry's legal Christian name is Inferno Lightning, and he goes by Larry.

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,680
So he had to change it. Inferno, Blaze, Lightning.

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,240
But he's like, the edge is like- He's like, just call me Larry.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
If Adam and Larry ever broke off into their own band, Adam and Larry-

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
Us two. It would sound like-

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,880
It would be called Us Two, please. They would call themselves Adam and Larry,

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,280
and it would sound like two Christian comedians that go church to church

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,960
doing wholesome routines. I mean, that's basically what-

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Basically what you two's oeuvre is. It sounded like Travis had a good intro.

43
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm excited to hear what- Sorry.

44
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,680
Sorry, yeah, go ahead. We're nearing episode 400,

45
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
and so I wanted to inject a new segment to kind of bring new life.

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
And I was thinking about this last night as I was trying to fall asleep.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Just, I was really worried about Daylight Savings Time.

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,680
You know, it's keeping me up. For the time thief.

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,200
For the farmers to come and take away the hour they gave us back in fall.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,480
So I've titled this segment, What Do You Think You Would Do If?

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
I've come up with some hypothetical scenarios I got for here,

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,120
that I don't want to pitch to you guys.

53
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,120
So this is like an audio sort of theater of the mind John Quinone experiment.

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
Yeah, sort of like that. So Justin Griffin,

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
what do you think you would do if you saw a bear,

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
and then the bear kind of like padded the seat next to him,

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,800
and he just kind of like stared up at the stars?

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,040
Is it sexual? The padding?

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
No, it's more just kind of, well, it's an open-ended invitation.

60
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,560
I don't want to limit where the scenario will go,

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
because that's kind of up to you, but it's just, it's just an invitation.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,480
I mean, I can't, I'm in a place in my life right now

63
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,040
where I can't just go around kissing bears in the forest.

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
Weird strange bears in the forest.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm married, you know, I got a kid, I got responsibilities, I got fidelities.

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,000
And I'm worried about what this sort of atmosphere would create.

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,040
The bear's breath hot on my face, rich with honey.

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,720
So I would say, but boy, I do love stargazing.

69
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,560
I think I would have to create a sort of platonic atmosphere with the bear

70
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,720
in a way that doesn't make the bear feel threatened, like it needs to attack me.

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Excellent. Justin?

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
I want my own.

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,160
Okay.

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,280
Griffin already did that.

75
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
So Justin, what would you do, what do you think you would do

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,280
if Burt Reynolds came to you and said that he needed your help

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,320
because he had loaned a friend his DVD copy of Meet the Parents,

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,480
and then the friend said that he didn't have it,

79
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,120
but Burt Reynolds had seen it on his friend's entertainment center the week before?

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Did you say Burt Reynolds, which is my favorite crayon color?

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
Yes. Okay.

82
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,760
That's actually Burt Reynolds' full name is Burnt Reynolds, and he shortened it.

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,920
It is silent.

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
So Travis, you didn't finish your anecdote.

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
So Burt Reynolds-

86
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Burt Reynolds, he loaned his friend his DVD copy of Meet the Parents.

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
Now he does also have a Blu-ray copy, so it's not pressing,

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,960
but he loaned his DVD copy of Meet the Parents to his friend.

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,000
And then when he asked for it back,

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
a friend said he didn't have it, but Burt Reynolds had seen it

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
on his friend's entertainment center the week before.

92
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
The DVD's got better special features too.

93
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,320
It has the gag reel Easter egg.

94
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,480
Okay, so is the person who he loaned the DVD to,

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,000
is he part of the Hollywood Glitterati?

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
Do I know the friend?

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
No, it's just his friend Doug.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
Doug Reynolds? No.

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
That wouldn't make any sense.

100
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,480
There would be no reason for what I said.

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,400
No, it's actually Dung Reynolds.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,480
And it's silent.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,160
Okay, so Burt asked me to get...

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Okay, do I have any sort of relationship with Dung?

105
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,360
Let's say you maybe live on the same block,

106
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
but you haven't spent a lot of time together,

107
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,280
but you've seen each other at the local swap meets.

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,320
Okay, so what I would do is this friendship with...

109
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm not the sort of person who when they make

110
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,560
a celebrity friend, sort of milks it for all it's worth.

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,400
So I am really gonna try to foster a better friendship

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
between me and Burt, and what I'm gonna do is

113
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,440
I'm gonna buy him a new copy of Meet the Parents on DVD,

114
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,760
and I'm gonna give it to him, and wait,

115
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,040
there's right answers?

116
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,080
Well, don't worry about that.

117
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
Hold on, don't worry about that.

118
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
No, hold on, I need to know if there's right answers

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
to this segment, because then I might do my bear one.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
No, you're both right so far.

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
You're nailing it, 100%.

122
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,320
So it was sexual, we can all agree this bear

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
is trying to put the moves on me.

124
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,640
Okay, so yeah, I would get him a new DVD,

125
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,880
and I would say, like, here, I don't want you

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
to have to worry about this anymore.

127
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,040
You're in your Twilight years, you just did that

128
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,200
direct to direct TV.

129
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,160
That is a thing, actually, it is direct to direct TV.

130
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
Burt Reynolds movie, the...

131
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,800
So, you know, I want him to keep acting,

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,760
I want him to focus his energies on that,

133
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,320
and I don't necessarily want him

134
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
worrying about this DVD anymore.

135
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,920
So I'm gonna drive a wedge between him and Dung

136
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
by buying him a copy of the DVD, and he'll say,

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
thank goodness I don't have to worry about that anymore.

138
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,520
Thank you, Justin.

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,600
Give me a second to finish writing that down.

140
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Thank you, Justin.

141
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
Wait, why do you need to write it down?

142
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
Don't worry about it.

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
Okay, so Griffin, here's your second one.

144
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
What do you think you would do if you were a turtle

145
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
and you had really good credit,

146
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
but you're not sure if you're ready to settle down

147
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
with your long-term girlfriend, Sheila?

148
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,280
Why does my credit have anything?

149
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,920
It's really good.

150
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,760
This is just sort of character development

151
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,920
about turtle not being.

152
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,360
So what do you think you would do?

153
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,040
I mean, here's the thing.

154
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Turtles live for fucking 2,000 years.

155
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
We all got the same turtles from back in Christ's time,

156
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,640
basically, and so if you settle down as a turtle,

157
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,760
that really means something,

158
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,840
because you're talking about thousands of years,

159
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,840
but potentially, and then it's all about spawning

160
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,720
and the eggs, there's like a billion of them,

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
and that's a big responsibility, too.

162
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
I kind of get it, but at the same time,

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,160
it's pretty long.

164
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,840
I don't have a good answer for this one, Travis.

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,600
You've given me literally nothing.

166
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
That is correct.

167
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
Justin, here's the final one.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
What do you think you would do if-

169
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,280
Oh, wow, wow.

170
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,040
You saw fire, and at first you panicked a little bit,

171
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,840
but then you realized it was just like a campfire

172
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,560
and all of your closest friends were sitting around it,

173
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
and they were all really worried about you.

174
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
And they were all really silent,

175
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
and at first you're like, what's going on?

176
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
But then you realize they're all just being contemplative

177
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
and thinking about life,

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
and then the fire starts to die down,

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
and you go through all the proper steps to put the fire out

180
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
and pour sand on it and stuff and make sure it's out.

181
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
And then you go and you lay down in your tent

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
and you start to feel a little hungry,

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
and you remember you have a cliff bar in your jacket,

184
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,440
but then you think, oh, no, I left my jacket out by the fire.

185
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
But then you realize that, no, you brought it in.

186
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,280
It's in the tent with you.

187
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,600
And you go into the pocket and you get the cliff bar out

188
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,960
and you had thought it was chocolate chip,

189
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
but it's actually oatmeal chocolate chip.

190
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,280
Then you eat it and you don't feel hungry anymore,

191
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,240
and then you go to sleep.

192
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,720
Kind of feels like Travis only had two.

193
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,640
Yeah, I don't think that one, it requires much action.

194
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
So what do you think you would do if?

195
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,160
What I would probably do is continue to sleep,

196
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,320
have a restless night's sleep

197
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
because laying on the earthen ground is always difficult.

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
And you ate so late,

199
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,240
and you know that always gives you weird dreams.

200
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah, and I would have a weird dream

201
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,160
and I would wake up the next day

202
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,640
and build a new fire and start the cycle again.

203
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,160
Excellent, you are correct.

204
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,400
You are trapped in a time cycle.

205
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,760
You nailed that one.

206
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,560
Waiting for Dr. Who to come, that is his name,

207
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,040
Dr. Who to come rescue me or her name, excuse me,

208
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,760
wait for her to come rescue me from the cycle.

209
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
All right, now Travis, it's your turn.

210
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,360
What do you think you would do?

211
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,920
No, Justin, you have to really squawk it.

212
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,080
What do you think you would do

213
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,880
if you were friends with Barack Obama?

214
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,080
Friends to acquaintances.

215
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,680
You don't know each other great, but whatever.

216
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,280
So I might invite him to hang out in a big group hang,

217
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,240
but it would be weird if he and I went on a road trip?

218
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes, thank you.

219
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,080
All right, you're borrowing this dude's DVDs nonstop.

220
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
And you had some live shows coming up

221
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
and you needed a poster design

222
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,400
and you asked Barack to make one for you.

223
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Even if it's not good, it's still the poster that Barack made

224
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
and people are gonna be wild for it.

225
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,320
He gives you a link, a shareable link

226
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
for some of his rough sketches,

227
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,960
sort of what he's thinking about for the shows.

228
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,720
When you click through the link, the posters are there,

229
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
they're terrible.

230
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,960
I mean, they are wretched.

231
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,200
But you also see a directory in the Dropbox that says Pirate.

232
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,520
And when you go into it,

233
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,600
you find off-screen filmed copies of The Post,

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,400
of Thor Ragnarok, of Lady Bird,

235
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,600
and then some like Broadway stuff.

236
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
Oh, geez.

237
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,000
Legally Blonde, he filmed a preview of Legally Blonde

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
and tormented it.

239
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,520
Oh, man.

240
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,440
He didn't film it, he tormented it.

241
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
So what do you think you would do?

242
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
So if I found out that our former president,

243
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,080
Barack Hussein Obama, had pirated not only film,

244
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,640
but also Broadway, which is probably,

245
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,760
I would say even more upsetting than pirating film.

246
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,400
And the Olympics, and some football games.

247
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
And you're not supposed to do that.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
Yeah, it's some of his favorite football games.

249
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,320
What would I do?

250
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,600
You know what?

251
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,320
I'd turn him in.

252
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Wow.

253
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,040
I mean, listen, I'm not proud, but I'm lawful good.

254
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
You know what I mean?

255
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,920
If there's one thing people know about me.

256
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
Would you really fucking turn him in?

257
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,000
No.

258
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,280
No, of course I wouldn't, Justin.

259
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,560
Okay, well, why don't you answer my question?

260
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
Why don't you quit being full of shit

261
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,400
for a fucking minute of your life?

262
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,320
Yeah, I want to answer my fucking query.

263
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,840
Because I panicked.

264
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,960
Do you want to know the truth, Justin?

265
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,080
That's a hard game, huh?

266
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,920
In this administration, you want to hand

267
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,840
the former president, Barack Hussein Obama,

268
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,440
over to this current administration

269
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
as a federal criminal.

270
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,480
You want to do that.

271
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,400
That's your fucking choice.

272
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,680
Here's what I would do, Justin.

273
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,360
Here's what I would do.

274
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,080
Do you want to know what I would fucking do?

275
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,120
Yeah, I wouldn't have asked it

276
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,760
if I didn't want to know what you would do.

277
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
Here's what I fucking do, Justin.

278
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,400
I would maybe set up some sort of elaborate prank,

279
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
but not like a funny prank,

280
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
but like kind of a scared straight kind of prank,

281
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
where I was like, and if that had been real,

282
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,120
you'd be in prison right now, Barry, you know?

283
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,080
I'm worried about you.

284
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,160
Okay, you show up at his door,

285
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
dressed up as a movie cop.

286
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,480
My name is Ace Shooter, Hollywood Cop,

287
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
and I probably don't want to show up

288
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,800
at former president Barack Obama's house

289
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,520
and say your name is Ace Shooter.

290
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,760
That's a fucking, that's my fucking name.

291
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,800
What do you want me to do?

292
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
Have it changed.

293
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,680
Go to the Imagitorium and get a new name for Ace Shooter.

294
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,720
Fine, my name is Ace Cool Flicks,

295
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,160
and my name is Ace Netflix, and I'm here.

296
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,960
Would you steal a car, former president Barack Hussein Obama?

297
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,160
I do not think so.

298
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
So why have you stolen the ladybird?

299
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,440
You're going to jail for a very long time.

300
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
Just kidding, it's me, Griffin.

301
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,800
But you learned something.

302
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,120
I feel like he didn't give him time to get scared.

303
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
He knew it was you, you're close friends.

304
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
Let me try again.

305
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
He's closer to Griffin than he is to Travis.

306
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
Hey, what's up?

307
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,080
My name is Damien Blockbuster, Hollywood police,

308
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,400
and I'm here to talk to you about the ladybirds you stole.

309
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
Did you use this to get past the Secret Service?

310
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,720
Because I think that they would probably answer the door

311
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
and not let you get close unless you-

312
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,320
No, Justin, it's a jurisdiction thing,

313
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,720
because at that point, the Hollywood police

314
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
trumps the Secret Service.

315
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,480
I brought a pie, and I'm like, this is Barack home, president?

316
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,360
And then I laid on him.

317
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,080
I'm going to put you in the Slammer now,

318
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,360
the Hollywood Slammer, and wait for it.

319
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Just kidding, it's me, Griffin.

320
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,320
I tear off the beard.

321
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
Oh, there's the beard.

322
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,080
There is no Damien Blockbuster.

323
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,080
I mean, maybe somewhere.

324
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,560
This is a good segment, Travis.

325
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,200
Hey, thank you.

326
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,360
Speaking of the live shows that we got,

327
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,960
former president Barack Hussein Obama

328
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,000
to make posters for us,

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
should we talk about the live shows

330
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
we do actually have coming up?

331
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,920
Yeah, let's blaze through them.

332
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,840
Folks, we're hitting the road this year.

333
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,960
We're getting back out there.

334
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,960
It's too much road.

335
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm looking at a list of road, and I'm already exhausted.

336
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,360
There's a lot of roads.

337
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm not going to bog you down with a bunch of dates

338
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
because you can find those at mcroyshows.com forward slash tours.

339
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
Trevor, can you go ahead and put those on there

340
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,400
even if we don't have the links yet?

341
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,720
Yeah, by the time this goes live, they'll be up there.

342
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,280
They'll be up there.

343
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,600
Okay, mcroyshows.com forward slash tours.

344
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,320
We are coming to...

345
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,560
Okay, my brother, my brother and me

346
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,000
is coming to Dallas, Houston, St. Louis,

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,080
Detroit, Columbus, San Francisco,

348
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,680
Phoenix, Orlando, and Atlanta.

349
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,160
Now, some of those two are also Adventure Zone shows.

350
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,120
Adventure Zone is going to be in-

351
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,960
I was going to do them separately.

352
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,760
The Adventure Zone is coming to Dallas,

353
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,280
San Francisco, and Atlanta.

354
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,120
Yes, and those are over like the next,

355
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,320
Jesus, like six months.

356
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,200
Yeah, from April to September in there.

357
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,880
There's a lot of shows going up, folks.

358
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,920
It's going to be a lot of fun,

359
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,840
and we're very much looking forward to it.

360
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,120
I know I said that I wasn't

361
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,240
because of how exhausted I was,

362
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,800
but it's going to be a hoot.

363
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,000
Some of these have never been to.

364
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720
Columbus, Detroit, St. Louis.

365
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,680
What's up, St. Louis?

366
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,120
Going to get up in that big scary arch.

367
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,080
Phoenix.

368
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,120
Phoenix has its own arch.

369
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,000
I have been to Columbus many times.

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
That's where COSI is.

371
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
Nice try.

372
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
But we haven't done no shows there.

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,160
Anyway, yeah, all the links and stuff

374
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,920
are at mcroyshows.com slash tours.

375
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,360
Now, tickets are going to go on sale this week,

376
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
so look lively.

377
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,360
Somebody with the email open

378
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
can probably tell you exactly when that's going to be.

379
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,240
Yeah, so tickets are going to go on sale Friday the 16th

380
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,880
at 10 a.m. local time.

381
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,160
Now, just-

382
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,840
Local to where the shows are,

383
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,440
not just where you live.

384
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:01,920
Correct.

385
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,000
Now, the thing, keep in mind,

386
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
just as a word of warning

387
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,240
because it's happened before,

388
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
it's always possible that they go on sale

389
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,960
a little bit early,

390
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,320
so maybe don't jump on right at like 10 a.m.

391
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,560
Maybe start checking a few minutes before

392
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,800
just something to keep in mind.

393
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,240
Now, we are going to be doing a pre-sale also.

394
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,720
Correct.

395
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,880
That's going to be Wednesday, March 14th at 10 a.m. local

396
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,280
to Thursday, March 15th at 10 p.m. local.

397
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
There's going to be a pre-sale going,

398
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,600
and all you need to do to access that pre-sale

399
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,680
is use the password mybrother,

400
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,480
and that's the same for Taz and the Bim Bam shows.

401
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,920
It's mybrother,

402
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,720
and you can use that pre-sale to get into,

403
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,760
to buy the tickets early.

404
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
If you want to go to the shows, do that.

405
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,400
Do the pre-sale because if you wait for the other one,

406
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,520
it might be tough.

407
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
If you have problems accessing the site,

408
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,560
if the site goes down, which it tends to,

409
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,880
keep trying.

410
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,320
Don't like get out of queue or whatever,

411
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,280
and if you're going to tweet at somebody,

412
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,560
tweet at the venue or whatever if you're having issues

413
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,880
because we are not going to be able to do anything about it.

414
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
We're going aggro, Craig, with this fucking schedule,

415
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,920
so we are not going to be able to add more shows and stuff

416
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,040
like we usually do, so look lively.

417
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,880
May the odds be ever in your favor.

418
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,840
Please don't tweet at us.

419
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
We have no idea how this fucking process works.

420
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,560
And just, we also are going to,

421
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
that's only up till the beginning of September.

422
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,080
We're looking at some other things, nothing guaranteed,

423
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,240
but we're going to try to keep doing them

424
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,040
throughout the year too,

425
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,960
but this is the only thing that's confirmed

426
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,320
and guaranteed right now.

427
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,560
All right, so look lively.

428
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
Justin, read this question.

429
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
Here we go with the show.

430
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,480
I like watching nature shows at night before bed to relax.

431
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,560
My cat has begun doing this cute thing

432
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,160
where he sits at the foot of the bed

433
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
and inadvertently watches the TV with me.

434
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,920
Or intently, not intently.

435
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,680
You really added a lot of letters.

436
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,120
Whoa, I added a lot of there.

437
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,680
Okay, intently watches the TV with me.

438
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,120
His favorite shows feature birds or four-legged critters,

439
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,720
like David Attenborough shows, of course.

440
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,680
Like David Attenborough, a centaur.

441
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
One night, I was watching some trashy TV

442
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,400
when my cat hopped up on the bed and began watching.

443
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
Immediately, I changed from my trashy TV show

444
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,520
to a nature show I knew he would like so that he would stay.

445
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,120
And then I realized I just tailored my TV time

446
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
to my cat's preferences.

447
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,360
Brothers, what's the protocol

448
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,200
for sharing TV time with a cat?

449
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
How can I expand my cat's interest beyond just critter shows?

450
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
And that's from Not That Crazy Cat Lady in Tennessee.

451
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,280
Maybe your cat just wants you to learn something

452
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,800
about alligators instead of just watching some Garbo TV.

453
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,520
Maybe your cat wants to enrich your mind

454
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,760
with David Attenborough's lessons.

455
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,200
And I still, people are always talking about this dude

456
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,560
and I still just have no idea who it is.

457
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,640
But I assume he gets up there and he's like,

458
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
alligators, is he British?

459
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,080
Alligators, the snakes with legs.

460
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,600
And you learn about them instead of seeing a bunch of people

461
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,560
hit each other in the street while drunk.

462
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,760
I don't know, I don't know.

463
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,040
I feel like that's a good thing.

464
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,040
How far does this go though?

465
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,760
If you start indulging your cat this way

466
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,400
and then you turn on the new Brian Eno record

467
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
and your cat comes over and he swats your face,

468
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,440
you say, I want Skinnerd.

469
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,040
Put on Skinnerd.

470
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,560
Put on some Skinnerd.

471
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,400
Put on some Skinnerd.

472
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,480
Now, I learned to talk.

473
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,280
Also, get the wet food.

474
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,200
I know it's a pain in the ass,

475
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,040
but I want the wet stuff.

476
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,280
You gotta open one can at a time.

477
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,560
I like them commercials with the dog in the china dish.

478
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,320
Oh, I like that.

479
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,360
I'm tired of that dry stuff that's supposed to make my shit smell good.

480
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
It's never gonna happen.

481
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,840
Give me the can. Give me better shit sand, Debbie.

482
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,040
I've been thinking about it.

483
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,000
I think I want it.

484
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,280
Eat a bacon strip.

485
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,760
Fuck you.

486
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,040
Send me to school.

487
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,120
I want to go to school.

488
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
Stop keeping me from school.

489
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
I want to learn.

490
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,520
I want to be like you.

491
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,920
Give me a mantra and fire.

492
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,320
I'm going to go to technical college

493
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
and learn how to maintain servers.

494
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,960
I want to go to living.

495
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,800
Ever since you closed down the plant,

496
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,760
I've been stagnant.

497
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,080
Yeah, I don't know what happened.

498
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
I want a future.

499
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
I can't access my email anymore.

500
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,640
Is there any way you can-

501
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,080
Yeah, I can fix it.

502
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,120
And we just plug-

503
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,920
Oh, you didn't have it plugged into the damn Wi-Fi.

504
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,800
Hold on.

505
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,840
All right, I did it.

506
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm gonna knock your mouse off your desk now.

507
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,560
Scanner, fuck you.

508
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,240
Don't you want to use-

509
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
Wouldn't that be easier if you use the mouse?

510
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,960
No, I don't.

511
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,400
I don't enjoy using the-

512
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,600
It's my predilections.

513
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
I don't like using mice.

514
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,480
And it's also better sensitivity with the trackpad, really.

515
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,560
Yeah, look at these pads.

516
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,320
Look at them.

517
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,440
All right.

518
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
Hey, you got any milk?

519
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,120
So we just did a fun cat character

520
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,600
rather than just sort of addressing the issue.

521
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,720
I think that helped though.

522
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,080
I mean, it doesn't.

523
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,760
I mean, if your cat can like nature shows,

524
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,360
then your cat can learn to like My 600-lb Life.

525
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,320
So you just gotta help.

526
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,600
You meet your cat halfway,

527
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,200
watch a little something they like,

528
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,640
and then watch a little something you like.

529
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
And sometimes you can get them on board

530
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,680
with the storylines of something,

531
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,920
especially those episodic, trashy reality TV shows.

532
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,960
Maybe try to adjust your cat's taste

533
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,480
so they like the stuff you like.

534
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Yeah, do you know cats?

535
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,880
That ain't gonna happen.

536
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,080
My cat is just,

537
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,920
I can't get this little guy to do anything.

538
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,760
Maybe get your cat a smaller TV

539
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
that you just play nature shows on

540
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
so you can watch what you want.

541
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,560
Well, but that's gonna end up with you

542
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,200
watching a small TV and him watching a big TV.

543
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,200
He just, my cat runs my life, you know?

544
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm just operating on his schedule at this point.

545
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,280
You know what I mean?

546
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,160
If they were to make a sitcom about me and my cat,

547
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,760
you know what we'd call it, Who's the Boss?

548
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,120
Except maybe they'd stylize it as Who's the Paws?

549
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,400
Who's the Paws?

550
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,920
Maybe Muse the Boss?

551
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
So Griffin, you got a Yahoo?

552
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,400
I do.

553
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,880
Here's one that was sent in by Merit Palmer.

554
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,440
Thank you, Merit.

555
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,560
It's Yahoo Answers user,

556
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:56,720
BolsteadNorge asks,

557
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,120
if a word in the dictionary were misspelled,

558
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,560
how would we know?

559
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,960
Oh, shit.

560
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
Whoa, fuck.

561
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
No additional details listed or required.

562
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,840
How would we know?

563
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,400
No, like a real toughy like archipelago.

564
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,760
And you're like, did I do this right?

565
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,880
Let's check with the dictionary.

566
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,440
And the dictionary is like, here's how we think it is.

567
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
But how did they come, how did they figure that out?

568
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,480
And words that you can't really figure out,

569
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,280
like what the right way is, like color or color.

570
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
Like whatever they list is just how it goes.

571
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
But did they go to the, you know,

572
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,240
where did they find the ancient stone tablet

573
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,080
that was just like, nah, nah, nah.

574
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,320
Here's how you spell archipelago.

575
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Okay, words do change their spelling over time, right?

576
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,080
So if you look at like early, like old English,

577
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
you're gonna see a lot of wild vowels

578
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,840
and what have you in there, right?

579
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,920
Yeah, and like what's up used to be what's up.

580
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,760
And then all the great commercials came out

581
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,920
and now the dictionary says it's was up.

582
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,720
Yeah, so that language changes.

583
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,440
I think if the dictionary changes the spelling on something,

584
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
that's the spelling.

585
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,080
Yeah, I actually, I think that there are also

586
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,040
quantum words like restaurant, for example.

587
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,720
I think if you look at it, it changes between

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,720
being R-E-S-T-A-U-R-A-N-T or A-R-A-U-N-T,

589
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
depending on when you're looking at it

590
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
and who's looking at it, because I don't believe

591
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,320
that there is actually a right way to spell restaurant

592
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,760
and I'll always get it wrong forever and ever and ever.

593
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,240
You know what I always get made as convenience?

594
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh, yeah.

595
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,720
A resuscitation, like anything with like the double S's

596
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
in there somewhere. How often are you putting that down?

597
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
What? How often are you doing resuscitation?

598
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, how often do you have to say resuscitation?

599
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,360
I can't even say a fucking thing.

600
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,880
Sure, I can't even say it.

601
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
Are you using resuscitation a lot?

602
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
Oh, you know the other one, occasionally.

603
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,120
Oh, yeah. Which ones are doubles?

604
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,720
Balloon. Balloon gets you?

605
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,800
Balloon is tough. Is it a double L?

606
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,240
I don't know, I don't remember. Oh, shit.

607
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,400
Or a single O? This is my ballon.

608
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,600
But that's what I'm saying. They could just change it.

609
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
And they're always adding stuff.

610
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
They're very hip and very woke

611
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,240
and they're always adding stuff to the word Bible.

612
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,160
And just kind of, who's making these calls?

613
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,440
It's just like, now balloon is one L, one O.

614
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,200
It's ballon. And now that's how it is.

615
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
And if every other, and when they do that,

616
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,240
every book ever written before that is just full of typos.

617
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,120
Yeah, it's just wrong.

618
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,480
How come there's not a fucking competing dictionary?

619
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,800
Yes.

620
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,240
There's only the one dictionary company that's out there

621
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,320
and they're the only ones deciding.

622
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,200
And I think it's time for us to maybe do a dictionary.

623
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,440
And it can probably just not be all the words.

624
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,880
I don't think we're gonna be competing with them on scale.

625
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
But like some of this stuff, there's just like the word-

626
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
Just the hard words.

627
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,000
Like conscience.

628
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,720
It's just like, I would just miss that one.

629
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,960
And I would just be like, conscience.

630
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,400
The thing inside of you tells you whether it's good or not.

631
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,680
How it's spelled.

632
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,360
Just whatever.

633
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,560
Just go for it.

634
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,280
That's the thing is we're fine listing multiple definitions

635
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,120
for words, but not multiple spellings.

636
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
Come on, grow up.

637
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,320
Grow the fuck up, Miriam.

638
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,360
It's 2018.

639
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,880
Things are spelled however.

640
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,360
I've got too much on my plate to worry about

641
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
where the U goes in restaurant.

642
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,560
And with our, the McElroy's super good dictionary,

643
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,800
spelling bees become way more fun.

644
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,720
Cause then it'd be like, if they get up there

645
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,400
and spell it, it'd be like, spell archipelago.

646
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,960
And they'd be like, A-R-K-A-P-E-L-I-G-O.

647
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,480
And they'd be like, I guess.

648
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,040
That tracks.

649
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,540
Fine.

650
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,760
It was so fun pretending there's only one-

651
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,840
And then they would go do a physical challenge.

652
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,160
Yes.

653
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
So it'd be awesome.

654
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,240
Yes, yes, yes.

655
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,360
Arm wrestle now.

656
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,840
You too.

657
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
From the spelling of the word.

658
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,640
Yeah.

659
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,040
It was so fun pretending there's only one dictionary.

660
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,720
But I'm going to stop pretending it for this next thing

661
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,440
I'm going to say.

662
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:03,680
Okay.

663
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,640
You know how there's like different dictionary companies?

664
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,140
What?

665
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,040
No, but there's only one as established.

666
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
We're not pretending that anymore.

667
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,800
Oh, okay.

668
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,800
So like, there's like Webster's and Oxford.

669
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,480
Wouldn't it be funny if Webster decided to make,

670
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,600
like change the definition of Oxford in its dictionary?

671
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,080
Just like, oh, at Oxford, that's the Dickey stain

672
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,960
you get on your drawers.

673
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,080
Got them, got them.

674
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,760
Oh, you got an Oxford on there, gross.

675
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,120
Why is there different dictionaries?

676
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
Because the words are the same and the definitions are the same.

677
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,240
Is it just you copy and paste the other folks shit

678
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
and just put it right in your book?

679
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,040
And it's like, you stole it.

680
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,080
What are you talking about?

681
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
I can't steal what Apple means.

682
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,920
It's so they can have an arms race for putting busted new words in

683
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,040
to try to have some like notoriety or like some reason

684
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,160
that the media will talk about.

685
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,400
Like, did you hear staycations in there now?

686
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,200
Like, yeah, fine.

687
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,840
It's so quick.

688
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeet goes viral.

689
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,200
And Merriam's like, we got yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet, yeet.

690
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,080
Burn the old ones.

691
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,880
Burn the old ones.

692
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,160
All your old books are bullshit.

693
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,880
Go buy a new one.

694
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,760
It's got yeet.

695
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,800
It's the Merriam-Webster 2018 yeet edition.

696
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,080
Also, we took YOLO out.

697
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
Nobody's fucking saying YOLO out.

698
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,200
What are those?

699
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,760
It's done.

700
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,080
Welcome to the Merriam-Webster what's hot, what's not edition.

701
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,640
I would like to make a new better version segment.

702
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,120
Oh, okay.

703
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,480
A new version of the dictionary that just has a different alphabetical order

704
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,600
because alphabetical order is just completely arbitrary as it is.

705
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,240
And I would like to put all the vowels together.

706
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,160
Oh, that's good.

707
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,880
And then, but the whole alphabet starts with T

708
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,040
so that I'll always be first in line for stuff.

709
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,320
That's cool.

710
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,800
And then maybe instead of a song that we teach our children,

711
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,400
you just say the alphabet like it's one big word.

712
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,360
I like that.

713
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,760
So it's like-

714
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,480
Since the beginning.

715
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,360
And then all the vowels.

716
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:03,680
So it's like-

717
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,320
And then all the vowels.

718
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,320
Like that, and then kids say it and it helps them learn.

719
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,680
Like a Missy Elliott song.

720
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,720
Yeah.

721
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,680
Well, you know that not all her songs are like-

722
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,160
What?

723
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,480
Once-

724
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,720
Yeah, not all of her songs feature her sort of saying things backwards.

725
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,160
You know that, right?

726
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,360
It's not a gimmick.

727
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,680
It's just one thing.

728
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,480
It's not a gimmick.

729
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,200
She's not the backward song singer.

730
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,680
She just really has the one where that's sort of the focus.

731
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,560
Okay.

732
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,120
Well, sure.

733
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,120
If you want to just step on my joke.

734
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,640
Joke's kind of a strong word.

735
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,960
Let's take a break now and head on over to the Money Zone.

736
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,680
Already, huh?

737
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,480
Wow, that what would you do segment sure took a while, huh?

738
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
It was what do you think you would do?

739
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:56,720
There's no copyright in French in here.

740
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,840
Folks, I want to take a moment to ask if you are hiring,

741
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,960
because time's tight over here and I could use a gig.

742
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Posting your position to job sites.

743
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,040
That's what you do normally.

744
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,840
And then what do you do?

745
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,880
You wait, you wait, you wait for the right people to see it.

746
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
Well, no more waiting because Zip Recruiter has revolutionized hiring.

747
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,920
Their technology finds great candidates for you.

748
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,800
It kicks open their door.

749
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,000
It grabs them by the scruff of their neck.

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,520
It drags them into your desk.

751
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,720
It tapes them there with duct tape and it makes them answer your questions.

752
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
It learns that you're looking for it,

753
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,120
identifies people with the right experience and invites them to apply.

754
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,040
What kind of experience do you think you look for

755
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
for people to write a dictionary for you?

756
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,360
Like if you were hiring dictionary writers,

757
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,440
that's such a specialized skill set.

758
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,080
Yeah, what's the deal with that?

759
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,560
Do you think that there are dictionaries

760
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
that also include some sort of narrative?

761
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,200
We did dictionaries already, Travis.

762
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
We're in the body of the advertisement now.

763
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,920
But now I'm thinking about if we wrote a dictionary,

764
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,120
but there was a story that unfolded as you read the dictionary.

765
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,160
That could be fun.

766
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,480
Okay.

767
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
Hey, peepums nasty.

768
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,160
Peepums, as long as we're doing all the big bits,

769
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,040
peepums nasty gun.

770
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,160
Let's check in on that one.

771
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,480
Right now, our listeners can try for free

772
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,040
at ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

773
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,200
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

774
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.

775
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,640
Hey, Pamela, how's our new spot on the bim-bam?

776
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,600
Well, it's long.

777
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,160
It's not really about us for much of it,

778
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,520
but it is a long spot.

779
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
I want to tell you about Squarespace.

780
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,800
From those boys.

781
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,200
Now, I want to tell you about Squarespace.

782
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,560
And also probably Glass Sharks at some point.

783
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,320
Glass Sharks can come in there.

784
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,000
Well, I'm going to reference something

785
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,360
I referenced earlier in the podcast.

786
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
And that is we were talking about the tours.

787
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
And we said macroshows.com slash tours.

788
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,640
And I said, yeah, I can put that up there.

789
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,760
That'll be up by the time.

790
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
That's because we use Squarespace.

791
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,320
And Squarespace is so intuitive and easy to use

792
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
that I can make changes wherever I need to,

793
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,280
update stuff rapidly and on my own schedule

794
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,160
without having to wait for some huge,

795
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,520
I don't know, website producing machine

796
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,200
to make the website for me.

797
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,560
I can do it.

798
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,240
And if you have a cool idea

799
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,360
or something you want to create a web presence for,

800
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,960
make a new website on Squarespace.

801
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,920
It's super easy.

802
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,080
They have beautiful templates

803
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,840
created by world-class designers.

804
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,400
They also have e-commerce functionality.

805
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,720
So if you want to sell things, you can do that.

806
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,920
And it's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

807
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,440
You don't even have to do anything

808
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,280
so people can use it on their smartphones.

809
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,880
Travis mentioned that quick iteration.

810
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,000
It really is awesome.

811
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,040
Like hypothetically, you could put on like a contact page

812
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,160
on like a personal website where people could email you.

813
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,040
And then when like 200 people send you emails

814
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,240
about BananaVore, you can just delete that instantly.

815
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,920
And like, it's not even a big deal

816
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,440
and nobody even notices.

817
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
And they help you buy domains

818
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
and they have a ton of extensions to use

819
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,600
and there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

820
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,560
So go check out Squarespace.com for a free trial.

821
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,760
And when you're ready to launch,

822
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,400
use the offer code MYBROTHER to save 10%

823
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

824
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,240
That's Squarespace.com and enter the code MYBROTHER,

825
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,960
all one word.

826
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
I want to tell you all about an exciting new podcast

827
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,840
that is called Talk From Superheroes.

828
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,200
It is a new podcast.

829
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,960
It's hosted by Andrew and Diana,

830
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,600
the creators of Texts From Superheroes,

831
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,280
that hilarious web comic you've seen

832
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,800
where superheroes text each other.

833
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
Every week on Talk From Superheroes,

834
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,720
they break down the hilarious things you've never noticed

835
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,560
in superhero movies and TV shows.

836
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,280
Like how Green Goblin's glider definitely cut off his junk

837
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,960
in 2002's Spider-Man.

838
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,200
Man of Steel is about how to insert a space USB

839
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,720
and how Tony Stark recruited a child soldier in Civil War.

840
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,600
Oh my goodness.

841
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,440
Yeah, I think all that probably does track.

842
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,200
A lot of just sort of probably I bet like

843
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,040
snafus, continuity errors, a lot of outtakes,

844
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,320
a lot of probably some plot holes, gang.

845
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,240
And so gird yourself for that.

846
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,080
But it's all on TalkFromSuperheroes.com

847
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,320
or you can also just search for Talk From Superheroes

848
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,120
on iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts.

849
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,200
I think that means like whatever application you use

850
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,400
to download the podcast and not like a nice tree

851
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
like to sit under or over in a hot air balloon

852
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,600
and enjoy listening to your podcasts.

853
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:29,360
Yes, this is from Anna Heavens and it's for Smooch Island.

854
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,000
Hey Smoochers, what a year it's been.

855
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Thank you for being part of a community

856
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,320
where it's normal to build internet friendships,

857
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,040
do some flirts, get some selfie validation

858
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,840
and maybe even experience some island magic.

859
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,200
To Jack, Almay, Jenny, Mo and John,

860
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,880
you are the best mods and people I know.

861
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,960
Thank you for everything.

862
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,920
I love y'all, keep smooching.

863
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
What is Smooch Island?

864
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,840
I don't know but I'm so excited to get to say it

865
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,680
and just be there.

866
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,960
You can't be there, it's like lost.

867
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,280
It's always moving.

868
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,520
There's a scary polar bear

869
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,560
and there's a big cloud that comes around and kills people.

870
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,720
But aside from that, it's great.

871
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,840
Everybody's smooching all the time.

872
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,160
Now why didn't you go with Fantasy Island, Griffin?

873
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,720
Because it seems more like Fantasy Island.

874
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,880
Nope, it's the lost island, bears and everything.

875
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,040
Sawyer's there, Sawyer's there, but he's kissing.

876
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,480
He's kissing?

877
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,640
Oh, so you can smooch Sawyer, that helps.

878
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,040
Hell yeah.

879
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
That really takes the edge off the smoke monster.

880
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
I'll say this, smooch Sawyer doesn't hurt.

881
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,080
Well, he's got a lot of stubble.

882
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,720
You might get some hurt.

883
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
Oh, it would.

884
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,440
You gonna read this next one, Trav?

885
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,480
Sure, this is from Wes Davies and it's for Robin Phelan.

886
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,600
Dear Robin Phelan, fantastic DM

887
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,520
and even more fantastic friend.

888
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Reese and Wes, Inya and Francie, Sin and Amy,

889
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,800
Rizza and Luca, Kuviri and Juniper,

890
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,480
Way and Iris.

891
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,480
Why is it written like this, Wes?

892
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,600
This is the biggest D&D group fucking ever.

893
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,680
Maybe that's their, that's probably the player.

894
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,440
Wait, is that the player?

895
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,960
Player and the, I don't know.

896
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,920
Character and the player?

897
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,960
I don't know.

898
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,120
They all send you our love

899
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,360
and thank you for the zags, the gays,

900
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,520
and for all the kindness you put into the stories

901
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,640
you give to us.

902
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,760
May they continue to heal us and you every month.

903
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,880
You are so loved.

904
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,680
And that message is set to air whenever.

905
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,680
I like it.

906
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,560
I like it.

907
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,600
There's never a bad time to thank your DM

908
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
for their hard, hard work.

909
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,400
I agree, Griffin.

910
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,000
Thank you, Travis.

911
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,320
Hi, I'm Ellie Gertz.

912
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,440
And I'm Julia Prescott,

913
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,000
and we're the hosts of Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

914
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,440
We are a Simpsons podcast,

915
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
brand new to the Maximum Fun Network.

916
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,760
And every episode we cover a different episode

917
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,800
of The Simpsons that is a favorite of our special guests.

918
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,880
We've had guests that are showrunners and writers

919
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
and voice actors like Nancy Cartwright,

920
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,240
all people that have worked on The Simpsons.

921
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,080
And we've also had guests like Weird Al

922
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,560
and people that are on the Maximum Fun Network already.

923
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,120
And each week we will talk to a very cool guest

924
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,160
about their favorite episode.

925
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,120
And it is so much fun.

926
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,160
So if you like The Simpsons,

927
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,240
come listen to Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

928
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,360
All right, smell you later.

929
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
My friend won't let up

930
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,760
about the existence of airline hitchhikers,

931
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,960
people that stow away in the baggage place of an airplane

932
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
and look through the paying passengers things

933
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,000
during the flight.

934
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,640
According to her,

935
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,120
they sneak on while the terminal loads in the baggage,

936
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,480
nobody the wiser.

937
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,920
This only came up when I asked

938
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
why she was putting those miniature key locks

939
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,600
on every single zipper for checked bag,

940
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,200
as I thought she was more hesitant

941
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,960
about them opening during flight

942
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,400
instead of hitchhikers digging through her socks

943
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,360
or something.

944
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,920
How can I convince her that these airplane stowaways

945
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,360
don't exist and are not looking through luggage

946
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,000
and she doesn't need a dozen locks on her suitcase?

947
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,320
And that's from Surprised in Sarasota.

948
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,200
Of course, yes.

949
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,520
This is obviously ridiculous

950
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,040
because people sneak on the plane inside the luggage,

951
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,480
not while it's being loaded.

952
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,400
Don't be ridiculous.

953
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,680
And then when they put the luggage through the x-ray

954
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,640
and they get stopped like, hey, we saw some weird shit

955
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,320
and you can be like, no, no, no, it's just a skeleton.

956
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,820
Yep.

957
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,520
I'm fine if there's airplane hitchhikers.

958
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,480
If that's the point that we're at, that's fine.

959
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,800
Can I please leave my shoes on then?

960
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,360
If you are gonna let people climb on

961
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,720
and dig through people's bags with their sticky fingers,

962
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,160
can I please just leave the shoes on maybe?

963
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,120
Would that be okay?

964
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,520
They're prescription shoes, TSA.

965
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,760
Justin, you used the word let in the air

966
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,680
and it did occur to me that if this was truly a problem

967
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,440
and there were airline hitchhikers

968
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,080
and so airlines were just like, what are you gonna do?

969
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,880
Listen, we can't stop it every day.

970
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,960
We open the doors, oh, dang it.

971
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,080
Everybody's clothes are everywhere.

972
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,840
They got us again, the airline hitchhiker.

973
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,480
And they've just accepted that it's an inevitability.

974
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,080
You can't stop these sky pirates.

975
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,720
You know what I mean?

976
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,200
It happens.

977
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,760
That is what I am implying, yes.

978
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,680
I don't think that it would continue to be.

979
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,000
They don't let me on wearing my shoes.

980
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,680
You do get a chance to put,

981
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,000
you know that once you go through security,

982
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,840
you can put the shoes back on and you don't.

983
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:22,720
What?

984
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,240
Wait a minute.

985
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,760
Wait, I thought you left them off so you got home.

986
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,160
Are you the stink feet man I've been reading about?

987
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,440
I've been seeing articles pop up on Time,

988
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,880
the Wall Street Journal, all the big blogs

989
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,720
about the stink feet man who goes on the plane

990
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,240
and doesn't wear the shoes

991
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,880
and then just sort of makes the plane his space with the smell.

992
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,280
The worst thing I think about having to take your shoes off

993
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,960
at the airport and it's a huge inconvenience obviously,

994
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,440
but if you think about it, if you're a sane human being,

995
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,360
you go to get on the airplane and serve your kickoff buddies,

996
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,520
your buddies that you can just slip right off.

997
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,400
And then what happens?

998
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,680
Well, the terrible side effect is you've now loaded up

999
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,880
an airplane with people that are wearing the shoes

1000
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,160
that are most easily kicked off.

1001
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,640
Like most easy, just like kick off and relax.

1002
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,880
You're kickoff buddies and you're wearing them.

1003
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,480
It's a whole plane.

1004
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,160
We have like normalized taking your shoes off in an airplane

1005
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,080
because everybody's wearing the shoes

1006
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,800
that are so easy to slip on and off.

1007
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,720
They should make you wear your most difficult.

1008
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,960
Everybody should have to wear their steampunk boots

1009
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,560
that lace up to the knee that require two friends

1010
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,760
to help you get on and off.

1011
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,280
Your Dom boots.

1012
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,040
Yeah, I'm actually sitting here right now

1013
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,120
looking at my steampunk boots

1014
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,880
and that is where that reference came from.

1015
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah, the only hero of my brother, my brother.

1016
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,040
That's probably not true.

1017
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,840
This is a podcast.

1018
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,040
There's probably a lot of podcasters

1019
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,320
who have steampunk boots.

1020
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,400
If only there was a word for people who hide

1021
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,640
in the like the secret spaces of modes of transit

1022
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,520
because Airline Hitchhikers is kind of a mouthful.

1023
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,120
When they first said Airline Hitchhikers,

1024
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,280
it made me picture someone on a cloud like-

1025
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,200
Yeah, someone like on a hot air balloon

1026
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,320
with their thumb out and they're like,

1027
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,280
I gotta get to Phoenix,

1028
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,560
but I don't have a whole lot of money.

1029
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,440
Okay, here it comes.

1030
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,280
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1031
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,720
That's kind of what the little prince did.

1032
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,720
You know, the comments weren't into that.

1033
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,920
Comments weren't asked.

1034
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,560
The gremlin with the Shatner episode of Twilight Zone.

1035
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,760
Thank you, Travis.

1036
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,800
How about a yahoo?

1037
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,000
Yeah, can I just mention one other thing?

1038
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,240
The lid of my coffee mug stinks.

1039
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,080
You wash it?

1040
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,520
Yeah, I wash it every day

1041
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,680
and it's just the lid, the top of the lid of it stinks.

1042
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,840
Wait, it stinks like plastic?

1043
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,120
Because that's the thing I don't care for

1044
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,640
in the tumblers.

1045
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,160
It's a travel tumbler.

1046
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,680
That's the only thing I use to travel.

1047
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,920
I never, here's a fun fact about me.

1048
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,240
I don't leave the house as a rule.

1049
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,360
Don't pour my coffee in anything but travel mugs

1050
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,240
because if you're using a regular mug to drink your coffee,

1051
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,760
it is cold instantly.

1052
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,600
When I dump it into this,

1053
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,880
when I dump it into the Kotigo auto seal though,

1054
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,560
it's gonna stay warm for longer.

1055
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,680
So I always do that except the lid of this Kotigo auto seal

1056
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,840
smells so bad that I'm gonna throw the stink in

1057
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,200
and I'm gonna throw it away.

1058
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
What kind of stink, Justin?

1059
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,920
Let's get in there.

1060
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,720
I don't wanna know.

1061
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,680
Is it the stink like a dirty lid?

1062
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,080
Veto, veto, veto, blackball, blackball, blackball.

1063
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,520
Don't wanna hear about Justin's mouth stink.

1064
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,560
No way, veto.

1065
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
It is no way this is from me.

1066
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,600
This is not my brand.

1067
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,240
Is it just the material of the lid you don't care for?

1068
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,680
It's like it's a porous material that has absorbed stink

1069
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,360
at some point in the dishwashing process.

1070
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,880
What kind of stink, Justin?

1071
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I mean, it's an earthy, mellow stink.

1072
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,680
It's just like an old laundry stink.

1073
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,440
Kind of a musty old laundry stink on my Kotigo auto seal.

1074
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,480
How's the mouth feel?

1075
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,960
I mean, there's no sensory input in terms of tactile or taste.

1076
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,840
It's purely an olfactory issue.

1077
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,960
But with every drink, I'm like rubbing my nose in the stink

1078
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,720
while I'm trying to drink my coffee.

1079
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,480
Have you thought about just boiling the lid?

1080
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,400
I just took another drink.

1081
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Stop taking drinks of it, Justin.

1082
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,720
I need it to do the comedy.

1083
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,040
How about this Yahoo?

1084
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,400
What do you think you would do, Liv?

1085
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,360
Oh, fuck, for Christ's sake.

1086
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,600
You need coffee to do your comedy.

1087
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,880
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in.

1088
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,960
Thank you, Adrian Cowles, for sending this in.

1089
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Yahoo answers user Jason, who asks,

1090
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,760
what's your power meal?

1091
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,520
Update, update, I have two.

1092
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,760
15 bean soup and vegan chili.

1093
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,760
15 beans?

1094
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,360
That's 15 different kinds of beans, right?

1095
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,880
Not just like 15 beans.

1096
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,680
I think it's 15 beans because it's all that your,

1097
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,120
you know, all that your village had

1098
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,480
and you put it in there with the water

1099
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,960
and then everybody kind of makes up an imagination thing

1100
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,600
they put in there.

1101
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,280
And then at the end, you eat it and you're like,

1102
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,000
mm, my favorite, my favorite soup.

1103
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,120
But then you're like,

1104
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,960
we all know that this tastes like shit, right?

1105
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,360
Jeremy put a fucking rock in here

1106
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,920
and said it was like a magic rock that tasted good.

1107
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,400
But we can all agree that this is fucking gross, right?

1108
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,640
Okay.

1109
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,880
What's your power meal, though?

1110
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,680
What do you eat?

1111
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,120
I thought about this because I've reached a point now

1112
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,800
where there's very little food that makes me not want to either

1113
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,080
one, go to sleep or two, go to sleep on a toilet.

1114
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,760
And I don't know that food makes me feel powerful anymore

1115
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,680
as much as it makes me feel sad.

1116
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,960
So this isn't like your favorite happy comfort meal, right?

1117
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,280
Because for me, that's far too much fried chicken

1118
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,360
and cheesecake that does not make me feel powerful.

1119
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,480
No, not powerful.

1120
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,200
Not powerful.

1121
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,400
I'm talking about, I'm about to go fucking play paintball

1122
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,720
and I need to load up

1123
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,400
and I'm gonna get out there and play paintball

1124
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,280
and I need to load up.

1125
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,920
And so like, what's the meal I eat before then?

1126
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,560
So I can feel powerful so I can do all my cool

1127
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,400
like knee slide John Woo shit.

1128
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,760
And I'm saying I don't know because there's literally nothing.

1129
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,960
I mean, if you get me, okay, here's what it is for me.

1130
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,000
Salad, but like, staked out.

1131
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,600
Like tons of steak.

1132
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,760
Maybe you put a bunch of steak on salad.

1133
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,440
Oh, not like a salad you've been watching for weeks.

1134
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,400
No, to make sure nobody is tampered with it

1135
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,320
and make sure it's not falsifying documents.

1136
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,160
Yes, no, a steak salad because it's like,

1137
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,040
it blasts you with veggies and you love that raw energy,

1138
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,560
but then right behind it,

1139
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,720
it's got the protein there to kind of scoop you up.

1140
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,760
To make you go crazy.

1141
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,520
Yeah, that's what makes you go crazy.

1142
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,880
The other thing that I definitely would include in there

1143
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,840
is hot sauce.

1144
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,560
Like if you-

1145
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,720
Oh God, no, the power's gone, Justin.

1146
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,520
That's all I use.

1147
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,280
I don't use salad dressing.

1148
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,040
I use hot sauce on my salads.

1149
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,880
It turns you into a sports car.

1150
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,080
A what?

1151
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,480
It turns you into a sports car so you can go fast.

1152
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,880
And so there's our legally mandated-

1153
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,000
Every 100 episodes.

1154
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,800
Turbo Teen.

1155
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,160
Travis, if you think we referenced Turbo Teen

1156
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,280
every 100 episodes, you are out of your fucking mind.

1157
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,920
Fair enough.

1158
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,040
Justin, mine is similar,

1159
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,520
but mine is more contextual salad

1160
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,440
where it has to be like surprise, good decision salad.

1161
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,320
Okay, yes.

1162
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,200
You know, where it's like,

1163
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,680
oh, I'm feeling a little sluggish, right?

1164
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,520
I can't plan on having the salad,

1165
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,800
but I have to in the moment we're like,

1166
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,360
you know what?

1167
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,560
I mean, I have a salad.

1168
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,280
And that is like, it sneaks up on me

1169
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,960
and we go on an adventure together

1170
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,040
where I feel like I've made a good choice.

1171
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,360
And I feel better.

1172
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,360
That happens to be on tour sometimes.

1173
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,760
On tour sometimes like around the last show,

1174
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,560
Paul will be like, let's get that dinner order in.

1175
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,640
I'm like, you know what I'm gonna go with?

1176
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,880
And he like turns to me really slowly.

1177
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,600
And he's like, Justin, you don't mean a...

1178
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,960
And I'm like, yeah, Paul, I do.

1179
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,880
A salad.

1180
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,120
I mean, everybody on the crew,

1181
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,480
like rushes into the green room,

1182
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,840
which is against our writer.

1183
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,440
And everybody in the crew rushes in the green room

1184
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,840
and they just started applauding and screaming,

1185
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,440
like flinging things everywhere.

1186
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,120
That is a thing that happens all three of us.

1187
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,320
It'll be like, it's as if someone just suggested

1188
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,880
like a dessert where I'm like, oh, a salad.

1189
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,040
Actually, yeah, I changed my salad too.

1190
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,840
I can't, but I can't even,

1191
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,680
salad's not even great for me anymore

1192
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,800
because it shows up in my tummy.

1193
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,280
And like my tummy workers, like Bill is like,

1194
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,240
Susan, I don't even know what to do with this stuff.

1195
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,160
And Susan's like, yeah, I don't know either.

1196
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,560
Let's just get it out of here as fast as we possibly can.

1197
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,080
Griffin, I feel like science needs to develop for you

1198
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,640
some kind of like gray liquid

1199
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,360
that gives you all the sustenance that you need

1200
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,800
and the energy you need,

1201
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,440
but maybe you don't even notice you're eating it at the time.

1202
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,080
That might be the only thing your stomach

1203
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,200
is able to process now is my worry.

1204
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,040
Might be good, because right now my plan is like,

1205
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,880
I see a healthy salad and I see some mozzarella sticks

1206
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,040
and I'm like, both of these are gonna make me feel bad.

1207
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,640
I may as well have a good time in the mouth.

1208
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,880
Have you tried Soylent?

1209
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,320
They named their company after the thing

1210
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,560
where they killed people to turn them into food.

1211
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,280
Spoilers.

1212
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,360
It's just wild to me.

1213
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,080
It's like if Pepperidge Farms changed their name

1214
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,920
to Silence of the Lambs.

1215
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,760
You can't just, gang?

1216
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,440
Every one of our delicious boxes

1217
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,840
comes with our hickory-smoked fingers.

1218
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,640
Wait.

1219
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,400
Hickory-smoked dude?

1220
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,480
It's the wildest like tech bro shit ever to me

1221
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,720
where it's just like, yeah, we named it after,

1222
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,840
is it people or not?

1223
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,680
We'll never tell.

1224
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,480
We're fine.

1225
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,640
No, we're very successful.

1226
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,120
For reasons beyond Griffin's comprehension.

1227
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,440
Could you tell, actually?

1228
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,600
Could you actually tell real quick?

1229
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,920
Because like, I don't know if you've seen out there,

1230
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,880
but a company that called itself after the food drink,

1231
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,080
the maid of people, and then they did do it

1232
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,560
on the rankings of the past few years,

1233
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,600
I would be like, a seven, maybe a seven, maybe.

1234
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,840
You might trend for like an hour.

1235
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,720
It's people.

1236
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,920
And everyone's like, okay.

1237
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,120
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

1238
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,040
And it's still, I can just drink it

1239
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,600
and I'm good for like the next four or five hours

1240
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:39,920
and I don't-

1241
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Yeah, but it's people.

1242
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,520
Yeah, but it gives me whatever I need.

1243
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,240
But it gives me energy to code.

1244
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,720
Yeah, dude, go for it.

1245
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,520
It's people.

1246
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,160
What is it these days, am I right?

1247
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,040
Lots of things, every other thing.

1248
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,200
And a banana, an orange.

1249
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,200
Who has the time?

1250
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,120
The peeling, yuck.

1251
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,040
I can't peel, I got a code.

1252
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,200
How about another question

1253
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,800
or do you wanna Yahoo another one?

1254
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,880
Let's, we've only done two questions.

1255
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,640
Let's crank one more out here.

1256
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
I'm a delivery driver for a business in California

1257
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,720
that sends marijuana and other THC products

1258
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,880
to people's front door, just like pizza.

1259
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,000
It's legal here and I absolutely love my job.

1260
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,920
Well, yeah, it's a good gig.

1261
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,960
Every customer I've ever had has been positive.

1262
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
They've been polite and happy to see me.

1263
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,480
The problem is that sometimes they're too happy to see me

1264
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,080
and or they still have the stigma

1265
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,920
that our arrangement is something shady

1266
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,680
instead of a licensed business.

1267
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,040
And they asked me to come inside,

1268
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,880
which feels unsafe for me personally,

1269
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,280
and unprofessional for a business as legitimate as ours.

1270
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,800
How can I let my slightly too friendly customers

1271
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,920
down gently so I don't harsh their buzz?

1272
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,840
And that's from Weed Man Steve in Sacramento.

1273
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,160
Well, Steve, I should clarify what you're doing

1274
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,280
is still a federal crime.

1275
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,760
So let's not get too uppity.

1276
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,520
It's still a federal crime.

1277
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,120
Like pirating movies.

1278
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,400
Like pirating movies.

1279
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,840
What if they asked you to come inside?

1280
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,920
You said, oh, that's actually illegal.

1281
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,200
What you're doing is this is not going to be a problem

1282
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,320
in 20 years.

1283
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
This is a symptom of-

1284
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,080
That doesn't help Steve now.

1285
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,480
No, no, no.

1286
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,680
I'm just saying that this is a very unique issue

1287
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,720
that you are having to solve.

1288
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,960
I am saying that there's very little precedent for this

1289
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,560
because it is a problem that has only popped up

1290
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,320
in the last few years or so.

1291
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,000
Where back in the day, you'd call up Todd,

1292
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,680
Todd would come over,

1293
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,440
slide you some sweet greenie nugs,

1294
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,880
and then you'd be expected to play golden eye with Todd

1295
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,360
for the next three hours as he enjoys the thing

1296
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,560
you just paid for also kind of.

1297
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,840
Do you think when they started pizza delivery,

1298
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,040
the recipient was like,

1299
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,400
are you going to come in and slice it up for me?

1300
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,880
Do you want to eat some of it?

1301
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,440
Did you bring-

1302
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,160
You're probably hungry from walking over here.

1303
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,120
Did you bring any arcade games for me to enjoy?

1304
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,160
Because usually that's how it works.

1305
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,320
I bet early in the day they were like,

1306
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,680
listen, we got a whole pizza here.

1307
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,680
You should come on in and have some pizza.

1308
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,160
Come on in.

1309
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,640
I got some new cassettes that we can jam out to

1310
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,280
and enjoy my pizza.

1311
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,640
Hey, you're not a cop, are you?

1312
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,840
This blends so many things for me

1313
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,880
of my extreme social anxiety

1314
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,760
and just sort of general anxiety about

1315
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,440
I guess doing drugs with strangers

1316
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,360
is probably a good one to have.

1317
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,520
It sounds solid.

1318
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,040
What can we do?

1319
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,000
What can they do?

1320
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,480
It makes me wonder if this person was like,

1321
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,320
okay, get in here.

1322
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,760
And you said like, no, thank you.

1323
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,680
No, thanks.

1324
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,480
And they're like, oh, okay.

1325
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,360
Well, then let me get this transaction done

1326
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,520
as quickly as possible then, I guess.

1327
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,600
I can't say I wouldn't be that person though

1328
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,480
because my gratitude would be enormous.

1329
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,520
I'm extremely thankful

1330
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,280
when the pizza delivery person shows up

1331
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,400
and gives me the pizza.

1332
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,000
And I imagine that if the weed delivery person

1333
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,920
had showed up before the pizza delivery person,

1334
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,400
I would be exponentially more grateful

1335
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,520
towards the pizza one.

1336
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,520
I think I would also probably invite them in

1337
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,160
and give them some sort of like, I don't know, dowry.

1338
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,680
You've done a great service for me.

1339
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,400
I've been experiencing this from a different direction.

1340
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,440
I've been using DoorDash and DoorDash is like,

1341
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,760
how lazy are you?

1342
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,400
Cause basically you're calling in like a pickup order,

1343
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,800
but then you're having someone else

1344
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,520
that you do not know pick it up for you for money.

1345
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,080
So it's like delivery,

1346
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,360
but you have added the step of like saying,

1347
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,200
but I'm not gonna go get it.

1348
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,880
So it's not delivery.

1349
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,600
It's DiGiorno, which is the name of your driver.

1350
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,120
My name is Todd DiGiorno and here's your artist.

1351
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,800
When Todd DiGiorno brings it to me,

1352
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,640
my posture and attitude and tone of voice

1353
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,920
can only be described as deeply apologetic.

1354
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,520
Yeah, I fucked up.

1355
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,200
I should have done this instead of you, Todd DiGiorno.

1356
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,040
I know, listen, I know.

1357
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,840
I know this is where we're at and I get that.

1358
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,360
Oh man.

1359
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,240
We literally have said nothing helpful

1360
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,840
about what this person can do.

1361
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,280
I think you could just say like,

1362
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,760
sorry, I've got a lot of other stops.

1363
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,000
And then if you could spread some angel wings

1364
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,200
and just fly away

1365
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,400
and you've left your Mitsubishi eclipse behind,

1366
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,080
but you'll come back and get it later.

1367
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,520
But I think it's something that just says like,

1368
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,600
you can't, do you wanna come in?

1369
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,880
You can't hog me, bud.

1370
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,640
I got lots of other,

1371
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,880
I got lots of other miracles to perform tonight.

1372
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,800
What if when they said, do you wanna come in?

1373
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,480
You said, oh, I'm wearing a wire.

1374
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,680
I'm wearing a wire, why?

1375
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,520
Well, cause then they wouldn't want you to come in.

1376
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,040
Oh, so you're assuming they're already kind of high.

1377
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,120
So you could say like, I can't, I heard some cops.

1378
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,040
And then you just kind of leave.

1379
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,640
I can't go in, I'm a cop.

1380
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,960
Yeah, as long as you're playing into those stereotypes,

1381
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,400
you can just reach into your pocket

1382
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,080
and take out a fist full of combos

1383
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,840
that you kind of throw behind them.

1384
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,400
And then you can run away as they fiendishly

1385
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,280
chomp down on these floor combos.

1386
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,120
These weed rats, these druggie waste-oids.

1387
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,280
I think that's helpful.

1388
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,280
Yeah, that probably helps.

1389
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,120
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1390
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,120
We got a couple of other things to talk to you about.

1391
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,040
First one is our new merch store.

1392
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,320
If you're listening to this on Monday,

1393
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,640
it could be launching today, maybe tomorrow,

1394
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,840
definitely this week.

1395
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,920
It'll be at McElroyMerch.com when it is live and working.

1396
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,080
We'll tweet about it and Facebook about it

1397
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,200
and all that other good stuff.

1398
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,720
There's gonna be a ton of new fun items on there.

1399
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,080
A lot to discover and explore.

1400
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,480
There's a ton of new items on there

1401
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,040
as well as items we have offered before.

1402
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,720
And so I'm super excited for everybody to see these.

1403
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,640
There's some really cool stuff on here.

1404
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,840
We're actually partnering on this with DFTBA.

1405
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,640
Don't forget to be awesome.

1406
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,720
This is John Hank Green's business interests.

1407
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,000
They've got a lot of other great creators

1408
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,320
on there like Hannah Hart and Extra Credits.

1409
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,720

1410
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,840
The sequel to Extra Credits.

1411
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,600
So we're very excited about that.

1412
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,840
And it's McElroyMerch.com.

1413

00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,080
They usually sell out pretty quickly.

1430
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,680
That's not us being dicks.

1431
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,320

All one word.

00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,800
All one word if you want the early ticket sales.

1438
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,440
And then whatever is left will be on sale Friday

1439
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,720
at 10 a.m. local time.

1440
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,440
We are engaging in a special project this week

1441
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,600
that we can't give too many details on.

1442
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,080
But we need questions.

1443
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,400
It's the weirdest thing we've ever done.

1444
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,080
Yes, hands down.

1445
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,960
So we need from you questions, topics directly relating

1446
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,080
to like vacation, getting away, relaxing on a beach.

1447
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,120
Boat drinks.

1448
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,320
That kind of thing.

1449
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,960
Boat drinks, sailing.

1450
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,840
And you may think you know what it is from this.

1451
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,120
Trust me, you don't.

1452
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,320
It's weird.

1453
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,040
It's weird.

1454
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,000
And the good news is you're not gonna have to wait too long

1455
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,600
to listen to it if all goes according to plan.

1456
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:33,680
So just send those questions and put in the subject line.

1457
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,960
It's about vacations.

1458
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,320
So we know we can find it.

1459
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,040
Schmaners is going to be-

1460
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,000

1461
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,720
We're going to be at Moon Tower Comedy Festival on-

1462
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,920
My wife.

1463
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,440

It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1474
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,760
It's a very good album.

1475
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,360

Maximumfun.org.

1499
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,360

Hey, my name is Jonah Ray.

1503
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,240
You might have seen me on the latest season

1504
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,760
of Mystery Science Theater 3000

1505
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,760
or heard me on the Nerdist podcast.

1506
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,600
Well, I got a new podcast that's about five years old,

1507
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,440
but we're moving it over to Max Fun,

1508
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,280
along with my friend Cash Hartzell.

1509
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,080
Hey, everybody.

1510
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,440
And my other friend, Neil.

1511
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:39,920
Hi.

1512
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,480
Neil, man.

1513
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,520
So it's a music podcast where a lot of people

1514
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,520
just kind of hang out and talk about music,

1515
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,960
but so much more.

1516
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,160
We also take submissions.

1517
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,960
And we're going to be doing a little bit of music

1518
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,320
and so you can hear your band or our music.

1519
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,080
Or both.

1520
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,040
Or both of it.

1521
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,040
You could do, you could listen to your band,

1522
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,400
play your music.

1523
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:00,640
Yeah.

1524
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,600
So tune in, why don't you?

1525
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,360
You could find out about some new bands

1526
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,640
and maybe just hear us embarrass ourselves

1527
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,520
as we drink too much.

1528
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,240
Not too much.

1529
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,720
Well, it's all perspective, isn't it?

1530
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:21,440
Sure is.
