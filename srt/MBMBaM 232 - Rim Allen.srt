1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show from

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,880
modern era. We usually come up with something to say at the beginning,

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy. Did you just tell everybody

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,120
what we won't do? My thing for the beginning this week

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
was a little bit of my brother and my brother and me trivia,

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,840
in that we normally come up with something to do at the beginning.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,800
Fun facts, here's a thing we're not doing this week. You know why?

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,240
Because we stay up till like 2am watching the Pokemon Live musical.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
That is true, Griffin. Okay, we're all sitting here recording.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm going to paint a picture for everybody who can't see us right now.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
Justin's pointing furiously at Travis and the board, just pointed to something up.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
Are we good? Those levels look much better to me.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
Oh, by the way, if you're just tuning in as your second episode ever,

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,960
and you listen to the canonized episode, we curse a lot.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,880
Ooh, fuck, it feels so good to be back in the fucking saddle.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,520
We had hundreds of people who- Six hundreds of people.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,320
Listen, we had six hundreds of people who traveled from hundreds of miles away

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,560
to see our show. Our wives are literally in the goddamn next room,

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,760
and they cannot be bothered. They have a free-

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,400
What do you want them to do, stand in the doorway and just watch us lovingly bullshit at each other?

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,720
I want them to pull up a couple chairs, get some nog, and make it a real festive show.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,880
A personal, intimate live- You know what? I could eBay that.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,280
A personal, intimate live show. Just you and your favorite brothers

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,880
doing their comedy show, so intimate. I asked my wife to do a special Christmas

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,960
hour special with us, and you know what she did? She gave me an old finger and she made this noise.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,240
So I'm sure that our wives will be stopping in throughout this show to say hi.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Kind of a family. Maybe sing some songs.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,920
Maybe you'll hear them laughing in the background. They're great jokes.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe that also might not happen.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
If you came to our live show, thank you very much for coming to Huntington.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
We hope you have fun. We hope we can do that again next year.

37
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
Maybe in a more acoustically treated building and or room.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,200
A less century old building than that building was.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,640
But the show, the audio for the recording was good.

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah, it was good. But apparently some folks listening

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,800
had some troubles hearing it. If that was you, we are sorry, but we hope-

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
I'm not sorry. The magic of being there made up for it.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920
I heard a lot of people say, Echo, guess what? You just got fucking two shows.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,600
Two bonus shows. Two shows in one.

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,280
And here's a little tidbit from us to you. There was Echo on stage.

46
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,840
Try doing that at all. It is an-

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,560
But it was great.

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,160
But it was great. It was a lot of fun.

49
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,600
Next year we want to have just a festival.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Candlelight's Festival. Get every podcast in the world to come to Huntington.

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
And sing a song on stage.

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,480
And sing a song on stage. I just want to be like Stephen Colbert for like a second.

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
He can get like, like, Bill de Blasio.

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
And like- That was the best thing that he had was Bill de Blasio.

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,560
Literally, I cannot think of a single person that is- George Lucas.

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,120
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,600
You know what I mean?

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,880
I think he'd get Gio.

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,520
You think he'd get Gio?

60
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,480
What's he doing?

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,280
He's not doing anything.

62
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
Making that Ferngully movie.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
We'll talk about this off mic.

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,520
Well, yeah, we'll get Lucas.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
We'll get back to you.

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
Lucas, if you're out there, get at me.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,520
When I'm dining out specifically at restaurants with an Asian flair,

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,680
I tend to prefer my food rather spicy.

69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760
While I love the burn, spicy food usually makes my nose run.

70
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,520
I know that by no means acceptable will blow your nose on a cloth napkin at a restaurant,

71
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,960
but I can wipe my nose covertly without making any disgusting noises.

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,760
Can I wipe my nose?

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,480
They were saying can.

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,120
Can I?

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,240
They weren't bragging.

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
I can do it.

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
Don't even act like I can't wipe my nose.

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Don't even try to spot me wiping my nose.

79
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
You're going to miss it.

80
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,280
I'm illusion.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
Did a ghost just fly across Linda's face?

82
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
That's from Restaurant Runs.

83
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,160
Restaurant Runs.

84
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
Well, that's a different thing.

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,480
Man, the spicy food is giving me the Restaurant Runs.

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
Yeah, I mean, both.

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
Why can't it be both?

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
I mean, what's your alternative?

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Just let yourself have a leaky mess on your face.

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
But this used to not be a thing because people used to have like

91
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
handkerchiefs like on the ready like all the time for this.

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,560
Because can you imagine being that restaurant employee that has cloth napkins and be like,

93
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
oh, yeah, OK, snotty McGee on two.

94
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
And we got snotty Deborah on six.

95
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,600
In Victorian days, you would have usually wood or ivory nose plug

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,360
that you would put into your nostrils.

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,880
And that would help keep that.

98
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,920
Ladies would sometimes decorate theirs with like sparrows or leaves and shit.

99
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,720
And they just pop that badmama jammer right in there.

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
That's how Chrashan got her look.

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
That's how Chrashan's look was born.

102
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,760
Do you guys ever think about old timey handkerchief days

103
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,240
where it was just like a catch all for all of the plague

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,480
that you had inside of your nasal cavities?

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,640
And then when they get home and like take that bad boy out of their pocket,

106
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,840
how wouldn't you just?

107
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,600
I would just.

108
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,920
It's also not like they had their laundry game on point or anything,

109
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,400
you know what I mean?

110
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
They weren't throwing OxiClean in there.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,760
They never had a fresh handkerchief.

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,200
Did they even have water?

113
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,920
They probably did.

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,240
No, water wasn't invented until 1922.

115
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
Yeah, everyone was just super fucking thirsty, basically.

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,760
No, they had Gatorade.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,800
No, just have a handkerchief with you that says like my spicy buddy.

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,440
Then have it embroidered with the words my spicy buddy.

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
And then when you get really to business,

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
everybody will be like, you got to drop it.

121
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
You got to pull them out because then they'll get excited.

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
They'll get excited to see you wipe your nose.

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,320
And that's a hard needle to thread.

124
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,820
Yeah.

125
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
It's very distracting.

127
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
We had several guests from listeners at the live show.

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,320
Thank you all so, so much.

129
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,360
Thank you so much.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:41,360
One of the oddest was eight VHS copies of assorted Eddie Murphy films on VHS.

131
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
And I was just sitting here noticing that The Nutty Professor,

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,360
The Nutty Professor 2, well, they obviously had the same box art.

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,320
That's fine.

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,680
But it's also basically the same as Dr. Doolittle.

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
Basically, it's like they were just saying, hey, this is the same movie.

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,440
It's just the same thing again.

137
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's just keep this branding going.

138
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's keep this brand going.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
Yeah.

140
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,440
That Murph train will never stop rolling.

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,560
Never stop the Murph train.

142
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
I think there's actually nine.

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
I think one might be on the floor.

144
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
We had some fun with those VHS tapes.

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,960
I tell you what, boy.

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,920
Oh, boy.

147
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,240
Oh, boy.

148
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,840
Did we have some fun with those VHS tapes?

149
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,640
I made a fort.

150
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,520
You want to Yahoo?

151
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
Yeah, I guess.

152
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,680
Got Yahoo.

153
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,360
That was sent in by Adam Bash.

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you, Adam.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

156
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
I prefer Adam Franklin.

157
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,220
OK.

158
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,880
I got you.

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,160
Franklin and Bash goop, pretty tight, pretty tight.

160
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm Adam Rizzoli, and I'm Adam Ailes.

161
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,640
This Yahoo Answers user asks, my boyfriend gave me a 60-count box of waffles for Christmas.

162
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,240
He seems so excited about it, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.

163
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
And then there's a picture of a AGO Homestyle 60-count waffle box.

164
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,480
It's big, man.

165
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,720
It's big.

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
And it's name brand.

167
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,240
This isn't your off-brand store brand waffles.

168
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,200
Yeah, this isn't like yum, yum, and yum ones, 60 good time waffles.

169
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
That's probably a $20 box of waffles.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
That you think?

171
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Yeah.

172
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,400
60?

173
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,680
That's a pretty good value.

174
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
Pretty good value.

175
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,840
60?

176
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,400
We're talking about $23 waffle meals for $1 each.

177
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm trying to think, because I want to say a regular box of AGOs is like, what, $3, $4?

178
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
And that only has four and a half AGOs in it.

179
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,400
Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,640
So now we're talking 60, so I'm going to do some math.

181
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
OK, just tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

182
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,520
So yeah, you're paying like $0.06 an ounce.

183
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,120
This is a tough gift for somebody who struggles with weight.

184
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
Because you get a box of waffles, right?

185
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,600
And you're like, well, I'm going to treat myself.

186
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm going to have a waffle.

187
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
But then you think, well, it's time to get my life together.

188
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,240
It's time to lose weight.

189
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,440
But then you see, well, I'm not going to be losing weight till this box is empty.

190
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,600
The diet starts as soon as I pop my last AGO.

191
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,680
Let's get it down to what you do on your deathbed.

192
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
Let go, my soul.

193
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
Let go.

194
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,680
Yeah, I mean, then you got to at least eat it down to a nice round number.

195
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
You got to say, well, today I'm getting it down to 50.

196
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,320
But then you eat one too many, 49.

197
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
You can't stop at 49.

198
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
No, you have to eat the 50th.

199
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
You got to keep rocking.

200
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,320
I like this president because this president is saying, hey,

201
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm going to move into your freezer for a while.

202
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
Like, I'm going to keep this stuff at your place.

203
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
I want to keep these waffles at your house.

204
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
You know, she's not adequately impressed by the fact

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
that that's a tough wrap.

206
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,160
That's a tough wrap.

207
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
You got to time that.

208
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
They're not individual waffles, Justin.

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,400
They're in a box.

210
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,920
No, he's thinking about their temperature considerations.

211
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,640
Right, right.

212
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,200
I don't know what the paper does for insulation.

213
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,760
I don't know.

214
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,200
What's that inside the freezer?

215
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,160
Did Santa leave behind a special present?

216
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
I hope it's not a head.

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
Somebody should check in the freezer.

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
What's that puddle underneath the tree?

219
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,560
Did the stand?

220
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,240
No, that's waffle juice.

221
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,960
Waffles are fucked up.

222
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,760
Frozen waffle juice.

223
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm just like, wicked bad at presents, I guess.

224
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,960
Does it say how long they've been together?

225
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,520
No.

226
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,760
Because there's a weird bell curve that I think they are.

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,560
They get worse.

228
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,960
You're right.

229
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,000
The longer they're in the box.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
But if you've been together two weeks, right,

231
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,000
and you give them a 60 count, it's like, OK, right.

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
I wasn't expecting anything.

233
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,160
We've been together two weeks.

234
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
If you've been together like 20 years,

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,440
and he gets you like Eggo's, it's like,

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
oh, what a fun present.

237
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,240
Because you know how much I love Eggo's,

238
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,600
or this is a fun ironic joke.

239
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,920
But if you've been together like a year and get Eggo's,

240
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,800
you're done, though.

241
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,280
You're done.

242
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
Do you not?

243
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,120
Isn't there also a window where it's like, whoa, moving a little

244
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,840
fast, huh?

245
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,440
Oh, 60?

246
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,960
I'll start at four and a half.

247
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,080
I guess you've got a point.

248
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,120
If it was 12 waffles, there is no, that's fine.

249
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,680
Whatever.

250
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,560
12 waffles, I'll give a person on the street 12 waffles.

251
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,040
Right.

252
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,920
60 waffles.

253
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,080
Jesus, that's a commitment to yourself and to waffles.

254
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Yeah, that's like a modern version

255
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,360
of giving somebody your apartment key.

256
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
Like, hey, we're always going to have waffles for a while.

257
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,760
What if there's an engagement ring inside one of the waffles?

258
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,400
But then you won't know for like four months,

259
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
because that's how long it's going to take you.

260
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
Well, unless you get in the first waffle.

261
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,880
Oh, no.

262
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,080
The object is so slim.

263
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,240
Well, you say that, but somebody's got to win,

264
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
and it might as well be you.

265
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,360
My mother is an older mom.

266
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,080
I'm 22.

267
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,720
She's 60.

268
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,880
And she recently received a new smartphone from my father

269
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
as a belated birthday gift.

270
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
This is all fine and dandy.

271
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
However, some at the AT&T store are turning on to this app

272
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,360
with all the obnoxious free ringtones from circa 2006.

273
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,840
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

274
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,360
That's my impression of Crazy Frog.

275
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
These gems include a Blake Shelton

276
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,640
sound like singing Your Hubby is Calling.

277
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
Give us a taste of that.

278
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,280
Your hubby is calling.

279
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,960
And a woman shouting, alert, it's your mother-in-law.

280
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,460
Brothers.

281
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,200
Brothers.

282
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,440
I love my mother dearly,

283
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,840
but I can't change another one of her contacts

284
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,760
to one of the corresponding tones.

285
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,260
Help.

286
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,760
Help.

287
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,580
That's from Audibly Arrayed in Austin.

288
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,540
That's my city.

289
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,340
I don't want to hear that.

290
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,380
That's polluting your air.

291
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
I don't want to be at Whole Foods in here.

292
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,060
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

293
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,500
Your hubby is calling to die.

294
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,140
That's Blake.

295
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,260
Why don't you make a deal with her

296
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,420
that they're all very annoying,

297
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,780
so you're gonna put them all into one single ringtone

298
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,060
that she has to use for everything.

299
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,460
Oh, and then she can only use it when you're calling,

300
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,820
because then you'll never be around.

301
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,220
Let's give a sampler what that would sound like.

302
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,260
Three, two, one.

303
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,380
That would be pretty good.

304
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,900
I think that would be a pretty good ringtone.

305
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,860
And if you want to take that,

306
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,660
and you want to cut that out,

307
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,860
make it a WAV file,

308
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,460
maybe an M4A file,

309
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
attach that to all our contacts.

310
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,420
Maybe a GIF.

311
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,020
When we call you, we want that sound.

312
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,260
Yeah, this is basically Prairie Home fucking campaign.

313
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,940
Or wait, wait, don't fucking tell.

314
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:27,960
Yeah.

315
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,300
This sucks, and that person at AT&T store should feel bad.

316
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,740
Did they upsell them?

317
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,380
Why do you...

318
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,940
No, probably didn't upsell them on this shitty ringtone app.

319
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,780
No, it was probably another 60 year old was like,

320
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,980
hold up, you gonna love this.

321
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,580
Hold on, players.

322
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,100
You're gonna love this app.

323
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,140
You think about going with that...

324
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,180
No, put that away, put that away.

325
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,060
I got something for you.

326
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,580
Ring, ring, I'm a phone.

327
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,300
Do you like that?

328
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,580
I do.

329
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,020
I got more where that came from.

330
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,900
I do like that.

331
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,140
Check this out.

332
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,340
First taste is free.

333
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,980
Check this out.

334
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,620
No, of course, it's not the real Tim Allen.

335
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,460
I like it though.

336
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,900
We couldn't get the real Tim Allen.

337
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,940
It's close enough for me.

338
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,980
I'm not a proud woman.

339
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,180
You got text.

340
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,380
You really have your finger on my pulse here.

341
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,340
We got Rim Allen.

342
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,480
Sorry?

343
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,380
Rim Allen.

344
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,660
Do you know how...

345
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,860
Is that Tim's nephew?

346
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,100
Do you know how in Zelda there's...

347
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,740
I don't know.

348
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,620
You've lost me already.

349
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,660
I'm a 60 year old woman.

350
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,460
There's Dark Link.

351
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,700
That's what Rim Allen is.

352
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,180
Rim Allen is Dark Link?

353
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,220
For Tim Allen.

354
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,660
Oh, for Tim Allen, there's a metaphor.

355
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,940
Shadow world version.

356
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,540
You got any other ringtones on there?

357
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,340
I might have to pay...

358
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,940
These are probably like $100, right?

359
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,420
I'm probably gonna pay $100 for this ringtone app.

360
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,740
$100 a ringtone?

361
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,460
$100 a ringtone.

362
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,900
How many bitcoins does this cost?

363
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,420
I hear my grandchildren talk about it.

364
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,140
How much would you expect to pay in bitcoins for this ringtone app?

365
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,620
Christ.

366
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,700
Four kilobytes.

367
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,660
At least four kilobytes.

368
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,180
I mean, you can delete it and she'll never find it.

369
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,740
She won't find it again.

370
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,100
She'll never find it again.

371
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,460
But then when somebody calls her, it's just gonna be like...

372
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,260
Read another question.

373
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,820
Not a lot of people sent...

374
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,460
I got some great yahoos this week, but not a lot of people sent in yahoos.

375
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,020
I guess they were celebrating the Christ child.

376
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,460
My desk is located next to both the kitchen and mailboxes at work.

377
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,500
I have a young coworker who literally every time she walks past my desk

378
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,100
asks in a sing-song voice,

379
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,980
How's it going?

380
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,860
And actually expects an answer.

381
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,860
At first, I answered her honestly, but lately I've been getting annoyed

382
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,660
and will just say,

383
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,380
Fine.

384
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,740
It's going fine.

385
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,300
Or, you know...

386
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,780
Brothers, can you help me come up with some different ways to answer this woman

387
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,620
who demands to know how it's going five to eight times a day?

388
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,220
That's from It's Going Freaking Fine in Columbus.

389
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,540
Bless you.

390
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,580
We had a genuine my brother, my brother and me sneeze on the scene.

391
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,380
You heard it here first.

392
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,100
You heard it here first.

393
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Can't edit that one over out because we are recording one track.

394
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
I think this is why people come up with idioms.

395
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,980
I think it's why our dad speaks almost exclusively in idioms at this point.

396
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,060
He is basically just a ringtone app of idioms at this point

397
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,700
because you just want to have fun stuff to say like,

398
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,420
How's it going?

399
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,300
Fire and frogs here.

400
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,660
Split four ways.

401
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,540
That's what that is.

402
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,180
You realize that, right?

403
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,980
That's a good jam.

404
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,980
Fire and frogs here.

405
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,940
Split four ways.

406
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,180
And if you want to get a little fancy,

407
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,060
if you can nail the execution, split four ways and sand it down.

408
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,260
Now, that's a harder.

409
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,660
That's a harder.

410
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,700
You got to nail it this way.

411
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,580
You got to nail it this way.

412
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,140
It's going to be hard to make that frog stand that stand.

413
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,460
The good thing about fire than frogs here is

414
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,700
if you don't know it and you probably don't,

415
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
the person's still kind of like chewing on it

416
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,740
and you have plenty of time to push them over and run away.

417
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:40,980
Yeah.

418
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,900
You can push them into an open trash can and then run.

419
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,020
Don't be so confused.

420
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,300
Is it possible she's just been waiting for you to turn it around

421
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,900
and she's not doing so hot and you don't say like,

422
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,260
well, no, how are you?

423
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,860
And then she's just got to break.

424
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,140
It's like, oh, my God.

425
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,180
I'm glad you asked.

426
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,900
I'm so glad.

427
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,780
It's because I've been waiting.

428
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,580
I'm the worst.

429
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,660
Is she doing like Joey from Friends?

430
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,860
Like, how's it going?

431
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,060
I'm sorry.

432
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,780
Want some more?

433
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,020
How's it going?

434
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,820
He got worse.

435
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,100
Joey's melting.

436
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,900
Joey's melting.

437
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,180
Joey's melting.

438
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,700
If you had asked us in like season one,

439
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,740
My Brother, My Brother, Me,

440
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,180
I probably would have said something funny.

441
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,420
And like, but this is like nothing.

442
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,620
This is a non-issue.

443
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,700
Like when did, what season are we in now?

444
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,580
And when did season one end?

445
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,740
I think the Canalized Specialists are season one finale,

446
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,300
which by the way,

447
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,020
thanks for tuning into the thrilling season premiere,

448
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,580
season two.

449
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,060
Someone dies.

450
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,460
Someone flies.

451
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,260
Save the cheerleader.

452
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,740
Save the world.

453
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,620
I just feel like this is like,

454
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,780
she's asking how's it going

455
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,780
and she just happens to be the other person

456
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,540
that's kind of interested in the answer.

457
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,780
Like there's way worse people

458
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,700
that you will encounter in work.

459
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Like that's not that bad.

460
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,460
But you have to give it up

461
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,340
for the fact that this person got the worst desk, right?

462
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,220
Is right next to all the shit.

463
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,820
It's a high traffic area.

464
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,620
You don't want that.

465
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,900
You want a secret cubby hole.

466
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,300
How else are you gonna look at funny videos on E-bombs world?

467
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,140
Can you just respond like it's going great.

468
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,980
Thanks for asking every time.

469
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,700
And like-

470
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,140
And try to wear her down.

471
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,020
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

472
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,540
But you have to do it in like a pleasant.

473
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,300
Like I'm not like, oh, it's fine.

474
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,180
Thanks for asking.

475
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,460
Say like, fine, thanks for asking.

476
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,740
Fine, thanks for asking.

477
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,180
But exactly the same.

478
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,820
That's not, that is not gonna have the desired effect.

479
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,260
I feel like if you drop a fireman frog's hair,

480
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,700
split four ways and stand it down.

481
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,060
Every time she asks you,

482
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,220
she is going to stop asking you.

483
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,500
No, because then

484
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,660
you're the funny, cute one who uses that.

485
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,980
And now it's a thing between the two of you.

486
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,500
And you always say like, oh, how's it going?

487
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,020
Fireman frog hair split four ways.

488
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,060
She's like, that's our thing.

489
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,300
You do that eight times a day for a year.

490
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,420
You're not a cute, funny one.

491
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,540
You're a Cyberman.

492
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,620
Oh, can you do it just flat?

493
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,420
Like no effect.

494
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,980
Fireman frog hair split four ways.

495
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,060
Why don't you look her dead in the eye

496
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,980
and grab her, grab her necktie and pull her real close.

497
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,300
Okay.

498
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,500
Is this Paula Poundstone?

499
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,700
Grab her necktie, pull her real close

500
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,420
and just get in her ear and say, diarrhea.

501
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,620
Every time.

502
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,500
A little added effect there,

503
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,100
Justin went beyond the pop filter.

504
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,780
Go beyond the pop filter again.

505
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,340
Diarrhea.

506
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,380
Can you tell the difference?

507
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,580
There was a little bit of pop in there

508
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,380
and some diarrhea.

509
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,660
You wanna Yahoo?

510
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:22,900
Yeah.

511
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,180
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

512
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,020
Let's all get really comfortable with each other, okay?

513
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,060
Thanks, Drew Davenport.

514
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,140
You are a miracle boy.

515
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,860
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user.

516
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,420
And since he's finally starting to kick in, huh?

517
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,820
Oh yeah, it does not smell like poop in here as much anymore.

518
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,540
So thank you for that.

519
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,460
We're recording in the same room

520
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,100
that my cat litter box is.

521
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,580
And usually I'm very diligent about cleaning up.

522
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,780
But you know, it's the holidays.

523
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,900
You let things slide.

524
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,820
You wrap them up as presents.

525
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,420
You wrap them up as presents.

526
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,540
You feed them to your baby.

527
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,420
Amy Sue Harris asks,

528
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,540
I know, dry hump advice?

529
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,220
I know it sounds stupid,

530
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,940
but for a 15-year-old hormone-enraged girl

531
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,660
who can't go on the pill and whose boyfriend isn't ready,

532
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,060
it's a pretty smart way to pleasure both of us.

533
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,220
This person is 32.

534
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,420
Shh, pretty new to our relationship though.

535
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,940
And I have some questions.

536
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,300
How do I position ourselves?

537
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,340
So it's like his,

538
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,940
that's what it says,

539
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,020
is rubbing right against my arm so it's more enjoyable.

540
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,900
And is it better as fast and hard?

541
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,500
And what's the best way to do it?

542
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,580
Usually I wear tights and he wears jeans.

543
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,020
Tips? Thank you.

544
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,900
Valerie, clear our schedule.

545
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,060
We're doing the rest of the show

546
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,780
about how to teach teens on dry humping.

547
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,780
Oh, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

548
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,700
Is this legal hot waters?

549
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,300
Because this is a 15-year-old.

550
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,460
No, because it's not a 15-year-old.

551
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,820
It's not a 15-year-old, Griffin.

552
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,220
This is not worded how a 15-year-old would ask.

553
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,060
When you say things like his ahem and my ahem,

554
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,740
this is a 40-year-old woman.

555
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,220
Trying to dry hump a 15-year-old boy.

556
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,460
Yeah, like, hey, I need some tips.

557
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,780
Now that'll sound weird if I say I'm a 40-year-old

558
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,980
trying to hump a 15-year-old.

559
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,580
Yeah, try that, it might sound a bit weird.

560
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,540
Oh, I know.

561
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,300
I'll say I am also 15.

562
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,260
Here, let's just give general dry hump advice

563
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,380
into the ether.

564
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,620
And then if it hits this 15-year-old, cool, cool.

565
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,980
If they catch it like dry humping.

566
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,100
Like big butterflies.

567
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,300
How long can we give dry hump advice to teens

568
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,660
before our wives come in?

569
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,740
At least one is like, stop.

570
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,300
Stop it.

571
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,860
Stop it.

572
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,540
Guys, stop it.

573
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,260
No.

574
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,820
Stop it.

575
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,740
Dry scissoring.

576
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,220
Just like lead off with that, Justin.

577
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,500
That's good for placement.

578
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,860
You know what I like?

579
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,460
A nice side-by-side dry hump

580
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,940
where you just rub your legs together like crickets

581
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,020
and you just get some friction in your jeans.

582
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,220
Yeah, fire hazard, though.

583
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,100
You gotta watch out for that.

584
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,020
Oh, yeah, don't get no sandpaper in there.

585
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,340
Ooh.

586
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,260
You're saying you preheat the oven

587
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,220
by rubbing your zone to get it super friction hot

588
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
and then you touch it gingerly against it?

589
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,060
No, that's how you build up static electricity

590
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,900
and then you poke them in the face and shock them.

591
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,020
Some dudes like that.

592
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,740
That's all I'm saying.

593
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,180
Some dudes are into that.

594
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,740
One thing is you can put a sandpaper patch

595
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,180
on your front of your jeans

596
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,500
and that can give you some really good traction

597
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,940
when you're dry humping.

598
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,420
You know what?

599
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,460
What I like is the old sit and spin.

600
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,660
Oh, yeah?

601
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,500
Yeah, where you both sit on sit and spins

602
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,620
and just play with them.

603
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,300
I like the double wrecking ball.

604
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,020
How does that work?

605
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,700
Let me think.

606
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,860
If you gotta be on some sort of swing,

607
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,060
some sort of rope, lever, attach to the ceiling,

608
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,540
and then the two of you just sort of go like this

609
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,620
and you just sort of swing into each other over and over again.

610
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,180
That's pretty good.

611
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,060
You just smash it together.

612
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,420
How about the mortar and pestle?

613
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,700
And that's where you dry hump,

614
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,300
but you put some barley down there

615
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,580
and you grind it up when you're done.

616
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,100
And when you're done, you have ground up barley.

617
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,220
I like the kind of dry humping where you dry hump so hard

618
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,060
that I guess some stuff just got through,

619
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,820
or at least that's what I told my gynecologist.

620
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,020
Wow, a lot going on there.

621
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,180
I think that one of the weirdest things about dry humping

622
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,460
is I feel like it has...

623
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,020
What are the weirdest things about dry humping?

624
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,180
There's a sentence I want to hear my middle brother say.

625
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,740
Hit me.

626
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm just thinking about like that there must be

627
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,900
like kind of that age of innocence

628
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,700
because there has to be a point where you suddenly go,

629
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,740
what are we doing?

630
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,540
What are we doing?

631
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,660
This is too dry.

632
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,380
This is dumb.

633
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,180
And I doubt very much that there are 40-year-old people

634
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,740
who are like, hey, let's just dry hump tonight.

635
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,140
Because then you're just looking going, what are we doing?

636
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,140
Hey, I got an idea to spice things up.

637
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,580
Let's reduce the moisture.

638
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,900
What are we doing?

639
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,300
And so it's almost like this very innocent,

640
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,980
but also very weird thing.

641
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,660
You know how much it would please me

642
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,180
if they dry hump?

643
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,140
Just right now for once, to just feel young again.

644
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,420
Probably not like a lot.

645
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,260
Do you think people ever dry hump for the novel?

646
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,700
Are you feeling young again?

647
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,340
Yeah.

648
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,860
Just like the same way you'd like go to see

649
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,900
a Backstreet Boys reunion tour.

650
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,620
And dry hump.

651
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,740
And dry hump all the Backstreet Boys in sequence.

652
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,620
Just to feel young.

653
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,060
Wait, in what sequence?

654
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,500
What's the proper sequence?

655
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,140
I will unlock the Pharaoh's tomb.

656
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,700
OK, it's JC, Tori, Jody, December, Big Ralph.

657
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
OK, if you do it in that order.

658
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,380
Sorry, was one of them called December?

659
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,340
Yeah, December was one of them.

660
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,820
Tori, Jody, December, Big Ralph.

661
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,460
Chazes.

662
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,260
And Chazes.

663
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,220
They're all brothers.

664
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,660
You sweep back around.

665
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,300
That's the scene, guys.

666
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,500
All right, nobody's popping up in the tomb.

667
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,420
And while Justin's going to be a very rich man very soon,

668
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,380
very rich with locusts, you got to swoop back around

669
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,660
and get JC again.

670
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,620
So can you imagine the last-

671
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,780
By that point, you will have worn holes in your jeans.

672
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,340
Right.

673
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,540
The last five minutes of our show being transcribed,

674
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,940
and Dave Barry just hands it to his editor.

675
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,060
This is my new book.

676
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,220
Weird stuff about dry humping by Dave Barry.

677
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,260
I'm not sure, Dave.

678
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,460
I don't think you've got a hit.

679
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,980
Forward by JC Chazes.

680
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,140
Please leave me alone.

681
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,100
Please, please, please.

682
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,620
I don't know where the treasure is.

683
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
I don't know how many times I have to tell you.

684
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,660
Please stop dry humping me.

685
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,860
I haven't dry humped in months.

686
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,580
Stop talking about me.

687
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,980
Keep my name out your mouth when you're talking about dry humping.

688
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,740
What are some other great things to say about dry humping out loud?

689
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,020
It's better than impact humping.

690
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,900
Is dry humping, is that a gateway, do you think?

691
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,620
You go from dry humping to like arid humping?

692
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,500
Yeah, you got to make sure it's the gateway in the right direction

693
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,940
to hydrated humping.

694
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,380
And then you got, you got, you have to get your electrolytes.

695
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:35,860
You can't be-

696
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,820
Oh my God.

697
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,420
Oh, it's so easy.

698
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,940
Don't try to, don't try to dry hump without talcum powder on hand.

699
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,740
Something.

700
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,220
Something.

701
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,300
Should we go to the money ton?

702
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,580
I feel like we're already there.

703
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,460
This week, talcum powder.

704
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,060
Put it down there, you have to.

705
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,020
Guys, we have a return of a classic sponsor,

706
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,140
and this is one that I'm real big into, one month.

707
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,780
Here's a fact.

708
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,100
Have we made that joke yet?

709
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,500
No.

710
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,980
Finish it.

711
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,380
If you want a chicken.

712
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,300
If you want to code a website that demands the death of Griffin McElroy

713
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,380
for the last 15 seconds of audio.

714
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,340
You cannot kill me.

715
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,060
I opened the Pharaoh's tomb.

716
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,540
That weird.

717
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,020
Coding.

718
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,260
Coding was the most in demand job skill of 2014.

719
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,980
That is one of them.

720
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,980
Peanut butter will be 2015.

721
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,340
You heard it here first, I'm guessing.

722
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,740
Here's my thing to you, okay?

723
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,260
Your 2014 was a little rough.

724
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,580
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

725
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,380
Are you talking to everyone?

726
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,980
Cause it was pretty much rough room.

727
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,420
Yeah, but you know how we're going to fix it.

728
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,620
We're all going to learn how to code.

729
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,140
We're going to code our way right out of here.

730
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,860
In 2015, you're going to learn how to code with one month rails.

731
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,700
Imagine you can build your website overnight.

732
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,500
Imagine that your resume could stand out when you're applying for a job.

733
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,860
That's like how I'm imagining.

734
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,460
One month rails is the easiest way to learn how to code.

735
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,140
You can learn Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, GYAT.

736
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,220
I don't know what GYAT is.

737
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,940
GYAT.

738
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,660
GYAT.

739
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,160
GYAT.

740
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,500
You can learn all that stuff.

741
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,820
I haven't-

742
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,340
That's why you said all the bugs in your code.

743
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:20,820
GYAT.

744
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,580
I have done a one month course on HTML.

745
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,740
I knew a little bit beforehand, but it was a really good,

746
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,060
I mean, not just a refresher because HTML has changed so much

747
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:37,220
since I made the GeoCities webpage for my band of Vezo in the mid 90s.

748
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,660
It's changed a thing you say.

749
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,500
So has your band of Vezo.

750
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:40,740
Yeah.

751
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,420
Our sound is very much evolved in that we have been dormant for 15 years.

752
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,940
By the way, Justin is panda bear.

753
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,440
All right.

754
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,340
So it is a really super easy way.

755
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,620
They break it down to where it's like a half hour every day, 30 minutes.

756
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,340
You dip in, you do the lesson for that day.

757
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,180
The biggest problem I had was honestly stopping,

758
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,540
because sometimes I wanted to do another lesson because they're a lot of fun.

759
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,660
They've got other classes too.

760
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,460
One month iOS to help you build an iPhone app.

761
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,820
Whoa, I want to do that one.

762
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,780
That sounds like fun.

763
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,020
Yeah.

764
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,220
One month growth hacking.

765
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,660
That's to get like GBH.

766
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,300
And there's one month HTML.

767
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,060
I took the class.

768
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,340
Like I said, it's great.

769
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,780
30 minutes for 30 days, and then you will have this new skill.

770
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,900
I'm totally going to do that.

771
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,380
App one.

772
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,780
That sounds great.

773
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,500
Yeah, do an app.

774
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,580
I'm going to make an app, because that's what the world needs is more apps.

775
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,380
And how do they do it?

776
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,420
You go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

777
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,940
Now, typically your room is going to be $99, but if you join now,

778
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,660
you're going to get a one time discount of 25% off.

779
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,340
Which I think is going to be like $24.96.

780
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,740
One month is the service.

781
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,700
Again, that address is onemonth.com slash my brother.

782
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,260
You are really going to like one month a lot.

783
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,860
Let's turn around 2015.

784
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,420
You've earned it.

785
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,460
Here's a call to action.

786
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,020
Assemble and check out slash cg.com.

787
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,220
Ship just got real.

788
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,060
I guess that's the tagline for it.

789
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,220
I think it's short for like friendship.

790
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,580
Or relationship.

791
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,060
Oh, OK.

792
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,340
Games by Playdate is excited to release The Blanks,

793
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,980
a customizable expansion for the hit party game slash romance without boundaries.

794
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,980
Put yourself, your friends, and...

795
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,820
Oh, God.

796
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,180
It's cush.

797
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,540
Put yourself, your friends, and your frenemies in a one true pairing

798
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,380
with your favorite pop culture figures.

799
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,180
Why not add Orb, Glass Shark, Tiny Amelie, or Edward Snowden

800
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,180
to your evening of improv slash fic?

801
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,300
I don't know who any of those things are or what they're referring to.

802
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,580
My Bim Bam won't care that you've got them making pretend romance

803
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,380
to She-Ra or Rasputin, probably.

804
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,420
Well, uh...

805
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,580
True love can't be stopped by time, space, logic, or literary canon.

806
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,940
Hey, that's not true.

807
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,260
Space, logic, or literary canon.

808
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,140
Hey, fuck the shit out of Rasputin.

809
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,940
I don't give a damn.

810
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
Games by Playdate, they're great.

811
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,420
They've been big supporters of our show, and we're huge fans of theirs.

812
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,380
They sent me a couple games and everything, just out of the goodness of their heart.

813
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,340
There's a Shakespeare game that they sent me that I cannot wait to play.

814
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,020
They made a Sawbones game.

815
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,860
They made 13 Dead in Drive.

816
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,140
They made that board game.

817
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,500
I'm gonna send it back in time.

818
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,060
Kerplunk?

819
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,820
By the way, guys, I have 13 Dead in Drive.

820
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,100
You wanna play some fucking 13 Dead in Drive?

821
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,060
Stop the show now.

822
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,540
A copy of 13 Dead in Drive has ever worked once.

823
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,740
That game's busted.

824
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
It's a combination of Clue and Mousetrap.

825
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,300
Enjoy!

826
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,100
And Broken Shit.

827
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
So, check out slash CG.com.

828
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,700
Ship just got real.

829
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,500
Just got another message for Toby, and it's from Zach Sasha.

830
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,780
Another message for Toby.

831
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,060
Yep, he just keeps getting them.

832
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,060
We've probably done a Toby message at some point.

833
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,260
It's from Zach, Sasha, and Jake, who say,

834
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,060
Dear Toby slash Dink Joe slash Swaday.

835
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,660
Swaday.

836
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,060
Swaday.

837
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,180
Shaday.

838
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,060
Shaday.

839
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,260
Congratulations on being born 27 goat years ago.

840
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,060
You read so many books, know so many things, and frown so much.

841
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,700
We, not Zach, adore your curls.

842
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,020
Wow.

843
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,140
Your feminine cardigans and your obnoxious t-shoes.

844
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,780
I said t's, but your t's are probably fucked up too.

845
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,660
Your bi-weekly grumpy visits almost make up for you moving out,

846
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,420
and we're all proud of your literary success and smoke-free lungs.

847
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:16,740
Love.

848
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,580
Love.

849
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:18,900
Love.

850
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,780
Love.

851
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,580
Love.

852
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
Sorry about your curls.

853
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,180
Toby, it sounds like you're getting your life together vis-a-vis smoking.

854
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,380
I do wish you would smile.

855
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,260
Turn that frown upside down.

856
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,780
Turn that frown upside down.

857
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
You don't have to worry about nicotine stains anymore.

858
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,900
Let's get that smile going.

859
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,580
Hey, baby girl.

860
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,220
Hey.

861
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,460
Hey.

862
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,900
Show me that smile.

863
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Show me that, no, it's right here.

864
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,780
Show me, show me that smile.

865
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,620
Let me try, no, it's up right here.

866
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,980
Show me that smile again.

867
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,580
Show me that smile.

868
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,260
Don't waste another minute on your crying.

869
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,260
We know we're near the end.

870
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,620
The best is ready to begin.

871
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,300
As long as we got each other,

872
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:16,260
we got the world spinning right in our hands, baby.

873
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:25,780
You and me, we gotta be the luckiest dreamers who never quit dreaming.

874
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,460
We just made that up.

875
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,780
Excuse me, boys.

876
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:39,380
I'm Alan Thicke, and all of you are going to prison for a long time.

877
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,540
I'm Canada's Alan Thicke.

878
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,020
Please don't remind anyone I'm related to Thicke.

879
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,540
Oh my god, it's my daughter.

880
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,260
Hi, Charlie Gale.

881
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,460
Hey, Charlie Gale.

882
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,700
In her third costume of the day.

883
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,100
Wow, already?

884
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,500
You just keep on pooping and spitting, pooping and spitting, pooping and spitting.

885
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,780
And we pooped right through it.

886
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,500
Pooped right through it.

887
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,780
Pooped right through it.

888
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,980
Just like we're doing to this show.

889
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,580
Welcome to Vim Bam.

890
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,260
We pooped right through our clothes.

891
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,380
Welcome to Vim Bam.

892
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:09,380
Our let's just get 45 minutes of audio containing anything ever on the book.

893
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,860
Did we just sing the growing pains theme song?

894
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,140
I don't know, I'm blacked out.

895
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,500
That ain't a good 90 seconds.

896
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:14,980
That was great.

897
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,260
Hey, everyone.

898
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,060
We're the Flophouse, one of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun podcasting network.

899
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,260
I'm Dan McCoy.

900
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,540
I'm Stuart Wellington.

901
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,980
And I'm Elliott Kalin.

902
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,700
What is the Flophouse, you may very well ask.

903
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,940
We watch a bad movie, and then we talk about it.

904
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,300
A bad movie podcast?

905
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,780
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

906
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,460
I'd answer that by saying, one, we've been doing this show for over seven years,

907
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,580
long before the entire premise of our show was a cliche.

908
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,100
And two, shut up.

909
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
Sick bird.

910
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,020
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

911
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,420
A podcast about words that sound like other words.

912
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,060
A podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one.

913
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,020
A podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie.

914
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,260
Or discussions about sex tarps.

915
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,340
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out.

916
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,860
And talking about ding dongs.

917
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,900
That's mostly used to.

918
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,780
Wait, what?

919
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,460

921
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,580
The Flophouse.

922
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,980
I work for a small company.

923
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,180
My only everyday coworker is my boss's daughter.

924
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,940
I don't know.

925
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
Starring Ashton Kutcher.

926
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,220
We recently moved into a small office, roughly 10 by 15.

927
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,980
And whatever perfume, body spray, or whatever is just overwhelming.

928
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,780
To make it worse, she's a germaphobe

929
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,820
and applies similarly scented hand sanitizer at least every hour.

930
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,860
I'm sitting next to her right now and I have such a headache because of the smell.

931
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,580
To be clear, the scent itself is not unpleasant,

932
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,980
but it's the perfume volume to space ratio that's causing the problem.

933
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,340
Well, I've made subtle general remarks.

934
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,620
She's obviously not picking up on those.

935
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,780
What's the best way to approach this situation?

936
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,900
Do I confront her about it,

937
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,300
or do I find a way to make my experience less miserable?

938
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
That's from Stunk Out in St. Louis.

939
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,700
You gotta over stink her.

940
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,620
You have to out stink the stinker.

941
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,580
Gotta do it.

942
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,100
You gotta fight those waves of force with it to fuel you on your own.

943
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,540
And what, how?

944
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,060
Go negative?

945
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,620
Well, you can take the campaign negative.

946
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,500
Suck on the anti-smell.

947
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,780
Yeah, well, cause here's the thing.

948
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,340
She's already a fan of like the positive smells.

949
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,700
You know, she's doing the scents.

950
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,980
She's doing the perfumes.

951
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,820
You gotta go negative.

952
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,980
You gotta take the campaign negative.

953
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,500
Are you talking about stinky bad smells,

954
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,180
or are you talking about negative smell?

955
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,300
Things that, things that possess no smell and-

956
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,540
Some activated carbon in the air.

957
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,020
Yeah.

958
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,820
Something.

959
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,820
Or maybe just go like steaks, like a hearty, like a-

960
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,620
Steak salad?

961
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,380
Yeah, like you get like a steak, you know,

962
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:55,300
like you get like a, more of a savory smell to combat the sweet.

963
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,780
Get a steak candle and replace the pretty stink

964
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,660
with the right angry stink.

965
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:58,900
Yeah.

966
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,780
Listen, you could, you could do one thing.

967
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,740
I've seen commercials for like, like Febreze air spray

968
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,420
and according to commercials,

969
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,500
you just like grabs the smell out of the air

970
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,260
and tackles it and brings it down.

971
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,140
Maybe you could try that.

972
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,380
Cause scientifically that makes sense to me.

973
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,020
The Febreze grabs the stink.

974
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,340
It makes a bubble around the stink and then brings it down.

975
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,940
And now you're in the carpet.

976
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,780
Now it's like no, no air.

977
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,660
Is that what it's called?

978
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,300
No air?

979
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,700
You know.

980
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,980
The Febreze no air.

981
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,460
Don't spray too much in an enclosed space.

982
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,420
Because it'll depressurize and you'll be sucked out of the chamber.

983
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,820
Can you put a giant air purifier on your desk

984
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,900
and then when she looks, just give her like a facial expression,

985
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,860
like bleh, P-U, P-U.

986
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,820
Can you say you have an allergy?

987
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,300
That's a good thing.

988
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,220
Oh, oh, an allergy.

989
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,780
That's good.

990
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,420
That's so good.

991
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,940
Do you know what I just thought of?

992
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,900
Is it better than an allergy?

993
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,540
Cause you-

994
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,900
It's a different avenue.

995
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,140
Okay.

996
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,820
Tell her that you read on the internet

997
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,620
that all of these hand scented lotions and perfumes

998
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,780
contain this germ that in like 10% of people

999
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,060
is causing some kind of skin infection or skin irritation.

1000
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:13,380
Oh, so you, her comeuppance for her germaphobia

1001
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,540
is that you're gonna force her to lean into her germaphobia.

1002
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,620
Okay, so you give me that and I'll be-

1003
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,620
You wanna gaslight this poor woman.

1004
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,660
I'll be stinky coworker.

1005
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,580
You give me that and I'll, let's just see how it goes.

1006
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:22,900
Okay.

1007
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,420
Can I get some coffee while you guys are doing this little play?

1008
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,740
No, you can't.

1009
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,220
Perfect.

1010
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,420
You gotta be here as the boss.

1011
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,980
You gotta be here.

1012
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,900
You have to be this woman's father.

1013
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,940
You're the Drew Carey.

1014
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,660
Okay.

1015
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,300
Listen, you two have a good day working.

1016
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,220
I'll be out getting a few rounds of goldfin.

1017
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,740
You can't see her, it's in this fiction.

1018
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,180
The boss is, half of the boss's mouth is sewn shut apparently.

1019
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,380
We work for Harvey Dent.

1020
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,900
It was a golf accident.

1021
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,220
Have a good workday, kitten.

1022
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,660
Don't let this man take away your good smells.

1023
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,220
Okay, so the-

1024
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,340
Do you remember-

1025
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,780
He says that a few weeks.

1026
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,100
Remember what mommy said about a good clean girl

1027
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,860
smells like roses and flowers and sand and breeze.

1028
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,220
We asked you to be the Drew Carey.

1029
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
You're kind of being the Colin Mochrie right now.

1030
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,340
Okay.

1031
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,460
Give me the pitch.

1032
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,340
Oh, hey, did you, I read, I think it was on Facebook, man.

1033
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,140
You're like BuzzFeed.

1034
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,060
But they found it like-

1035
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,140
I'm watching this from the doorframe.

1036
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,420
You better nail it.

1037
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,380
0.1% of people have like an allergic reaction.

1038
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,260
It's something to do with like this drug or like a germ

1039
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,340
or something they found in these hand lotions.

1040
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,940
Okay, hold on just a second.

1041
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,100
I just Googled it, you're lying.

1042
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,660
If you're gonna be this boss in my daughter,

1043
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,180
you better have a ring in your pocket.

1044
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,420
Hold on, what?

1045
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,420
You better be proposing marriage

1046
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,460
if you would dare take away her good smell.

1047
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,940
She's Dottie's little flower girl.

1048
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,380
How about a yahoo?

1049
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,380
You're a yahoo out of this office.

1050
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,460
Did I just get fired?

1051
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,660
Yeah, you both did.

1052
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,700
Sorry, get in.

1053
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,900
He's too deep in the fiction.

1054
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,940
You should have known not to get embroiled with a man like this.

1055
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,140
We're gonna have to chloroform.

1056
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,300
Tell you how to live your smell.

1057
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,780
Somebody flip the factory reset on Justin.

1058
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,140
Don't let any man steal your smell.

1059
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,540
Somebody hold Justin's power button for five seconds

1060
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,260
until the LED lights.

1061
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,860
You're a strong sira.

1062
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,620
Don't let any man steal your smell.

1063
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,100
Okay, Travis, I think you need to take the fuse out of the power box.

1064
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,580
Okay.

1065
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,380
Okay, here we go.

1066
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,180
Posted by Marko Resnick and a few other people.

1067
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,580
Thank you.

1068
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,700
It's by yahoo answers user Samantha who asks,

1069
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,860
I'm throwing a sexy Santa party.

1070
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,100
Every year my boyfriend and I throw some sort of Christmas party.

1071
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,260
Last year we did a kind of dress up dinner party,

1072
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,740
but we were thinking of doing a sexy Santa party this year

1073
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,100
and having everyone wear their sexiest PJs.

1074
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,540
Any, why Santa then?

1075
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,580
Any ideas of other things we can do to make the party sexy?

1076
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,700
Oh, we are in our early 20s.

1077
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,980
Fucking of course you are.

1078
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,700
I hope so.

1079
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,620
In case that helps.

1080
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,340
I can pinpoint your birth month from this question.

1081
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,660
Sexy Santa party.

1082
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,620
Santa's already sexy.

1083
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,740
He's a man who is very giving and responsible

1084
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,980
and takes care of like, yeah.

1085
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,820
Here's my question.

1086
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,540
How do you propose this to your friend in a way

1087
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,260
that all of your friends in a way that they don't go,

1088
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,340
do you want to see my bitch?

1089
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,420
Do you want to see my dick?

1090
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,220
Is that what's up?

1091
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,180
Like, how do you say like,

1092
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,940
I thought a really fun party would be like,

1093
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,180
we all wear see-through clothes and stuff.

1094
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:20,500
Bring it.

1095
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,460
Haha, get it?

1096
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,500
BYOB.

1097
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,500
But the last B stands for Bush because I want to see it.

1098
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,460
I want to see it.

1099
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,580
Want to see that Bush.

1100
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,940
Happy holidays.

1101
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,740
Happy holidays.

1102
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,660
Show me your Christmas Bush.

1103
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,020
Show me your Christmas Bush and bring a covered dish.

1104
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,500
But you know what?

1105
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,220
Here, I was just thinking that I remember some parties

1106
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,100
like in college or like the anything but clothes parties

1107
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,220
or like that idea of like,

1108
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,180
it was a thing where like you people when you're young,

1109
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,380
I almost remember people used to dress sexy

1110
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,980
to go to things on purpose.

1111
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,820
Is that a thing?

1112
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,420
Did that happen or am I dreaming it?

1113
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,540
It's like a, it's like a,

1114
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,860
it's like an Eyes Wide Shut invitation orgy.

1115
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,140
You can't send something out saying,

1116
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,740
hey, come on, give up.

1117
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,340
You got, it's got to be veiled.

1118
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,020
It's got to be thickly, thickly veiled.

1119
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,460
They have to be like,

1120
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,700
is this going to be an orgy or is it not?

1121
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,100
You can't be like, come on and bring your Bush.

1122
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,900
You can't do that.

1123
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,180
You can't put that on an invitation.

1124
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,740
You can't do it.

1125
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,940
I won't let you do it.

1126
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,900
I won't let you do it.

1127
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,660
You can't let somebody just bring their own Bush.

1128
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,740
No, this sucks.

1129
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,620
Bush optional.

1130
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,100
Why is it sexy Santa if they're wearing PJs?

1131
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,260
You're waiting for Santa sexily.

1132
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,100
Oh, then they call it Santa baby.

1133
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,540
No, that could be misleading.

1134
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,820
People could show up as giant Santa baby.

1135
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,140
Do you think Santa actually still comes down the chimney

1136
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,580
of like five houses a year

1137
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,100
and he picks it based on this very specific criteria?

1138
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,620
Like, uh-oh, Bush party.

1139
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,460
Gotta get down.

1140
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,300
No, put Biloxi on the list.

1141
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,940
If he doesn't, I think we've proved that he doesn't exist

1142
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,580
because like that would be the party that I'd stop at.

1143
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,460
Come down the chimney like,

1144
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,460
Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, cool.

1145
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,740
Y'all been naughty.

1146
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,820
And then he vanishes.

1147
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,340
If you want you and all your young attractive friends

1148
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,100
to be basically naked together,

1149
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,900
don't drag Santa into this.

1150
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,100
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1151
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,620
This is all pretense to like Christmas time follies.

1152
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,860
I want to think that this is like their six year

1153
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,020
hosting this party and they've put up

1154
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,660
with boring ass themes for five years,

1155
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,300
just building up like the equity

1156
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,460
to be able to get all their friends naked.

1157
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,020
I would worry about if you call it a sexy Santa party,

1158
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,220
you're going to have people show up

1159
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,980
with like just ripped red overalls,

1160
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,580
like to show their muscles coming through

1161
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,580
and like not a beard so much as like a stubble,

1162
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,740
like white stubble and just shredded.

1163
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,140
Wait, why is that a worry?

1164
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,900
You're worried about starting a sexy clothes party

1165
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,700
is that people show up in sexy clothes.

1166
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,780
Are you, Justin's drooling right now.

1167
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
Are you just painting erotic fiction

1168
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,900
for our listeners right now?

1169
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,940
About Santa?

1170
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,700
That's ASMR right there.

1171
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,420
No, it wasn't.

1172
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,980
It was ASMR right, basically.

1173
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,480
No.

1174
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,420
Have you guys noticed the more we talk about ASMR,

1175
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,580
the more defensive people get about ASMR?

1176
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,500
And the more demand that there is for it.

1177
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,540
For it, yeah.

1178
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,180
It's upsetting.

1179
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,140
Y'all welcome.

1180
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,340
Y'all welcome.

1181
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,940
You're throwing stones at a glass house right now

1182
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,540
because that's like your jam and you can't find it.

1183
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,860
I don't get militant about it though.

1184
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,360
Okay.

1185
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,220
Oh, you're sad now?

1186
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,500
This Christmas, I received the same gifts

1187
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,420
from my parents and my boyfriend's parents

1188
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,260
after they shopped for my Amazon wish list.

1189
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,100
I don't want to upset either of them

1190
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,300
by returning the gifts they chose,

1191
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,100
but I also don't need two pairs of the same shoes.

1192
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,980
Should I let one of them know I'm returning their gift

1193
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,740
or should I keep it on the down low

1194
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,780
and thank them each for the gifts

1195
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,380
for returning one of the duplicates?

1196
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,740
That's ruining our returns.

1197
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,340
Do you fucking need our-

1198
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,140
Like, did you come all the way down to our office for this?

1199
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,260
Could I get free money

1200
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,180
or should I just put things in garbage can?

1201
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,140
What are you saying?

1202
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,420
What are you talking about?

1203
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,060
I will say-

1204
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,660
How did you get past the secretary?

1205
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,820
Let me say congratulations

1206
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,540
on opening that second present and pulling it off.

1207
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,100
Because that's a challenge every year.

1208
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,380
You open that second present

1209
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,100
and you have that split second rushes through your brain,

1210
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,060
like, oh, I got this.

1211
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,700
What do I say?

1212
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,580
Oh my God, this is so-

1213
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,540
I know I'm going to do it.

1214
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,100
I'm going to do it.

1215
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,380
And then you pull out of that nose dive

1216
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,980
and you're like, oh my God, thank you so much.

1217
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,300
Thank you.

1218
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:07,780
It's crazy.

1219
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,060
Exactly what I wanted.

1220
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,620
Two, I say you keep it.

1221
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,740
What?

1222
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,540
You got to back up.

1223
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,660
Have a backup.

1224
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,460
Have a back-

1225
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,180
My greatest fear at any point in my life

1226
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,260
is that one of my wonderful material possessions

1227
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,740
will be ruined.

1228
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,460
So take one of your many belongings.

1229
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,740
And then, and so knowing

1230
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,300
that I've got a backup material possession

1231
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,900
will put me at ease.

1232
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,780
Put me at ease.

1233
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,220
And just the having of-

1234
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,740
Oh, having things.

1235
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,660
Having things is so great.

1236
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,700
You've got one whole thing

1237
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,980
just to do whatever you want with.

1238
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,420
It was about packages.

1239
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,700
It was about tags.

1240
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,220
Grinch brings your shit back and it's like,

1241
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,740
we already bought new shit.

1242
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,100
And now we've got two of the shits.

1243
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,540
It's a Christmas miracle.

1244
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,140
And this has been Travis's Grinch.

1245
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,860
We've got so many who bangers.

1246
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,740
That's one of the things that-

1247
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,020
Yo, what's up party people?

1248
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,740
I got another who banger coming at you.

1249
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,860
Get on the floor.

1250
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,360
Door.

1251
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,420
Now pass that who hash.

1252
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,060
Put your titties on the roast beast.

1253
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,900
Put your titties on the roast beast.

1254
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,540
You said that with your mouth.

1255
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,500
Don't put your titties on the roast beast.

1256
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,020
That's not where they go.

1257
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,660
We done?

1258
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,140
We done.

1259
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,700
We done.

1260
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,180
Listen, this has been my brother,

1261
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,980
my brother and me,

1262
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,580
an advice show for the modern era.

1263
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,420
We hope you had a lot of fun listening.

1264
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,460
Kind of a truncated one,

1265
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,660
but you know, it's the holidays

1266
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,180
and you should just count yourself lucky

1267
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,660
to get anything at all.

1268
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,380
Well, don't say that.

1269
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,900
Handle it.

1270
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,660
Travis and Teresa are late

1271
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,860
for a Christmas appointment.

1272
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,380
We're trying to get them out the dope.

1273
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,980
Oh, so thank you for hanging in there with this.

1274
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,940
We appreciate you listening to the program

1275
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,340
and laughing along with us

1276
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,300
and learning and growing.

1277
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,580
We hope you had a great holiday season.

1278
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,900
We thank you to people who,

1279
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,820
by the way, bought tickets to see us in LA.

1280
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,220
That show is sold out from what I understand.

1281
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,220
Believe there are still some tickets

1282
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,980
to see us with JJ Go in San Francisco

1283
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,580
so you can buy those.

1284
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,740
Travis, do you remember the Bitly he created?

1285
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,060
It's bit.ly forward slash mbmbamsketchfest.

1286
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,500
Okay, so you can find those tickets

1287
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,900
and buy those if you want to see us in San Francisco.

1288
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,740
And we'll be announcing new live shows

1289
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,100
probably within a month or so.

1290
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,780
Some folks who came to our live show in Huntington

1291
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,780
had actually traveled from areas

1292
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,940
that we will be in shortly.

1293
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,900
So that was kind of awkward.

1294
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,180
So that may be Switzerland.

1295
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,540
Yeah, maybe Switzerland, who knows?

1296
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,340
But so keep an eye out for that.

1297
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,620
If you're not a big social media person or whatever,

1298
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,860
just follow us, just us,

1299
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,860
and we'll tweet information out

1300
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:57,860
that people can consume and use however they want.

1301
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,060
Griffin, do you have any thank yous?

1302
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,220
Yeah, I want to thank John Roderick

1303
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,740
in the long winters for the use of our theme song,

1304
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,980
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1305
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,060
You can find that wherever Fine Music is sold.

1306
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,220
Saw a few people tweet pictures

1307
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,060
of them getting the vinyl for Christmas,

1308
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,260
which is very, very exciting.

1309
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,300
I also own that vinyl, and boy, is it waxy.

1310
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,940
Oh, I also want to say the podcast that I do

1311
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,860
with my friend Andy Bolt, Bunker Buddies,

1312
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,420
the comedy survival podcast,

1313
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,580
we're doing a live show with Jordan Jesse Goh

1314
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,260
at UCB Franklin in Los Angeles on January 6th.

1315
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,980
It's at 11 p.m. and tickets are only $5.

1316
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,860
If you go to bit.ly forward slash LA Bunker Buddies,

1317
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,820
you can get tickets there.

1318
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,940
So we hope you come out and see us.

1319
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,780
It's our first live show and we're really excited.

1320
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,940
Also, listen to other podcasts on the Max Fun Network,

1321
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,420
Jordan Jesse Goh, stop podcasting yourself,

1322
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,300
Throwing Shade, The Goose Down, Song Exploder, Risk.

1323
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,580
There's all kinds of free entertainment.

1324
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,580
Let's not forget about Sawbones.

1325
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,540
Sawbones.

1326
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,660
And The Adventure Zone,

1327
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,340
our new Dungeons and Dragons podcast

1328
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,860
that we do with our dad.

1329
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,540
There's a new episode going up this Thursday

1330
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,820
that I'm very excited about.

1331
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,860
Both, all three of you guys actually do

1332
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,700
some really dope shit in this episode.

1333
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,220
This was the episode that marks the point

1334
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,100
where we forgot we were doing a comedy silly game

1335
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,780
and all three got really into it.

1336
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,900
It gets pretty silly.

1337
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,740
You guys forget some of the antics we got up to,

1338
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,460
but there's also some dope adventure shit in there.

1339
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,220
Anyway, that's this Thursday.

1340
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,460
Tune in, we're only like three episodes deep.

1341
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,620
So it's still, you still have time to get on board.

1342
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,020
It's really fun.

1343
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,860
Seeing a lot of people say they've never played D&D before,

1344
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,980
listen to it, it's got a lot of crossover appeal.

1345
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,660
And if you decide to play D&D's result,

1346
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,940
please tell Wizards of the Coast

1347
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,260
so they'll send us some money.

1348
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:38,900
Yeah, I guess.

1349
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,260
Or at least some campaign books.

1350
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,020
Or some campaign books or just merch.

1351
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,340
You got a noisy baby in there.

1352
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,100
I hope that we're not picking up the baby's box.

1353
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,380
Baby's singing.

1354
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,980
Yeah, baby's just spreading the word.

1355
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,260
So that's gonna do it for us.

1356
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,940
She's the young Ellen Thicke.

1357
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,900
Thank you so much for listening to the program.

1358
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,500
We hope you've had fun and we're going to miss you.

1359
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,660
We hope you have a great, this is the last time.

1360
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,940
20, we gotta figure it out.

1361
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,900
This is the last time we're gonna talk to you in 2013.

1362
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,940
Or no, 20.

1363
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,420
Oh my god, what was our shit?

1364
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,700
What was 2014?

1365
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,380
Oh no.

1366
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:14,500
What was it?

1367
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,420
I mean, whatever it was, we didn't fulfill it.

1368
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,660
Let's be honest and just say it was 2014.

1369
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,620
20 forward.

1370
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,660
20 forward.

1371
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,540
2014.

1372
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,380
It was 2014 though, if we're being honest.

1373
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,700
I watched a bore video that somebody made

1374
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,020
of a big fox lady swallowing him up.

1375
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,860
And it was spliced in with,

1376
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,580
brace yourselves, colonoscopy videos.

1377
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,020
Or perhaps an endoscopy.

1378
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,460
Daddy didn't like that.

1379
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,620
Daddy did not like, suddenly the subject of war

1380
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,100
became much less funny overnight.

1381
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,300
Just like that.

1382
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,020
So we have votes from listeners.

1383
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,220
Not that they get to vote.

1384
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,940
For 2015?

1385
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,340
What we're hearing right now,

1386
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,900
here are the teen choices in order.

1387
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,740
Jim Carrey again wins.

1388
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,540
From the bottom up, 2015.

1389
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,580
What's that mean?

1390
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,260
Seriously, does anybody else smell that?

1391
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,300
20 mifteen.

1392
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,140
20 swifteen.

1393
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,300
20 shifteen.

1394
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,500
20 blissteen.

1395
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,180
20 milfteen.

1396
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,460
Never stop getting it.

1397
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,420
20 lifteen.

1398
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,940
Raise someone's spirits.

1399
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,220
20 whatifteen.

1400
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,340
Imagine the possibilities.

1401
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,260
20 gifteen.

1402
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,300
Share the wealth.

1403
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,580
20 splifteen.

1404
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,180
Oh my god, I forgot about 20 splifteen.

1405
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,300
I'm gonna 420 so hard next year.

1406
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,300
20 thrifteen.

1407
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,500
And the number one.

1408
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,420
And what I think should be the official.

1409
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:28,980
Grifteen.

1410
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,780
20 grifteen.

1411
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,660
The con is on.

1412
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,900
20 grifteen.

1413
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,220
The con is on all year long.

1414
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,620
So wait, we need to fucking get out the blueprints right now

1415
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,380
and start planning this heist.

1416
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,340
This is the con is on next year in 20 grifteen.

1417
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,860
So we hope to see you there.

1418
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,900
Thank you for being with us through 20 forward slash 2014.

1419
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,820
Sorry we didn't do it.

1420
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,700
Sorry that we didn't.

1421
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,340
I don't know.

1422
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,540
I feel like we moved forward significantly.

1423
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,340
We moved the change.

1424
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,140
Griffin one last time.

1425
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,740
I swallowed lots of men.

1426
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,980
So it's a tie, really.

1427
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,460
It's a toss up.

1428
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,020
Griffin.

1429
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,540
This final Yahoo was sent in by, how appropriate, Drew Davenport.

1430
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,380
The beginning and the end.

1431
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,420
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

1432
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,460
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ross who asks, oh, I navigated away from the page.

1433
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,180
Ross asks, how hard can you twerk without dying?

1434
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,340
I'm Justin McElroy.

1435
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,140

1437

My brother, my brother, may he kiss your dad's square on the lips.

Did you, the listener, like that?

1447
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,780
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic where anything can happen

1448
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,140
and anything is possible.

1449
