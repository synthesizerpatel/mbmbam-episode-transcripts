1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,300
It's better, it's better with you

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,220
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Layla

10
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:25,940
No, it's me Justin. It's Justin. Okay. I'm your middle his brother Travis big dog woof woof Layla. Oh my god

11
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,740
This is Griffin to go behind the bit somebody was like

12
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,580
Hey, let's do an intro about Eric Clapton and I without knowing like like, okay

13
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,580
I guess the man's written quite a few songs

14
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,660
I was like, yeah, sure. Let's Clapton it up, baby

15
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,620
And then I it while my brothers were introducing themselves. I did Google the gentleman's name

16
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,020
I did find out that he has released I would say

17
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,660
Uh, let's see the independent calls it a controversial new anti-lockdown anthem. This has got to stop. That sounds fucking good

18
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
Huh?

19
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,580
Enough is enough. I can't take this be yes any longer. It's gone

20
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,700
Don't wanna claim my soul you'll have to come and break down this door. I

21
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,780
Knew that something was going on wrong

22
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,780
when you started

23
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,300
I can't move my hands. I break out in sweat. I'm gonna cry

24
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,860
Okay, it's the most sort of like listen here's the thing we don't know exactly what we're upset about but we know we're upset about

25
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,420
Yeah, I'm gonna break down in tears cuz I can't take off my mask

26
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,060
Well the whole time I'm at the California pizza kitchen. This song sucks shit

27
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,900
You're protesting that someone asked you to just like chill at home

28
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,300
Like I'm mad that cuz they won't come to all my great Eric

29
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,460
This is like if during like the blitzkrieg

30
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,480
Someone in in London have been like it's bullshit that they're making a stay inside and like hey, that's not the problem

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,200
You know that that that is a solution to a bigger problem, right? You know that right? Oh

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,640
My god, he just he's so wild. He sucked for a long time

33
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,200
This is not new by the way, Eric Clapton has suffered quite quite some time

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah, he had a

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
He's got a new song out cuz enough's enough with this covered stuff and I you know what I'm that front

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
Yeah, I'm with I think we can all get behind

37
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,840
Him on that thing because if it had been like can we just yeah, can we just move?

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Can we just get it?

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,640
Hey COVID sucks and we need to do whatever we need to do to stop it

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,480
But instead it's like COVID sucks, but also I miss breathing on people

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,800
I love that special Eric Clapton way I breathe. If I don't breathe on people I can't feel alive. This is BS you guys

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,960
I love to breathe on people and if I can't if I can't huff other people's breath. Am I even Eric Clapton anymore?

43
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Oh my god, Eric Clapton, what a weird like and one last thing. Man I love all, I love 100% of Eric Clapton's shit without fail. Thanks to everybody who's enjoyed my whole thing over the many many years. Now just if I can just say one quick thing.

44
00:04:47,960 --> 00:05:04,760
I know, I know what you're thinking. Is this gonna be a song about how I look like the guy who vented Atari and everybody in my band looks like that guy too and the answer is no. It's gonna be a whole, it's gonna be a whole fucking anti-COVID like protection thing.

45
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,200
We're all anti-COVID, we're all anti-COVID, Eric.

46
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:16,920
I just hope that this leads to a bunch of like controversial but very like maybe Billy Joel will release a song called Remember When We Used to Smoke on Planes

47
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,440
and it'll just be about like how much Billy Joel hates and he doesn't even smoke but he thinks it's bullshit that other people can't, you know?

48
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:43,960
This fucking dude last year, by which I mean Eric Clapton, did a track with Van Morrison that was called Stand and Deliver that was also about lockdown woes and part of me wonders if they actually got together to collab on that track

49
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:58,520
or if these two fucking dinguses wrote two separate anti-COVID lockdown songs that they just realized, hey, if you play these at the same time, they fucking harmonize because we're both fucking smooth brain Jasmine idiots.

50
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:17,160
Eric Clapton's song should have been released and the whole thing was just about like, I wish I had some hobbies besides huffing other people's breath and standing on a stage. Does anyone know how to knit? Could you teach me about sourdough? Cause I'm bored as shit.

51
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
You guys wanna hear some of the comments?

52
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,080
Yeah.

53
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,200
Yeah, I would love to.

54
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,800
They say to always do the comments.

55
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,440
Wait, on what platform are you reading these comments?

56
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,160
YouTube.

57
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,960
Okay.

58
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:37,080
On his official video. These are people that have wandered into the fucking, like, you don't think they sought it out, Justin? You think they just stumbled into Eric Clapton's anti-lockdown song?

59
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,920
I mean, I found it somehow. This is not important. Here's the important thing.

60
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,160
Thanks, Eric. Great job.

61
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,960
Awesome.

62
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,280
Excellent song and brave message. Nice energy and bounce to it.

63
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,960
This one's good. This one's your fucking, this one bounces.

64
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,760
This one's kind of bounce.

65
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:00,120
Oh, I could grind on the dance floor to this song Enough's Enough about this COVID stuff. Also, bold message, is it?

66
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,040
It's just a bold message. Congratulations on your attitude.

67
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
That sounds sarcastic.

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Congratulations on your attitude?

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,400
Congratulations on your good attitude.

70
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:18,920
That sounds like something a 12-year-old says in the heat of the moment when they can't think of, like, a good retort. And then it's just like, oh yeah, well, congratulations on your attitude.

71
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,400
Here's one. It says, yes, new Clapton.

72
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,120
Wow, this song was absolutely horrible in propaganda.

73
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I don't know if they were typing that, like, as they were listening to it, like, yes, yes, a new joint, a new joint from Eric Clapton.

74
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,680
Okay, these comments are so, hey, Pfizer, do you listen?

75
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,120
What?

76
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,920
Hey, Pfizer, do you listen, I guess, to this song, to Eric Clapton?

77
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Hi, my name's Jeremy Pfizer, and oh shit, yeah, the Jazz Man's got a new track out.

78
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,480
Let me just pipe right in.

79
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,360
Oh, shit.

80
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,760
Hey, guys, you gotta come listen to this.

81
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,320
Have we fucked up pretty bad?

82
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,960
Now, here's the interesting, apparently, I've not watched the full video for the song.

83
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,920
The video also includes, like, imagery of a world on fire.

84
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:17,320
And so it's, like, anti-lockdown, but also pro, like, environmental reforms mixed messages.

85
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,080
Fuck yeah, let's get into this now.

86
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,160
Fuck yeah, this is a gift that keeps on giving.

87
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:29,240
New Yorker did do a send up, a little political cartoon by Barry Blitt called Eric Clapton, enough is enough.

88
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,240
And the subtitle says, the listening party for Eric Clapton's new protest song.

89
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,640
And it's an unflattering image of Mr. Clapton.

90
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,240
And then you got, let's see, Jim Jordan and Louie Gomer in kiss makeup.

91
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,840
You got Daffy Duck, a Brachiosaurus, Van Morrison, Goofy, Bozo, and several Iguanodons.

92
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,760
Oh, got him again.

93
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,480
End of joke.

94
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,440
What's that?

95
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,920
Okay, Goofy is a fucking emblem of an idiot.

96
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Bozo, a clown, right?

97
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,120
Van Morrison, we have covered my feelings about this gentleman.

98
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,800
What the fuck did Daffy Duck?

99
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,080
What the fuck is Daffy?

100
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,720
Is Daffy Duck notably anti-vax?

101
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,200
No, if anything, Daffy Duck is the one I appreciate the most in the Mickey Mouse universe.

102
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,840
Because he's the one to say like, this is dumb.

103
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,240
Like Goofy will throw up some dumb bullshit.

104
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,000
And Donald's like, no.

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,600
And I have sympathy for Goofy because Goofy doesn't know.

106
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,520
And Goofy gets on the internet and he sees somebody saying like, Bill Gates wants a microchip.

107
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,560
And then you're like, okay, I've got an idea to read it.

108
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,760
Let's hear about this.

109
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,680
But Daffy Duck is fucking, Daffy's doesn't need to subscribe to that.

110
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,480
No.

111
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,520
And also, why bring the fucking Brachiosauruses into this?

112
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,560
What did they do?

113
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,200
For real.

114
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,000
They had a rough go of it.

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,960
Let's let them.

116
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
Several Iguanodons.

117
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,160
I get that.

118
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,360
Those fuckers.

119
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,240
Yeah, that tracks.

120
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,800
Ugh, Iguanodons.

121
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,360
I feel like I should, this has felt venty.

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
No, it's fine.

123
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,040
This feels venty.

124
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,600
I feel like we're-

125
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,840
You feel like we're punching down at Eric Clapton?

126
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,240
Well, no, I mean, no.

127
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,560
I mean, no, it's like kind of sideways.

128
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,440
I bet we're about-

129
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,520
Finish it.

130
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm the guy that uploaded Barry's Included TikTok.

131
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,000
I feel like I'm about equal to Eric Clapton at this point.

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,880
Yeah, sure.

133
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah.

134
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,640
27,000 times that has been used.

135
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,800
We're sitting next to them on the airplane and violently fighting over the armrest.

136
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
Just very passive aggressive.

137
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,920
That's us and Eric Clapton, for sure.

138
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,520
For sure, for sure.

139
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,040
And we're masked and he's not.

140
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,160
It's important to note.

141
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,720
The fucking gutless headlines of the people,

142
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,640
except for the fucking New Yorker who came in and was like,

143
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,480
look at this fucking doofus.

144
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,440
He loves Daffy Duck.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,040
All the other ones are like,

146
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,720
let's see, almost a guitar website,

147
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,360
which is called guitar.com, I guess.

148
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,600
Eric Clapton's new single, This Has Gotta Stop,

149
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,080
seemingly voices his anti-vax sentiment.

150
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,800
No fucking way.

151
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,440
Does it?

152
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,160
Daily news, Eric Clapton appears to criticize COVID restrictions in song.

153
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,400
I don't want to put words in his mouth,

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,440
but at the part where he's like,

155
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,320
AstraZeneca, I don't trust you.

156
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,680
It's like, I think-

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,520
Like, let's talk about this for a second, Eric.

158
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,280
Let's talk about your bad boy anthem here.

159
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,840
Uh-huh.

160
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,720
How this bad boy anthem where the third line is,

161
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
I can't take this BS any longer.

162
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,280
Yep.

163
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,600
Aw, damn, dude, fucking zinged him.

164
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,120
Did you say BS?

165
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,600
Got him.

166
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,040
I remember fucking when Dylan was like lighting shit up in the 60s,

167
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,200
like, this BS from the government.

168
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,200
These jerkoos have done enough with my privacy.

169
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,640
I'm sick of all of this crap.

170
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,520
And I'm like, not cool.

171
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,120
Hey, everybody in the audience, if you're sick of this crap doo-doo,

172
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,960
let me hear you.

173
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,880
Put one hand in the air.

174
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
It's like when Rage Against the Machine was like,

175
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,760
hey, F you, I won't do what you tell me.

176
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,320
You know what I mean?

177
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,600
It's like, whoa, strong language there.

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,120
Some of those that work forces are real stinkers.

179
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Are real pills.

180
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,520
Like, Eric, what is happening to you?

181
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,680
Like, because if, just like, I live in West Virginia

182
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,320
and everything just seems to be progressing as normal here.

183
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,400
I see no souls being claimed.

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,080
Everybody's just kind of going rump-a-room on it over here in West Virginia.

185
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,120
I don't know, man.

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,400
I don't know what it's like over there.

187
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,800
I don't know who's trying to steal your freedom.

188
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,720
Because if you're talking about the freedom to, like, do concerts,

189
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,760
well, on this one, Eric, I think that, you know,

190
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,840
bud, it sucks.

191
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,200
It sucks, don't it?

192
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,080
It's pretty bad to keep wanting to do a show

193
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,000
and it's not safe to do this show.

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,600
I wish Eric had just called me to complain about it

195
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
rather than having to do a song about it.

196
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,080
Because nobody's taking your freedom, Eric.

197
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,360
Do you think that the first draft of this song was like,

198
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,280
it sucks that I don't get to do concerts,

199
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,880
but I do understand.

200
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,040
And then someone's like, I don't think that's bold enough, Eric.

201
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,400
And he's like, oh, got it, got it, got it.

202
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,680
Let me take another pass at it.

203
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,720
This is BS.

204
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,280
He doesn't even have the guts to, like, say what the song is about.

205
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Like, it's like, yeah.

206
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,800
And it's the most limp, like, I just wish it...

207
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,520
It's like, it's the passive voice protest song.

208
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,120
It's like, be nice with stuff.

209
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,280
Yeah, I'm sick of it or whatever.

210
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm not going to agree with what you're saying.

211
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,120
It feels like something like that uncle would post on Facebook,

212
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,240
but then not respond to any of the comments from people like,

213
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,600
what do you, hey, what do you mean?

214
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,280
Yeah, it would be like if instead of this song

215
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,320
was titled Cocaine, if he had called it, like, silly stuff.

216
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,720
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

217
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,360
Fun dust.

218
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,480
Mr. Clapton, did you write a song about cocaine?

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,800
What?

220
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
No, it's called Fun Dust.

221
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,680
It's different.

222
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,240
Anything.

223
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,480
Could be anything.

224
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,720
Unspun cotton candy powder.

225
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,520
It sounds like a cover of the song Cocaine that you did not write.

226
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,440
Yeah, no, I know, but I switched it with Fun Dust so it could mean anything.

227
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,080
Oh, it's getting a little war with grandpa you though,

228
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
because we're at 16 minutes.

229
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,480
Yeah, we got to wrap it up.

230
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,160
Although ironically, we are currently at war with grandpa.

231
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,720
To be fair, is there a way that this song, okay,

232
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,040
is there a way that we can reclaim the song,

233
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,480
this has got to stop, to make it about something else?

234
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,360
Because it's so sort of empty and hollow.

235
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,640
What is something that we can rage against with these?

236
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
Let me look at the lyrics here.

237
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,720
Yeah, just imagine the most boring, pointless set of it you can.

238
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,200
Yeah, okay.

239
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,920
Okay, yeah.

240
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,280
This has got to stop, enough is enough.

241
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,120
How about I just bought a top,

242
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,480
I just bought a top and it fits really great.

243
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,040
And it's just about a good shopping trip that he had.

244
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,200
That would be a bolder stance, I think,

245
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,880
than the one he's taking here.

246
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,640
I don't think it's salvageable.

247
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,600
Oh, I can't take this IBS anymore.

248
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,160
And it's about finding, we have to find a cure for IBS.

249
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,840
What do you do without changing the lyrics?

250
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,520
We just decided it's about something else.

251
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,160
Okay, wait.

252
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,920
I can't take this video, it's gone far enough.

253
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,840
You want to claim my soul, come break down the story.

254
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,280
Yeah, okay.

255
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,000
So this is about your friends are like,

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,080
hey, you're watching too much NCIS.

257
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,560
And you're like, I'll never watch enough NCIS.

258
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,480
You'll have to come and break down this door

259
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,280
if you want to take away NCIS from me.

260
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,640
And that would be a bolder statement

261
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,680
than what he's saying here.

262
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,040
This is an advice show where we help people.

263
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,320
And I fear that he may be beyond that point,

264
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,920
beyond our powers, our considerable advice giving powers.

265
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,280
Hello, brothers.

266
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,720
Jacket hanging up at my work.

267
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,280
I feel like you guys didn't respond to that.

268
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,520
Yeah, it's an email.

269
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,880
Okay.

270
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,560
Hello, brothers.

271
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:05,800
Hello.

272
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,280
There's a jacket hanging up at my work

273
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,200
that as far as anyone knows is ownerless.

274
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,400
But is it ownerless?

275
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,640
Someone must have left it there when they quit.

276
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,440
It's been like eight months at this point.

277
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,800
Thing is, it's a pretty cool jacket.

278
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,480
It won't fit me, but it would fit my friend

279
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,880
and they would definitely like the style.

280
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,240
I've asked my coworkers and no one has claimed it's theirs.

281
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,480
So it's just sort of in limbo, hanging on a shelf untouched.

282
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Can I take this jacket and how do I do it without being weird?

283
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,960
That's from the Sierra Nevada jacket snatcher.

284
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,920
Now this is the kind of thing where, is there a picture?

285
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,960
No.

286
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,640
Do they include a picture?

287
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,440
Probably not.

288
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,240
No, no picture included.

289
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,640
The only reason that a picture would sort of

290
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,520
put any English on this ball is if the jacket

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,440
was like the fucking Scorpion bomber jacket from Drive.

292
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,240
Like some real Ed Hardy trash

293
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,360
that somebody would see you wearing it and be like,

294
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,120
is that the forgotten jacket?

295
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,320
Is that the abandoned jacket?

296
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,280
But they're not wearing it.

297
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,800
They're taking it to give to a friend.

298
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,920
It will be gone.

299
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,200
They'll never see it again.

300
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,320
Off the premises.

301
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,680
To the point where I would say, Griffin,

302
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,120
even if that were the case,

303
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,680
people would be very excited once that jacket was gone.

304
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,680
And there would be an imperceivable freedom

305
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,520
granted upon the office as everyone breathed a little easier

306
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,120
now that the jacket was gone.

307
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,160
I mean, shit, yeah.

308
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
I mean, you can't tell your friend where you got it

309
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,440
if you do this.

310
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,960
Unless it was the right kind of friend.

311
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,360
Yeah, the right kind of friend who knows how to party

312
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
who's looking for a come up.

313
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,920
You know what I mean?

314
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,480
Yeah, sure.

315
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
I think that's what you're describing here

316
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,560
is you're gonna pop some tags.

317
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,000
You see this and you just take it.

318
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,720
You know what I mean?

319
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,440
Yeah.

320
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,080
Now here would be-

321
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,040
You just say you want it.

322
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,040
Here's one method you might try.

323
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,240
I call it transient motive.

324
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,960
What this means is with someone's around

325
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,400
when you pick up the jacket,

326
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,920
you create a motive for that moment.

327
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,960
Do you understand?

328
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,760
So you're like, wait, is this dry clean only?

329
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,160
And you start talking like that

330
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,240
as you're taking it and walking away.

331
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
And in that person's head,

332
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,320
they're like, why were they so interested?

333
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,880
If, oh, well, I'm moving on with my life.

334
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,600
And then at that point you're clear, right?

335
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,400
And then it's not like, why are they holding the jacket?

336
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,440
It's just sort of accepted at this point.

337
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,520
You are holding the jacket.

338
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,120
You could also style yourself as like a hero in this moment

339
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
and loudly as you pick it up and announce like,

340
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,800
fine, I'll take care of it.

341
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Yeah, that's good.

342
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,720
Or like, if no one else will do it,

343
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,080
I'm taking it to lost and found.

344
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,560
Right.

345
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,680
And then you start walking away

346
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,080
and people are like, where is lost and found?

347
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,360
But that's the name of your friend

348
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,280
who's legally changed it to lost and found.

349
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,880
So then you're not lying.

350
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm taking this to the jacket kitchen

351
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,840
where you can donate your used jackets to be eaten.

352
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,840
Fair.

353
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,160
Now I will say that the only hiccup here

354
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,360
is if this is a very seasonal jacket,

355
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:19,240
perhaps a Green Bay starter jacket from 1998.

356
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,840
Or like Mary Arbor Day.

357
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Sure.

358
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,400
And it has been there for the eight months

359
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,240
since the end of that season, right?

360
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
And we're just about to come back to the season

361
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,680
at which it will be appropriate.

362
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,080
Because then the previous owner may for the first time

363
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,360
realize they were without it.

364
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,120
However, at that point,

365
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,280
I would say if nine months or so passes,

366
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,520
the reasonable statement of no one knows

367
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,840
where your jacket is at this point makes complete sense.

368
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,640
No, I don't think that the person who owns the jacket

369
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,840
is coming back for it.

370
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,200
It is this thing of like,

371
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,640
nobody wants to take the initiative.

372
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,000
And I think that's where you could kind of

373
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,920
have a little wiggle room here.

374
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,240
Like you're just making some space.

375
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,600
You're just making a little space.

376
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,160
It's one less thing for people to have to work,

377
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,840
for people to have to look at.

378
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,400
Absolutely.

379
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
It's like if there was a car parked on your street

380
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,120
for like eight months and no one moved it.

381
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,560
So you just stole it, right?

382
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,240
Because that's a parking space

383
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,760
that someone else could have, right?

384
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,000
Absolutely.

385
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,920
Oh shit, I got it.

386
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,160
Okay.

387
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,600
I got it.

388
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,920
Go.

389
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,600
Every day you come into work.

390
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,240
You take a little bit of the jacket.

391
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,960
Every day you come to work, you take your jacket off,

392
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,680
put it on a hanger, leave the jacket there.

393
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,440
Eventually you will arrive to work

394
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,960
and there will be no available hangers.

395
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,720
And you will say, hey, is this anybody's?

396
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,000
Is it okay if I move this so I can hang up my jacket?

397
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
One of my other jackets.

398
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,160
Then everyone will be like, yeah, go for it.

399
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,040
And then you take it down off the hanger.

400
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,840
You can take it away.

401
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,120
No one will question it.

402
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,680
Now, listen.

403
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,280
And then you hang your jacket up.

404
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,960
Now you have a problem.

405
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,320
This is a brilliant idea, Jocelyn.

406
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,560
It's a little bit of fry and pan fry situation.

407
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,000
There's two issues here.

408
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,880
Now there's 20 jackets.

409
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,760
Well, but the problem is that they work at the Coat Hook Emporium.

410
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,400
So they're always worst ones.

411
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

412
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,600
The number of jackets you're gonna have to invest in here.

413
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,160
It's gonna make for a heavy lift, but at the end of the day.

414
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,960
I gotta throw a wrinkle in this question.

415
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,560
You know me, Mr. Wrinkle Tosser.

416
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,960
I love to get into these questions and add a wrinkle.

417
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
That's why they call you that.

418
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,460
Yeah.

419
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,800
Hello, brothers.

420
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,240
There's a jacket hanging up at my work

421
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,800
that as far as anyone knows is ownerless.

422
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,480
The phrase in there, as far as anyone knows,

423
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,080
suggests that you have gone cubicle to cubicle

424
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,000
and said, do you know who owns this?

425
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,560
And every single person without fail has said, no, I do not.

426
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,000
There is no way that you have conducted such a canvassing.

427
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,560
You are, there has to be a layer of assumption here of,

428
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,560
well, I don't know who this belongs to.

429
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,920
And a couple of people I've talked to

430
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,440
doesn't know who this belongs to.

431
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,280
So nobody here knows who this belongs to.

432
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,560
It got there somehow.

433
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,640
Someone must have left it here when they quit,

434
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,440
but you don't know wicked for sure though.

435
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,920
Because what if there's a chance that that was somebody's

436
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,720
and then they died in like a horrible accident

437
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,120
and now the jacket is left there as a memorial

438
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,520
and it's been there for years and years and years.

439
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,760
So only like the oldest employees remember,

440
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,680
but God damn it, they remember.

441
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,560
And you haven't asked them

442
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,000
because they're in upper management now

443
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,840
because they put the fucking time in,

444
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,720
which you wouldn't understand kids these days.

445
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,960
But if you take that, they're gonna be like,

446
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,400
who took old Bill's jacket?

447
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,080
No, that was old Bill's old Ed Hardy jacket.

448
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,240
He loved Ed Hardy as much as he loves saving kids from car wrecks.

449
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,440
You could come in dressed up in a costume,

450
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,920
big leather vest, big bushy beard,

451
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,680
a clown cap on, fucking wellies on your feet.

452
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,520
And fucking cool disco pants and two different gloves.

453
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,560
And you walk in and you pick up the jacket and you said,

454
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,680
there it is.

455
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,560
And then everybody else who's there would be like,

456
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,800
oh, I guess that like really weird guy

457
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,960
is who that jacket belonged to.

458
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,800
Well, mystery solved.

459
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,360
Can't wait for fucking Tyler to get back so he can tell.

460
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,000
Wait a minute.

461
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,200
Was that person roughly Tyler's size

462
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,280
but dressed up in a bunch of wild garments

463
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
that they've been stealing from all the other jobs

464
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,000
they've ever worked?

465
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,640
Damn, almost got away with it too.

466
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,080
I don't know that we're gonna be able to help with this one,

467
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,960
but I think I do have-

468
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,080
I feel like we tried though.

469
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,600
We tried really hard.

470
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,360
I do have one that we might be able to help with

471
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,960
and it's if we do approach the wizard,

472
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,400
Taylor sent this in, thank you.

473
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,760
And it's a WikiHow called how to choose a nickname for your car.

474
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,440
Oh, thank fuck.

475
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah, I've had so many fucking cars now, like-

476
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,360
Braggart.

477
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,000
Three, and I have not gotten nicknames for any of them.

478
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,500
Ooh.

479
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,720
At least none that I would put out into the world,

480
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,400
maybe in my heart of hearts.

481
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,600
The problem for me has always been

482
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,760
that I didn't know their given name, right?

483
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,920
So like if I wanted to call him Johnny, right?

484
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,840
But what if their real name isn't Jonathan, right?

485
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,120
And now it's just fucking weird.

486
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,040
Right, and it's like also that I don't drive that much,

487
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,000
like I use my computer a lot more

488
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,080
and I didn't nickname my computer.

489
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,440
Oh, you didn't?

490
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,640
No, it's just a computer.

491
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,760
Mine's Jeremy Bits.

492
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,920
Jeremy Bits, okay.

493
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,420
Yep.

494
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,880
That was also my stage name during my ill-fated stand-up comedy career.

495
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,760
Yeah, Jeremy Bits.

496
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,600
I wouldn't call it ill-fated, Juice.

497
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,320
I'm ahead of myself.

498
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,880
You're a runner-up season three of Last Comic Standing.

499
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,680
You got a Comedy Central 30-Minute Stand-Up Special.

500
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,000
I did Leno, but it's when he was at 10 p.m.

501
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah, I thought it was fucked up though

502
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,200
how Leno really made you censor a lot of your darker stuff.

503
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800
Yeah, there was a lot.

504
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,880
And it wasn't even like that the words you were saying

505
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,640
were like banned by, you know, anybody.

506
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,080
It was just the concept.

507
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,040
He didn't like the idea.

508
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,280
He said it was so challenging.

509
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,640
I don't like the ideas.

510
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,320
You really make people think about their deaths.

511
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,240
Yeah, I don't like those ideas.

512
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,840
Do different ideas.

513
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,880
And it's like, J, that's not really how-

514
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,160
Do some Cars ones.

515
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,440
So here's how to brainstorm.

516
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,320
Speaking of Cars ones,

517
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,120
here's some good ways to come up with car names.

518
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,960
Think of the name of a beautiful person.

519
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,520
One of the most common ways to name your car

520
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,120
is to think of a celebrity or model you like

521
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,080
and give it the same name.

522
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,040
Awesome.

523
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,200
Oh, Oscar Isaacs.

524
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,920
It's perfect.

525
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,760
I'm worried, Juice,

526
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,680
that Travis is going to be freaky good at this.

527
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,360
Yeah, I don't like it already, the way it's going.

528
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,520
Some good names include Claire, Stella, Brock, and Venus.

529
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,400
Bright.

530
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,760
I don't know that you can just be like,

531
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,440
this is my car, Claire.

532
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,920
Yeah, well, then you,

533
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,400
Trav, you may want to just chill for like five minutes

534
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,400
because you cannot scrutinize this wiki Howl in that way.

535
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,560
I'm just saying that that's not a nickname though.

536
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,240
That's a name.

537
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,960
Yeah.

538
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,720
Name the car after your favorite musician

539
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,920
or cartoon character.

540
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,120
If you're looking around for names

541
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,480
that aren't commonly used for people-

542
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,760
Carlos Santana.

543
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Yeah, fucking hell, Travis.

544
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,720
Turn yourself off.

545
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,600
And here's the thing,

546
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,680
it doesn't matter what make or model it is.

547
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,600
It could be literally anything.

548
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,760
Car names that are based on musicians or artists

549
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,240
include Sid, Beyonce, and Bono.

550
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,080
Now, but they, Bono?

551
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
But here's the thing, in the picture,

552
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,000
the horrible pictures that wikiHowl has,

553
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,840
they got like a blue Corvette

554
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,640
and then there's a picture of Donald Duck

555
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,240
just like hovering over it.

556
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,760
This is my Corvette.

557
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,840
This is my Corvette.

558
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,560
Donald Duck.

559
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,360
The duck from Mickey.

560
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,280
Add a prefix or adjective to the name.

561
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,960
Adding a prefix like Ms or Mr

562
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,360
will add some character to the car name that you choose.

563
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,880
And there's a picture of a man

564
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,000
and he does have a goatee

565
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,760
and he's yelling, Mr. Donald.

566
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,800
What?

567
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,960
This is my Corvette, Mr. Donald.

568
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,040
This is my Corvette, Mr. Donald.

569
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
Hey, excuse me, Valet,

570
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,440
could you go pick up Mr. Donald, please?

571
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Good adjectives for your name include colors

572
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,960
like white, black, or silver.

573
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,640
Mr. Blue Donald, Mr. Blue Donald.

574
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,400
Is there a Mr. Blue Donald here?

575
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,080
Whose car is this?

576
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,440
There's a bumper sticker on the back

577
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,120
that says white Mr. Donald.

578
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,120
Good starting adjectives for your car

579
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,840
include things like super, baby, or old.

580
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,440
Hey, whose car is this that says

581
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,520
super baby white Mr. Donald on it?

582
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,320
Hi, I'm looking for my car.

583
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,240
It's named super white, Mr. Donald.

584
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,560
Wait, is there a comma in there?

585
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:49,960
Somewhere.

586
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,460
Nope.

587
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,320
This next one's awesome

588
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,520
because it's coming in at the very middle

589
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,800
of this WikiHow article.

590
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,000
Search online for other popular car names.

591
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,360
I don't fucking know, man.

592
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,960
I got a Kia Sorrento.

593
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,520
I tried calling it white Mr. Donald Duck,

594
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,120
but people hated that name.

595
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,000
So just-

596
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,960
Mia Sorvino.

597
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,740
Fuck!

598
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,840
Did you mean Kia Sorvino?

599
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,120
That works too, yeah.

600
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,440
Okay.

601
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,000
Trav, just take it clean.

602
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,560
Take it clean.

603
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,080
Take it- Kia Sorrento.

604
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,920
So use an online name generator

605
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,280
to the next one and that's the same thing.

606
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,200
Matching the name with the style of the car.

607
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,920
Base the name on the shape and size of the car.

608
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,880
Look at the body of the car.

609
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,640
If it's blocky, bulky, or powerful,

610
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,080
a more masculine name may-

611
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,680
If it's sleek, sexy, mysterious,

612
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,600
a feminine name may suit it better.

613
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,800
God, I mean WikiHow.

614
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,960
And so there's a picture of a big-

615
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,320
What's that car's ass do?

616
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,520
And here's a big like scary SUV

617
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,800
and it says Wolverine

618
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,480
and then there's a check mark

619
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,240
and then it says Christine

620
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,280
and then there's an X.

621
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,160
Even though there's the most famous scary car ever

622
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,920
is named Christine from the John Carpenter film.

623
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,240
Those two also are not comparable.

624
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,560
Like no one has ever said,

625
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,400
uh yeah, I'm having a baby.

626
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,840
If it's a girl, Christine

627
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,360
and if it's a boy, Wolverine.

628
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah, include the maker model in the name.

629
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
You can make it like a Camry.

630
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,120
So I have a Subaru that I call Ruby Sue.

631
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,640
Yeah, that's good.

632
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,760
I mean, that's a good one.

633
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,320
Choose the name based on the type of car that you drive.

634
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,640
That's, you already fucking said that.

635
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,680
Yeah, the Slamberghini, by the way,

636
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,080
I don't know if anyone who listens to this show

637
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,040
has a Lamborghini,

638
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,360
but Slamberghini is just a great thing to call your car.

639
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,560
It's a pretty good one.

640
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,040
For instance, you wouldn't want to name a slow truck

641
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,680
with the name supercharged or red hot

642
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
because it doesn't represent the aesthetic of the car.

643
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,560
Bullshit.

644
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,920
They have a picture of a truck here

645
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,120
and the word that they have emblazoned over it is big rhino.

646
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,200
That's pretty good.

647
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,400
But I'm just saying that this person

648
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,240
who's written this WikiHow article

649
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,800
has very little concept of ironic nicknames

650
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,480
where you call like a big guy tiny

651
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,920
because calling like a very slow truck,

652
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,960
like calling it like hot pepper or something

653
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,080
is fucking baller.

654
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,200
I love that.

655
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,040
And then name it based on color.

656
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
Names include Nightcrawler, Cherry Bomb,

657
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,280
Mr. Freeze, Cookie Monster, Frogger,

658
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,800
Mean Green, and Creamsicle.

659
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,400
Hop in the Creamsicle.

660
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Oh, wow.

661
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,280
Have you guys ever tried to actually get like,

662
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,400
it's pretty hard to get a nickname going for your car.

663
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,080
I've done it for myself a lot.

664
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,040
Yeah, I know.

665
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,680
To get out of pity.

666
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,000
Hoops, The Kid, Mr. J.

667
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,040
Yeah, that one we need to talk about, by the way.

668
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,480
That one hasn't caught on as much.

669
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,520
It's hard for your car

670
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,400
because like the only way to get it going

671
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,480
is to like sheepishly admit it to your wife

672
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,920
that there's a nickname for it.

673
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,200
And if she's going to mention it,

674
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
it'd be nice if she, okay, nevermind.

675
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,320
Honey, I don't know why.

676
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,720
I'm sorry.

677
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,160
I don't know why I brought it up.

678
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,120
Ignore me, stupid.

679
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,920
There's only one.

680
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,600
I don't know why I called my Honda a Pilot Sully.

681
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,680
I thought it was funny because the Pilot Sully.

682
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,920
Yeah, no, you didn't think it was funny, funny.

683
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
I just thought it was like, not funny,

684
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,440
but kind of like nodding acknowledgement kind of deal.

685
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,160
You know what I mean?

686
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,200
There's a mystery amongst some of my friends

687
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,200
where our mutual friend Bobby had this white car

688
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,440
and he went back home for a weekend.

689
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,280
And when he came back,

690
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,680
that white car had across the windshield, the Gambler.

691
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,320
And now Bobby claims that the white car died

692
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,120
and he bought a different white car that weekend.

693
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,440
And that one happened to be the same make and model.

694
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,880
It just said the Gambler across.

695
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,920
That was the only difference.

696
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,560
And I have no idea to this day if that's true or not,

697
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,280
but that's a good way to get a nickname going for your car

698
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,760
to just add it to the windshield.

699
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,320
Yeah.

700
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,000
Can I call my car the Michael Dukakis

701
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,880
1988 presidential election campaign bus?

702
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,360
I mean, yes.

703
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,920
Is that?

704
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,120
Oh, shit.

705
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,520
I shouldn't.

706
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,960
People might like find me at live shows now.

707
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,920
Damn it, Travis.

708
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,600
Fuck.

709
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,240
The only other shit on here is like,

710
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,920
really think about it.

711
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
And really think about it.

712
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,000
And then there's a picture.

713
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,760
There's a very Ferris Bueller looking cartoon man

714
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,400
laying on a pillow and there's a thought balloon.

715
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,120
And inside the thought balloon, it says Silver Surfer,

716
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Bio Silver, Chroma.

717
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,280
That's a cool fucking thing.

718
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,680
I wish I could shut out the fucking demons.

719
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
Bio Silver?

720
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
Bio Silver.

721
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,720
I wish I could shut out the demons in my head for a minute

722
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,160
and think about shit like bad car names.

723
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,160
Sometimes they just come to you unbidden.

724
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,440
You don't have to think about them.

725
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,880
It's just how your brain works.

726
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,120
Yeah.

727
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,760
You definitely have like a disease.

728
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:56,920
Yeah.

729
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,800
It's called ADD.

730
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,280
Oh, boy.

731
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,080
Howdy.

732
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,480
Trav.

733
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,680
Car-D-D.

734
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,480
Car-D-D.

735
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:05,720
What?

736
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,840
Car-D-D.

737
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,280
Juice, you don't have the touch.

738
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,480
You don't have the glow.

739
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,880
ADD.

740
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,840
Car-A-D.

741
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,120
No.

742
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,160
So we're going to go to-

743
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,200
AWDD.

744
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,560
Because it's like all wheel drive.

745
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,160
We're going to get the fuck out of here.

746
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,360
We got to go to the fucking money zone.

747
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,160
Go, go, go, go.

748
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,040
I need to hire some people.

749
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:32,840
Yeah.

750
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,480
Yeah.

751
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,120
Perfect thing for that.

752
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,760
But here's the thing.

753
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
It's hard to pick things.

754
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,720
I have a hard time making a decision as to what shirts to wear in the morning,

755
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,280
a thing that has no impact on barely my life, let alone anyone else's.

756
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,960
So the idea of having to pick a human being to hire for a thing

757
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,600
is one of the most imposing, terrifying decisions.

758
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,840
That's why I'm glad that there are things like Zip Recruiter.

759
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,640
Because Zip Recruiter is the adult who will help you hire somebody.

760
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,200
Right?

761
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,840
Right.

762
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,880
They're the parent or teacher that can come in and make it better.

763
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,920
Yes.

764
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,000
Because they're going to make sure all of the qualified candidates come right to you.

765
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,720
And you can invite your top choices to apply for the job through Zip Recruiter.

766
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,080
Get in here, Mark.

767
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,040
Don't be shy.

768
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,240
I know you're the man.

769
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,040
You're the one.

770
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,760
You're the man, Mark.

771
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,000
Does Zip Recruiter have a feature that shows you the employee that you had dreamed of

772
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,440
was inside you all along?

773
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,880
Is that an option where it's like-

774
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,240
That's a premium service.

775
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,960
Premium service.

776
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,000
They also have one where a group of teenage girls ask you questions about like,

777
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,080
what house do you think you'll have when you get married?

778
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,120
And that helps you choose the right employee for you.

779
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,640
But that's an up charge.

780
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,000
It's like a billion dollars.

781
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That's like a billion dollars for that.

782
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,560
But you can sign up.

783
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,640
Do they have a thing where they'll take an employee that already works there

784
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,880
and they'll take off their glasses and they're like, maybe this is them?

785
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,440
You know what I mean?

786
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,280
But extra for ponytail removal.

787
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,480
Yeah, right.

788
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,360
They have a feature on Zip Recruiter where you can pick an employee

789
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,280
from a different company that you'd never hire

790
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,720
and then they take that employee away and make them really cool and beautiful

791
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,000
and make them prom queen.

792
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,080
And you're like, oh man, now I love them.

793
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,880
And you hire them.

794
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,880
And then they also have a service where if you can't find the perfect candidate

795
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,400
that has all the skills you need,

796
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,800
they will find like three or four different candidates

797
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,720
that have some of the skills you need.

798
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,480
And then they put them in a big tub full of proprietary fluid

799
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,920
and they don't tell you what the fluid is.

800
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,360
That's probably for the best.

801
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:45,320
And then nine months later out pops a single amalgamated business entity.

802
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,560
The shape of it is not recognizably human,

803
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,320
but it does do like 130 words per minute.

804
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,360
So that's pretty good.

805
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,560
So you can't beat that.

806
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,440
And you can sign up for not that service,

807
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,160
but the other ones that we talked about early on in the ad

808
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,440
before we went some places.

809
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,280
If you go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother,

810
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,800
you can try Zip Recruiter for free.

811
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,680
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

812
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,160
Please don't tell them about a lot of the stuff we said.

813
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,600
Please don't tell any of our-

814
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,480
Oh my God.

815
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,520
Blankest statement.

816
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,440
Don't tattle on us to any of our advertisers

817
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,640
because then the shit's going to get boring.

818
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,520
They're going to have to be like,

819
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,440
Zip Recruiter does a business one.

820
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,000
If you get that, you get 10 buck dollars.

821
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,000
Snooze effect, right?

822
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,880
Hey, do you know what's exciting for me though?

823
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,600
My dreams.

824
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,960
Is it my dreams?

825
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,400
Do you have a good one?

826
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,480
Oh, I have great dreams every night.

827
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,960
Playing laser tag with Michael Dukakis.

828
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,720
I had a dream recently.

829
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,320
There was a crossover between Full House and Buffy the Vampire Slayer

830
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,120
and I saved Uncle Jesse from a vampire trap.

831
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,840
And that was pretty good.

832
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,600
Yeah, that's definitely who would save who

833
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,400
if you two were in a vampire trap together.

834
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,440
Squarespace though helps make your dreams a reality,

835
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,720
except for the dream that Travis had,

836
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
which I think we can all agree is total bullshit.

837
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,920
They will help you build a website

838
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,120
that can showcase your work,

839
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,720
sell products and services of all kinds

840
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,560
to promote your physical or online business.

841
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,160
And more.

842
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,800
And they do that with these beautiful customizable templates

843
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
created by world-class designers.

844
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

845
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,240
So don't freak out about it.

846
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,520
Yeah, sure.

847
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,360
And if you want to know if your website's sick,

848
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,880
they got analytics for it.

849
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,200
And they do free and secure hosting.

850
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,960
So there's just nothing to really worry about,

851
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,640
except like how you're going to spend all of your website money

852
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,280
that you're going to get when the big bucks are rolling in.

853
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,000
So go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

854
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,040
And when you're ready to launch,

855
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,440
use the offer code my brother to save 10%

856

857
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,920
I'm Jesse Thorne.

858
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
This week on Bullseye,

859
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,440
David Byrne on the talking heads,

860
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,520
easing back into live performance,

861
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,880
and the magic of Doo-Wop.

862
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,080
You don't get it very much.

863
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,520
People doing dibbidi-dip-dip,

864
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,760
whoa, whoa, nama-nama-nama-nama.

865
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,280
You don't get a lot of that.

866
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,520
Listen to Bullseye from Maximumfun.org and NPR.

867
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,720
Griffin, you got another Yahoo! for us?

868
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,800
Not for a while now, Justin.

869
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,280
Let me reach into the fucking time well.

870
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,640
Hold on.

871
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,080
Oh no, I've fallen down into the time well.

872
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Oh no, he's an old man now, Justin.

873
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh no, he went too far the other way and he's a baby.

874
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,320
He's a baby?

875
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, let's see if we can catch him right in the middle.

876
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,320
I'll grab him by the back of his collar and pull him out.

877
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,120
Whatever, dad, fuck you.

878
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,160
Nah, damn it.

879
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,520
I got him when he was 45.

880
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,960
Man, that's some-

881
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,720
Do you not have a Munch Squad, my friend?

882
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,200
I have like too many and it's starting to feel like this predictable thing.

883
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
It felt too predictable.

884
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,720
It used to be a fun energy, you know what I mean?

885
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,840
And now I'm having to beg for it.

886
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,720
I love it.

887
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,680
I love the energy.

888
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,400
First of all, do the fucking song.

889
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,760
Play the song, Eric Clapton.

890
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:23,800
Okay, Munch Squad, this is a new theme song.

891
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,600
It's pretty good.

892
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Why don't you just give us some log lines and then let me and Travis be your navigators

893
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,760
through this wire if there's something that-

894
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,200
I don't fucking trust you guys to do that.

895
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,520
Okay.

896
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,320
Oh, okay.

897
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,680
Honey Baked Ham has a new-

898
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,280
Okay, first off, I have just sort of an addendum.

899
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,840
A correction.

900
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:41,960
Okay.

901
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,360
What'd you do?

902
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,920
A quick addendum.

903
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,560
Not a correction.

904
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,120
What'd you do?

905
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,280
No, nothing.

906
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,240
What'd you fuck up?

907
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,360
I did ask John Hodgman if the Taco Bell Crispy Chicken Sandwich taco where they're trying

908
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,640
to get beef going.

909
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,440
Hodgman has made basically his entire career is based around deciding whether or not a

910
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,400
hot dog is a sandwich.

911
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,800
I noticed that.

912
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,320
So I asked him to like weigh in on this and he said, and this is sort of like official,

913
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,680
as you can hear on his podcast, Judging on Hodgman, he makes these sorts of rulings all

914
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,720
the time and they are binding.

915
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,000
It's a taco inspired by a sandwich.

916
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
That's what Hodgman told me.

917
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,680
All right.

918
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,560
So that's official.

919
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,040
I like that.

920
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,160
He said, it's like, you know, like the famous Reuben taco.

921
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,800
And then like an hour later, he texted me, or a tuna melt taco.

922
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,120
Well, we get the concept, I think.

923
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,320
We got you, Hodgman.

924
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,680
Do you know what happened with that last one is Hodgman thought about a tuna melt taco

925
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
and he's like, fuck, that'd be delicious.

926
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
That's what he actually said.

927
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,560
Like, now I'm thinking about it.

928
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,600
I think he made himself hungry.

929
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,880
I think so too.

930
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,720
I think he practiced the secret.

931
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,080
I think he was visualizing.

932
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,320
Honey baked ham is doing pumpkin spice glazed turkey breast.

933
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,800
That sucks.

934
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,400
Yeah, it sucks, right?

935
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,280
Yeah, that's great.

936
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,720
What's wild is like in preparation for this limited time offering, Honey Baked did a survey

937
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,120
and they're like, the results reinforce the demand for fall flavor starts now.

938
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,720
Now, 69% agree fall has the best seasonal flavors.

939
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,360
In fact, 70% of people agree pumpkin spice is an essential part of the fall season.

940
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,960
Okay, but those are two different things.

941
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,240
Those are two different things because you're saying that a lot of people love fall flavors

942
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,520
and they acknowledge that pumpkin spice is essential to fall.

943
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,840
Not that they love pumpkin spice.

944
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,560
65% of people said pumpkin spice flavors should be available August through October.

945
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,200
That's true.

946
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,960
And 15% want the flavor to be available all year.

947
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,560
So 65%, 59% said spending time with family and friends for gatherings is a favorite fall

948
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,040
activity.

949
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,360
Okay.

950
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,000
And 71% of respondents said they feel disappointed when they miss out on an experience.

951
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,360
What?

952
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,440
There had to be a bit where you're like, what did you ask?

953
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,360
I'm sorry, one more time.

954
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,000
Sorry, I said that.

955
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,160
I just asked if you feel disappointed when you miss out on an experience.

956
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,000
Do you mean a honey baked ham sandwich experience or just any experience?

957
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
Just any experience.

958
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,880
It's like, well, fuck, was this for ham?

959
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,640
Can you say 75%, Justin?

960
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,360
71% of respondents said they feel disappointed when they quote, I'm just reading,

961
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,880
miss out on an experience.

962
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,320
I want to meet that other 29% who are so comfortable with themselves.

963
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,200
They're like, if I miss it, I didn't need to be there, I guess.

964
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,520
You're just like, I would have just fucked it up.

965
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,440
You know what I mean?

966
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,520
It probably wouldn't even been nearly as good.

967
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,120
An experience.

968
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,840
An experience.

969
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,800
An experience.

970
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,120
An experience, not good or bad, just 30% people are like, oh.

971
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,400
Yeah, man, I swear, God, the aliens landed.

972
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,280
I was not present at the Point Pleasant Silver Bridge collapse.

973
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,200
Damn it.

974
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,680
Fuck.

975
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,240
Damn.

976
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,740
Shit.

977
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,920
And I heard there was some really good ham there afterwards.

978
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,600
But Pumpkin Spice, they're doing Pumpkin Spice ham.

979
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,880
Yeah, okay, sure.

980
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,400
Why the fuck not?

981
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah, why not?

982
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,440
But that's not really what I'm kind of, the thing I actually want to talk about.

983
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,560
I just think that's funny.

984
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,960
They did, there's like, guys, there's like a whole thing about what would you do?

985
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,800
Here's what Pumpkin Spice lovers are willing to do to make it a year long, year round thing, right?

986
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,600
I'd murder.

987
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,720
28% of people would shave their head bald.

988
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,000
Okay.

989
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,800
27% of people would go a month without internet access.

990
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,600
No, you would not.

991
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,440
27% of people would give up their smartphone for a year.

992
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,880
Bullshit.

993
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,280
Just learn where to buy Pumpkin Spice.

994
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,920
It's a combination of flavor, you could do it yourself.

995
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,960
It's like just nutmeg and cinnamon.

996
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,760
They sell it, you can get bottles of it in the spice aisle with everything else.

997
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,800
Anyway, Wendy's unveils hot and crispy French fry innovation.

998
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,240
This is what I'm talking about.

999
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,960
I'm going to stand up.

1000
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,600
Yeah.

1001
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,960
This is what I do Munch Squad for, because this is actual news, okay?

1002
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,360
It's been fucking 11 years, okay?

1003
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:07,400
For the first time, the chain is updating its number one selling product, which is, of course,

1004
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,640
the French fry.

1005
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,600
The French fry.

1006
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,000
The Wendy's French fry.

1007
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,840
Now, it's been 11 years since we've touched this recipe, and now we're going back to the drive.

1008
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,640
We're going to change it.

1009
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:26,120
The tag that they're using, they're sort of like in the drive-by, you see a lot of drive-by

1010
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,520
fast food coverage, and it's just like, we just need a quote, so what do you think?

1011
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:39,000
And they're like, yeah, it's like a lot of places do it bad, and we're going to do it good.

1012
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,720
They say the fast food chain developed this new fry offering to put an quote

1013
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:50,280
in to the disappointing, inconsistent fry experiences that other places still serve.

1014
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,320
You see what they're doing here?

1015
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,680
They're putting their fuck up on everyone else's food.

1016
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,760
They're not changing it, you're right.

1017
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,800
Not because we fuck it up, but other places do.

1018
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,560
Yeah, we're going to carry even more of the weight than we have already.

1019
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,600
The ball's in their court.

1020
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,800
QSR Magazine, which is sort of my sort of like secret source, my number one source for like,

1021
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,720
when I want to go behind the headlines.

1022
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,440
It's your secret sauce source.

1023
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:24,920
Yeah, so this has an interview with John Lee, Wendy's vice president of culinary innovation,

1024
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,920
who is probably a genius at his job, but probably is one of the wilder interview

1025
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,480
subjects.

1026
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,560
I've seen a lot of John Lee's work, and it gets pretty wild every single time.

1027
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,920
Um, here's the example.

1028
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,560
It's basically one of those things where they're good.

1029
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,400
That's already a great start.

1030
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,120
It's basically one of those things where there were good fries out there, but there

1031
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,640
are not great fries out there.

1032
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,920
And we collectively got together and we told ourselves two and a half years ago that good

1033
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,520
is definitely not good enough.

1034
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,040
Now, earlier in this interview, he says that they've been working on this recipe for months.

1035
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,280
So I guess it was like two years where they were like, we gotta do something about the

1036
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,480
fries, cause like, yeah, yeah, we don't even start.

1037
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,280
We're going to go full court press and figure out what's the best way to have our customers

1038
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:12,680
backs.

1039
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,320
If fries are the most ordered menu item, we're going to create the best possible fry.

1040
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,960
So they, they asked John Lee, um, how, uh, tell me how your team has been approaching

1041
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,880
reinventing the fry and to land this new hot and crispy game changer.

1042
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,280
So hi, my name is Justin McElroy.

1043
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,800
Uh, I'm going to do my, my, uh, dramatic monologue is John Lee's answer to this question.

1044
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,800
Uh, and I'd like to read it for you now.

1045
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,840
And do you, I'm sorry.

1046
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,000
Do you have a headshot that we could, uh, peruse?

1047
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,800
Yeah, thank you.

1048
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,080
Uh, here.

1049
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,480
Okay.

1050
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,720
And do you, I'm so sorry to, I don't want to break your flow.

1051
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,520
Do you have a butt shot?

1052
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,520
No, uh, it's on my Instagram.

1053
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,320
It's just all butt shots.

1054
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,040
Can you show me your butt?

1055
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,720
This is what you want.

1056
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,280
You gotta get the, make it clap.

1057
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,600
Hey, make it clap.

1058
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,360
Uh, you gotta get the right potato.

1059
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,080
Once you get the right potato, you gotta make sure you're applying the right process.

1060
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,400
And we have a signature proprietary process that allows us to get the fry.

1061
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,120
Oh yeah.

1062
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,120
That's the way he puts it.

1063
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,880
You gotta do it in a way that our customers want it.

1064
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,000
So there's, so there's a whole bunch of forms.

1065
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,440
What?

1066
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,200
We've done a lot of research.

1067
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,560
There's a whole bunch of shapes.

1068
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,600
What?

1069
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,120
And there's a lot of different routes we could have taken to create new news.

1070
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,720
Oh man, sliding doors.

1071
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,640
The problem is to say true to our heritage and the roots and what Dave Thomas expected

1072
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,560
in terms of the perfect French fry.

1073
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,240
And then based on the research of what consumers really want, which is a fry that is hot and

1074
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,880
crispy, we actually landed on what we have today.

1075
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,640
So it looks like your standard French fry.

1076
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,360
It is not your standard French fry.

1077
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,160
The reality is sometimes they got it right the first time out in regards to shape.

1078
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,680
There's specifics around how we cut our fry.

1079
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,600
It was done right the first time around.

1080
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,920
So we didn't have to do much to fix that.

1081
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,040
But applying a proprietary process and being really careful about the partners we choose.

1082
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,160
What?

1083
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,520
And having the right raw materials coming in from a potato perspective.

1084
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,240
Oh my God.

1085
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,720
Gets us out where we're at today.

1086
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,040
Okay.

1087
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,080
Now, and then obviously we have our ops partnerships too.

1088
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,920
They do a fantastic job.

1089
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,080
We are trained properly.

1090
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,720
We've got that.

1091
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:41,000
We got certified people working those fryers and they care and are as passionate as we

1092
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,120
are about making sure that the guest experience is awesome every time they bite into it.

1093
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,960
Why am I standing up and salute?

1094
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,080
Like I'm saluting with my hand over my heart and I don't know like how I got to this position.

1095
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,000
I, listeners, I want you to rewind back to the beginning of Justin doing it and then

1096
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,800
listen again.

1097
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,560
And this time I want you to picture Justin standing in front of several like corkboards

1098
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,680
with like string wrapped around like thumbtacks going from thing to thing as he points out.

1099
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:17,640
And just imagine that John Lee has been awake for four weeks prior to this interview.

1100
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,840
I'm a ketchup eater.

1101
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,480
I'm not afraid to admit it.

1102
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm a ketchup eater.

1103
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,200
I'd like to take our pouch and I like to squeeze on a little squiggly drizzle on each fry.

1104
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,320
And soggy fries don't make for a very good eating experience when you try to do that.

1105
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,240
Using fries that they created are perfect for this.

1106
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,760
So if you include the delivery expectation of 20 minutes, typically 20 to 30 minutes,

1107
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,280
they're still crispy, which is mind boggling.

1108
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,560
It's the mind.

1109
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,560
The mind cannot conceive of the crispy.

1110
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,520
The mind cannot conceive of the crispy.

1111
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,560
Hey, can I say something?

1112
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:08,360
It is a razor thin margin between pleasantly floppy and way too crunchy for fast food french fries.

1113
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:14,120
The way this man is speaking makes me think that these are going to shatter my jaw bones.

1114
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,320
Oh yeah, baby.

1115
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
So fucking crispy.

1116
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,560
And they're heated internally, I guess.

1117
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,760
Like those like hand warmers that you crunch up and then put in your gloves.

1118
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,760
There's some kind of chemical activation from inside of them that 25 minutes later,

1119
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,440
they're still warm.

1120
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,040
I don't want you to go back.

1121
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,840
Hey guys, no, guys, you have to keep pressing forward.

1122
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,880
This is a question you had a freight.

1123
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,120
I really, guys, I really don't know.

1124
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,480
Please don't ask me for context.

1125
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,800
I don't know what is what is happening in this specific part.

1126
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,480
OK, you had a phrase around the coding that was great that included the word whisper

1127
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,920
and that you didn't want it to have a barrier to the potato.

1128
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,120
Can you share just a little bit about that philosophy?

1129
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,560
The reason why the whisper came out.

1130
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:13,480
Yes, thank you so much for asking.

1131
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,000
I was hoping you would bring up the whisper.

1132
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,400
Thank you.

1133
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,000
Actually, that's so stupid of you.

1134
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,640
Yeah.

1135
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,800
The reason why the whisper came out was because there are a lot of our competitors

1136
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,160
and options that we could have looked at that had heavier battering.

1137
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,240
But the beauty of our research was that it told us something very clearly

1138
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,720
that consumers really know their French fries.

1139
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,160
I love the French fry.

1140
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,880
For the fact that it's natural sort of potato texture.

1141
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,320
They want with the very light contrast and texture crisp on the outside.

1142
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,680
Fluffy baked potato in the middle is how we always talk about it in our kitchens.

1143
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,480
You cannot do that if you start applying a whole bunch of batter,

1144
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,000
which may make it more crispy.

1145
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,720
Yeah, but you end up changing the actual overall eating experience of the French fry.

1146
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,280
I know this gets deep into French fry.

1147
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,400
Does it, John?

1148
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,840
I know, but this is what we do.

1149
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,280
We talk about French fries like this.

1150
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,320
If you bite into a heavily battered product, I guarantee, I guarantee fucking tea.

1151
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,480
It says, I guarantee fucking tea.

1152
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,280
They start to get gummy and they lose that baked potato fluffy texture in the center.

1153
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,560
Our research tells us most consumers that is not good.

1154
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,600
John, honey, please come to bed.

1155
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,240
You've been up for days.

1156
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,640
John, please, the children miss you.

1157
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,280
Come home.

1158
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,440
But Mr. Lee, why should they not be married?

1159
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh, sorry.

1160
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,280
Yeah, no, no, no.

1161
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,640
I love her.

1162
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,040
I love her or something.

1163
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,400
Anyways, potatoes to all.

1164
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,240
I've got to be off.

1165
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:57,960
The change is in regards to the actual battering process that we use.

1166
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,760
And finding the right level batter, which sounds like it's easy.

1167
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,000
No.

1168
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,400
Try doing millions and millions of pounds of French fries.

1169
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,000
There's a lot of science involved.

1170
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,360
Please, Mr. Lee, calm down.

1171
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,640
Please put the knife away.

1172
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,960
There's a lot of engineering.

1173
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,160
So we had to get it just right.

1174
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,280
You think you could do it?

1175
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,640
Oh, John.

1176
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,760
This is truly the combination of our own science on a product that seems so simple when you

1177
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,080
compare it to something that looks more complex.

1178
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:33,080
It's actually probably the most complex project that I've worked on in my entire career.

1179
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,000
It fucking sounds like it.

1180
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,920
It sounds like it, John.

1181
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,240
And I love, John, can I say we've been having a lot of fun here on our comedy podcast,

1182
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,280
but I love the passion.

1183
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:42,600
I love it.

1184
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,840
I love the passion, you ketchup, you fucking ketchup eater.

1185
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,680
The only thing that makes me sad about this now that I think about it is how much passion

1186
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,160
and love John Lee has put into these French fries and how most fucking plebs are going

1187
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,320
to take a bite of it and go, that's pretty good.

1188
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,760
And they're not going to appreciate-

1189
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,440
They're not going to appreciate about it.

1190
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,040
You know what else tickles me is that this recipe is being rolled out and should be in

1191
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,640
all Wendy's by mid-October.

1192
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,960
I think that you should, in the future, not denigrate your current product while you still

1193
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,800
have apparently so much of it.

1194
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,480
I feel like people should just show up because now if you think I'm going to go to a Wendy's

1195
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:27,160
place before this new incredible fry is available, you see people go for it two to one at McDonald's.

1196
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,280
I'm not going to waste a trip to Wendy's right now when you're still serving that garbage

1197
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,600
fry.

1198
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,960
This is your last chance to stock up.

1199
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,320
Let me get a Baconator combo meal, but just keep the French fries because I wouldn't eat

1200
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,280
that fucking shit with my worst enemy's mouth.

1201
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,040
Could I get an IOU for the French fries that I can turn in in mid-October?

1202
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,000
Actually, just take the French fries and pull out your waistband like a silly clown and

1203
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,520
put them down your pants because you're a clown.

1204
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1205
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,720
And dance and say I'm a bad fry clown boy.

1206
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,760
Thank you.

1207
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,320
Thank you.

1208
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,520
Perfect.

1209
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,760
Oh, is it too late to order a small Frosty?

1210
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,840
I bet they are going to be pretty good though.

1211
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,880
Oh, yeah, sounds great.

1212
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,760
No, they're going to be great.

1213
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,200
They know what they're professionals.

1214
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,720
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1215
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1216
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,480
We hope you're going to rush out and get some of those Wendy's fries.

1217
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,680
They did not pay us to say that.

1218
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,800
Start waiting now.

1219
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,520
You got about-

1220
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,240
Start waiting now.

1221
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,720
45 days.

1222
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,080
Don't get any fries.

1223
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:17,400
Don't.

1224
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,800
Yeah, you know, fall's just around the corner.

1225
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,600
So, you know, do you got any questions for Richard Stank?

1226
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,240
He's going to be-

1227
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:25,880
Fuck.

1228
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,240
You know, the new season means a new visit from Richard Stank.

1229
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,480
So if you got questions about fragrance, you know, please be sure to pass those along.

1230
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,560
Hey, we have some really exciting news.

00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,160
We're doing a My Brother, My Brother and Me Live and Virtual September 24th.

1232
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,920

Yeah.

1234
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,040
It's going to start at 9pm Eastern time with Sawbones opening, which is very exciting.

Also, we got new merch over at mcrorymerch.com.

1240
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,720
Our pin of the month is Dr. Shaq from Adventure Zone 813,

1241
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,960
which benefits the World Central Kitchen, which uses the power of food to nourish communities

1242
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,560
and strengthen economies through times of crisis and beyond.

1243
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,920
We've got a Phantom Seek Coast Co. pin, excuse me,

1244
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,880
and some Adventure Zone temporary tattoo flash sheets designed by Lynn Doyle

1245
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,000
and benefits the Asian Prisoner Support Committee,

1246
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,200
which provides direct support to Asian and Pacific Islander prisoners

1247
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,480
and to raise awareness about the growing number of APIs being imprisoned, detained and deported.

1248
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,400
Hey, thank you to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life is Better with You.

1249
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,880
It's a jam, a bop, a slap, it rips completely and fully.

1250
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,440
It's a wiggler.

1251
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,240
Listen to the whole version of it now.

1252
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:53,240
Watch the music video that we participated in on the McElroy Family YouTube channel.

1253
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,440
And thank you, Montaigne.

1254
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,840
It's just, it brings me such joy.

1255
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,480
Is that it, though?

1256
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,440
Is that it for the show?

1257
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,720
I mean, you need to do your final yahoo.

1258
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,880
Yeah, no, I mean, other than that.

1259
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,920
You do a final yahoo.

1260
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,320
Yeah, sure.

1261
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,840
This one was sent in by Paul McCartney.

1262
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,120
Whoa!

1263
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,680
Whoa!

1264
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,520
Yeah, he listens.

1265
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,600
And he is really plugged into it.

1266
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,360
He's a very active yahoo user.

1267
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,520
He has 100,000 yahoo points.

1268
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,840
Thank you, Paul.

1269
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,400
Sir Paul.

1270
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:33,480
It's asked by yahoo answers user Tram-ter-kins, Tram-ter-kins.

1271
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,240
Tram-ter-kins, okay.

1272
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,600
And Tram-ter-kins asks, I'm thinking about

1273
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,400
starting a new.

1274
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,400
I'm thinking about starting a new.

1275
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,160
Hello.

1276
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,600
I'm thinking about starting a new.

1277
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,760
Just do it.

1278
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,040
Just read it.

1279
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,080
Off your screen.

1280
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:09,640
Sorry, guys.

1281
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,680
It's gotta, I gotta.

1282
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,960
You gotta scroll down.

1283
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,080
The fucking wire came loose.

1284
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:13,480
Hold on.

1285
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,640
Okay, here, it's loading now.

1286
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,000
Okay, good.

1287
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,560
Hello.

1288
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,680
Where do I start a new?

1289
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,480
Oh, never mind.

1290
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,920
I have a different question.

1291
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,520
Where can I download the all nude episode of According to Jim?

1292
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1293
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,160
This has been my brother, my brother.

1294
00:58:41,160 --> 00:59:09,960
May I kiss your dad's square on the lips?

1295
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,400
It's better with you.
