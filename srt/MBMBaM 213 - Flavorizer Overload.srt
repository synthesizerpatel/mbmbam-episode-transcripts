1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello, everybody, and welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,560
modern era. Attention, I have breaking news. I'm joined by my middle brother Travis and

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,120
my youngest brother Griffin. Say hello, gentlemen. Just hello. Hello. I have breaking news. Last

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,200
night, Travis was at a party where he played a steel drum. We take you now live on the scene

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,440
to Travis McElroy. It was just as majestic as you would think. I felt like I was playing

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,640
upside down turtle. It was lovely. I played a couple chords, and then they played Wasted

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,240
Away in Margaritaville. It was transcendent. It was a two-man steel drum band because one

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,680
steel drum is not enough, and they were able to do harmonies. Travis, we have eyewitness accounts

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,680
from the scene of the drum that you did, in fact, rattle out the theme song to Rugrats.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,720
Is that true or false, Travis? Can you confirm or deny? Listen, I was in a haze of tequila

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,120
at that point, so I may or may not have rocked it out, but I was not trying to. I don't know

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,320
why you're trying to hide this from us. I don't know why you're trying to fucking sweep this

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,440
under the rug. We take you now live to our analyst, Orb, who is a horse, former race

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,760
championship horse. Orb has just heard this news. Orb, you've been processing this this

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,400
morning. Of course, we're still trying to get all the pieces of this story about Travis

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,760
playing a steel drum last night into place. What is your initial reaction to this turn

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,160
of events? Orb can be played like a steel drum. He does not prefer it.

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,040
So you have personal connections to this instrument. Orb is two steel drums turned

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,520
to face each other. Let me ask you this, Orb, where does Travis go from here?

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,760
Jamaica.

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,040
Continuing our coverage of Steel Drum Gate 2014, we go live where Travis has prepared

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,640
a statement. Ladies and gentlemen, I have decided to step back from my steel drum career

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,320
and just spend some time rebuilding my family right now. This has been very tough on us,

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,120
and especially on them, and I feel out of respect. I must not play the Rugrats theme

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,240
song ever again. Breaking news, we're hearing reports from multiple sources that what Travis

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,360
actually played was an upside-down garbage can and that he was actually confused. We're

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,200
getting texts in. This is a scandal, but we are hearing reports that have tied his recent

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,920
resignation from steel drumming to the fact that he did in fact hit an upside-down trash

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,120
can with two chicken legs. Not a steel drum, as we were initially informed. Griffin, if

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,840
you heard any more updates from your sources, I see you kind of pounding away on your Blackberry

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,280
there. What are you hearing? We have an analyst here, Chet Chorson, who is doing some body

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,000
interpretation of Travis's statements. Chet, what do you think? Sounds to me like he fucked

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,960
the steel drum. Sounds to you like he fucked the steel drum. Yeah, I mean, look at him.

38
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,440
I mean, I guess I get it. I guess I'm confused about the physiology. Think about it. Oh, yeah.

39
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh, sure. So obviously Travis is not owning up to this at this time. We are going to continue

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,040
to monitor the situation. In the meantime, we return you to my brother, my brother and me

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,320
already in progress. Friends of ours really enjoy entertaining at their apartment.

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,480
My fiance and I are regularly invited for board games, chatting and on occasion dinner. My problem

43
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,800
is our apartment is far less presentable and because of this, we do not host very often.

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
We've taken to bringing a six pack or two with us to make up for our lack of reciprocity.

45
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,160
Are we good or should we make a bigger effort to host for our friends? That's from Hospitality Hot

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,720
Mess in Hyde Park. Well, hold on. We've got a question later. I'm going to tie this question

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
in now and go ahead and read it. OK, I'm in college and because of that, I'm a pretty social

48
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,000
person. I have a decent amount of friends and I'm usually either hanging out with them

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,080
or someone is at my apartment. However, when people are over at my house at some point in

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,560
the evening, I usually hit a point where I just want them to leave and have alone time.

51
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,960
The problem is I never know how to gracefully kick them out. How do I tell my friends that I'm

52
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,840
ready to be done with social time without sounding like a jerk? And that's from Semi Social Awkward

53
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,400
at Purdue. Is there a buzzer you could buy and activate? I just feel like these connect so well

54
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,960
because when I host, I love hosting and then there hits a point where it's like and I'm done

55
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,080
and I want you out. OK, goodbye, everybody. And that's usually about 830. I feel like that's part

56
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,600
of like finding your group of friends, though. Like I have a group of friends that are like

57
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,160
perfect at this where just when I'm like, I'm ready for sleepy time, they bounce.

58
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Mm hmm. How do they know, though? Do you have do you think maybe you're more obvious about your

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,480
sleepy time signals than you think you are? I mean, I do. I do come out my onesie footie

60
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,440
pajamas. You know, you joke. I did that once. I know you're in my house. And then it was like,

61
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,000
well, I gotta I gotta go to bed now. And I came out in my pajamas. I spend a lot of time

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,720
thinking about issues like this. I tend to worry about making sure I had enough sleep before

63
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,960
or that I can handle the situation that I won't be the first one to be sleepy. So I'll do like a

64
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,800
five hour energy or something. I think you take a nap. I'll take a pizzazz in the afternoon.

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,720
That kind of thing. I think you just have to keep you have to stay ahead of the

66
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,520
ahead of the game. You can't collapse. You can't be the most drunk person there.

67
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,080
You can't be most drunk. Can't be the sleepiest. Can't be the handsiest either.

68
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,240
No, I don't like going to Darryl's house. He's very handsy. You have to be so normal when you're

69
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,520
hosting a party. It's best to stay in the center of the room and try to, like, maintain a neutral

70
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,720
baseline. Exactly. That's true because I'm more of an iconoclast. I think of myself as

71
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,120
really the Auntie Mame of our family. You know, throwing a Christmas celebration in July,

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,760
whimsical hats, a donkey in the living room. Auntie Justin. Justin's having another donkey

73
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:21,440
show at his party. I think of myself as that. But you have to level yourself out when you're

74
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,320
hosting because people need to know that they're safe and cared for. They don't want Auntie Mame.

75
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:34,720
They want Aunt Normal. Yeah, Auntie Lame. Auntie Lame would have been a better thing.

76
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,440
Yeah, well, we'll fix it in post. Y'all want a Yahoo? Yeah.

77
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,480
This Yahoo was sent in by a close personal friend of mine of the show, Drew Davenport. Thank you,

78
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:57,440
Drew. It's by Yahoo Answers user InnocentButDeadly. Ooh, spicy. Who asks, is it okay to do the pee-pee

79
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:07,520
dance at work? I was really consumed with the task at hand and didn't want to interrupt it.

80
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,760
By going to the restroom. Before I knew it, my bladder weighed three pounds. All the excess pee

81
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,040
was killing me. So I finally decided to use the restroom. I crossed my thighs, tightened them

82
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,160
while hopping. I work retail on the store level. So customers, as well as coworkers,

83
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,560
saw my pee-pee dance. One coworker told me to stop. And after taking a huge leak in the restroom,

84
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,840
I did. Was that normal? Well, I think it is normal for your pee-pee dance to stop.

85
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,440
I think it is normal for your pee-pee dance to stop after you take a huge pee-pee. Yeah.

86
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,120
It's much weirder if you do it afterwards like a celebratory touchdown dance.

87
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,880
This person was carrying three pounds of urine in what I can only assume to be like maxed like a

88
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,440
half pound bag. Well, you don't know. Well, I mean, without weighing the bladder first,

89
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,360
you can't be sure that some of that three pounds wasn't, maybe they just have a really fat bladder.

90
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah. A lot of flat, fat bladder. Mama Sita. That's what that song all about,

91
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,360
that bass is all about. And Copacabana is about that too. Being proud of your bladder.

92
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,280
And with slow love, she was a showgirl, fattest bladder in the land. Everybody give her a hand.

93
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,480
She went merengue. You didn't hear the sloshing. Okay. What fucking thing could you be doing in

94
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,280
a retail store level job that you're like, I cannot walk away from this. I will risk

95
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,880
prostate and bladder problems to finish putting these price tags up.

96
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,200
The avatar actually looks like a woman. So no prostate problems. No prostate problems.

97
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,640
I've worked several retail jobs. I always took it as a tiny vacation when it was time to pee,

98
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
because no one's going to say no. No one's going to be like, get back to work because we're not

99
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,200
working in a gulag. You got to pee. You go pee. Maybe there's three pounds down your leg. Maybe

100
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,920
they're selling a PB gone, a special pill that makes it so you never have to pee again.

101
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,840
That would be very embarrassing for them and your place of business. Have you guys ever,

102
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't think I've ever done a pee pee dance of like, I don't think that actually,

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,520
I don't think there's any physiological implications sprint. Yeah. Well, that's every

104
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,760
time for me, every time, every time for me. And it's, it's an emergency. Have I done a pee pee

105
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:42,320
dance? You know, I used to pee pee whenever I needed to like a big boy, but now I, uh, I've

106
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:50,400
been sort of holding off a little bit until I just can't take it anymore because that is, I miss that

107
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,560
movie theater. You know that tantric, tantric, tantric peeing that you do after a Lord of the

108
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,000
rings and you think it's almost over and then it isn't, but it's close enough that you've missed

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,600
all the pee times on the run P app. Yeah. Um, and so you just have to push on through. Uh,

110
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,000
I missed that kind of pee. I wish I had that kind of pee more regularly. You know when you have to

111
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,920
pee really bad and then suddenly just strangely the feeling just goes away for a little while.

112
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,920
That's the scariest, scariest with that P go, uh, I'm going to give us, I'm going to allow us maybe

113
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,120
one more minute of this. Um, but, um, I've ruined myself working from home for seven years now,

114
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,080
uh, because I'll just go, I'll just go even when I, maybe I don't even really need to,

115
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,600
it just like sounds like a good thing to do. I'll just go in there and do it, which has,

116
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,640
which has reduced the iPhone game you're playing at that moment, which has reduced my ability to

117
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:58,400
not go to a span of about 20 minutes. So your flange is loose. My flange, my cap, my resistor,

118
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,840
uh, is, is, is barely non-existent at this point. But again, like I don't do a pee pee dance cause

119
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm a fucking adult and I know my fucking body at this point and I always know where the bathroom is.

120
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
So I don't let it get to that point. Come on.

121
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:21,200
I feel like a pee pee dance would just be more pressure in odd places than I would want. I feel

122
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,160
like the best thing I can do is just sort of stay zoned, stay focused, straight line. Get my

123
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,640
mindfulness right. Breathe in, breathe out, healing, cleansing light and just wait.

124
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,040
For what?

125
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,440
Till it presents itself, Griffin. Till it's time. I don't know why ever,

126
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,840
whatever reason this guy had. I don't know. I'm 33. I pee when I want.

127
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
Yeah. Sometimes when I don't want.

128
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,880
If I want to pee, I pee. If I want to eat Captain Crunch one morning, I do. I don't care.

129
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
Sometimes I sneeze really hard and I pee a little bit.

130
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,320
God, Juice, I gotta say being 33 sounds awesome. I cannot wait to get there.

131
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:08,240
Pretty cool so far. I bought a cereal that had s'more in the name today. No one cares.

132
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
And you can't do that until you're 33?

133
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,280
No one's gonna stop me. I thought the Larynade lady would say like,

134
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,880
are you sure you want to do this?

135
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
Can I check your ID?

136
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,000
Can I see your ID? Nope. 33. You're right. Okay. Well.

137
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,400
I thought you were starting a new question and that this is just somebody else who had done this

138
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,840
and not you. And then I found out it was you. And then our relationship changed in a subtle,

139
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
almost imperceptible way.

140
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,280
Yeah. Irreversible.

141
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,000
Irreversible and imperceptible. Do start a new question. I do not want to talk about pee pee

142
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,160
anymore. Yes, you do. You just are afraid people don't want to listen to you talk about pee pee

143
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,520
anymore. We'll do a new podcast for that. I was living with my girlfriend. I don't want to know

144
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,240
people who would listen to that podcast. It's dirty.

145
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,120
It'll be a pee pee and Dungeons and Dragons podcast.

146
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Pee pee. There it is. I was living with my girlfriend and another roommate for just under a

147
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,720
year. When we broke up, she moved back home and my roommate and I moved into a new place together.

148
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,880
Now roommate is moving out and he is claiming ownership of some of the various items my ex left

149
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:21,920
behind. He claims that since we were all roommates before her and I started dating, we should split

150
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:31,360
the booty equally. I claim her and I shared things. I claim her and I shared things when we started

151
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,240
dating and anything she left behind is mine. Also, a lot of stuff in our place is actually his,

152
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,920
so I don't think he needs any extra crap. Am I crazy or should my ex's stuff be mine now?

153
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:54,400
That's from Canadian custody battle. This is some ghoulish shit. I was living with my

154
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,480
girlfriend and another roommate. He lived with his girlfriend and they had another roommate.

155
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,240
Him and his girlfriend broke up. She left behind a bunch of stuff. The roommate, they're moving out

156
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,720
now and the roommate wants some of the ex-girlfriend stuff because they were roommates.

157
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,120
This is what is ghoulish. Does this person have extra claim on the things that this

158
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,320
roommate left behind? Which is totally fair. When a roommate leaves and doesn't take their shit and

159
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,960
expresses no interest in taking their shit, congratulations. Now you have things. But does

160
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,960
the person who actually dated the woman get- And if I'm reading the question correctly,

161
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,720
they started dating after they all moved in together. We were all roommates before her and I

162
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,880
started dating. That's a rookie mistake by the way. Yeah. I almost feel like you should have to

163
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,680
give the non-dating roommate everything because you fucked up so grandly. That is correct. If

164
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,640
nothing else, even if it had gone super well, you did put roommate in position of being like

165
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,800
permanent third wheel. So maybe he gets that box set DVD. You know what I mean? Maybe he gets all

166
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:10,960
of F-Troop. She left her F-Troop box set and roommate wants it. What are you going to do?

167
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,400
Split them up? You take season one, he takes season two? That doesn't make any sense. Just

168
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,080
give him the whole box set. You're both going to be missing integral parts of the F-Troop crew

169
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,640
line. You won't know how it ends. You won't know where it begins. It'll just be a mess. Yeah. Can

170
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,880
you have a- Okay, let me hit you with this. Each of you has $500 of Monopoly money. You invite a

171
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:38,240
third party over. It's going to be Jeff Probst. It's Jeff Probst. He's the ex. And then he does

172
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
a survivor style auction. You don't know when it's going to stop. You don't know what the items will

173
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,800
be, but you get to bid on the ex's thing. So that way you can get the things that you need the most,

174
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,920
like maybe rice for the camp. You know what I like about that, Justin? That not only is a practical

175
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,400
idea, that sounds fun. Yeah, it sounds like you'd have a great time. Probst probably wouldn't have

176
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,960
a great time auctioning off his own goods to his ex-lover. But, you know, just side note,

177
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,680
so Teresa and I moved into Los Angeles and I had an idea pop in my head. It was like, you know,

178
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,520
it would be way more affordable if we got like a two or three bedroom apartment and then got a

179
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,320
roommate. And then I couldn't think of anything weirder for some, and I'm sure that people out

180
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,440
there do it and I'm not trying to throw shade, but the idea of like a married couple finding like a

181
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,200
roommate was really weird to me. Yeah. Is that crazy? Oh, you're going to get a lot of applicants

182
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,800
that show up like, hey, my name is Tom. Yeah, I have a great job in the city. I'll be able to

183
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,600
make you guys into cuckold. Also, I don't like washing windows. I really like living with you

184
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:52,480
guys. I'm really getting into the swing of it. Okay, let's watch a movie. I was at a party last

185
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,760
night and a friend of mine was showing us how Tinder works because I asked because I've never

186
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,200
seen it before. And one of my other friends instinctively saw a picture of a guy and thought

187
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,400
he looked cool. And so they liked him, which is how Tanner works. You either like or dislike them.

188
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
And if you both like each other, you get a notification that you have a match. And so he

189
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,400
did it because the guy looked cool without having any additional info information. Holy shit. That

190
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:26,560
way it's called Tinder because you get a match. That might be it. And then they match. And then

191
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:37,680
we clicked through below the jump there to read some additional info. And he's married and he

192
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:47,440
travels on business a lot. Business with a capital B, he said. And he is into cuckold and he is into

193
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:57,440
making fantasies come true. He's into quote, teaching women how to squirt. Fantastic. Thank

194
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:06,000
you, Roger, very much. And he finished out his monologue by saying that he is into nail clipper

195
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
play. That's a new chestnut that I'm going to throw into a volcano. But he's making dreams come

196
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,400
true. He's making fantasies come true. That's pretty cool. Wait, he's he's making fantasies

197
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,200
come true for unsuspecting people. Could, and he travels a lot. Could this be Ty Pennington

198
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,800
from Extreme Home Makeover? Is that possible? Business with a capital B. It was actually

199
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:41,760
Jareth, the Goblin King. Squirt, magic squirt. My comic book collection is getting quite large

200
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,880
and I'm running out of space to store all my single accounts. Oh Justin, what the fuck did,

201
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,240
what did we do yesterday? I can't, we can't say. We can't talk about it. Many of them I only read

202
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,560
once and then store it in a long box. I want to go all digital, but I don't know how to tell my

203
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,240
comic book shop that I don't need a pull list anymore. That's from Colin. Colin is describing,

204
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,640
I think, the biggest problem with comic books. I really like comic books as like a reading

205
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,960
experience and I hate everything else. I hate paying four dollars for five minutes of something

206
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,520
and then a lifetime of guilt. Ironically, I find that I feel the same way about going into a comic

207
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,280
book store the same way I feel about going into a high-end like Ben's fashion store,

208
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,840
where it always seems like it's going to be a cool, fun, like let's find, and then it's like,

209
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,000
oh yeah, no way. All this stuff costs way too much money for me to actually buy it. Cool.

210
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,240
And so, but I guess what confuses me about this question is,

211
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,680
isn't that the point of comic books? Is owning, is like having a collection of them?

212
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,440
No, I mean digital, digital comics are taken off in a big, big way and I'm sure that,

213
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,000
I mean, I think your best bet is to just ghost and maybe they'll think that you're dead or

214
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
something because I think you calling and saying, hey, I am actively, actively contributing to the

215
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,880
erosion of your whole thing here. They're not going to take this.

216
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,680
Yeah, that's better. Hold on. Tell him you're going on an extended vacation,

217
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,920
so not to do the pull list, and you will call him when you get back in town so he can start

218
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,520
pulling the comics for you again and then just never call him again. So lie, lie real good.

219
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,200
Well, so that way, because if you just ghost, he's going to keep pulling them and end up with

220
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,480
this huge stack and be like, where's Colin? I guess just call the comic book store and say,

221
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,960
hey, this is Josh Richardson, so I'll pull my comics by and then hang up really fast.

222
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,840
Your comic book dealer is probably already a little panicked about the advent of digital

223
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,320
comics. If you call and say, listen, I'm going all digital, you're only going to keep him up at night,

224
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:58,960
provide him with more anxiety. If you don't call and leave no inclination of your indication of

225
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,200
your whereabouts, he's going to think you're dead. Can I read a Yahoo? That is a nice segue here.

226
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
I feel like we didn't help Colin at all, but yes.

227
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,920
I mean, we did our best. This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport also. Thank you, Drew. It's by

228
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Yahoo Answers user, Dr. Quantum, who asks, I want to read Dilbert. Where should I start?

229
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,240
Good comic book store. I've never read Dilbert, but a friend of mine, first of all, what?

230
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
I've never read Dilbert, but a friend of mine usually talks about it, and I think I'll like it,

231
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,440
but he couldn't tell me where is a good place to start. Thoughts? You could start at the death

232
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:51,120
slash rebirth of Dilbert Ark. Oh, sure. After Dilbert Civil War. I love the 11th Dilbert

233
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,320
. I mean, you never forget your first Dilbert, but the 11th Dilbert provides a great jumping

234
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,520
off point. I think I really liked the brightest Dilbert, darkest Dilbert miniseries. Yeah,

235
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,760
that was pretty good. Dilbert, there's Dilbert Ultimatum. That's pretty good.

236
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,240
The Dilbert Amalgam where he mixed with Garfield. That was a pretty good one. I like that one a lot.

237
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,840
I don't like the crossover shit. Okay. No, I don't like the Dilbert Avengers. There's like

238
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,760
amazing Dilbert. There's ultimate Dilbert. There's extreme Dilbert. Dilbert 1999. There's Dilbert.

239
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:31,200
There's Dilbert teens. And that's there's Pigbert. There's Pigbert. There's zombie Dilbert,

240
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
which is like obviously Marvel was just fucking having a field day with that one.

241
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,960
You got to take I think the best place. I think you go back to the beginning.

242
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,640
I think you go straight to always postpone meetings with time wasting morons. See if you

243
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,640
can find it in the original printing. It's got a better cover. And then from there you go to

244
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,400
Dogbert's Clues for the Clueless. It's the third book, but in a way it's the second. Yeah, yeah.

245
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
And then Shave the Whales.

246
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,680
Shave the Whales. Motherfucker.

247
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,720
Still pumped from using the mouse is another good jumping off point.

248
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,760
And maybe do some readings. Do some reading Scott Adams. Maybe read some of his big ideas.

249
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,040
Yeah, and then kind of figure out where you're at after that. Okay, so here is the game.

250
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,000
Are you ready? Yeah, I am going to read either the name of a Dilbert collection.

251
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,960
Oh Jesus. Or the name of a Jimmy Buffett song. It's always that then. Okay,

252
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:50,320
breathe in, breathe out, move on. That's a Jim James Buffett. Okay, when body language goes bad.

253
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,640
Oh damn. I'm gonna go Dilbert. I'm gonna say James Buffett. That is Dilbert. Correct, Travis.

254
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:08,960
Congratulations. Positive attitude. Oh shit. Is Scott Adams a pen name for Jimmy Buffett?

255
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm going Dilbert. Positive attitude? I think that's actually Jim Buffett. That is Dilbert.

256
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:28,160
Yes. Son of a bitch. Dear Jimmy Buffett. Dilbert. Yeah, I think it's Dilbert. Sorry that's Jimmy

257
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,280
Buffett because his name is in it. I thought it was a Scott Adams love letter. Oh, this is a good

258
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:42,560
one. This is a good one. You ready? The Dilbert principle. Margaritaville. Okay, let's get the

259
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,880
money zone. I'm just throwing out that it's five o'clock somewhere works for both. Yeah,

260
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,480
it's five o'clock somewhere would be an excellent Dilbert book. So does Dogbert's Clues for the

261
00:25:50,480 --> 00:26:03,680
Clueless. It was Dogbert's Clues for the Clueless. And a pineapple smiled nearby. He went a little

262
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Randy Newman there at the end. Here's some truth. I've been struggling with anxiety for the past

263
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:24,000
few months. And part of that is that I try to stay in a pretty positive place. And as a result,

264
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,200
I have listened to exclusively Radio Margaritaville on SiriusXM for the past three months.

265
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:39,040
I mean, exclusively. We're talking tear off the knob. You're in Jimmy's hands now. I guess I'm

266
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,400
not comfortable with you. Jimmy take the wheel. Jimmy take the wheel of my car. I'm not really

267
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,040
comfortable with you drinking and driving though, Justin, I have to say. No, Jimmy Buffett is

268
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:56,560
drinking for your ears. Yesterday, here is the point that we have reached. Now to be clear,

269
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,800
Radio Margaritaville is not just Jimmy Buffett tunes, although wait a few minutes, one will come

270
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:08,800
on. It's songs hand selected by Jimmy Buffett. I mean, that's what they say. I don't know. He

271
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,240
probably has assistants. There's probably a different Jimmy Buffett in every town, like

272
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:21,600
Santa Claus. But I described to Sydney yesterday, as we drove to the mall for the entire 15 minute

273
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,480
duration of our transit to the mall on Friday, I described an imaginary Jimmy Buffett collection

274
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,600
that I would like to construct a box set of all the tunes that I need for mental health.

275
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Just to let you guys in on the collection, the second disc is all different versions

276
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:49,280
of Margaritaville live, just with different. It's your beach time prescription. It's a beach time

277
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,560
prescription for good feelings. Here's the kicker. You ready? The first disc, guess where it kicks

278
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:00,480
off with? Margaritaville. I know you're thinking Margaritaville. That's the second disc. No, you

279
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,880
launch with I will play for gumbo. No one sees that coming. Then straight into boat drinks.

280
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,760
I certainly would not see that coming because I don't know the fucking song.

281
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,200
Just for the people at home, rather than our typical Money Zone music,

282
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,880
I'm going to request that you put in the chorus of I will play for gumbo.

283
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,120
Now see, every time you do that, I have to go to Amazon. I have to buy the fucking mp3.

284
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,600
I'll pay you a dollar. Not that you'll need it because you'll be so into this fucking tune.

285
00:28:33,600 --> 00:29:01,920
Is he going to hear it? There we go into the Money Zone. Once you're full up on gumbo,

286
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,800
you need something to counterbalance that. What pairs well with gumbo? What's the best

287
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,360
pairing for gumbo? It's anything from NatureBox. They have delicious snacks. Literally any of them

288
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:24,720
can be put atop gumbo for a crunchy or chocolatey or chewy or salty or sweet. Literally anything

289
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,560
that comes in a bag can be put atop gumbo. That includes dishwasher tabs. Kitty litter. I actually

290
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:40,240
don't know what gumbo is. Teeth. A bag of teeth. NatureBox has delicious, delicious, delicious

291
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,320
snacks that are natural. They got no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup, and there are some

292
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,400
that are low in sugar and have no gluten. And they ship them for free. You don't have to worry

293
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,880
about that either. What are you guys rocking? Because I know there's some staples for you guys.

294
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,080
Not that you don't get a big bag of staples. I would highly recommend the French Toast granola.

295
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,080
That's very, very good. You put some milk on that, your day's going to get started

296
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,280
really, really right. And if you're like me, I love the salty chip kind of stuff.

297
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:24,560
They got sea salt pop pops. So good. They also have some Santa Fe corn stick stuff. So good.

298
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,480
So if you try NatureBox right now, we can get you 50% off your first month's box. Just go to

299
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,200

300
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,080
to last you a super long time. They have different options, different size boxes for different size

301
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,400
family. There's something that's going to fit. I promise you, their snack selection gets bigger

302
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,480
and bigger every day it seems. There's going to be something there that you're going to like.

It's real tasty. So go to naturebox.com slash my brother. All one word, and we'll get you half off

304
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,200
your first box. No big deal. That sounds like a great deal. No need to thank us, but if you

305
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,200
want to, we're on Twitter. So here's the thing. You've probably tried Hulu. I mean, it's been

306
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,200
around, I think, since the internet. Can you not start with, so here's the thing. So here's the

307
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,240
thing. Lean in. You sound like fucking Linda Ellerby, sitting backwards on a chair. Hey,

308
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,920
let's rap. You've all tried Hulu, right? You're all cool kids, and you think you've tried Hulu,

309
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,360
and that's fine, and you're awesome. Well, here's the thing. You think you're cool,

310
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,800
but you haven't tried Hulu Plus. Hulu Plus is that new shit. Travis, that is a smart pantsuit

311
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:33,280
you're wearing right now. Thank you. It makes me feel sexy and confident. You're both. Hulu has

312
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:39,680
everything, man. They have current season episodes of shows that are on right now, like Modern Family,

313
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:46,160
Daily Show with Jon Stewart. They have every episode, like deep back catalogs of shows like

314
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:53,520
South Park, which is only on Hulu Plus. You can also find stuff like, you know,

315
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,920
Teresa and I watched Parks and Rec on there, Bottle of Burgers, tons of stuff.

316
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,600
The Prophets on there, that's one of my favorite shows basically ever, where you have a failing

317
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,560
business, and my boy Marcus Lemonis comes into your failing business, and he says that this

318
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,800
place sucks, but I'm gonna make it awesome, and you're gonna give me half, and for the next week,

319
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,880
you have to do exactly what I say, you scumbag. That sounds like a great show. And by the end,

320
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,040
they fall in love with him? Yeah. By the end, they're like, you were so right. Or sometimes,

321
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,160
he just dips. Sometimes he's like, hey, I think you're embezzling, so I'm gonna go,

322
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,560
and then credits. It's a great show. It sounds very good. I'm gonna check that out.

323
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:38,320
It's on everything. You can use it on a smart TV, Roku, Apple TV, any gaming device basically,

324
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:47,200
Xbox, PlayStation, whatever. You can do it on a phone, on a train, on a turret, at the urinal.

325
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,560
That's a good look. That's a great look. You're gonna be there for 23 minutes plus ads,

326
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,800
so it's gonna be hard to get comfortable, but chase your bliss. Not only that, they've got

327
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:10,000
original stuff you can't find anywhere else, like the awesomes created by Seth Meyers. It's

328
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,720
about a misfit group of superheroes, cartoons. You're gonna love it. All 10 episodes of season

329
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,520
one. Season two just premiered, so it's a great time to go check it out. It's only eight bucks a

330
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,680
month. You'll get your shows wherever you need them, but we can give you a two-week free trial

331
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,840
if you go to huluplus.com slash my brother, all one word. Normally the trial's one week. We're

332
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,320
gonna give you a second one in case you're really dragging your fucking heels on this.

333
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,240
So make sure you go to huluplus.com slash my brother so that it counts towards us and makes

334
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:54,720
us look so good. I just gotta get a message to Hal from Lori. Lori says, I'm so happy you said yes.

335
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:02,080
I'm so happy you said yes and that I beat you to it and I got to do the asking. I told you that

336
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,440
road trip to West Virginia would only be the first of our adventures together. I love you so much

337
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,720
and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. That's from Hal. Well, it's from Lori to Hal.

338
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,040
But I think it's also a little bit from Hal, if you really look inside your heart.

339
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:26,160
Lori came- they came to see Superman. Did they? My show Superman, yep. They sound- they sound

340
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,280
super sweet. So she asked him for his hand, it sounds like. Apparently his hand. I don't know

341
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,320
what- she doesn't specify, so maybe it's just like they wanted- she wanted to go see Transformers

342
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,000
Rise of the Fallen and he was like, yeah, I'm glad you asked and said yes. Because I would be

343
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,320
embarrassed to ask that of you. And then while they were there, Optimus Prime married them.

344
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,200
Surprise! Surprise. So congratulations, you two. I'm so happy and I'm glad that you're in love.

345
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,520
I got another message from Ian, Alex, and Rebecca. Three ways split there. For Jessica.

346
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,080
And her last name's here, but I don't think that's Jermaine. Hi, Mabim Bam. Because our amazing big

347
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,960
sis Jessica is now happily engaged to her incredible man Jake, we thought she deserved

348
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,440
a shout out on her favorite podcast. And this- I don't know why I make them sound like they're

349
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,880
from fucking He-Haw. I'm sure you guys are great. Sorry. Despite her leaving us for a kick-ass new

350
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:32,320
life in Nashville, we love her all the same. Congratulations, Jessica on your encouragement.

351
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:42,800
Oh no, Ian's melting. We'll miss your bunches. Love your wee siblings.

352
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Oh man. Uncle Joe, he is a moving kind of slow at the junction.

353
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,720
Petticoat Junction. Man, that's so sweet. Love is in the air. Kind of sound like

354
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,920
nerdy buddy in the club getting married. Love this. Love this. Man, I'd hate to be an unmarried

355
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,880
person right now. Am I right, guys? Come on, don't drop that. Why are you throwing shade?

356
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,520
Bikini season. Volleyball time. Hot dogs and hamburgers. Get ready to Olympic dive.

357
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,560
Fourth of July. Are you ready for rollerblading rain time? That's right. It's Aaron and Brian

358
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,880
from Throwing Shade, if you didn't know from that very clear intro. We take a look at issues

359
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,000
involving ladies and gays and we treat them with much less respect than they deserve. So

360
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,400
watch out, punks. So hey, download us and take us to the beach while you're doing your summertime fun.

361
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,840
How about a yahoo? Hit me. I'm ready. We just did Dilbert, but there's some important topics

362
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,200
in here. This one was sent in by John Jelnick. I believe that's how you pronounce his name.

363
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,600
Thank you, John. I'm just going to be more confident with that shit.

364
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,720
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user. Fucking thing's not popping up.

365
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,840
It's a weird name. What's your fucking... I can't... He has no name.

366
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:05,760
He has no name. This is unprecedented. Okay. Well, it was asked by some Yahoo Answers user.

367
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm going to assume they were just deleted. The phantom of Yahoo Answers. Can we assume that

368
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:19,200
if we reach the singularity, the first thing the AI will do is destroy Yahoo Answers? It's too

369
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,320
helpful. I hope so. I also hope that about the rapture, about the super volcano eruption,

370
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,240
I hope that about everything, that it's the first against the law. This mystery user asks,

371
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,480
what would your reaction be if a stranger asked you to briefly watch their child,

372
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,280
say in a store or waiting room while they slipped away briefly to use the restroom, pay, et cetera?

373
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,640
It does seem like a setup for like a, I don't know, jackass or like, is a candid camera still

374
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,000
a thing? Well, that would be both a terrible jackass and a terrible candid camera. It would

375
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,520
be... I mean, this is John Quinones. Like, John Quinones does this on the weekends for fun,

376
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:07,120
I think. He just asks adults to watch. Does this say something about us as a people now that my,

377
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,080
I don't know how it hit you guys, non-jokey style. My immediate, immediate reaction was,

378
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:20,560
I would say, well, no. No, no, I don't want that on me. No, thank you. Remind me, Griffin,

379
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,520
does it say like, given circumstance where they are, what's going on? They're going into the

380
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,600
changing room of say an H&M and they have their child with them and they say, sorry,

381
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,280
can you watch him just for a minute? Do you know what makes this okay? What? If you had your own

382
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,600
kid with you. No, because now I'm too, too deep. Now I'm not numbered. Well, how old's the kid?

383
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:49,520
I'm thinking like stroller age. Says 16 years old. No, because then you give this kid a part-time

384
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,480
job. Do I get back? What if that other kid like fucking made a shiv out of Pokemon carbs and

385
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,520
stabs your kid? I'm saying, you know, I wouldn't, I would double not trusted another kid, another,

386
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:11,120
like probably flea infested child near my perfect human specimen. I did no way, no way on earth.

387
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,920
My perfect Dakota. And let me throw out this situation. Hey, can you watch my kid? I'm just

388
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,160
going to duck in here real quick. Two hours later, they still haven't returned. Now you're

389
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,760
stuck with this extra kid. Yeah. That's, I mean, that is the, what would you do? That's,

390
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,560
that's Kenyanses game is how long can we make a person own a child? I mean, I think the only

391
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,480
rational response is to find the next person you see and ask them if they will watch your kid.

392
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,160
It's basically like the ring of kids. Like you, you, you ask them to watch the kid and then it's

393
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,920
their, their problem. That's what that song, it takes a whole village to raise a child is about

394
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,120
is I'm going to H and M. Can you watch this little thug for a second? And then you're like, sure.

395
00:39:51,120 --> 00:40:00,320
Hey, sorry. Um, I'm got to go run to blockbuster blockbuster. Can you watch this closing in five

396
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,240
minutes? Also kids, kids aren't allowed in it because most blockbusters are infested with

397
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,960
coyotes at this point. Um, can you, I'm going to the coyote run, the fear will run blockbuster.

398
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,520
Can you watch this kid? Yeah, sure. I guess I was about to go to dip and dots, dip and dots.

399
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,440
That's great. Cause it's the ice cream of the future and a video store with the past.

400
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,440
I haven't been to a fucking mall since 1996. I got to hit up this orange Julius.

401
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,400
Oh shit. That was going to be mine. You beat me to it.

402
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,840
Yeah. I, but like, I'm serious. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it.

403
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,560
And everybody on Yahoo responding to this question is like, nope, nope. Not a chance

404
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,920
in hell. No way. No, never. And does that mean like, have we, as a culture, like,

405
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,760
I, is this like part of the mounting evidence that we are just fucked? Because I think back

406
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,960
in like the fifties, this probably happened all the time. Like, hey, so it's where you see a lot

407
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,960
in the fifties, like just general adults using the fact that they're adults as like

408
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,720
carte blanche to yell at kids. Like you think about that these days, like if another adult

409
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,160
yelled at your kid, that would be crazy. But you see that all the time in ye olden days.

410
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:34,720
But like also just giving absolute responsibility of your child to a human that you just fucking ran

411
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,880
into at Sam's club. So a couple of days ago, I was at a, I was at a food cart and I was also

412
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,920
working a show. I was doing sound for the tour and I ordered my food and it was taking forever

413
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,600
to come out and it was really coming down to the wire. Like I had like three minutes to get back

414
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,840
to my table and run sound when the show started. And this woman next to me said like, oh, do you

415
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,680
have to get back over there? And I was like, yeah. And she was like, okay, well, if you want to go,

416
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,840
I'll just bring your food to you. I'll, I'll grab your food. Okay. And I said, no, I was like, no,

417
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,040
I'm good because I didn't trust her with my grilled cheese sandwich. Can we just take a second

418
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,880
and just appreciate the moment? This moment. I want to live in this moment forever where Travis

419
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,680
has just equated his ownership and consumption of this grilled cheese sandwich to the protection

420
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,040
to the protection of your human life that you created. What my point is times that by a million.

421
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,440
Okay. So you recognize that make it, does that make it more likely for me to say like,

422
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,120
Hey, could you just hold on to this baby for a second? I, I know, like I don't trust people

423
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,120
with my grilled cheese. I ain't going to trust people with my baby. Anybody that would entrust

424
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,280
their child to another person is a rogue agent. They are off the reservation as far as society.

425
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,280
That person is capable of anything. And where, where does that leave the kid?

426
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,000
And I think that it becomes doubly true of the person volunteer. Like if there's someone standing

427
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,120
next to you while you've got your baby and you're trying to like take care of something,

428
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,800
like if you need me to watch your kid for you while you go do that, I understand. It's like,

429
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,520
Oh no, you're going to take my baby. You're a baby taker voluntarily.

430
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,240
If someone offers that's no, that's unacceptable. I recently moved to a new city. I've joined a

431
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,600
popular dating website and have been meeting and getting it with a variety of interesting people.

432
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,760
I'm pretty sure dudes are attracted to my, I don't give a heck bad attitude.

433
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,400
Fantastic.

434
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,760
That's excellent. However, the two times I've gotten genuinely excited to meet someone,

435
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,800
I flubbed the first encounter with my nervousness and awkward conversation and then drunkenly texted

436
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,680
them apologies afterwards. Oops. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds like bad attitude. All right.

437
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,040
That's I don't give a heck bad attitude. You're capturing that spirit perfectly.

438
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,520
Oops. How do I learn to play it cooler in the face of serious relationship potential?

439
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,240
That's from old school crazy in Oregon.

440
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,040
So if I'm okay. So when they, when she doesn't care, she kills it. She does great.

441
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,920
And then when she actually cares, she's getting real uptight.

442
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,040
When she meets a nail clipper enthusiast,

443
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,280
who's going to make our fantasies come true. Someone who's got bad attitude with a capital

444
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,280
B. Just say Ty Pennington. Ty Pennington. So when you meet Ty Pennington, you get a little

445
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:31,600
bit awkward and then drunkenly text apologies, which in any circumstance ever is never a good

446
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:37,760
call. Never, never. Well, when you're drunk, texting anything to anyone for any reason is

447
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,600
a bad idea. Unless it's help. Unless it's whoops. I just, I like, yeah. Cause you're

448
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,440
compounding it at that point. If you have an awkward day, that's fine. If you text them

449
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,480
afterwards, like sorry, I was so weird. Then that's, you've just hit, you just took it to

450
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,120
the next level. Especially if you interpreted it as awkward, but they didn't. And they thought it

451
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,040
was like a perfectly good time. And then you're like, so, so I was so awkward. And they're like,

452
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,160
this person's crazy. Here's the reason you got to play a cool hot shot. Because if you do

453
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,040
apologize for acting weird, whether or not you acted weird, you've just ceded all the,

454
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,480
your territory in the relationship. Do you have already given your prospective future husband

455
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:25,360
the ball, as it were. It's in his corner now. So you can't ever apologize unless you've been

456
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:34,160
with someone for six years. Correct. Hold on. Yes. My wife and I haven't been together for six years.

457
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,760
Then you haven't hit that wall yet. Good. You haven't had to apologize yet, right?

458
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:47,680
Yes. So he said, I just hit six years and I had an apology that lasted 36 hours.

459
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm so, okay. If you're really excited about the date and you know that you have a tendency

460
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,800
towards like getting awkward in the conversation, why not pick a first date location that, that

461
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,960
inherently has something you could discuss about. So like go see a movie and then go to dinner

462
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,040
or go see a movie and then go to drink. So you can talk about movie or go to dinner somewhere,

463
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,080
like, you know, where they cook right there at the table or something interesting to talk about.

464
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,600
Shut up. Oh, wait, there's endless conference. Can you believe this beat? Can you believe the

465
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,320
steam? I did another cool thing with the knife. I was trying to think of a place. I was trying

466
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,760
to think of a place where they do something interesting, but wouldn't also be like terrifying

467
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,320
if it went bad. Oh, I hope he doesn't throw the shrimp at me. I don't know if I can catch the

468
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:50,080
shrimp. Oh no, here it comes. Oh, I did it. I'm really enjoying this date. You should try it too.

469
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:56,000
It's real fun. You get a little bit of shrimp grease on your chin, but otherwise it's a good time.

470
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:07,440
I love you. I love you, I think. I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this. And then they leave. Oh

471
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:16,080
God. What was that? What was I doing that whole time? I was doing a weird voice the whole time.

472
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,080
I've got to email them and say I'm sorry. I have to just shoot them a quick written

473
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:27,760
physical letter. Just a quick voicemail. Don't tell me not to do it chef at the table. I'm

474
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,760
doing it. I'm just going to leave five or six voicemails while you're sitting next to me.

475
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,160
Oh, hold on. Hey, I'm sorry I did a weird thing. God damn it.

476
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:46,000
The whole time you're just being pelted with shrimp. Pay attention. I'm throwing shrimp at you.

477
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,240
Just be confident in yourself and your abilities. Y'all want a Yahoo?

478
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:04,960
Yeah. This Yahoo is sent in by Ira Ray. Are you Ira Ray? Who wants to know? Thank you Ira Ray.

479
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user. They've been suspended. Fuck me. This is a blood bath this week.

480
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,760
They ask, would people eat less if air had a flavor?

481
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:29,760
Would people eat less if air had a flavor? Isn't this basically what vaping is? I guess so. But

482
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:42,720
imagine that everywhere. You walk into a room and you're like a cat. I have two questions. One,

483
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,080
does different air in different places have a different flavor? Yes. What a nightmare. I guess

484
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:54,480
air does have a flavor. Hold on. Let me think about that. Are you saying that maybe air has

485
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,640
had a pronounced flavor and you're just desensitized to it? No, I'm saying air probably has a very

486
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,920
subtle flavor. It tastes like air. Yeah. There's particles and atoms and molecules and shit. We're

487
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,840
tasting it. You're only ever tasting air. You're constantly tasting air. Right. That's what I'm

488
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:15,040
saying. I don't even recognize. The taste of air has become your de facto, there is no taste. I'm

489
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,680
not tasting it. Right. If we could morph it. If we could chop and screw that flavor. When you walk

490
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:28,880
into my house, baby back ribs, right? Because I love that song from the Chili's commercials.

491
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,680
But maybe I walk into Travis's house. That would also probably be ribs. No, I think garlic mashed

492
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,960
potatoes. Oh, God. I mean, that's a good thing to eat, but it's not a good thing to air taste. No,

493
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,800
but see, but that's the question. Does it smell like that? No. That would be the super fucked

494
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,200
up thing is that it wouldn't smell like taters. It would only taste like it. But smell is an

495
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,840
essential component of taste. The two would have to work in concert. You only think that because

496
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,080
Neil deGrasse Tyson told you that. Yeah, he's full of lies. It doesn't. I mean, maybe he's

497
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,640
not full of lies, but not everything is. He's not going to hit them all. You know, I'm saying

498
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,600
actually, I would probably be like something like a Skittle or a Mike and Ike. I feel like

499
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,400
most people would go sweet over savory. Yeah, I think so, too. But you don't want to like ruin.

500
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:20,640
And you don't want to ruin a meal if I forget to turn off the flavorizer in the room and then like

501
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,880
I serve up some lasagna, but I have the Skittle still going. That's going to be a bad eating

502
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,280
experience. Well, I mean, that's the question. Is it like uncontrollably smells like it tastes

503
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,400
like that? Or is it like you have a knob next to your thermostat that you turn up the flavorizer?

504
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,440
Oh, do you want to? You want a little bit more Mars bar? OK, OK. Oh, my God. Tom, wake up. Wake

505
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,360
up. Did we turn the flavorizer off? Oh, if we get home and our home really spaghetti,

506
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:55,760
you would open up the door and just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

507
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:09,920
it's so much spaghetti. I'm overwhelmed by the taste. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm not going to

508
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:17,120
be able to taste real spaghetti for a week. Eat the air. Eat the air as fast as you can.

509
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:24,880
Your way to the flavorizer. Oh, God. All the flavorizers are level two. Oh, Jesus. Invite

510
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,640
the neighborhood dogs in to eat some of the spaghetti. They would die. They would fucking die.

511
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:38,880
I'm going to stay at my mom's house. Tastes like split pea soup. Oh, Jesus. Would people eat less,

512
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,720
though? Probably not. You can't fucking stop us. No, if anything, they would eat more. Yeah.

513
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,160
Because they would be like, well, now I want spaghetti. Yeah. I actually do this to myself

514
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,200
with the sensi's all the time where I put in a nice berry tart. Yeah. Who's making berry tart?

515
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,360
No one is. Well, now I have to. And then you drink the liquid to get that flavor. It burns my tongue.

516
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,920
And then you poop a candle. Yeah. And that's how 50 Shades of Grey ends.

517
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:10,640
Uh, thank you so much for joining us for our comedy podcast. Uh, my brother,

00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:20,320
to MB and BAM. Um, happy birthday to our pop pop. Happy birthday, daddy. Happy birthday.

529
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,520
the long winters for the use of our theme song. It's a departure off the album, putting the days to

530
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,240
bed. I have a, um, to get my microphone up to like mouth level. I don't own like a mic stand. So what

531
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:36,800
I use is the, the box for, uh, one Christmas at a time, the John Roderick and Jonathan Colton

532
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,240
album. Right. Um, and so like the entire time I'm recording, I'm looking down at a cartoon

533
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:49,520
illustration of, of, of Joko and, uh, John Roderick, Joe Rowe. So it's like a guardian

534
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,560
angel watching over us, making the goofs happen. Uh, and we want to say thanks again to nature box

00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,960
on Monday. So okay. Let's say yes. You guys are fucking troopers. Yeah, man. Yeah.

552
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,880
What are the hells we're going to do? That's a good point. Should we mention that? Like,

553
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,800
once you guys have a baby, like we're going to go on a fucking freestyle jazz odyssey.

554
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,800
I don't know what's going to happen. Yeah. All right. It's going to be good. Our dad talking

555
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,960
for an hour. No, we're going to keep releasing stuff here on the bim bam, but it's going to be,

556
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,000
uh, outside the box. We're going to be thinking outside the bud.

557
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,640
Um, so yeah, look forward to it. Please look forward to it. Uh, anyway, that's, we're done.

558
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,000
We're done. Yeah, we're done. Thank you. Final Yahoo answer by Drew Davenport. Thank you,

559
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,960
Drew. It's by Yahoo answers user bulls cubs fan who asks, I think we've had a bulls cubs fan

560
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:28,400

563
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:04,080
Listener supported. Hi everybody. I'm Justin McElroy and I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy. Every Tuesday,

564
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,160
we bring you saw bones, a marital tour of misguided medicine, a show about all the dumb,

565
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,160
weird, terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years. You know,

566
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,440
some light summer listening. Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas or why we tried to eat

567
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,040
mummies for a while or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea. That and so

568
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:31,360
much more is waiting for you every Tuesday right here on the maximum fun network with saw bones,

569
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:55,360
a marital tour of misguided medicine.
