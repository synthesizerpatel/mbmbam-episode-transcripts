1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What day is it, son? Game day. Time to play until the whistle blows. This is the sage advice passed on by one Matthew McConaughey in the film We Are Martians.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's advice we try to live by every single day. It's my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What we do here is channel the wisdom of Matthew McConaughey and try to filter it to a form that is usable to you, the common man or woman.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What would you guys think of if when I edit the show this week, we just get like a constant like bongo beat going on underneath it?

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, like a really groovy, like a really chill.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Something you can really sack to.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, you can like, you can hear the spirit sort of welling up from the bongo tones.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I am so disgusted right now.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I can't even put it into words.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, instead of the bongos, I would be happy listening to 40 minutes of bongos, but let's instead not waste our talent.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's not keep our proverbial light under a bushel. Let's pass down some wisdom.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Our first question comes from FormSpring.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I proposed to my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and she said yes.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Congratulations.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I found out she's been texting one of her coworkers a lot lately.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
One of the texts said that he was watching a movie and he started thinking of her.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What do I do?

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
FormSpring, FormSpring, FormSpring.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay, I don't like the sound of it, but I also don't like the sound of you reading her text messages.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Can I, can I propose something?

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Griffin, I'm sorry to step on some toes here, but my advice is to pack your bags.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No, no, I'm with him on this one.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think you got to get out.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You don't trust her and she's in love with Jerry in Accounts Receivable.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You got to get out.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Listen, man, you both fucked up.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You both fucked up.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You fucked up.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You don't trust her.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She doesn't love you.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You fucked up.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She, you have a reason to not trust her because she's fucking Jerry in Accounts Receivable.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But this is the true test of love that everyone goes through after they propose to their significant other.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is that both of them get the jitters and one of them fucks someone they work with and one of them reads her text message, which isn't as bad a crime, I think.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, now, joking aside, because this is serious.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are, you are at a point in a marriage where it's possible that she is not regretting the decision to agree to marry you.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But maybe she's feeling a little spooked by it and she's getting a little flirty with Jerry.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And, you know, you are making a long term commitment to her and you're, you know, you're being kind of a jealous dude about it, like all completely natural emotions.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But here's the thing, like, if you are at this point in your relationship, like you're not even married yet, you have got to be able to talk to her.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like, you've got to be able to say, hey, just walk up to her, grab her shoulders and say, hey, I forgive you for fucking Jerry in Accounts Receivable and see what the reaction was.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Just start the conversation.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And fourth ring, I'm not trying to judge you, but this is like general advice for everyone.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If you propose to your girlfriend before you trust her enough to not cheat on you, you shouldn't have proposed to her yet.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Listen, that's in the past.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Look at Travis in the rear view.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm looking at the future.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm just saying, like, this is general advice for everyone from the future on.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That should be on your checklist before you pop that question.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I agree. I agree.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But what you're feeling is natural.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The thing is, if you get in that jealous mindset where, like, you think something's going on, that is something that your partner is not going to be able to talk you down from.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Like, they're not going to be able to say anything that will satisfy that.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You've got to let that go.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Like, if you want to talk to her about it, talk to her about it, but then seriously let it go because that kind of shit will haunt you forever.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Also, you're a guy, right?

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think so.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Think back for a second there, FormSpring.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You ever said some creepy stuff to a girl that's in a relationship?

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I bet you have.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you're a dude, I bet you said some creepy stuff to a girl who's engaged, married, or in a serious relationship, right?

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let him without sin.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, really.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Cast that first tone, FormSpring.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And honestly, the last thing you want to do is to go out to her and say, hey, I was reading your texts and blank.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I have another suggestion that's good for the economy, if you think about it.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's one industry that's been really suffering in these rough times.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oil.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It is the profession, the noble profession of the private investigator.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Whoa, yeah, get Keith Mars up on that bitch.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Get Keith or Veronica, if they're available.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Or Encyclopedia Brown.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Encyclopedia Brown, Nancy Drew, any of these fictional characters.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
See if they're available to just follow her around.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Guys, listen.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can't even say this, but I'll use pig Latin, so I know what I'm talking about.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What about a o-fessional-prey-assassin way?

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Listen, listen.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wassassin?

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, like with a vowel.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What is a wasassin?

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You got to add a W.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's French.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You got a W at the end of his vowel.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey, get a hitman.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hitman.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hitman.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hey, that's what we're talking about.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
To L.K. Airy J.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And then she'll run to you, she'll be so distraught, so despondent at the loss of her precious Jerry,

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that she'll never leave you again.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And at the funeral, at just one point, say really cryptically, well, that's what happens.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And then there's that.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you follow through with this plan, you delete this episode of My Bim Bam from your computer.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh my god.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So when the police read it, they'll be like, this is so weird.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There's no episode 22 in here.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We were really enjoying it.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It just skips 22.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, and make sure, make sure as you're driving away, you hand her a handy wipe.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And she'll look at you quizzically, and you say, oh, that's for the blood on your hands.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I hope the texts are worth it, creepo.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is from Clearly Not a Stalker, Gmail.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Huh, well.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Huh.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, good start.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I was recently in class, and I overheard a girl's name.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay?

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sounds pretty normal so far.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She looked cute, so I ascertained her last name by checking the roll online.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Then I proceeded to Google her and got information about her family and her brother and her birthday

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and everything.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My question is this.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Is asking about her family a good opener?

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Should I just straight up ask, how's James?

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I saw on Google he was sick.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Thanks.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't finish the question.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't do that.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't do that at all.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In fact, travel back in time and don't do all that shit you just told us you did.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What's more important is go back in time and not send us that question.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Listen, you can't, you can't ever be with her now.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have got to bail on this.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're done with this.

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You mess this one up.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You get married.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You got toddlers running around on the floor, and you look at her and you say, hey, hey, babe.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I know we've had a long, happy decade together.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I just want to tell you that I started our relationship by creepy.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You remember Google that used to be on the Internet?

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You remember the Internet?

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It used to be before you all had implants.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I googled you before the cybernet, before Skynet.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I googled you and your whole family.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay, here's my advice.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Go to a novelty store and buy a Jordan visor and then run up to her and tell her that you're her grandson from the future.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Come back and use all that information to convince her that you are her grandson from the future.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I am a big fan.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wow, you guys have a complete 180.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I am a huge fan of everything that has happened so far.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Clearly not a stalker.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The Geordie contingent, let's call it.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If you employ the Geordie contingent, I think that there's a really great chance that you could have the love of your life in your hands.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh, and then convince her that you're your own grandfather.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, that's good.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why don't we just cut out the middleman and actually hire LeVar Burton to put on the Geordie visor, come to your school and say that he is your great grandson from the future.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sure he is not busy.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you could probably lock him down.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And if you're a white person clearly not a stalker, it'll show like you're super open minded.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're down for anything.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You don't care.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You don't see race.

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And that's something people are looking for in a stalker.

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I mean potential partner, not a stalker at all.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
From the future.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Jay, oh Griffin, do you have a Yahoo for us?

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, let me bust out a Yahoo.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This one was sent in by, see this one's more of an in the show question.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How about, this one's from Wax Catharsis who sent this in via Twitter.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Fan of the show Wax Catharsis.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you Wax Catharsis.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But it's by Yahoo Answers user I Am Life who asks,

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How can a person live young forever in this body?

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Is it possible for a person to live forever young in this body?

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We have been programmed to died.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We purchased gravesite plot and life insurance.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So is it possible for a person to deprogram themselves to live instead of dying?

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Whoa.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm glad someone finally cleared away the mist.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You know what I mean?

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, right.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Cut right through the BS.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Every time I go to a funeral, I just look at them and think, oh, you.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You dummy.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You cog in the machine doing exactly what the man tells you to do.

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Everyone knows that death is just a creation of big funeral home.

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah.

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And big funeral home.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Big funeral.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There's a really depressing answer on this which says,

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the inevitability of death is what gives us a reason to live.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Immortality would never work.

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You know who you're going to live.

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You know you're going to live forever.

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So who cares?

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The population would fall into a depression.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know what?

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Everyone says that.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I completely disagree.

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If I live forever, it would be awesome.

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It would be a nonstop 24 seven party into infinity.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I think I could probably figure out something to do.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Uh huh.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I mean, I know, right?

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Like, I would just start walking.

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And like, where are you going?

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Like, I don't know.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have forever.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not afraid of dying though.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Because it's not going to happen.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It would make bad plastic surgery really regrettable though.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh yeah.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's true.

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Also tattoos.

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tattoos.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You would need it around your 48,000th birthday.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think it would also allow us to complete a bunch of projects that you like didn't get

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
around to.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Like, you know, living in space.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I just want to program myself to live until the first time that I use a jetpack.

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like, if I have a jetpack, I'll probably try to fly that bitch into the sun.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Because it's not going to get better than that.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's really where humanity is going to peak.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What's troubling about this question is the terminology that we have been programmed to

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
dyed.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Is there like a, is that an outpatient procedure I don't know about where like a doctor can

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
just cut you open and like hook this vein up to this artery and then mix these nerves

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and then what's up?

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm the Highlander now.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Except what if, what if the person who wrote this is not quite human?

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If you catch my drift, bicentennial man anyone?

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He only wants to be a human so that he can bone down on that one chick from that one

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
show or movie.

238
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
His love is real, but he is not.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, I was going to say his love is real, but his understanding of grammar is not.

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Damn it.

241
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Damn it.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Stupid AI jokes.

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hi, guys.

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hello, James.

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Recently, school has started back up and my English teacher from last year contacted me

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
saying, I had the most improvement between the last two quarters.

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
God, I thought this email was going to take a sexy turn for a second.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I got all excited.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
As such, she wishes for me to choose a book by Friday for her to buy and add to her class

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
library.

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay, maybe it is.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He's turning around again.

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Last year, she had really boring cookie cutter books all year, so I want to recommend something

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
interesting and appealing that a student would otherwise not find or read.

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I also wanted it to be something keyed into the nerd mindset without being deluded or

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
corny.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I've come up stumped and wished for some McLarevoyant help.

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
All right.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll allow it.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What do you guys recommend?

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
With befuddlement, James from MA.

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What about the secret?

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You want to set those kids on the right path.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You want to get them thinking in a mindset that's going to equate with success and get

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
rid of some of the demons that have been tormenting them.

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What about Dianetics?

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
James, Dianetics.

268
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's my official recommendation.

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think that there's a vein we can tap into of books that will somehow create a sexual

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
rendezvous with your teacher.

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Books that will somehow suggest like, hey, if you're down, I'm down, but none are escaping

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
me.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Is there a book out there?

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is there a book out there that said, hey, teach, if you're down, I'm down?

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Lolita for dudes.

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Lolita for dudes.

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Lolita.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Lolita.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What about a novelization of the film The Graduate?

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
See, that's not a teacher as much as it is just a foxy older lady.

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
My suggestion is this what Tuesdays with Mori was about?

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I didn't read it.

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, but it is what Mitch Albom's One More Day was about.

284
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay.

285
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, I get his books confused.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The ones are about getting wisdom from the elderly and the ones are about boning down

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
with your teacher.

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's Tuesdays with Wanda.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, there's some that are about just having conversations with his dead journalism professors

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and then there are some where he fucks older teachers.

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And there are crossover books that-

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The crossover books are in poor taste, Mitch Albom.

293
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You need to get it together, sir.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Stupid Mitch.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What an asshole.

296
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I recommend The Alphabet of Manliness by Maddox.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No way.

299
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
My terrible secret is that I haven't read a book in about five years.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Whoa.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Sleep tight.

302
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Sleep tight, people who are taking advice from us.

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How about The Stand since I've been working on that one for about two and a half years

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
now?

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
See, I was going to say Dune.

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Dune?

307
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Travis?

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Guys, Griffin came and visited me like two weeks ago and he said, I haven't read The

310
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Stand.

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I got like 50 pages left.

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah.

313
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I haven't picked it up for about three weeks.

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What are you doing?

315
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I got about 40 pages left now.

316
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I knocked out 10 the other day.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I just went out on the porch for about six minutes.

318
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah.

319
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You need to maybe start – you need to get more regular if that's all the reading you're

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
doing.

321
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Maybe.

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Maybe that's the problem.

323
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey.

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Hey.

325
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My bim bam.

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
My friends are 21-ish and still think going to the mall like a bunch of girls is still

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
fun.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's sexist.

329
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Are they girls?

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
How do I get them to stop being so lame, turn that mall time into bar time?

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Thanks, Steve.

333
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, that's easy.

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
By turning – you got to turn your friends into other friends.

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Can I try that ending again?

336
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Thanks, Steve.

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sorry.

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Turn your friends into other friends.

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I like that.

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You could go to the – we have a place in the Huntington Mall Club, Block and Barrel

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
or something where it's like a bar within the mall.

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I like that.

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Go to a mall bar.

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I think there are two answers to this question.

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There's one answer and one observation.

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:26,640
The answer is to get them in the mindset that a bar is basically a mall for booze, for spirits.

348
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
It's like a beer mall.

349
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
It's like a beer mall basically.

350
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, not all are beer malls.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,440
Some of them are like shitty beer strip malls where they only have Miller Lite and –

352
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,000
And some of them are strip beer malls, which is a whole other thing.

353
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,200
But the other way of looking at it is you have a problem, which is maybe they do go

354
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:59,400
to the bar with you a normal amount, but you don't want to go to the mall with them because

355
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,360
they don't serve liquor there.

356
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,960
I picture this awesome 1980s movie kind of situation where you're like, hey guys, let's

357
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,520
go to a bar and all your friends kind of look at each other and smile and go, man, it's

358
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,880
not bar time.

359
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:20,220
And then in unison say, it's mall time and then cuts to a montage of them doing jumping

360
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,040
jacks in the mall and stuff.

361
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,520
But the whole time you're freaking out.

362
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,980
You're just having a panic attack because you want to be in the corner.

363
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,560
You go drive your car into a house.

364
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,720
Jeremy, what are we doing this afternoon?

365
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, I got to go pick up a gift for my meemaw at the Crate and Barrel.

366
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Ah, fuck that.

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Let's get drunk.

368
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Fuck that noise.

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I need some cargo.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's noon on Tuesday.

371
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,360
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

372
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,120
The mall closes at nine.

373
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
What are you doing?

374
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,280
Like, how could you not work these two things out together?

375
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,680
Like, how could you not work this out?

376
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,000
Like, well, the mall is closed now, time to go to a bar.

377
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,760
If you're in the back of the Hot Topic hiding behind the corset, sneaking a drink from your

378
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,920
flask, your friends are doing you a disservice from not tackling you and ripping the aboos

379
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
out of your hand.

380
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,960
Hey, guys, is it bar time?

381
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,880
No, Steve, it's funeral time.

382
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,680
I want to put beer in my face.

383
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm 21.

384
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,400
I already have a problem.

385
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
Oh, God.

386
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm headed to university on the 26th.

387
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Speak English, motherfucker.

388
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Whoa.

389
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,880
And the word, Amy, is college.

390
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,780
I'm headed to university on the 26th, and I wondered if you guys had any tips for introducing

391
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,000
myself to those who will be living on the same floor of my student accommodation block.

392
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm usually rather shy when it comes to meeting new people.

393
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,400
Before I would get my friends to do all the hard work and let the new person be introduced

394
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,180
to me in conversation, however, my friends are spreading out, heading to different universities,

395
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,920
and I'll be on my lonesome.

396
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,600
What's the best way to build up the confidence to say hi to someone new?

397
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,680
Or would you recommend me doing the opposite, play some music on my laptop, then hope and

398
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,600
pray someone will dig my taste in tunes, which is very broad, to act as a conversation starter?

399
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
No.

400
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Don't do that, Richard.

401
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Don't do that.

402
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,720
Hey, who's that guy that's always playing music from his laptop with his door open and

403
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
looking expectantly outside?

404
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,520
With a bowl of chips and a couple of open beers.

405
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
That's weird, Richard.

406
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
No one goes in his room.

407
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Don't go in there.

408
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,880
He's always talking about deep Dave Matthews band cuts to nobody.

409
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
He's just yelling it into the hallway.

410
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,560
If anybody wants to talk about music, I'll be in here.

411
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,760
He calls his room the boneyard.

412
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,160
There's a B-side to under the table and dreaming.

413
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Deep cut.

414
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,480
I went out to the boneyard and got this deep cut.

415
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,520
Richard, real answer is everyone else is feeling the exact same way that you are.

416
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,120
You can set yourself up as the cool guy just by walking up to people and introducing yourself,

417
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,120
because they want to be introduced to you just as bad as you want to be introduced to

418
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
them.

419
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
You've got to get in the mindset.

420
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,520
You've got to pretend when you get there day one that you've already made five friends.

421
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,680
Act like a guy who's already made five friends there, because then you won't come off as

422
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,400
desperate and you'll have the confidence to really talk with people.

423
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,520
Also, a great thing to have in your room, Goldeneye.

424
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
That's what I was going to say.

425
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Set up a Goldeneye tournament.

426
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I knew Travis was going to turn him in that vein.

427
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,120
Put Goldeneye in your dorm room.

428
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,920
I went one step further and I took my N64 to the common room and hooked it up to the

429
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,360
TV and started playing.

430
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
People filtered in.

431
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,080
They were like, oh, what's this?

432
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,160
Also start a poker night.

433
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Poker night would be good, too.

434
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Yeah.

435
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,480
Something that people want to get into and try, and it's a good way to meet people.

436
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:44,120
There's also, Richard, a ton of... Any university is going to have a ton of clubs and stuff

437
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
like that.

438
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,640
The people on your floor, they'll be good as starters, but college is so broad and so

439
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,760
much broader than high school, which you're used to, that you are going to make general

440
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,760
friends there, but you're going to want to specify a little bit when you're making your

441
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,800
lifelong college friends.

442
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,360
The people on your dorm are just geographically close.

443
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:13,080
The people who you meet in music club for fans of Dave Matthews Band Cuts, they're going

444
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,200
to be people who really share your interests and better friends.

445
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,000
You said clubs, which made me think of nightclubs, which sent me down this vein that I really

446
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,040
think you could get into.

447
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:32,240
It would require a bit of an investment, maybe a $200 investment, but go out and buy a whole

448
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:42,640
bunch of fancy liquors, like a gin or a scotch or a scotchka, and then you arrange them in

449
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,560
your room, like a bar, and you could turn your dorm room into a speakeasy.

450
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,560
That's actually a pretty good idea, actually.

451
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,840
That's actually a good way to get out of going to college, if you wanted to be a short stag,

452
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,480
because you will be asked to leave.

453
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,160
No, if he's at university and he's in some Britain country where they can drink all the

454
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
time.

455
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,800
The drinking age there is four in a beer garden.

456
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,840
You can be a beer gardener at four years old.

457
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,400
Some kids are born in beer gardens.

458
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,720
Hey, get that toddler a brewski.

459
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,520
I want to have an underwater birth at a beer garden.

460
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,080
I would like to be born into a vat of fresh penis.

461
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
I hate to bring it.

462
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
It's a little bit late.

463
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Yeah.

464
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Damn it.

465
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,240
What's the best way to get over a girl you're madly in love with and one day her feelings

466
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,800
just changed and she needed a break?

467
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm hurting, bim bam.

468
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Help me.

469
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
This is from Dex, Gmail, Griffin.

470
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
You know what he needs to do.

471
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,520
You have come to the right place.

472
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,280
Well, the obvious answer is pack up those bags and get out of town.

473
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,200
You had a good run, but it's all over now.

474
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,400
The other thing you can do is surround yourself with dudes, which again, you've come to the

475
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,120
right place because the three of us will just rail on that girl.

476
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:06,880
Just that bitch, that awful, mean, I'm not the right person for this, but go find your

477
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
bros.

478
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Wait, wait, wait.

479
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
What if what if he introduced her to the show while they were together?

480
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
We don't really mean it.

481
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Fuck.

482
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
No, we didn't mean to go.

483
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
He's here.

484
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Listen up.

485
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
He's her.

486
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Hey, hey, he's hurting girl.

487
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
You know it is.

488
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
No, you know what?

489
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm taking sides.

490
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Oh, wow.

491
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Right.

492
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Listen, you broke his.

493
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,200
You done broke his heart and you should feel terrible about it.

494
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Dex taking her side.

495
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Taking her side.

496
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
No, I'm taking Dex's.

497
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Not good enough for you, girl.

498
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I'm taking her side.

499
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm going to say I will stay neutral here and say you guys should maybe talk it out.

500
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,880
See if there's still a spark there.

501
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Justin.

502
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
All right.

503
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Let's talk it out.

504
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Her feelings are changed.

505
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Listen, listen.

506
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
My feelings have changed.

507
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,440
We had a good run together, but now I'm looking to move on.

508
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,520
I want to fuck Jerry and accounts receivable.

509
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Griffin.

510
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
Listen, he is all over the place.

511
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,760
I'm the only one who can give you what you want, what you need, what you have to have,

512
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
what you got to get.

513
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,880
It's not there.

514
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
I cannot.

515
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I can't.

516
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I got to feel.

517
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Let's stay positive.

518
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,360
Let's stay positive here.

519
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,520
Griffin, go.

520
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,000
Let's let's let's take a five minute recess.

521
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,400
OK, but I want to come back to this.

522
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,880
I don't want to just shut it out, just like everything else.

523
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,840
Why did you never open up to me, Dex, Dex?

524
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,560
I feel like we've made a lot of good progress here.

525
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,800
You've got to open up to her, Dex.

526
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
You got to.

527
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,440
You've got to open up as you're packing your bags.

528
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
And can I know?

529
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Let her go.

530
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Let her go.

531
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Don't open up to her.

532
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Let her go.

533
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
It's over.

534
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Get away.

535
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Get away real quick.

536
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm packing.

537
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I'm moving away forever.

538
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,920
I want to open up while closing this box.

539
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Toss it all.

540
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Toss your cares.

541
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,960
Toss your worries and your woes into that big black Samsonite.

542
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,140
You are done.

543
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,000
We get a lot of questions.

544
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Your name is Dex.

545
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,760
You can fuck anybody you want whenever you want.

546
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Dex.

547
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,940
The the the answer to this question is really cliche, but unfortunately it's time.

548
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,960
It's time and getting lots of strange.

549
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,560
Whoa, I'm half with you.

550
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,520
Which I really, I really miss my old girlfriend and I have a VD.

551
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
I don't feel better.

552
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,680
I do not miss my untainted penis.

553
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,960
I miss my untainted.

554
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,520
OK, then let's do anything but don't sleep with lots of women, but get flirted with by

555
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
lots of women.

556
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,960
Flirt with lots of women.

557
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,560
Just get the attention of other women until you feel happy and desirable again.

558
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,000
Hey, this is this is an interesting coincidence.

559
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,360
This is from Gmail.

560
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,440
There's this guy at work that was just really nice and now he's become my occupational stalker.

561
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,760
I'm a secretary and I sent out mass emails to our floor.

562
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,320
He always respond replies with personal suggestive replies.

563
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,280
I'm married and I don't want to embarrass him.

564
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,320
Plus it's not quite sexual harassment.

565
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,780
It's just flirty old man creepy.

566
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:00,720
How do I make him stop emailing me weird messages?

567
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
You got to forward it.

568
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,360
You got to forward his responses.

569
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,640
And then and then when he gets uncomfortable, say, oh, I thought you were joking.

570
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Yeah.

571
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,240
Just, yeah, you got to you got to forward them.

572
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,780
Or you could do something where like.

573
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:25,760
You accidentally reply all to one of the emails that he sends you and just say, like, listen,

574
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
creep.

575
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
I'm not interested.

576
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,680
And he'll be so ashamed that he may have to kill himself.

577
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
That's really the end game.

578
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:40,120
Kind of a scorched earth policy that you're off of stalking.

579
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,160
Yeah, I don't I've never worked in an office before.

580
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,680
Sometimes sometimes Justin sends me weird emails, but I keep those and keep those locked

581
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
away.

582
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,080
Just tell him it's really sad.

583
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
That's the best thing you do.

584
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,000
If you say no, then it's like you're playing a game.

585
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,160
But if you're like, I this is honestly kind of depresses me when you send these because

586
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,920
there's it's so out of the realm of possibility that I would ever look at you with anything

587
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,720
other than contempt and just make him feel really ashamed of himself.

588
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,460
You know what I mean?

589
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Is he rich?

590
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,920
You're his grandson from the future.

591
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,360
This is Travis's do pack your bags and move away.

592
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Yeah, I like it.

593
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,200
I think it can be applied to many situations.

594
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,640
Because here's the thing, even if he knows that it's blatantly not true.

595
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
What?

596
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,680
No, I think it's a lady.

597
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Okay.

598
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,840
It says secretary and have you ever heard of something so farcical and ridiculous as

599
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,000
a male secretary?

600
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Get real.

601
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Okay.

602
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
Hey, here's a pretty smooth transition.

603
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,680
Here's a Yahoo Answers question that was sent in by Eric near.

604
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,260
Thank you, Eric near.

605
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:54,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ben Edwards, who asks, I think so he's not positive, but he

606
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,720
thinks that he is in love with a goose.

607
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,880
What should he do?

608
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,600
You know what it is?

609
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,880
It's that fucking neck man.

610
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Oh my god.

611
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
But couldn't it swallow?

612
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Right?

613
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,720
Well, I mean, I'm not even talking about the length.

614
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,280
I'm talking about the elegant curvature.

615
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Oh my god.

616
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,800
Look, which is it's like exactly what I have is that elegant curvature or it would work

617
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,840
out really well.

618
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,680
It's like a mysterious sexy question mark.

619
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,040
Hey, I'll tell you what you need to do.

620
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,560
Can you reread the question, Griffin?

621
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Sure.

622
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
I think.

623
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Okay.

624
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,040
Here's our operative word here.

625
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,400
Here's what you do.

626
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,760
You need to shore this shit up and figure out if you're in love with a goose.

627
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,800
Take a long look in the deep, dark, truthful mirror and think about whether or not you

628
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,280
want to stick that goose's beak in your butthole.

629
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,260
Do you want to fuck a goose or not?

630
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,920
This is not something you're equivocal on.

631
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,280
It's something you know.

632
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Do you want to fuck the goose?

633
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I'm up now.

634
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Yes or no?

635
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm on the fence on my position on goose fucking.

636
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Okay.

637
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
No, wait.

638
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
No, we don't know.

639
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
He wants to fuck it.

640
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,720
He may just want to be in love with the goose.

641
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,000
There's lots of different love.

642
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
There's lots of different love.

643
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's so true, Travis.

644
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Maybe such a good point.

645
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Maybe he just wants to adopt the goose.

646
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
One of those types is goose love.

647
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Maybe he just wants to adopt the goose.

648
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Have a goose baby.

649
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The thing is he dreams about it all the time.

650
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,520
He dreams about it all the time.

651
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,240
So what is he dreaming about it?

652
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,760
Like he's going antique shopping at flea markets with his love goose?

653
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Yeah.

654
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Okay.

655
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Yeah.

656
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
This is fine.

658
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Give him a little suit.

659
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
I mean, it's not fine.

660
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
It's not fine, Justin.

661
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
It's not fine.

662
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
He's talking about a goose.

663
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
By the way, side note.

664
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,920
The guy who wrote in asking for names for his band, Love Goose, is an awesome name.

665
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,360
You can put a little Jordy LaForge visor on it and say it's your goose son for the

666
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
future.

667
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Well, that one didn't work quite so well.

668
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
It works for me.

669
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,880
It works for me.

670
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,840
He comes from a weird Island of Dr. Moreau-esque future where man-animal hybrids are the same.

671
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,360
He has the brain of a man or a woman, if you don't want to be gay.

672
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,040
A gay goose lover is the worst.

673
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,360
I want a hetero goose lover.

674
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
He's only into lady goose.

675
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Hey, I'm no weirdo.

676
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,960
I'm going to fuck a lady goose.

677
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm not an aberration to God.

678
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,040
What kind of deviant shit do you think I'm into?

679
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,360
I only fuck female gooses.

680
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Geeses.

681
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Geese.

682
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Geese.

683
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
No homo or nothing.

684
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,440
I just want a fucking goose.

685
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,840
I just like to fuck a goose down there.

686
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,120
I like to kick back with a cold brew and fuck a goose.

687
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,200
Just chill out, watch a game, eat some coin chips, and fuck my goose.

688
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,280
It's been a long, hard day at work.

689
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,920
Time for some good old-fashioned goose fucking.

690
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,840
I say, goose, get back in the kitchen and finish making dinner, and the goose is like,

691
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I'm a goose.

692
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,840
I can't even get to the counter.

693
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,680
The only recipe I know is seeds.

694
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Goose.

695
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Goose, where's all my bread?

696
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,240
Ah, you ate it again.

697
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Get over here.

698
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
I'm going to fuck you.

699
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,800
Goose, I told you not to eat that bowl of Sun Chips we left out, that's for guests.

700
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,200
Goose, quit walking in a line with other geese.

701
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Get over here.

702
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
I'm trying to fuck.

703
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Get over here.

704
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
You're mine.

705
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
I lost you.

706
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,520
I'm in love with one of you, I'm going to have to fuck all of you to figure out which

707
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
one.

708
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Oh no.

709
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Oh god.

710
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm just sick of the neighborhood kids spray-painting goose fucker on my porch.

711
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,800
Well, I wouldn't mind if they would stop writing gay goose fucker.

712
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Don't they get it?

713
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Let's be clear.

714
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:29,720
Listen, I'm at church every day with my goose wife in a dress next to me while the

715
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
reverend preaches.

716
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,080
I can't listen that close because all I can think about is how bad I want to get down

717
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
on this goose.

718
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,600
It's Adam and geese, not Adam and Steve.

719
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,160
Okay, that's it, the show is about to be over.

720
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,080
That has to be where we start the show.

721
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,200
We have to draw the line unless we draw it there.

722
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Few housekeeping notes before we hear Griffin's last question.

723
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:02,640
It's always great to have your support, it's great to have you listening, we super, super

724
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,960
appreciate it.

725
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,720
Everything you need to know if you want to ask a question is on nbnbam.com.

726
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,000
There are still t-shirts, we would love it if you wanted to wear that.

727
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,280
And if you've already got one, send us, I want like more pictures, we're going to try

728
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,520
to get together a gallery to host on the website.

729
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,400
So if you've got pictures of you wearing a My Brother, My Brother, Me shirt in a funny

730
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,920
locale or you put it on a baby, we love everything like that so send those to us.

731
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Also we're instituting a new program this week.

732
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,840
We got the idea from our buddy Jeff Monolog and he had a party, a MBMBAM party and we

733
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:54,200
recorded a little special message to them and this is an offer we'd like to extend to

734
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
everyone.

735
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,440
So if you are having a party for My Brother, My Brother, Me, a My Brother, My Brother,

736
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,920
Me listening party, we will let us know ahead of time, we'll record a special greeting just

737
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
for you.

738
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,440
It has, let's see, what's a party?

739
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,640
We need some parameters, yeah, because it can't just be you invite Rosie over to your

740
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
cubicle to listen.

741
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:24,040
The Bible says anytime two or more are gathered in my name, I'll be there too, that's God.

742
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,360
We're bigger than the Beatles.

743
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
The Beatles are bigger than Jesus.

744
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Is Jesus bigger than God?

745
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
Five people.

746
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Yeah.

747
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Sam's gonna say four.

748
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
Five.

749
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
No, I think four is a good number.

750
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
I think four is around four.

751
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
No, five.

752
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
One is the host, four guests.

753
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Okay.

754
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
No, no, no.

755
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,800
I don't think that's gonna, I don't think it's gonna happen.

756
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,000
I think it's gonna be three people who listen to the show who invite their one friend over.

757
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,480
Okay, we'll do four, we'll say four.

758
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,700
Four people and let us know, you know, names or whatever, you can email that to us and the

759
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,440
only thing we ask is afterwards, we're gonna need a picture.

760
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,240
Pics or it didn't happen.

761
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Pics or it didn't happen.

762
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,160
Gotta have something of bim bam in there.

763
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,120
And if you can, invite somebody new into the fold.

764
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,520
Yeah, right, right, right.

765
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
That's the idea.

766
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,700
I mean, it's absolutely, it's crazy.

767
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:15,680
It's absolutely insane that people are having parties that are centered around us talking

768
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
for 40 minutes.

769
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,760
That's completely bananas to me already, but.

770
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,280
That's how every party I go to ends up.

771
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,120
Try and get some new people, even if you don't have a party, just try and get some new people

772
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,120
on the show cause we don't, we don't have any way of getting new, new people on board

773
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
other than Jeff.

774
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,160
Mod Locks, uh, weekly move in, bam, listening party is blowing up.

775
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:44,360
He's got seven guests, Brendan, Henry, Zach, David, Jeff, Michael, Robbie, huge party.

776
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,120
As long as you keep inviting me, I'm going to keep saying maybe.

777
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,600
So feel free to use that.

778
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,440
So, so yeah, send that to us and uh, you know what we'll do.

779
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,440
We'll put something on the, on the website or on the Facebook that has the, the dates.

780
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,560
Um, if you want to get down on this program, I want to throw out a couple of Twitter shout

781
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,820
outs for people that have been pimping the show.

782
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:10,160
First of all, um, anyone who's looking for new and interesting people to follow on Twitter,

783
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,840
search hashtag MB, MB, AM, and then follow every single person that mentions the show.

784
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,600
Uh, but some, it's a community, some specific people.

785
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,240
Uh, of course I want to think Brent O'Floss, uh, you follow Fridays, that's every Friday.

786
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,400
He's a great guy.

787
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,760
Um, Matthew Vose, um, talking about the week re-energizing us.

788
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,520
Um, Hill Thins, H I L T H E N S, um, big fan of the show, Atomic Fox.

789
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,880
I want to throw that out just because he just realized that there's a connection between

790
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,360
joystick and MB, MB, AM.

791
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
What is it?

792
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,640
I, I don't know what it is, but he's keeping it to himself.

793
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,080
Um, office of nature, uh, not only talked about my bim bam, but try to get son of buzzo

794
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
on board.

795
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
I don't know.

796
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Now, whenever I see someone asking, yeah, you got to spread the, gotta get that follow

797
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
up.

798
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Yeah.

799
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
You got to jump them.

800
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
You just got to hook them up.

801
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,960
Um, so go to our website, mobimbam.com or mbmbam.com.

802
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,680
It's got all of our contact information, uh, email us at mbmbam at gmail.com.

803
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,560
We read every single email, um, even if we don't get to them on the show, we are, the

804
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,120
number of emails is increasing exponentially every week.

805
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,280
Um, so if we don't get to it, uh, we apologize, but we do read them, uh, and, and your, your

806
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,160
problems are in our thoughts.

807
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,960
If you email us about a listening party, make sure you put in bmbam listening party in the,

808
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,160
in the, in the headlines would make sure to see it.

809
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,500
And we got some more voicemails this week.

810
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
We did.

811
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
We got a bunch.

812
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,860
Uh, they were a little long.

813
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,920
They were, uh, in like the three minute range.

814
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,760
Most of them, which are cool to listen to, but, um, it's hard to turn into a question

815
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
on the show.

816
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,640
So, so if you can try and try and keep it brief, unless you don't want a question on

817
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,880
the show, unless you just want to chat to our voicemail, uh, that that number is 203,

818
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,040
um, a bmbam one or two zero three M B M B A M one.

819
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
Um, and that's it.

820
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
So that's it.

821
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Uh, Griffin.

822
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,120
May I hear that last question?

823
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,400
Uh, sure.

824
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,600
This one was sent in by Mr. Baseball 3030.

825
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Thank you.

826
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Wow.

827
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
That's already a really good name.

828
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Thank you.

829
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Mr. Baseball 3030.

830
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:30,320
Uh, Yahoo answers user dead Barbie asks, what are the benefits of circumcising a hamster?

831
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,800
I think that's obvious.

832
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,120
I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy.

833
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:46,720
This has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad, swear on the lips.

00:38:46,720 --> 00:39:14,160
You will never know me.
