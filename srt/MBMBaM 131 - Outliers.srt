1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:48,080
Welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,920
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and I'm doing this one shirtless.

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm wearing multiple shirts to make up for that fact.

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:09,680
I am your baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and I am talking to you with my wiener.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,120
Ladies and gentlemen.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,880
You're not curious about that at all. You're already moving on. You don't want to know how

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
it's working.

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,040
I don't want to think about it.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,160
Is it like a ventriloquist, puppetry of the penis kind of thing?

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,600
I can't do this with you.

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,920
It's sort of, it is sort of puppetry of the penis. Yes, Travis, except it's very,

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,400
it's a very literal translation of that idea. Let's just say I've been working on my urethra

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
control. Justin, you want to keep going or?

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I'm just gonna, okay.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,960
Ladies, let me paint you a picture.

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,400
I have just arrived from the shower. I've got my two tight Levi's on.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,880
My hair is still dripping wet.

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,040
Uh, do you guys, you guys know Joe Mangliano, the, uh, the, the werewolf from True Blood?

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
Are you talking about this?

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
Imagine, imagine him, except now imagine Joe Pantliano from The Matrix.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,680
That's what you're getting right now.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,280
Or perhaps actress Tea Eliano.

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,320
Or perhaps Chuck Mangione.

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,240
Imagine Luigi and Mario.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,000
Combined into one horrible person.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,760
Just arms and legs and mustaches everywhere. That's me right now.

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
This is an advice show for the modern era where we take your quandaries

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,880
and we turn them alchemy-like into, into wisdom and knowledge and, and I think growth.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,720
I think that's really our, our sort of focus has been in 2012 is growth.

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,120
I want everyone to better themselves and I want to be the vehicle upon which

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
you ride to betterness town.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,960
We want to be the hoverboard that you take to better city.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
That was the, uh, that was actually the title of Joel Osteen's last book.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
What's the hoverboard you take to-

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,600
Don't get fucking brainy with us trying to say names that you think people know.

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
No, he's the religious guy.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,640
He's the, he's the mega preacher.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,320
So is he, oh, so he's like the, the religious version of like Malcolm Gladwell or-

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,520
No, he's the religious version of Tony Robbins, basically.

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Tony Robbins is, is anti-religion?

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,720
No, Tony Robbins teaches you to believe in yourself.

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
And Joel Osteen teaches you that God believes enough for the both of you.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,960
There's a tiny God inside of you that you should also believe in.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,920
Does he have giant teeth?

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
They all do.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,920
You really can't be a leader of men without big, big chompers.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
That is leadership.

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,880
I'm surprised that we, the vehicle that we used to start the show wasn't my recent engagement.

53
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,400
It's not like I get that it's like already old news, I guess, for you guys.

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
Well, you were keeping, I thought you were keeping it like a secret.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
I mean, like you haven't gotten it to social media.

56
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,400
Well, just because I haven't tweet blasted it,

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,520
you think I'm fucking ashamed of my, of my new bride-to-be?

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,400
You're saying this is an exclusive for NBNB AM listeners.

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,320
Oh, we're dropping this bomb.

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Sorry, ladies.

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,160
Heart's broken.

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,200
Sorry, ladies.

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,880
The whole crew is taken.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,200
And suddenly a gasp went out from across the land.

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
Sorry, ladies and so inclined dudes.

66
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,960
Well, there's more than a few.

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,440
And over affectionate dogs.

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,040
Well, I'll take it where I can get it, I guess.

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,680
Are you saying what I think you're saying, Travis?

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
Listen, dogs won't fuck this.

71
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,120
I can't say, I can't like, I am flattered.

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
That's all I'm going to say about the matter is that I'm flattered.

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,120
But no, but I can't anymore.

74
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,920
Legally, I legally can't or else she will take me.

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,200
She will take everything.

76
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,000
You've built something.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,280
You're trying to build something.

78
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,840
We're trying to build something.

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,920
I told you not to sign that pre preenup.

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Yeah, it's a pre pre.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
And it is, let's just say, it does not favor this guy.

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,120
Let's just say, if shit go rough, I'm going to need a place to crash for a while.

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,320
I got a fruit on, so.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,160
Pardon?

85
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
You know you're going to have to explain what that is, right?

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,760
Like, why did you even pause?

87
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,200
It's a fruit on that I left an apple on for you to eat.

88
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
So there's literally fruit on it.

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,240
Continental breakfast, baby.

90
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
If you're good, you get a croissant there.

91
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
Where?

92
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,760
We're registered at Bath and Body Works, if you want to.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,480
Just Bath and Body Works?

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
Just Bath and Body Works, yeah.

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Both of our skin is just so fucking ashy.

96
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,560
Like, we need it.

97
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
You should have gone to Bed and Breakfast and Bath and Body Works and beyond.

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,480
The quint.

99
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,440
The quintuple, big.

100
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,240
You should have gone to Better Business Bureau, Bed Bath Works and beyond.

101
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,280
I had all these goos prepared to talk about it.

102
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,520
Like, how I proposed to her by firing her ring at her from a t-shirt cannon.

103
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,960
She was tragically killed, and now she's on the mark again.

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,280
I had to dig it out of her arm, but it was very romantic after that.

105
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
After that one hiccup.

106
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
I feel like this is going to be a really good one.

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,680
I think shirt, maybe I've been, by doing it shirted for so long,

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,160
that I've been hiding my lighter under a bushel a little bit.

109
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, I think so too.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,880
But when I'm around, if you could keep that bushel on hand still,

111
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,640
that would be great for me.

112
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
Well, I don't want to expel all my energy.

113
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,960
Hey, let's get into some advice here.

114
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,840
I want to help some people.

115
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,040
Congratulations, Griffin.

116
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,240
Oh, thanks, brothers.

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,880
Oh, God.

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,960
I don't need to congratulate you on our program.

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,840
I did it in, like, real life in a private ceremony.

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,480
Millions of people didn't fucking hear that, Justin.

121
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
I want them to know that you approve.

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,760
Okay, okay.

123
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,680
Millions?

124
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,320
Yeah.

125
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,440
You're assuming that, like, after our crime spree,

126
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,040
profilers by the millions are going to return to these clips

127
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,960
and look for clues that they missed along the way.

128
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
Once my episode of Doomsday Preppers goes live,

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,840
like, my Google profile is going to explode.

130
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,640
I can't keep up with all these alerts.

131
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm getting Google alerts daily.

132
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Thank you, Doomsday Preppers.

133
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,680
I really hitched it.

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,640
Hey, Griffin.

135
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,360
Hey, what?

136
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
I just want to say I'm very proud of you and congratulations.

137
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,040
Yeah, I love you.

138
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
Well, thank you, Travis.

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,200
Justin, it just feels kind of, it feels a little...

140
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,320
A little hollow.

141
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,240
Feels a little forced at this point.

142
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,920
I shouldn't really have to ask for it.

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,280
Have you guys decided what reality TV shows

144
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,880
you're going to be participating in?

145
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
Are we going to go...

146
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,480
Great question.

147
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,880
Say Yes to the Dress, Amazing Race,

148
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
Say Yes to the Dress Atlanta.

149
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm doing, actually, O3 Weddings.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
What's three weddings?

151
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,560
Three weddings that you've never seen

152
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,120
where three different women are getting married

153
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
and then they go to each other's weddings,

154
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
or is it like four weddings?

155
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,960
I don't know.

156
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,920
There's multiple weddings,

157
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,360
and then they judge each other's weddings,

158
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
and then whoever they decide had the best wedding

159
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,200
gets a free honeymoon.

160
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,700
Hmm.

161
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,280
That really is quite atrocious, but...

162
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
I was thinking we would just do Doomsday Preppers,

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
but like a wedding edition.

164
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,520
Oh, so romantic.

165
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,600
So like, maybe we could plan on getting married

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,200
right on December 23rd.

167
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,360
Right on December 21st, 2012.

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,760
And then like, just sort of get ready for old Quetzie

169
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,080
to come out of the ground and swallow his whole.

170
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,520
But like, maybe we do it romantically planning around that.

171
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,880
19 days left, people.

172
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,680
19 days left.

173
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,880
What if we mount him and ride him into the heavens

174
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,000
with our love?

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,840
Now that would be a truly...

176
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,920
That's technically eloping, I think.

177
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,640
I think so too.

178
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,520
Let's get into the advice.

179
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Let's get into the questions.

180
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm ready to help.

181
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,680
I have a coworker who has a language issue.

182
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
He seems to think the phrase...

183
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,460
Okay.

184
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,580
Okay.

185
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,040
He seems to...

186
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,080
God, you are 14 years old.

187
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,920
Okay, I can do this.

188
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,400
I can do this.

189
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,520
He seems to think the phrase blow my load

190
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,560
means the same as the phrase blow my top.

191
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,120
He uses it frequently to describe when he feels angry.

192
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,240
Needless to say, I'll find this hilarious,

193
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,920
but I don't want him to hurt his career

194
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
with the use of this phrase.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Should I ruin this beautiful situation by telling him

196
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
or keep it a secret until he gets old?

197
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
That's from Amused in New Orleans.

198
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,920
Is it possible that your coworker

199
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
just finds really random shit erotic?

200
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,220
Yeah.

201
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,760
I swear to God, if the boss tells me

202
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,240
to finish our report sooner one more time,

203
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm gonna blow my load.

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,040
Maybe he's like a very...

205
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,360
He's a weird sort of like S&M guy

206
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
where it's not like he wants a lady to step on his balls.

207
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
He just kind of wants the printer to act up, you know?

208
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,520
He kind of just wants to, you know,

209
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,640
forget his lunch at home.

210
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
Carlene, if you don't get back in here

211
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,720
and make a pot of coffee after you finished it,

212
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm gonna blow my load all over, all over the place.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,500
Carlene.

214
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,340
Oh, God. I don't have anybody like this in my life.

215
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,220
You understand that this person is a unicorn

216
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,820
and this thing doesn't really happen.

217
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,460
It only happens in American Pie movies.

218
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,580
Why the fuck would you ruin it by telling them?

219
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,820
Yeah, you are currently working

220
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,180
with a mid-90s S&L Rob Schneider character

221
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,380
and you need to just keep that roll rolling, you know?

222
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,900
Keep it going.

223
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,060
I'm also willing to bet that if you even like

224
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,980
voice a concern about telling him,

225
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,220
you will be swarmed by like 30 different people

226
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,980
who've been like, Todd, you can't.

227
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,420
Todd, you can't tell him.

228
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,860
This is all I've got, Todd.

229
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,140
My family life is shit.

230
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,540
Think about this, Amuse in New Orleans.

231
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,660
If some other crankster had come along

232
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,060
and fixed this before you got to it,

233
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,380
we would never have heard of it.

234
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,980
Think about that for a second.

235
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,340
That's true.

236
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,700
And it wouldn't have brought joy to my life.

237
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,340
Also think about the fact that if you talk to this guy,

238
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,100
that's gonna be in the Guinness Book of World Records

239
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,580
for the shittiest conversation ever.

240
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,220
Cause it's gonna go, hey, Todd,

241
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,100
that thing you've been saying, it means coming.

242
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,860
And then he's gonna fall to his knees

243
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,420
and he's gonna lash himself.

244
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,220
Here's the thing.

245
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,980
If you tell him, if you're the guy who tells him,

246
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,860
you are immediately responsible for every single time

247
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,420
he has said that and you have not corrected him.

248
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,100
Oh, great point, Justin.

249
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,380
Cause he's gonna sit there and think,

250
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,860
well, I said it to you when the boss's niece was around

251
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,300
and you didn't say shit.

252
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,140
You just let me keep saying it.

253
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,100
What's the matter with you?

254
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,380
Oh, hey, by the way, it means coming.

255
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,380
It does mean coming, sir.

256
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,660
If everybody doesn't know.

257
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,140
I mean, they know.

258
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,900
Everybody but this gentleman knows it.

259
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,300
Everybody except this gentleman has read 50 Shades of Grey.

260
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,740
And that's all they say in that book is like.

261
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,220
I'm gonna go blow my load.

262
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,500
Blowing my load.

263
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
But they also use it inappropriately too.

264
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,060
So the woman will actually say,

265
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,180
oh, Christian, blow my load all over the place.

266
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,060
That doesn't, I don't understand.

267
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,420
Well, I've seen a few videos.

268
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,300
Sorry, Nani.

269
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,300
How about a Yahoo?

270
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,340
Yeah, I'll give you Yahoo.

271
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,860
It's Yahoo.

272
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,300
I didn't mean to say that so sexually.

273
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,580
Why is it all getting dirty?

274
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,300
I don't know.

275
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,180
Let's get innocent.

276
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,780
Let's revive the innocence.

277
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,380
This one was sent in by Steve Lewis.

278
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,260
Thank you, Steve.

279
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,740
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Boris, who asks,

280
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,660
can doctors do plastic surgery on animals?

281
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,860
I would like to make my cat look more Garfield.

282
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,340
He's already a ginger tomcat,

283
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,980
but all it would require would be some large cheek implants

284
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,540
and he would be the pitting image of Garfield.

285
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,740
What would this sort of surgery cost?

286
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,500
Your soul.

287
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,940
Yeah, really.

288
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,260
And also more importantly, your cat's life

289
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,140
because no way would a cat survive that.

290
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,460
It is becoming more of a thing.

291
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,780
People are getting into it.

292
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,580
For instance, if your dog has a lot of sagging

293
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,860
and their skin is covering their eyes from all the sagging,

294
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,700
then you can get that fixed.

295
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,340
I swear, I saw a Sharpay the other day.

296
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,540
It looked like Joan Rivers.

297
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,700
It was horrifying.

298
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,020
Okay.

299
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,660
Also, then you got nauticals.

300
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,140
What about that?

301
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,820
That's pet plastic surgery, right?

302
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,740
I don't know what you're, I don't know what you're saying.

303
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Well, you put balls on their fingers.

304
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,220
No, nauticals are when you give them testicular implants

305
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
after you remove their nudes.

306
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,300
Why does it have such an adorable name?

307
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,500
I know, they sound, here's my problem, they sound delicious.

308
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,580
If you give me a ranch flavor nautical,

309
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,180
I might actually go to town on that.

310
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,460
If you can give me cool ranch.

311
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,140
Yeah, I went to Macaroni Grill

312
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,500
and they had a special for endless bowl of nauticals.

313
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,860
It was delicious.

314
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,860
Justin, if I came home for the holidays to your house

315
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,300
and your cat turned around at me

316
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,980
and it had a pure like Garfield face,

317
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,140
like from the CGI Garfield movie,

318
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,380
there would be a Griffin shaped hole in your wall.

319
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,860
Adios.

320
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,420
It would be like, hi, every, why?

321
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,180
And I wouldn't be there anymore.

322
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,140
I wouldn't be there anymore.

323
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,060
And I would never be there ever again.

324
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,420
Does this gentleman, Boris not realize

325
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,380
that when he does this for the rest of his cat's

326
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,580
brief horrible life, every time somebody sees it

327
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,860
and goes, what the fuck?

328
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,380
He's like, yeah, I had those put in.

329
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,300
That's gonna end that friendship or whatever it is.

330
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,140
The mailman will no longer come by.

331
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,580
He'll probably be taken to prison.

332
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,220
Also, I think that the surgery,

333
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,860
it would require some maintenance

334
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,660
because I'm pretty sure that we would be dealing with a like

335
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,820
Rocky from mask scenario within days.

336
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,820
Yeah, they'll scratch there.

337
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,460
They scratch there.

338
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,820
What if they scratch their implant

339
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,580
and then it leaks all over the place?

340
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,460
You gotta clean that up.

341
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,260
That's another mess.

342
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,620
Aren't cats enough hassle?

343
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,100
Better yet, what kind of back alley veterinarian

344
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,700
do you think you're gonna find is gonna be like,

345
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,580
what do you wanna do?

346
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,220
Okay, cool.

347
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,740
Okay, you wanna put a fake voice box in,

348
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,420
make him sound like a Lorenzo music?

349
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,060
I can hear that.

350
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,540
I can adjust his taste buds,

351
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,460
make him just crave lasagna if you want.

352
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:29,940
Fuck it.

353
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,620
Yeah, my cat and I are going through

354
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,460
a several year long procedure

355
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,260
to make him more like Garfield.

356
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,180
He's got a plastic Garfield face surgery.

357
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,500
I give him electroshock therapy one day of the week.

358
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,860
I will let you guess which day.

359
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,540
You can probably suss it out.

360
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,860
Well, I gave him the shock collar

361
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,940
so every time my dog Odie comes around,

362
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,700
I hit it just so he gets a nice,

363
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,820
you know, nice intolerance towards the dog.

364
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,740
I'm currently getting iris removal

365
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,620
so I more resemble the character that owns him.

366
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,220
I have also broken up with my longtime girlfriend

367
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,820
so I am terribly alone.

368
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,420
And I dyed the lady cat next door pink

369
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,900
so I might be arrested for that one.

370
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,820
I know too much about Garfield.

371
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,380
Garfield.

372
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:32,820
Why is Garfield so funny,

373
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:41,700
but not in any way that his creator can harness?

374
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,340
Why is everyone else able to make Garfield funny,

375
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,460
but somehow the ability to elude it

376
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,620
escapes Jim Davis daily seven times a day.

377
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,100
This motherfucker can't get the funniest strip correct.

378
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,100
He is unable to see what he has made and use it for good.

379
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
It's one of those things where Garfield minus Garfield

380
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,620
is like some of the funniest shit around,

381
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,540
but if he had just drawn that strip,

382
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,980
it would have been fucking mind-blowingly terrible.

383
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,140
Ultimately, the comedy that we find in it

384
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,260
is a direct result of Jim Davis's impotence.

385
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,500
Right, his inability.

386
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,940
Right, exactly.

387
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,580
If he were more competent as an artist or creator,

388
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,420
then we wouldn't be, but see like, okay,

389
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,020
you look at Garfield minus Garfield

390
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,140
or really any sort of deconstructionist Garfield rap

391
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,940
that we have done,

392
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,220
if Jim Davis had the artistic ability

393
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,940
to kill his little darlings,

394
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,020
to have the sort of foresight,

395
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,100
that scalpel, that artistic scalpel

396
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,140
to cut away the inessentials of his comedy,

397
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,860
he could be one of the great ones.

398
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,540
Excuse me, Bill Watterson.

399
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,980
He could be the greatest comic artist of all time,

400
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,420
but he is unable.

401
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
He cannot see beyond his mediocrity.

402
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,780
But in a way though, isn't that his legacy?

403
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,020
I'm saying it's intentional.

404
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,660
I'm saying that Garfield, people wouldn't be talking,

405
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,060
Garfield wouldn't be as relevant as it is today,

406
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,540
which is to say incredibly relevant.

407
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,020
Sure, yeah.

408
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,580
If it was just like, if it was the funniest thing ever,

409
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,100
if it was Mad TV, you know?

410
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,500
Wait, excuse me?

411
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,220
That's a whole different rabbit hole.

412
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,660
I don't want to go down right now.

413
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,980
If it was the funniest thing ever, a la Mad TV,

414
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,420
then people wouldn't be talking about it

415
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,700
because there would be nothing to say,

416
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,540
except did you see the latest Garfield?

417
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,900
And people would say yes and say,

418
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,060
I laughed so hard that I forgot to feed my kids.

419
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,060
Here's the Garfield Wikipedia page

420
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,460
has actually been locked by Wikipedia

421
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
because of quote frequent vandalism.

422
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,660
It is a serious problem for the Garfield Wikipedia home.

423
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,860
I think he's great.

424
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,420
Hey, listen, I love Garfield.

425
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,140
There it is.

426
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,060
Hey, and also I have another thing.

427
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,260
My husband often makes plans that include me

428
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,020
and are at our house, but doesn't let me know of said plans.

429
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,660
I always find out my slash our weekend plans from one of our friends.

430
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,540
It's not that I don't want these plans to happen

431
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,260
and I don't need or want him to feel like

432
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,660
he has to ask me permission to arrange plans,

433
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,500
but it would be nice to know from him,

434
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,060
not a third party, what my weekend plans are.

435
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,460
How do I approach this gently?

436
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,620
That's from uninformed in Indianapolis.

437
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,900
Why must it be gentle?

438
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,020
Yeah, how about you say-

439
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,820
I feel like you'd be completely just fine and going,

440
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,100
hey Frank, what the fuck?

441
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,860
Hey Frank, we were gonna go see fucking Argo this weekend, you dummy.

442
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,940
I have the strangest feeling that maybe she has just told him

443
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,860
by writing into their favorite comedy and rice podcast.

444
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,420
Maybe.

445
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,580
I am so tired of being a pawn in your people's romantic relationships.

446
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,500
Stop using us to break bad news to your loved ones

447
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,020
and just start communicating.

448
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,700
How do you pull that off though?

449
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Cause we're like 20 minutes deep now.

450
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Do you think she just sat there for 20 minutes?

451
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,140
Sort of fidgeting, like waiting, just like, oh, hold on.

452
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,780
Something's gonna be really germane to where we are.

453
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,220
Yeah, you also have to remember Justin,

454
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,180
we get sent like 150 questions a week and we maybe do four.

455
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,100
So that's really a Russian roulette style of breaking news

456
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,940
cause after an hour and five minutes,

457
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,660
usually if we haven't said it, you gotta turn to him and go,

458
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,740
hey, by the way, tell me when you make fucking plans.

459
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,940
We're gonna go see Argo.

460
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Why is he not making these plans with you?

461
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,700
That's why I went.

462
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,580
Uninformed?

463
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,260
Why isn't it saying, what do you want?

464
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,740
I understand being out in the world and you see some friends

465
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,340
and they're like, hey, what are you up to this weekend?

466
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,100
And you say, I don't know, let's hang out.

467
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,180
You know, you guys can stop by

468
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,020
and maybe play some cards or something.

469
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,540
But then your next step is to call your SO and be like,

470
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,580
hey honey, is this cool or should we figure something else out

471
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,020
or what were you thinking?

472
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,700
No one will leap to inconsiderate spousal behaviors

473
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,780
defense quicker than Travis will.

474
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,220
Travis needs to keep the bridge open

475
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,660
for whatever sort of inappropriate conduct

476
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,580
that he will employ in his own relationship.

477
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:25,220
I just happen to be a proponent of being a part of a whole,

478
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,260
you know, that you are a part of the relationship

479
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,580
that does not mean you have to constantly answer to them.

480
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,620
And she even says in the email

481
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,700
that she doesn't need him to check in with her

482
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
before he makes the plans.

483
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,340
I'm just saying that he's skipping a very important step,

484
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,540
which is like step two, tell her.

485
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,700
Oh man, I hate plans.

486
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,820
I hate them too.

487
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,780
You hate plans?

488
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,140
Oh, I hate plans.

489
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,780
You know, life is what happens when you're making other,

490
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,820
have you ever heard that?

491
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,620
I've heard, well, you didn't finish this.

492
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,660
Life is what happens when you're making.

493
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,420
Life is what happens when you're making other plans.

494
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,060
Think about it.

495
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,980
Think about that for a second.

496
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,660
That's horrible.

497
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:06,980
That's a really dark tunnel.

498
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,260
I hate plans, guys.

499
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,140
If I know I have nothing can ruin a weekend faster for me

500
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,660
than knowing I have plans.

501
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,980
You know what always kills me?

502
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,460
It's like I make the plans,

503
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,700
say on a Thursday to do something Saturday

504
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
and I'm like, yeah, okay, this is gonna be awesome.

505
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,180
We're all gonna hang out.

506
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,260
Then Friday, it's like, oh, we're doing that thing tomorrow.

507
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,980
And it's always like 10 minutes before the event.

508
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,220
Yes, and you're, oh, I don't wanna do this thing.

509
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,340
I want you to stay home, watch Star Wars.

510
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,900
I just got so comfortable.

511
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,700
That happens to me for concerts.

512
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,020
I always buy tickets for concerts months in advance

513
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,140
and I look forward to them.

514
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,540
And then the day of, maybe my tummy hurts

515
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,180
and maybe we just started watching Battlestar Galactica again.

516
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,020
And it's like, well, this is way better than the other thing.

517
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,100
It really is.

518
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,740
Concerts are an investment that really,

519
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,860
I'm not sure they always pay off

520
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,660
because it is just a constant stream of inconvenience

521
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,260
for a moment when you lose yourself in the music.

522
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,900
It really is.

523
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,380
It really is out of control inconvenient to go to any shows like that.

524
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,900
Any concert ever has been.

525
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,340
What about an outdoor show where you have to park a hundred years away

526
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,540
and walk with your bottle of wine in your chair?

527
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,780
And they give you a fucking mason jar at the entrance

528
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,980
that you have to poop and pee in

529
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,820
because there's no bathrooms anywhere.

530
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,060
And then imagine if you're like me

531
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,860
and all the bands that you like also share a demographic

532
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,060
with 50 year old rednecks who will smoke in your face

533
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,620
and bump you and dump their beers on your blanket.

534
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,660
Fortunately for you, Travis,

535
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,900
the only artist that you like is Neil Diamond.

536
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,060
That is not true.

537
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,940
Once that is scratched- Neil Diamond and Journey and Stix.

538
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,380
How many of those have you scratched off the list?

539
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,020
I've seen Journey.

540
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,260
Okay.

541
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,740
I've not seen Neil Diamond.

542
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,580
I had the opportunity in Dallas

543
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,620
and tickets where I shit you not like $250 a piece.

544
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,060
Man, that story about when Travis almost went and saw Neil Diamond

545
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,740
is one of my favorite anecdotes.

546
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,300
Did you meet him?

547
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,740
I always think it's not gonna pay off.

548
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,380
Did you meet him?

549
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,860
Neil Diamond you say?

550
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,620
Yeah, did you meet him at the concert you almost went to?

551
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,540
I almost met him.

552
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,300
I almost met him.

553
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,740
I swear we were in the parking lot.

554
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,900
I was standing on the hood of my car looking for him.

555
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,940
He wasn't there.

556
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,460
Well, that's a shame.

557
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,140
That reminds me of the time I almost met Mitchell Musso

558
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
from iCarly.

559
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,540
Right.

560
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,220
I wish you would stop mentioning names.

561
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,060
He was at the Grove the day before I was.

562
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,860
Oh, I see.

563
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,780
Oh, you're like an almost name dropper.

564
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,660
Yeah, Griffin and I almost met Tim Heidecker once

565
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,420
because we saw Prometheus with him.

566
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,940
And I got too nervous to talk to him.

567
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,860
And we were too nervous to say hi.

568
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,740
It was a great story.

569
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,780
Oh, you should make plans to almost hang out with someone.

570
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,220
We're planning on this weekend.

571
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,700
You guys should almost come over

572
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,380
and we should almost go see Argo.

573
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,620
But at the last minute, we should blow it off,

574
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,140
get some Thai food and stay at home.

575
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,060
Or like we should make plans,

576
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,060
but you thought we were going to the five o'clock one

577
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,820
and we thought we were going to the seven o'clock one

578
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,060
and we almost watched the same movie together.

579
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,700
That'd be great.

580
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,340
Griffin, can I get a Yahoo up in this piece?

581
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,860
Yeah, I'll pop off.

582
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,220
I'll blow my load.

583
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,740
This Yahoo is sent in by Supindle.

584
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,620
Thank you, Supindle.

585
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nick101 who asks.

586
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,380
I'm looking to learn about Nick,

587
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,060
but I want to get it on the ground level.

588
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,900
Do you have any advanced courses like a Nick202 or?

589
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,940
Hey man, if you really want to start in on the Nick situation,

590
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,380
you got to start with Nick101.

591
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,460
I took Nick AP classes in high school.

592
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,300
Those credits transfer over.

593
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Hey, so my parents found a dildo I ordered.

594
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,900
How do I handle this situation?

595
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,740
I'm 19 and not gay or anything,

596
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,140
but my parents accidentally opened my package

597
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,220
and found that I had ordered a dildo.

598
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,380
After having an extremely awkward conversation

599
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,660
with my mom over the phone,

600
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,580
I am left with quite a situation to sort out.

601
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,140
Please help.

602
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,100
Yeah, this is quite the situation.

603
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,780
It is quite a situation, Nick101.

604
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,860
Is it a gift dildo?

605
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,060
I guess it's a dildo.

606
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,820
See, if you order from Extreme Restraints,

607
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,780
they ship everything with like a fake,

608
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,100
like a facade over the actual present

609
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,300
that makes it look like a Kindle Fire or something like that.

610
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,860
Yeah, keep your piles like super straight come Christmas time.

611
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,260
Keep them really, really diligently straight.

612
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,060
They actually, Extreme Restraints,

613
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,780
actually does send you a Kindle Fire with every purchase.

614
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,620
And then you press a special button on it,

615
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,260
and then it digitizes a dildo right there for you.

616
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,740
It uses 3D modeling technology to-

617
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,260
Dildos in disguise.

618
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,820
It transforms.

619
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,740
It goes, and then you put it inside you,

620
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,460
and then you take it out and angry birds.

621
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,780
It actually turns into a flock of angry birds.

622
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,540
Why did you put me inside you?

623
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,580
I can't finish unless somebody shoots

624
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,420
a bunch of angry birds at my junk.

625
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,820
That is the only way I can do it now.

626
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,660
I think the best course of action for this gentleman

627
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,420
is misdirection.

628
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,780
And when his mom's like,

629
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,900
hey, why did you get a dildo?

630
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,380
You say, no, mother, why did you open my package?

631
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,420
Was it addressed to you?

632
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,460
Good day, I forgive you.

633
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,260
You're forgiven.

634
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:32,900
Man, again, this is one of those,

635
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,620
like 90% of the questions on this show,

636
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,820
we just need more info.

637
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,180
I need some more details.

638
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,060
I feel like it is unfair of Nick to say,

639
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,780
I ordered this dildo, I'm not gay.

640
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,260
Or anything.

641
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,940
Didn't finish that sentence with,

642
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,540
the reason I did is blank.

643
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,340
Well, maybe he did order it to like ram jam it,

644
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,300
but like, I don't know.

645
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,860
I don't, why don't you tell your parents to fuck?

646
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,740
You're 19.

647
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,460
You can't drink yet, but you can smoke and vote.

648
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,660
Yep, at the same time.

649
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,780
At the same time, you can smoke, vote,

650
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,420
and ram jam a Bilbo right up in you.

651
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,540
And you don't need to explain yourself

652
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,620
to goddamn anybody, except the polling place attendant

653
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,300
who's gonna wonder why you're ram jamming

654
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,740
inside the polling place.

655
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,700
And why you pressed,

656
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,020
why you selected it with a cigarette.

657
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
This one's for you, Obama.

658
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,900
I just recently got told by a friend of mine

659
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,340
who also works in theater,

660
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,740
that sometimes if they need to drop in a line

661
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,980
to like hook something in above an audience,

662
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,580
they'll tape a dildo to the line because it's soft

663
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,700
and they don't have to worry about it,

664
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,140
like hurting somebody,

665
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,460
but it's heavy enough to pull the line down.

666
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,420
Pause, pause the world.

667
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,020
Because if that, so the logic is it's not heavy and hard,

668
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,260
so if it falls on somebody, it doesn't kill them.

669
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,620
But if you're watching,

670
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,140
oh, this is my favorite production,

671
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,020
like Beth, I've ever,

672
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,380
well, what just hit me in the ear?

673
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,340
It kind of feels like-

674
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,220
Well, they tape it up.

675
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,020
They dress it up.

676
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,380
They wrap it in foam so it is not identifiable as a dildo.

677
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,340
But apparently it is a very commonly used theater practice

678
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,580
to use a dildo to wake a line.

679
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,740
Okay, how about a book?

680
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,500
Or how about a Nerf missile?

681
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,940
Or how about a banana?

682
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,660
Or how about the other 100,000 things?

683
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,020
Did you not know, Griffin?

684
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,540
Techies is freaky.

685
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,340
I guess, I guess, I suppose.

686
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,540
Techies is freaky.

687
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,220
I think you should just tell your parents

688
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,140
why you got the dildo,

689
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,980
whatever that reason may be.

690
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,700
And then they'll respect you.

691
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,660
Mother, father, may I sit you down for a moment, please?

692
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,020
I brought this dildo for me.

693
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,740
I don't have to answer your questions.

694
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,820
I'm gonna use it to fling Angry Birds at my dick.

695
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,980
Because that's how I do.

696
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,260
I'm feeling like 20 Does

697
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,100
has been about obviously getting it.

698
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I feel like, and we're still weighing

699
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,820
a few different options for 2013 themes,

700
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,660
but I feel like maybe 2013 should just be No More Secrets.

701
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,140
Yeah.

702
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,700
How many of our, like,

703
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,220
how many of our problems here on the show

704
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,340
would be solved by just No More Secrets?

705
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,060
You know, let's stop it.

706
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,340
Let's just be honest.

707
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,540
No More Secrets, guys.

708
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,820
Yes, but that's not good.

709
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,020
It's 13.

710
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,900
I can't think of anything that rhymes with 13

711
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,940
that makes it sound.

712
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,420
20 Does is like 22, you know?

713
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:22,980
22.

714
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,300
Right.

715
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,780
Do it.

716
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,740
Just do it.

717
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,380
Just get it.

718
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,340
Just do it, Nike.

719
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,860
Just do it.

720
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,100
Just get it, Reebok is their motto.

721
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,260
Jump good.

722
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,220
Skechers, it's the S.

723
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,180
Faster, faster, faster, faster, Nike.

724
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,580
Faster.

725
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,780
These shoes, these shoes are for poor kids.

726
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,280
Keds.

727
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,900
Poor Keds.

728
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,700
Keds.

729
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,660
Get them.

730
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,820
What year is it?

731
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,540
British Nights.

732
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,020
I could do this all day.

733
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,500
It's fun.

734
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,780
I really, really want some.

735
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,500
Reebok bump.

736
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,820
They don't sell them anymore.

737
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,420
If you move fast enough, the end kind of looks like a Nike.

738
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:11,620
New Balance.

739
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,900
What in the world?

740
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,380
Uggs.

741
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,620
I wish I could just let it.

742
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,180
I'm a Depression era child in Appalachia.

743
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,780
Paperbacks.

744
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,280
God.

745
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,420
I think we should probably go to the money zone.

746
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,700
I mean, we just got a bunch of money from all of those.

747
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,980
For Uggs and Moon Shoes.

748
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,100
Did we do Moon Shoes?

749
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,660
No, we didn't.

750
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,900
Hey, I'm going to fucking kill that kid.

751
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,460
Wheelies.

752
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,580
That's the shoe speaking, right?

753
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:02,820
Yeah.

754
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,740
No, I hate these fucking rolly pieces of shit that won't stop rolling around.

755
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,540
Just walk.

756
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,220
In my day, we walked.

757
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,980
We didn't have wheels in our shoes.

758
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:28,580
Our first message is for Chelsea from Joe, who is in all caps.

759
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,340
Boyfriend.

760
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,300
Boyfriend.

761
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,100
Boyfriend.

762
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,940
Let there be no doubt.

763
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,940
I am boyfriend.

764
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,340
You made it to 25, Chelsea.

765
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,620
Congratulations.

766
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,660
You're a Pokemon master, sexy freedom trail tour guide, and all around awesome lady.

767
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,180
He said fucking awesome lady.

768
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,500
I know.

769
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,820
I'm trying to tone it down.

770
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,660
We're coming up on candle lights.

771
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,340
We love the shit out of you.

772
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,380
He said shit, so.

773
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,580
Happy birthday from Joe, Connor, Terry, Lauren, and Mike.

774
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,900
Don't be late for the bug now.

775
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,860
I want to know what the sexy freedom trail is.

776
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,660
And I really look forward to visiting.

777
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,700
Travis, I'm not a linguistic expert.

778
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,060
I'm pretty sure he's saying she's a sexy guide on the freedom trail,

779
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:23,140
not as you have surmised here, a guide on a sexy freedom trail.

780
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,940
Justin, do you know what happens when you assume?

781
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,300
I guess you got me there, Trav.

782
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm sorry.

783
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,020
You didn't even like take a second to Google it.

784
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,420
I need you to Google sexy freedom trail, please.

785
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,780
I'm pretty sure it's just the one freedom trail in Boston.

786
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,580
Isn't that what they call it when, like, you have pubes on your gut that, like,

787
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,860
leads down to your butt, to your pee-pee or vagina?

788
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,340
Yeah, right.

789
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,860
Speaking of pee-pees and vaginas, we also want to tell you guys about Extreme Restraints.

790
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:55,380
It's a website where you can order all the latest fuck props.

791
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,180
They say, I think toys is too much for these works of art.

792
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,060
I think there are tools.

793
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,260
Fuck a couture mall.

794
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,140
A couture mall.

795
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,020
How about a couture mall?

796
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,620
Cannot, cannot.

797
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,260
Cannot.

798
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,500
If you use a coupon code MEDALIST, you can save 20% at the site,

799
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,540
which is, of course, located conveniently at ExtremeRestraints.com.

800
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,180
Go there and get all your couture mall.

801
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,300
Nope.

802
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:36,100
Guys, we got so many tweets last week from people, like, overjoyed that this partnership

803
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,220
had been struck up, that it had been reignited.

804
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,180
Because there were some fears after we went without for, like, one week.

805
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,540
People were like, what happened?

806
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,420
Was it me?

807
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,700
Was it something I did?

808
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,900
Talk to me, daddy and mommy.

809
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,860
Did I not buy enough?

810
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,620
Did I not buy enough dillbows?

811
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,380
Here's what I would say to you.

812
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,100
Please go to the website, use that coupon code,

813
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,780
because every once in a while we get a list, an anonymous list,

814
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,100
of all the things our listeners have bought with that code.

815
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,700
And it is really the highlight.

816
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,380
It's, like, we don't get, other than, like, tweets and books,

817
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,140
which is what you call Facebook interactions,

818
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,540
like, we don't get to, like, gauge you guys, like, the kind of people that you are.

819
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,180
Or what gauge of dildo you're getting.

820
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,620
Yeah, so when we get a list saying, like, you bought,

821
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,220
you bought, like, a butt hammer called Lil Stomper,

822
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,500
then, like, that informs us about the shape and angle of your character.

823
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,700
That helps us to customize the show for your enjoyment.

824
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,420
That's it.

825
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,860
Think of it like a focus group,

826
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,780
because we want to know the angle of your dangle.

827
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,980
And this is how we do.

828
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,940
This is how we do that.

829
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,580
I want to say a big hello to Sam Seeger.

830
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,420
This is from Alex, Ali, Chris, Mary, Max, Nat, and Will.

831
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,900
They have a very specific script here, so I'm going to read it exactly.

832
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,060
Sam, yes, you, Sam Seeger.

833
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,980
We can see you.

834
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,620
Don't just sit there in your striped cardigan,

835
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,460
sipping water at your desk,

836
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,060
or watching your shocked face from the camera in the hippo statue.

837
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,300
You need to stop masturbating all the time.

838
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,340
Stop masturbating.

839
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,020
Your friends just want to say happy birthday.

840
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,780
Here they are.

841
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,020
And then it says here, talk in funny voice, which I don't know.

842
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,300
I have two problems.

843
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,940
First of all, we're not fucking clowns for hire.

844
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,420
We are a little bit.

845
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,660
If you want clowns for hire, hire us from our clown service.

846
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,300
Silly guys.

847
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,540
Moreover, hey, has anyone ever been to a fancy restaurant?

848
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,220
You can't just go with eight people

849
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,140
and then get the most expensive dish on the menu

850
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,460
and be like, oh, all eight of us are going to split it.

851
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,500
Let's watch these.

852
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,100
Let's keep, let's keep it to a minimum on these group messages.

853
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,900
These pile on.

854
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,660
Are you saying that each one should have bought an individual message for Sam?

855
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,940
I'm saying each one of them could have maybe picked up the tab.

856
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,140
And our next message is also for Sam.

857
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,700
And also this one and this one.

858
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,340
And this one.

859
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,660
Right.

860
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,860
There's no Groupon for what we're doling out.

861
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,260
Yeah.

862
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,500
Guys, let's try to get a handle on it.

863
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,380
I want to get a handle on Jeff in North Attleboro from his buddy, Mike Cantor.

864
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,980
Maybe his lover.

865
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,620
I don't know.

866
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,140
I wouldn't suppose.

867
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,220
But happy 29th birthday.

868
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,700
His boss.

869
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,140
Maybe his boss.

870
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,820
Maybe his lover, his lover, his boss's dog.

871
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,700
Maybe his nemesis.

872
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,300
A shades of gray kind of situation where they signed a contract.

873
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,700
We can only assume because we got literally no information other than happy 29th birthday.

874
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,260
So we're guessing here, but we hope Jeff has a great one.

875
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,860
And that's for your buddy, Mike.

876
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,020
So happy 29th, Jeff.

877
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,100
Or as you call him, Mr. Cantor.

878
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,740
How did you guys spend your 29th?

879
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,460
I spent my 29th getting into a car accident and thinking about doing 365 new things before

880
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,180
I turned 30.

881
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,580
Pretty good birthday.

882
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,540
All at the same time.

883
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,540
It all flashed into my mind as I collided with the pleasant elderly couple in front of me.

884
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,940
Were they so pleasant that you just had to destroy them?

885
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,900
Is that what happened?

886
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,300
Yeah.

887
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,940
Was it like an air raid?

888
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,620
Stop that fucking railroad track.

889
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,140
Who does that, old people?

890
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,060
I just wanted to destroy something elderly.

891
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,420
I wanted to destroy something weathered.

892
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,900
Jesse Thorne here, proprietor of MaximumFun.org.

893
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,660
Look, we had a great time in the Poconos and everything, but there's no way we are forgetting

894
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,900
about our annual trip to Lake Arrowhead here in Southern California.

895
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:27,700
So unless the world ends first by Mayan prophecy, Max Fun Con West will be held May 31st through

896
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,860
June 2nd, 2013.

897
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,580
Join us for a showcase of elite stand-up comedy performers in the world, and we'll see you

898
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,900
next time on Max Fun Con.

899
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,780
About three months ago, me and my best friend started dating.

900
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,180
Since we're both part of a small community of mutual friends and colleagues who love

901
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,900
to gossip, we kept our relationship secret.

902
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,380
Enjoy it while it lasts.

903
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,620
You got fucking 29 more days of that for 2013.

904
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,540
No more secrets.

905
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,500
But now that we're serious, I feel silly having to keep my distance from my boyfriend when

906
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,060
I'm out in public and my friends trying to set me up with guys since they think I'm still

907
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,860
single.

908
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,420
How do I convince my boyfriend it's time to go public?

909
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,340
And how can I break the news to this small community without it becoming dramatic gossip?

910
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,420
That's from Mary in Illinois.

911
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,540
How do you not?

912
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,040
How?

913
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,540
What does everyone love more than anything else in the world?

914
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,180
People they know getting together.

915
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,680
No.

916
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,820
You're wrong.

917
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:01,220
The answer is knowing some shit that they shouldn't know that maybe not everybody else

918
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,720
knows.

919
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:10,680
So in your attempt to keep gossip from happening, you have created the juiciest, most mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

920
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,360
Do you know how you avoid gossip?

921
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,560
You do the fucking Alan Aldamu from West Wing Season 7.

922
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,060
Yes.

923
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,400
You hold a press conference and you just talk it out for like four hours.

924
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,520
You answer every question.

925
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,200
You stand and you fucking deliver.

926
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,520
Because what you have, God, it's so fucking going to blow my load.

927
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,240
It's 31 flavors and I want to taste each one.

928
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,880
You have done fucked up.

929
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,080
You have created the juiciest, most mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

930
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,880
They have probably hired a fucking private investigator because they want to know so bad.

931
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,800
Oh, God.

932
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,320
When the first person-

933
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,480
You hid the press in the closet and then you told the kids not to go in the closet or else

934
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,520
Santa wouldn't come for them.

935
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,720
And now fucking the closet is all they can think about.

936
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,480
And it's too late now because you've already had a brief period.

937
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
You're trapped in the closet.

938
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,080
If you say it now, if you come out with it now, all they're going to talk about is those

939
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,200
two fucking devilishly sexy months.

940
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,080
Who knows what's going on?

941
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,960
What were they doing?

942
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,400
What was that about?

943
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,760
They probably didn't want us to know because of how they were just pressing their butts

944
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,720
together all the time.

945
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,640
They were just pooping back and forth nonstop.

946
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,560
Travis, Griffin, wait till you get married.

947
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,800
You are going to learn so much about what sex is.

948
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,400
Well, I heard once you get married, they don't let you put your butt on their butt again.

949
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,720
No, you need to put your fanny against their fanny.

950
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,880
I heard if you put a penny in your jar every time you put your butt on her butt in the

951
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,480
first year of marriage and then every time after you take him out at the end, then at

952
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,800
the end, you have to put all the pennies in your butt.

953
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,560
That is true.

954
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,680
100% true.

955
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,180
That is-

956
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,160
I read that in Malcolm Gladwell's The Outliers.

957
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,000
Man, Travis just wants everybody to know he read a book.

958
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,960
I just want it to be known.

959
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,720
And to be fair, I listened to it.

960
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,720
I cannot read.

961
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,220
Jesus.

962
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,320
Well, ma'am, as it says in Malcolm Gladwell's The Outliers, I'll have the chicken McNuggets

963
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,680
and an extra large Coke.

964
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,440
Excuse me?

965
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,040
Can you not hear me?

966
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,640
I'll turn down my book on tape.

967
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,360
Sorry.

968
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,560
I apologize.

969
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,600
Yeah, listen.

970
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,100
You gotta-

971
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,880
And first and foremost, I need you to be honest.

972
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,880
I truly believe that anytime someone says, we're going to get together, but we need to

973
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,800
keep it secret from our group of friends, the reason you do that is because you guys

974
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,760
weren't sure if it was going to work out and you didn't want to make it a big thing.

975
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,040
Travis is 100% right.

976
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,160
He's very wise.

977
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,640
So now that you know it's going to work out, you need to just straight up be like, hey,

978
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,520
we're dating.

979
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,080
And don't just tell one person because that's how you create gossip.

980
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,120
Yeah.

981
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,280
That's like damming a river, right?

982
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,520
And then you put a small hole in it.

983
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,080
That's how it all breaks apart and becomes a thing.

984
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Just tell everyone all at once.

985
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,440
Travis had it right the first time.

986
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,920
Do an Alan Alda press conference.

987
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,120
Can you do a press conference at the office?

988
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,000
Just have everybody-

989
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,480
Hello.

990
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,360
Thank you all for coming.

991
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,040
I've called you together for an important announcement.

992
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,880
That problem is, where are you going to find a sign language interpreter at this hour?

993
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,880
I know you're probably wondering why me and Derek are touching our butts together.

994
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,480
Well, let me go ahead and clear up any confusion there may be.

995
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,880
Hola, me llamo Greg.

996
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,120
Es mi hermana Kelly.

997
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,000
That means sister.

998
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,400
Let me start over.

999
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,920
My sister Kelly and I.

1000
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,240
Now I know that this seems especially shocking now that you know we are blood relation.

1001
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,480
We have been secret brother and sister and secret dating.

1002
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,520
How is your world?

1003
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,560
We just changed it.

1004
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,240
To be fair, we've only been brother and sister for a month and we've been dating for three.

1005
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,760
So figure that one out.

1006
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,480
Thanks for getting married, mom and dad.

1007
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,600
New mom and new dad.

1008
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,920
Yeah, but just to be straight up, you create gossip by not telling people.

1009
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,440
What's interesting to people is not knowing for sure whether you guys are together.

1010
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,080
Now, how much of full disclosure are we talking about?

1011
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,600
Do they really have to be like, we are dating

1012
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,400
and we press our butts together on the reg twice a day?

1013
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,720
If you just come out and say, hey, so just so you guys know, Derek and I are dating,

1014
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,160
then they're going to be like, oh, we're so happy for you.

1015
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,600
And then when you leave the fucking room, the second you do, they're going to turn to

1016
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,480
each other and be like, what do you think their butt pressing schedule is like?

1017
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,200
That is exactly what people do.

1018
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,960
Tell me about the routines.

1019
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,480
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1020
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,120
What if you just pretended like you assumed everybody already knew?

1021
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,440
So like, go out, go out on like a group thing or whatever and just like hold hands and kiss

1022
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,000
and like do all the PDA and we're like, what the fuck?

1023
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,480
Be like, we've been dating for like two fucking months.

1024
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,200
Where have you been?

1025
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,440
When did Travis become the wizard of fucking Oz?

1026
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,200
Like he's so smart, right?

1027
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:08,600
Like I read fucking Malcolm Gladwell's The Outlaw.

1028
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,880
Oh man.

1029
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,680
We need to wrap this up.

1030
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,720
This has been a lot of fun.

1031
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,000
We've had a lot of fun here today.

1032
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,200
Let's do one more.

1033
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,700
Okay.

1034
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,600
Real or Yahoo or what?

1035
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,920
Well, I have a Yahoo.

1036
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,040
You want to see if you guys like it?

1037
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,880
Yeah, let's see how it tastes.

1038
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,440
It's working.

1039
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,680
I figured we should do at least one Candle Nights question.

1040
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,980
Okay.

1041
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,560
It was sent by Emily Wall.

1042
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,600
Thank you, Emily.

1043
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Poppy who asks,

1044
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,480
gerbil Christmas presents?

1045
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,700
Oh.

1046
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,160
Well, I'm going to switch out Christmas for Candle Nights for the rest of the question.

1047
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,600
Well, because who celebrates Christmas anymore, really?

1048
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,080
Yeah, that's a little 2011 for my taste.

1049
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,680
Well, this year for Candle Nights, I have no idea what to get my gerbils.

1050
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,880
All I have got is a great ball.

1051
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,040
A toilet roll.

1052
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,880
Please help.

1053
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,680
Wait, what?

1054
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,480
A toilet roll?

1055
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,960
Yeah, gerbils look like they...

1056
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,560
It's like a fun little bunker for them.

1057
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,920
Oh, like the inside tube.

1058
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,420
Yeah.

1059
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,560
Not like to wipe their gerbil butts.

1060
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,440
No, no, no, no.

1061
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,320
Well, I don't know.

1062
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,040
I don't know how gerbils do.

1063
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,560
I can't understand the words of the question.

1064
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,120
Okay.

1065
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,800
Should I do it again but slower?

1066
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,840
Yeah, do it again slower.

1067
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,280
So I can finish.

1068
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,680
Well, this year for Candle Nights, I have no idea what to get my gerbils.

1069
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,240
All I have got is a great ball.

1070
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,200
A toilet roll.

1071
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,720
Please help.

1072
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,800
Does he say he's already got a ball and he needs another idea?

1073
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,880
I got the ball, I got the toilet roll, but that's not enough.

1074
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,200
You're going to throw that back in my face.

1075
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,480
I guess what I'm asking is, do you know what my gerbils are getting me?

1076
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,880
How much have they spent so that I know how much I need to spend?

1077
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,000
The only answer on the question says a great ball or a toilet roll.

1078
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,920
I mean, you got your bases covered.

1079
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,320
What if he sells his car to get them some new chew toys,

1080
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:19,880
but they sell their teeth to get him a new air freshener for his car?

1081
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,080
Give to the mad gerbils.

1082
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,400
Man, my portmanteaus are on fire today.

1083
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:25,720
I love-

1084
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,520
Even worse is when he gives them the great ball and the toilet roll and Rolex watches

1085
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,920
and they're like, oh, we didn't get you anything, Steve.

1086
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,080
Steve, I didn't know we had that kind of relationship.

1087
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,160
I mean, we are gerbils.

1088
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,040
Do you want me to bite you?

1089
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,880
That's a thing I can do.

1090
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,760
And then one of them runs into their hutch real quick and like throws a bottle of wine

1091
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,520
leftover from a dinner party into a bag.

1092
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,000
And they're like, here, Steve, we picked this out just for you.

1093
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,800
The cork came out accidentally.

1094
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,400
I don't understand how it happened.

1095
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,160
And we chewed on it.

1096
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,880
We chewed on it.

1097
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,040
Sorry that we're gerbils and you don't have a girlfriend.

1098
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,560
I know what you can get a gerbil.

1099
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
How about you get him a nut?

1100
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,760
It's so cute when they try to get in there.

1101
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,800
What are they trying to get at?

1102
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,400
Give him a few corn nuts and you try to stick them all in his mouth at the same time.

1103
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,440
And he's got those big old cheeks like Garfield.

1104
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,200
Ooh, get him surgery.

1105
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:18,840
Yeah.

1106
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,320
Can you make your cat-

1107
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,000
He drew an eye on that plastic surgery.

1108
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,920
Make your gerbil look exactly like Garfield.

1109
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,360
That's going to be a cool look for him.

1110
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,040
He'll be the toast of, I don't know what you give him, a cage?

1111
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,400
Of the terrarium.

1112
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,120
Hutch.

1113
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,240
You know, here's the thing, though.

1114
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,640
What's up?

1115
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm going to be honest and say when my dog was still around, I got her Christmas present.

1116
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,400
Yeah, sure.

1117
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,040
But that's a fucker.

1118
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,560
Yeah, Travis, but you didn't ask internet strangers how many plastic bones to buy.

1119
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,600
Oh, so you're saying that it's cool as long as you keep it secret and safe.

1120
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,120
No, I'm saying why don't you know your gerbils well enough to know what they want?

1121
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,080
Why do you think the internet has a deeper personal connection with your gerbils than they do?

1122
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,920
Are you just going to check your gerbil's Facebook?

1123
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,560
What the fuck?

1124
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:06,680
Go to your gerbil's armoire, see if they're out of white diamonds, and just buy them some more.

1125
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,000
Buy them things they've already got and just replenish those if you're out of ideas.

1126
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Gerbil, have you ever seen 12 Monkeys?

1127
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,240
I got it for you on Blu-Ray.

1128
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,840
I thought you might enjoy it.

1129
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,880
Oh, you're afraid of monkeys.

1130
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,600
And TVs.

1131
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,880
And Blu-Ray, and discs.

1132
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,400
And discs, great.

1133
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,760
Cool, cool, cool.

1134
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,240
This has been our advice show, my brother, my brother, and me.

1135
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,440
We hope you've had as much fun as we have, which is to say some.

1136
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,480
Thank you for listening.

1137
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,080
Thank you for tweeting about the show.

1138
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:45,880
Thanks to Deconique, Roman Noodles, Stump Freak, Jason E. Becker, Whittleton, Iron Sean, Iggy K.

1139
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,800
MBMBAMWisdom is an account that tweets out quotes from the show.

1140
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,240
So, you know, go follow that one.

1141
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,640
It's got 1400 followers, believe it or not.

1142
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,160
Also, we're preparing for our special Candle Nights episode.

1143
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,440
I think this year we're going to go with like a gift giving gift guide theme.

1144
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,040
We've already gotten a couple of really awesome, great questions.

1145
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,120
So make sure to send in all of your Candle Nights gift giving questions

1146
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,040
and try to put it in the subject line.

1147
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,960
You know, Candle Nights or something along those lines

1148
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,640
so that I can recognize them right away.

1149
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
I can't wait for Candle Nights, you guys.

1150
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:23,800
I'm so excited.

1151
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,160
I know, it's getting closer.

1152
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,000
And of course, as all Candle Nights episodes, it will be it'll be cuss free.

1153
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,480
Yes.

1154
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,920
It'll be family friendly.

1155
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,600
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

1156
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,760
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

1157
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,680
Off the album, putting the days to bed.

1158
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,240
The what?

1159
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:37,560
Sorry?

1160
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,920
The album.

1161
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,400
The album.

1162
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:39,880
The album?

1163
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Yeah, you crack open the disc and it's that soft membrane through which all the rock lives.

1164
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,200
So thank you.

1165
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,400
Thank you, John Roderick.

1166
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,880
I had something I wanted to say and I can't remember it now.

1167
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,840
I want to say we were reminded from a couple of tweets this week that there is only a month

1168
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:01,320
left in 20 Does and if you have not gotten it yet, you have like 28 days to get it.

1169
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,000
A reminder to get your tickets for Max Funcon West.

1170
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,360
You go to maxfuncon.com.

1171
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,560
I'm sure there's going to be a ton of amazing guests and fun activities and you don't want

1172
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,120
to miss it.

1173
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,480
It was life changing for us.

1174
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,520
I think it's safe to say.

1175
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,040
Head on over there.

1176
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,640
It makes a great gift.

1177
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,040
Listen to all the other Max Fun podcasts.

1178
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:27,400

1179
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,040
Memory Palace, International Waters.

1180
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,560
I wish they'd stop adding them because that's all I can remember and I think I probably...

1181
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,280
Oh, Bullseye?

1182
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,840
God damn it.

1183
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,680
Yeah, you'll get them next time.

1184
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,480
There's a lot of podcasts.

1185
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,040
And make sure you subscribe on iTunes and rate us there and give us a review if you haven't.

1186
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,080
It really helps us out.

1187
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:49,240
It really helps us out and we got to beat, I don't know, Jimmy Pardo or somebody.

1188
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,040
I want to beat all of them.

1189
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,560
I want to beat Adam Carolla.

1190
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,360
I just want to...

1191
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,000
If we don't get to the top of iTunes, I'm going to blow my load.

1192
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,760
Griffin, do you have a final question for us?

1193
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,480
I do.

1194
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,880
This final Yahoo was sent in by Nick Robinson.

1195
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,160
Thank you, Nick Robinson.

1196
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Evan E who absolutely has to know.

1197
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,640
Why does everyone think Son of the Mask was so bad?

1198
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,800
I'm Justin McElroy.

1199
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1200
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1201
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,440
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1202
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,240
Kiss your dad.

1203
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:39,000
My brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad square on the lips.
