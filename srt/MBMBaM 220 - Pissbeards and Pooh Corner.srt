1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,520
Hey everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Scarra, and that means we go from goofs to spooks here on the show. No more jokes to be found,

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
only pokes at your grave. That's too scary, actually.

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,360
In fact, that's not even scary. We're going to murder you.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
Yeah, it's not scary as much as it is like modeling and threatening.

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
I don't want to be modeling or threatening. I want to be Frankenstein,

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,800
whatever Frankenstein is. That's kind of scary. Hi, I'm your oldest brother, Frankenstein.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm your smallest brother, the Wolfman. I'm your baby brother, Osama bin Laden.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,760
He's a pretty scary guy, though, I bet. He had a run, for certain.

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,200
Have you ever noticed that the Wolfman's never on the FBI's most wanted list?

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,560
Why are we doing more to stop the Wolfman? Can't stop people from breaking into the White House.

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,800
Maybe we could redirect our efforts. The White House, that's a lost cause. We can't worry about

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,960
that anymore. But what we can stop is Wolfman. We need to start a Wolfman program where they

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,840
can turn themselves in on the 29 other days and get amnesty and be locked in some kind of silver cage.

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,560
What if you saw a Wolfman and you were like,

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,880
hey, Wolfman's got nards. And he was like, I have a vasectomy. How dare you?

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,280
I'm a person.

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,640
A vasectomy doesn't... Oh, Justin, I have so many things to tell you about vasectomies, brother.

23
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,720
They don't just get all that stuff out of there.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,280
First, before you start getting all fucking patronizing, tell me how much you know about

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,240
Wolfman anatomy, specifically genitalia, before you start trying to contradict my goof.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,440
I can tell you I know a lot about human dicks and I know a lot about wolf dicks.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,120
So I'm just going to conflate those two knowledge bases.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
The fucking classic example of dealing with the Wolfman.

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
I bet that's what the mistake everybody makes is thinking he's half wolf and half man.

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,400
He's something else entirely.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,080
And his nards are on his shoulder.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,520
And his nards are on his shoulder.

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,640
It's not. Monster camp has established that that is not the truth.

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,080
Monster camp, monster team.

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
Monster friends.

36
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,080
Monster squad.

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
Super fun monster weekend.

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
Ass.

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
Weekend at Monsters.

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,520
Why don't we have any jokes? I took that seriously, huh?

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,680
And I said that we weren't going to do goofs anymore.

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,400
I guess I was being fucking a little bit of grain of truth there with no jokes.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,520
No nothing funny.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,680
You know, the problem is we're recording on a Monday and I have a case of them.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
There was one.

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
There was one right there, Justin.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
See, don't sell ourselves short.

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
You got one out.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
That's one and it took us five minutes to get there.

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
So if we keep that up, we're going to have like 12 or 13 goofs in this episode.

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,320
And that's, I think that's pretty much on par.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,120
Let's just get into the advice and hopefully our dear listeners will rescue us from the

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,040
I'm going to go ahead and say a very spooky slump that we find ourselves in.

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
Ooh, we can't think of jokes.

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Ooh, your favorite podcast isn't as funny as it used to be.

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
I miss bramble pelt.

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
I get it.

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,880
We fucking get it, okay?

59
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,800
People, do a horse thing.

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
We're not fucking clowns.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,720
We're not your fucking organ grinder monkeys.

62
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,280
We're human beings with real life responsibilities.

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
Sometimes, much like Tim and Eric, we want to pretend we were intentionally unfunny.

64
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,480
Exactly.

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,520
Can't you just give us that?

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Once a year, maybe?

67
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,480
Once?

68
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
Like 12 times a year.

69
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,080
I know a guy who's very clearly crushing on me.

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,120
I've told him I'm not interested in dating him.

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,240
Twice, actually.

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
But I think he forgot the first time.

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,480
No, he didn't.

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,200
He didn't.

75
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,080
I would like to remain friends with him because despite him not being the sharpest pin in

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
the cushion, he's fun to be around.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,280
So how can I get this through to this guy that I, as a chick who is not into dudes,

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
will never want to date him?

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,240
How is he fucking this up this hard?

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
Hey, it's the biggest fuck up you can do.

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,000
Remind me real quick.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
What did you say when I asked you out last time?

83
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,760
Was it a yes or a no?

84
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,640
Was it a yes or no?

85
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Are we dating now?

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,800
Because I can't remember.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,360
Let me look at my Facebook.

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
Was it a yes or a no or I'm a lesbian?

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
Which of those was it?

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
Was it like 100% no?

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Okay, cool.

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,440
Great, great, great.

93
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,960
I'll ask you again in like a week.

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,520
It's hard.

95
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,400
Like it's fucking hard.

96
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Like I try not to cast aspersions on people that I know two sentences about, but it's

97
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,640
like this doesn't sound like a person that like wants to be your friend if they don't

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,880
if they don't take no as an answer.

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,800
And then they also don't take I'm a lesbian as an answer.

100
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
I don't I don't care how fun you are to be around if you're going to backseat drive

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
on my sexual identity.

102
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
I prefer you just get out of the car.

103
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,640
I always take I'm a lesbian for an answer no matter what the question is.

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,120
No matter what the question is, you can say that shit on Jeopardy.

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
What is I'm a lesbian?

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,200
And then you trip X like yup, got it again.

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,840
God, you're doing really great, Ken Jennings.

108
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,880
And for a thousand dollars, the answer is I'm just going to take some time away from

109
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,600
you right now.

110
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
The question is, I'm a lesbian.

111
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
That is what is it?

112
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Is it it's like when women like other women, Alex, correct?

113
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
Why don't you know this?

114
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
How do you know everything in the world?

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
But not the blind spot.

116
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,160
Weird.

117
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,000
You're like a super smart.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,840
Anyway, I don't think that somebody is I think it like not a joke if he's not on board with

119
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,560
like your sexual preference.

120
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,480
I don't think you guys are friends.

121
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,520
I don't think this is like a question of him picking up the clues or picking up the hints

122
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,400
or getting it.

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
I don't think it's that he's not the sharpest pin in the cushion, as you say.

124
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
I think it's that he's just like, no, I'm going to change your mind.

125
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
And like, you don't want to be friends with that person regardless.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
There's nothing worse than that.

127
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,080
It's hard.

128
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,680
It's hard because like we are we have long been in the camp of like, if you have feelings

129
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
for somebody, tell them.

130
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
And it's hard to like reconcile that with like, tell them just the once.

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,720
And then if it's not if it's a no go because they don't prefer then fucking don't keep

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
doing it.

133
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
Then we need to rephrase it and say like, just tell her, dummy, and then listen.

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,560
And then listen so careful.

135
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,280
Oh, man.

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
Listen so good to the next part.

137
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
It's vital information.

138
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,280
If you're to have a next step, your next step is going to be determined by the next things

139
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,840
that are said.

140
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
And you should be on board with that.

141
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
Otherwise, you're just like watching her mouth move.

142
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
But in your head thing, like, I did it.

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
I asked her, oh, gosh, she's speaking.

144
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,960
I haven't been listening.

145
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,440
Oh, shit.

146
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,160
Did she say yes?

147
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,080
Did she say thespian?

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay.

149
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,600
Actor, no actor.

150
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,000
That's all right.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll bring whatever bacon while you audition.

152
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,000
What a shit show.

153
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,320
Yeah, I don't like this at all.

154
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,200
This is this is I just don't think this person's worth spending time with anymore.

155
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,440
Here's what here's the argument that I would make as to that without again.

156
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
We don't know this cat.

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
Maybe he is a sweetheart.

158
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,960
But picking up on context clues, this is the painting that I'm getting right now.

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
This is someone who's asked you out.

160
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,560
And not only did he not take no for an answer.

161
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,600
He actually like is in denial about who you are as a person in the hopes that you will

162
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,320
change your mind about a lot of things and not just his fucking broken down personality.

163
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,160
And look, his whole situation.

164
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
I think he is just in it because he wants to date you.

165
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
I'm not sure somebody like that wants to be your friend.

166
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,960
It's such an uncomfortable thing for both parties and like it's uncomfortable the first

167
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,760
time and that's why people are afraid to do it.

168
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,360
To keep doing it, to keep subjecting you to that discomfort is like is weirdly cruel.

169
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,640
To himself, right?

170
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,600
To himself, to you, it's it's uncomfortable for everyone.

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
It's uncomfortable for me and I don't even fucking know your real name.

172
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,520
It's uncomfortable for our listeners who have been subjected to this third hand.

173
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,840
There are 30 million people who are uncomfortable now.

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,120
We have 30 million listeners.

175
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
I don't want to be uncomfortable anymore.

176
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,040
We're basically the Big Bang Theory.

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
Bazoon Joes.

178
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Bazooka Joes.

179
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,800
Bazooka Joch.

180
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,960
Hey, here's a Yahoo.

181
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
It's sent in by Rachel Sperling.

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
Thank you, Rachel.

183
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nina.

184
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,760
It's in the pregnancy and parenting newborn baby section.

185
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,320
So Justin.

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,680
I should be able to feel this one.

187
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,180
Yeah.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Nina asks, why does my baby have forehead lines?

189
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
I just have my son a week ago and he was born with lines on his forehead.

190
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
The kind of older people get from raising their eyebrows too much,

191
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
worrying and stuff like that.

192
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Well, why does my baby have them?

193
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,400
I have never before seen or heard of babies having them.

194
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,040
Is it normal?

195
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,840
I keep convincing myself that it's my fault because I literally stressed every day while

196
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,720
I was pregnant.

197
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,000
I know only time can tell, but do you think he'll always have these lines or is there

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
a chance they'll go away as he gets older?

199
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,560
Again, he had them right when he came out of me.

200
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,960
The world's scowliest baby.

201
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,280
I think that I've never heard of a baby with worry lines, but based on the information

202
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,440
provided to me in this Yahoo Answer, I do think this baby has cause for concern.

203
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
RE, his parental situation.

204
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,160
I think that he may have some room to worry.

205
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,080
Well, I think the most worrying thing of this whole situation is that this woman doesn't

206
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,440
know the word wrinkles.

207
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
You know, like those lines, like old people get them, you know.

208
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
Like skin creases, shit.

209
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,280
You know, it's like when the skin kind of like together, you know, it's like a butt

210
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,240
crack on their face.

211
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
You know, you know.

212
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,280
Oh boy, I have never seen a baby.

213
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,600
I would be distressed if I worked really hard to have a baby.

214
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Well, my wife would, but then that baby came out and looked like fucking William Daniels.

215
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
I would be heartbroken.

216
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
I wanted a new human being.

217
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,920
And this human being looks like William Daniels mustache and all.

218
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,640
Maybe that's it.

219
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
Maybe like there's a like knowing soul trapped inside the baby who can't communicate because

220
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,280
it's a baby.

221
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,640
And like all they can do is like scowl and furrow their brow and try to figure out a

222
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,360
way out of this.

223
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,520
Oh my God, is it a Benjamin Button?

224
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
Is this the first?

225
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,120
You got old man baby, the first evidence, the first Benjamin Button in the wild.

226
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,840
The baby was born with wrinkles and tattoos and piercings and glasses.

227
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,760
It was bilingual.

228
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
I haven't seen the movie.

229
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,640
What is the return policy here on the baby?

230
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,960
Oh, I can feel this one ain't got none.

231
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,640
She would think you would think that they would have some sort of like right now.

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,160
My baby has hair on the top of her head and then the rest of her hair is sort of sliding

233
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,120
down a reverse bald spot like kind of a Wallace Shawn thing going on.

234
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm like, oh boy, what is I'm checking for warranties, looking for the receipts.

235
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,640
I don't have any receipts.

236
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,080
I have a social security number.

237
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,760
Oops, mine for good.

238
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
Can you trade her out with one of those like spare babies?

239
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,420
Spare.

240
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,680
No, actually, they do not include burner babies with your baby.

241
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
It's really just the.

242
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,040
Yeah.

243
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,120
So Cabal Cabal, I didn't have a have a baby, give a baby, need a baby, take a baby system

244
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,840
going on.

245
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,360
Just like a tray, like a little bowl on the front desk, just a little ball there on the

246
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
front desk next to the peppermint swirls.

247
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,360
They apparently used to have one, but now they have these bracelets on their legs that

248
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,400
beep when you try to participate in that particular program.

249
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

250
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,880
I thought this was my baby.

251
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,880
I guess I did bring a watermelon wrapped in a blanket that I was gonna.

252
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,080
But that was for eating.

253
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:45,440
I promise I I have to assume that babies when they are born because they don't have like

254
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,920
shit like, you know, marrow or that stuff that connects your bones.

255
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,400
And so I imagine that babies are like the most pliable you are as a human being.

256
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,400
So you could probably nip tuck that stuff pretty easy and just sort of chop.

257
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,280
Yeah, you just get a chip clip, pull the skin back.

258
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,400
You just chip clip it and then it should clip your baby.

259
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,440
Just chip clip it.

260
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,920
All I'm saying is that if much of society thinks is permissible to cut the tip of a

261
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,800
baby's wiener off.

262
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,520
Yep, because it won't remember.

263
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:24,080
This seems like a perfect time for it to go under the knife to get a tuck, a nip tuck.

264
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,600
So face facelift.

265
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,880
You're saying you are saying cut, cut, cut the tip and clip the chip.

266
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,400
Clip the chip and cut the tip, get your baby looking as fresh as the day he was not even

267
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,480
the day he was born, I suppose, but maybe the few weeks ago when he was looking all

268
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,800
right.

269
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Change your kind of change your William Daniels into a Bill Daniels.

270
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,840
Who's a young actor?

271
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Bill Daniels.

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,400
Turn your William Daniels into a Daniel Ratcliffe.

273
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,640
That works fine, but he has some lines.

274
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,080
He has some unsightly lines, too.

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
Well, it's a lightning bolt.

276
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Okay, you don't need to be an asshole about it.

277
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm a 25 year old student and I'm in a pickle.

278
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,920
The vast majority of my friends are women all the way from high school through uni.

279
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,840
Excuse me, college.

280
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,240
Thank you.

281
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,800
And the various places where I've been employed, I'm perfectly fine with this.

282
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
I enjoy their company and I don't feel like I'm missing anything by not having a group

283
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
of male friends to bro out with.

284
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
So I'm assuming this is a man writing this.

285
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,880
However, I'm not doing so well in the romantic scene.

286
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
Whenever I tried asking a girl out, I got rejected.

287
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Even when she was a lesbian.

288
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,360
Stop.

289
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,000
Whoa.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,040
No, it doesn't say that.

291
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,760
I don't need any help getting out of the friend zone.

292
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,040
That concept is stupid.

293
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,240
And besides, I'm quite fine with keeping my friends as friends.

294
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
I just don't understand why I seem to get along with women so well in a platonic context,

295
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
but fail miserably whenever I try to find that special someone.

296
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
Help me out, brothers.

297
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,200
How do I find that other half of my life that I'm missing?

298
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,760
And that's from Lovelorn in the Levant.

299
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,960
Oh, that's a great pen name.

300
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,280
Jesus Christ almighty.

301
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
I feel like we're about to get into some shit here.

302
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,880
I think we're about to get in the shit.

303
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
Put on your muck boots and just jump right in.

304
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
Because yeah, I think a lot of people are like this.

305
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
I know I certainly was.

306
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,880
I think it's safe to say like coming up, most of my friends were, you know, theater friends

307
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,120
all the way up through like high school and even a lot of college.

308
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,080
And so a lot of those theater friends were women.

309
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,600
And I was really good friends with a lot of women, but not such great friends with sex.

310
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,560
I was not-

311
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,600
Sex and I, not close.

312
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,760
Me and basically any erotic activity were not, how I say this, acquainted.

313
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:48,800
Right.

314
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,000
I mean, the answer to your question is right there in the question.

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,120
You've been making friends with women from high school all the way through university

316
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,600
for a decade now, and you are comfortable with that idea.

317
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,880
You're comfortable with that relationship.

318
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,600
You're practiced in like the social ramifications of those relationships.

319
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,160
And you just haven't practiced outside of that.

320
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,920
So like, it's not that surprising that you would get good at the thing that you have

321
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,840
done over and over and over again.

322
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,320
I think the secret is you've got to start back at scratch a little bit when you're

323
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,000
talking about something that could be more romantic.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,320
Like you have to give yourself permission to be kind of a neophyte when it comes to

325
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,760
that, because it sounds like you don't have nearly the amount of experience.

326
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,960
Do you think that those two ideas are mutually exclusive though?

327
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,080
Because I might just be like conflating them in a way that doesn't make any sense.

328
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,840
Because it's super, super, super great that you recognize that the friend zone idea is

329
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:05,760
bullshit and that nobody should treat their pool of friends who are female as a potential

330
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,000
grazing ground if only you know how to make that conversion.

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
That's a super fucked up way to think.

332
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
And that's great that you understand that.

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:23,360
But is there some sort of connection between knowing how to be friends with women without

334
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,600
being gross about it and not being especially romantically adept?

335
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,280
No, I don't think it's about being friends with women.

336
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,440
I think it's just about being friends.

337
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,760
Like you are good at being friends.

338
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,960
You are not so good at romance because you haven't practiced as much.

339
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,720
I think, okay, this is so thwarting to talk about.

340
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,280
I know.

341
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,840
It really is.

342
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,440
The thing that's hard about it is like we are, A, I know we're approaching this from

343
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,000
like a like really crazy heteronormative like position.

344
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So I keep getting tripped up on like gender pronouns and what have you.

345
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,640
I don't think anything we're talking about is like exclusive to anyone's sex or gender

346
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,360
or anything.

347
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,040
I mean, I think that it is completely applicable to no matter where you fall on the gender

348
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,240
and sexuality spectrum.

349
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,720
I think that any, I think all I'm getting at is that romantic relationships are a different

350
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,160
skill set and it's a different thing that you need to learn and part of the reason you're

351
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,280
being so successful with making friends with these people and not in like a romantic sense

352
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,560
is because when you're making friends with people, you're not putting any pressure on

353
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:34,880
yourself.

354
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,600
Exactly.

355
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,920
It's the exact same way as when you're in like a committed relationship, you seem to

356
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,120
do better with people who would find you repellent before.

357
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,960
It's because you're not playing the game, you're not putting a bunch of pressure on

358
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,560
yourself, you're just being yourself.

359
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,800
I will also say this, it makes me think about, you know, like when you get out of a long

360
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,840
relationship and then the next time like you get back in the dating pool, the problem you

361
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,800
run into is trying to jump too quickly to the level you were at in your previous relationship

362
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,560
and like that can screw things up and like you're coming into it going, oh, I'm so rusty,

363
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,320
I'm so used to being in the relationship.

364
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,840
Maybe that same thing is applying here where it's like you're so used to being in a

365
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,960
friendship that you're just like trying to jump to that level of comfort with the

366
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
person because you're so comfortable with all your other female friends.

367
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
I don't think that's necessarily unhealthy.

368
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,840
I think what Justin said was exactly right, which is the only distinction between those

369
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,040
different skill sets is the pressure that you put on yourself when you are trying to

370
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,120
pursue a romantic relationship with somebody.

371
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,040
But isn't that pressure kind of good because it makes you like, you know, performance

372
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,600
or your best and like try your best with a person for some people.

373
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,120
But like I, that, that pressure I think is, is nominal and you don't, there are people

374
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
who let it just fucking wreck everything.

375
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,560
And, and, and that is, that's where you need to pump the brakes a little bit and knowing

376
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,760
nothing about your situation.

377
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,960
I would say that, that, you know, might be the most likely thing of like, well, this

378
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,600
has to be different from how I treat my other friends when really like relationships like

379
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,120
romantic relationships are just friendship with a little bit that extra fire.

380
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,320
You know what I mean?

381
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,880
Whoa, so beautiful.

382
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,640
That's beautiful.

383
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,800
We've been talking very, very seriously for a while and I hope we didn't fart some poop.

384
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:22,960
Yeah.

385
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,440
Okay.

386
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,480
Who are those guys?

387
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
Should we have a Yahoo?

388
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,080
Yeah.

389
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,360
Yahoo would be great Griffin.

390
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,200
This Yahoo was sent in by level 451 Yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

391
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:42,320
Uh, this Yahoo was asked by Yahoo Answers user Sadie who asks, haunted corn maze actor

392
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,120
tips, please.

393
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm working in a maze this year and my character is a saloon girl cannibal and I can't think

394
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,720
of anything to say.

395
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
What would be scary to you?

396
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
How about another bottle of sarsaparilla?

397
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,600
Okay.

398
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,720
So I'm not sure that a portmanteau is like, I know that you're fucking terrified of those

399
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,680
things when people put two words together that should be a part.

400
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,520
Ah, no, thanks.

401
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:05,760
Yeah.

402
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,160
I mean, I'm terrified of them for good reason though.

403
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,560
I mean, look at how I brought this show to a screeching halt.

404
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah.

405
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,280
How about this?

406
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,800
Like, uh, hey cowboy, I bet you get pretty hungry out there on the range.

407
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,400
Care for a bite?

408
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,520
Cause she's a, cause she's a cannibal.

409
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
That's like a slow, that's like a line from-

410
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,000
Where are you going?

411
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
Wait, I haven't finished my sentence.

412
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,800
That's like, that's like, sounds like she's trying to like seduce him and eat him like

413
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,520
a praying mantis.

414
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,680
Right.

415
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,600
It sounds like a line from old west species.

416
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
But also- Is that not what's going on?

417
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
It's just not how corn mazes work.

418
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,040
Where you jump out and you're like- He's gone.

419
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,880
You're like, bruh, hey there cowboy, you look hungry because you've been out on the range.

420
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,600
You've been taking the long road from Tuscaloosa and it looks to me like, ah shit, another one.

421
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,160
Oh, I, I know, just jump out and yell.

422
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,000
I got my masters for this.

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,320
Yeah.

424
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,040
I went to, I went to corn maze school.

425
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,000
I was on three episodes of, uh, Days of Our Lives.

426
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,600
From a, from a day player on psych to this.

427
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,640
I, why do you need characters in a corn maze?

428
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,960
Well, a corn, a corn maze is the fucking scariest imaginable place that you can be.

429
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,480
A, you could die in there.

430
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,320
You could just get lost and die in there.

431
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,120
It happens every year.

432
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,080
There's like 30 deaths.

433
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,160
It's like more than, um, more than shark bites.

434
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,400
Um, B- And way more than shark tank.

435
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
B- It goes, it goes corn maze.

436
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,560
Corn mazes, shark attacks.

437
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,240
And then pop machines falling over on people.

438
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,600
Pop machines falling over on people.

439
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,880
That's exactly right.

440
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
B- corn is the scariest vegetable.

441
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,000
It looks like a knife.

442
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,880
It looks like a knife.

443
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
It's got a fucking hilt.

444
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,360
It has its own scabbard.

445
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
So maybe a sword.

446
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,920
Knives typically don't have scabbards or hilts.

447
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,720
Um, C- Scarecrows.

448
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,160
Right.

449
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,240
It's just there.

450
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,200
It's just right there.

451
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
I just, why not, why not just like wear a scary mask and jump out?

452
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
Do you think the guy who invented the scarecrow,

453
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,160
like on the day he invented it, he was like,

454
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,520
ah, that's pretty, uh, and he invented it during the daytime.

455
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
He was like, I got to figure out something to do to get rid of these crows.

456
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,200
Wait a minute.

457
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,080
I got it.

458
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,040
I'll make a scarecrow.

459
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,640
And he made it up in the daytime.

460
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,680
He was like, eh, pretty good invention, old timey man.

461
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
I think I crushed it.

462
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,520
And then that first night he looks out the windows like,

463
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
what the fuck have I done?

464
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,440
This is this, hey Martha, come look at this shit.

465
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm losing my mind.

466
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,600
Look what I did.

467
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
I made the scariest thing ever.

468
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
So now I'm a, I'm a nightmare weaver, Martha.

469
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
I'm a nightmare weaver.

470
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,040
I am Edgar Allan Poe.

471
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,800
I made a, I made a scare human.

472
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm Stephen King, senior, senior, senior.

473
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I can't believe I just created this terrifying vision.

474
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
I was at Home Depot the other day buying a fire pit

475
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,040
and they had their, you know, they had their autumn regalia out

476
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,200
and there was a fucking scarecrow that was just like propped out in the garden section

477
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
and there were actually crows on it.

478
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,720
Like actual crows just like chilling.

479
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,400
Pretty good scarecrow.

480
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,880
Pretty good job inventor of the scarecrow.

481
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,480
You invented things that can only scare humans and nothing else.

482
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,360
Well done, sir.

483
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,040
No, the world wasn't scary enough.

484
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,200
Let's go ahead and get more stuff

485
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
and make sure that we surround it with knife-shaped produce.

486
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,960
Terrific job.

487
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,160
The worst part about that is that guy had to watch all the time to see if it was working.

488
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,920
He just had to stare at that thing.

489
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,800
Maybe set up like an old timey lawn chair next to it

490
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,080
and just see if the crows were coming.

491
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,520
And eventually they became friends.

492
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,080
I lost a shoe in a corn maze once.

493
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,760
Do you remember those books that like you used to buy at the Scholastic Book Fair

494
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,720
that were like scary story six or whatever?

495
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,640
Yeah, goose pimples.

496
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,560
They were scary as fuck.

497
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,520
There was one about like a scarecrow that like peeled people's skin off

498
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,000
and laid it out to dry on a barn or some shit.

499
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,080
Yeah, but it was actually Richard Gere dressed up like a scarecrow.

500
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,800
Well, I think that's the plot of the hit West Virginia made film Dark Harvest.

501
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,240
Richard starring.

502
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,560
I can't believe they got Richard Gere in that independent film production.

503
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,680
Yeah, it's a big hit.

504
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,720
But actually that's funny.

505
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,560
Richard Gere is in the Mothman movie, which is set in West Virginia.

506
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,720
Right, he was in WV.

507
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,560
He was like, let me swing by for Dark Harvest.

508
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,120
But I'm also-

509
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,560
Let me get into Dark Harvest real quick.

510
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,600
I'll play a scarecrow.

511
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,080
It'll be easy for me because I do that shit in real life.

512
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,720
Every scarecrow you see, Richard Gere's in there somewhere.

513
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
And he wants your skin.

514
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,800
He would love it.

515
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,520
He would love nothing-

516
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,720
That's how he stays looking so young.

517
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
He would love nothing more than to take your skin, put it on himself,

518
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,800
get rid of those fucking William Daniels wrinkles.

519
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,880
When he does that charming Richard Gere wink, that's his eyelid skin falling off.

520
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,680
And he's trying to scoot it back in place.

521
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,640
There's a special motion graphics designer that works on every fucking film he's in

522
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,040
that has to edit that shit out.

523
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,320
That has to edit out the sloughing of his skin to the floor.

524
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Guys, if one celebrity besides Richard Gere had to be every scarecrow,

525
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,840
which actor or actress do you think would be, is like the most like a scarecrow?

526
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,560
I think Jeff Goldblum is very much like a scarecrow.

527
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,080
Well, that's not fair.

528
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
No, he's like an American treasure.

529
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,640
I love Jeff Goldblum.

530
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,800
Are you saying because he has the dimensions of a scarecrow?

531
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,360
Is that what you're saying?

532
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,640
Because that's hateful.

533
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,360
I'm just saying if it turned out he was a scarecrow the whole time,

534
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,080
I wouldn't be surprised.

535
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,200
Bushimi too.

536
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Well, that's-

537
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,640
Okay, I'm sorry, Justin.

538
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,600
I hate to call you on semantics, but you wouldn't be surprised

539
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,640
if it turned out that Jeff Goldblum had been a scarecrow all along.

540
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,320
If Jeff Goldblum just fell over at the Oscars and a bunch of straw poured out of him,

541
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,160
you'd be like, I fucking knew it.

542
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,120
I told everyone.

543
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,080
I'm 33.

544
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,760
It's very hard to surprise me.

545
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,240
We met Jeff Goldblum outside the show door at the Rainmaker and-

546
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,520
I lit a cigarette and he lost his fucking mind.

547
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,560
Explain that.

548
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,760
He said like, what, hey?

549
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,480
He said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

550
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
That's my Jeff Goldblum impression.

551
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
Yeah, it sounds a little bit like Yogi Bear.

552
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,880
No, no, no, no.

553
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,600
But hey.

554
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
We must get away.

555
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,800
We must get away from the cigarette.

556
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,080
Hey, no, no, no, no.

557
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,280
Hey, hey, Badda Badda.

558
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,720
Impressions.

559
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,720
If we're going to afford all of these anti-Richard Gear wards

560
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,040
that we have to hang in every room of our house,

561
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,160
we're going to need some more money.

562
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,440
We're going to need some more intake.

563
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:26,560
Let's go to my room.

564
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,360
Two words, people.

565
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,920
Two words.

566
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,560
Piss beard.

567
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,400
Piss beard.

568
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,920
No, you can't say that, Griffin, because we haven't-

569
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,640
Ah, fuck.

570
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
We broke the time stream.

571
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,600
We ran out of time reversal cubes.

572
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,240
Don't worry, guys.

573
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,880
We're going to talk about piss beards here in a few minutes.

574
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
And you're going to realize why, and you're

575
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,080
going to love the jokes.

576
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,400
Go on, Jeff.

577
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
But the two words are free snacks.

578
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,760
Yes.

579
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,480
If you act now, we're going to give you the opportunity

580
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,360
to get free snacks.

581
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,080
And here's the thing.

582
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,160
Snacks are not only good, they're good for you,

583
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
if you get the right ones.

584
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,040
You got to get delicious, wholesome snacks

585
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,400
at naturebox.com.

586
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,960
We've been talking about Naturebox for, I think, 18 years

587
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,760
now.

588
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
And if you haven't tried it, you are a fool.

589
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,800
You're a fool.

590
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm thinking about-

591
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,560
But maybe this is your first episode.

592
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,840
Maybe you've never listened to it before.

593
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,040
Then you're still a fool.

594
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,240
Here's the deal with Naturebox.

595
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,360
Naturebox gives you hundreds of snack options.

596
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,160
And these are like, really, all three of us are subscribers

597
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,520
and very, very happy about it.

598
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,600
You'll find snacks with no added sugar, no gluten,

599
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,200
that kind of stuff.

600
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,240
It's all in there.

601
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,280
Everything for everyone.

602
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,600
Which makes them sound shitty, but they're actually

603
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,000
extremely good and very delicious.

604
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
I'm thinking about getting on that Benjamin Franklin schedule

605
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,280
where I just eat only snacks 20 times a day.

606
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,560
I have 20 little meals and it'll be like sunflower

607
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,440
kettle kernels.

608
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,960
Known picture of health, Ben Franklin.

609
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,480
Well, later on-

610
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,120
You get to go through and pick whatever you want.

611
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,800
And it's way like peanut butter nom-noms are kind of like

612
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,440
the go-to.

613
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,480
There's like a cocoa nom-nom that's so good.

614
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,280
That's what Theresa and I, all we did was like eat Naturebox

615
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,200
as we drove across the country.

616
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,800
And it kept us going.

617
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,320
Kept us from murdering each other.

618
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,200
It was really nice.

619
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,240
With Naturebox, we used to do a 50% off thing.

620
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,800
This is new.

621
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,440
You're going to get a free trial box by going to

622
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
naturebox.com slash my brother.

623
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,040
You can get five of the most popular snacks for free.

624
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,000
That's huge.

625
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,520
I had no idea that we were doing that.

626
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,160
Here, enjoy.

627
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,440
Oh, are you starving?

628
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,080
Give us your hungry, your tired, your poor.

629
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
Here are five snacks.

630
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,920
If you don't do it at this point where you get a free box,

631
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
like what are you doing?

632
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,400
What's your fucking problem?

633
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,680
Do you hate food?

634
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,480
Are you a plant?

635
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
Are you a plant or a person?

636
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,880
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother, you plant.

637
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,680
Come on, plant.

638
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,840
Come on, stupid plant.

639
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,880
My Brother, My Brother, Me is also supported by Squarespace,

640
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,520
the all-in-one platform that makes it fast and easy to create

641
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,240
your own professional website or online portfolio.

642
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,640
They really are some good looking goddamn websites.

643
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,280
As a person who's taken like two and a half hours of Code

644
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,520
Academy lessons, I can say that this is some sound coding

645
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,480
that they've done here.

646
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,360
Some sound web design and programming.

647
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,280
They have all kinds of presets that you can use that are

648
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,440
beautiful to start out with, and then you can chop and screw

649
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,160
them how you like.

650
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,280
They have a support team that's available 24-7.

651
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,840
They have a logo generator to design your own logo.

652
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,760
Not everybody has their own Justin Russo.

653
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,720
Some people need software.

654
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,880
It starts at $8 a month, and that includes a free domain name

655
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,920
if you sign up for a year.

656
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,440
Maybe you're like me and you listen to other podcasts,

657
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,120
and you've heard about Squarespace before, but you've

658
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,840
never checked it out.

659
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
Well, let me tell you why this is different.

660
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,000
If you check it out using our code, it benefits us.

661
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,280
We get stuff from it.

662
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah, it helps us rather than those other shitty podcasts

663
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,920
that you listen to, so this is important.

664
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,960
It really is great.

665
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,040
It's all responsive design, so your site will work on every

666
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,720
device conceivable.

667
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,040
Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket.

668
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,720
So go to Squarespace.com and use the offer code MYBROTHER.

669
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,320
That's all one word, MYBROTHER, to get 10% off your first

670
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,040
purchase.

671
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
That's Squarespace.

672
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,960
A better web starts with your website.

673
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,800
It's got to fucking be the change you want to see on the

674
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,240
information superhighway.

675
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,000
I got a message for Jeff and Dylan, and it's from Jeff,

676
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,360
but a different Jeff.

677
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,080
What are the odds?

678
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,520
I know.

679
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,480
Jeffrey and Dylan.

680
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,040
Happy five month anniversary, Jeffrey and Dylan.

681
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,600
Jeffrey and Dylan, sorry for the delay, Jeffrey and Dylan.

682
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,920
For the only person tardier than the brothers is me, Jeffrey

683
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,480
and Dylan.

684
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Jeffrey and Dylan, some serious apologies, Jeffrey and

685
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,200
Dylan.

686
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,760
Jeffrey and Dylan, do you want to get a drink later, Jeffrey

687
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,400
and Dylan?

688
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,520
Absolutely.

689
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,640
Fantastic.

690
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
Nothing I can add there.

691
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,800
You did it.

692
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,760
Congratulations.

693
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,680
You split the goof uprights.

694
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,560
We said no goofs on this episode, and yet you managed to

695
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,840
pull one out of the abyss.

696
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,720
Squeak one in.

697
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,360
Then I got another message for Trailer from-

698
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,080
Whoa!

699
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
You could not have fucked that up worse.

700
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,480
It's from Trevor.

701
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,520
Trevor, I'm sorry.

702
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,320
I pined for you.

703
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,800
Autumn is who the message is from.

704
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,600
It's from Airstream.

705
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,360
Autumn says, hi Tee.

706
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,760
Hi Tee.

707
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,120
Hi Tee Tee.

708
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,080
Yep.

709
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,840
That nickname is official since the McBros-

710
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
Sorry, he's got a new better nickname, and that's Trailer.

711
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,160
We made it up called Trailer.

712
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,560
Thanks for letting me paint your toenails and fart on you while

713
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,200
you're sleeping.

714
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,880
I've been doing it for almost four years now.

715
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
Yay, love.

716
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
The shout out is the best drunk purchase ever.

717
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,720
Yes, it is.

718
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,600
You're the best.

719
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,480
And then this says, please follow message with more Amelie

720
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,240
impersonation.

721
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,280
It sounds like she wants Trailer to do that.

722
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,800
I have a happy birthday, Trailer.

723
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,440
I am in your glove compartment.

724
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
I don't think it's Trailer's birthday,

725
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,480
but maybe in Amelie's world.

726
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,560
Happy birthday, Trailer.

727
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,360
In Amelie's world, it's everyone's birthday all the time.

728
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,440
Everyone is birthday all the time.

729
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,800
Fantastic.

730
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,240
Everyone is birthday.

731
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,800
So best-

732
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,680
That's true today.

733
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
Best money zone yet.

734
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,680
Mark your calendars for a brand new thing.

735
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,680
The first ever Max Fun Week is coming up October 15th through 21st.

736
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,640

740
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,680
No fundraising, just awesome stuff for you.

00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,840

743
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
during Max Fun Week, October 15th through 21st.

744
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,840
Oh shit, breaking news.

745
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,800
We've got some farm wisdom.

746
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,760
I can't believe it.

747
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,640
Farm wisdom.

748
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
Put your scarecrow in the barn, farm wisdom.

749
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,120
And then light that barn on fire.

750
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,640
Stop him anyway you can, farm wisdom.

751
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,680
Griffin, I would like you to read it, please.

752
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,180
Okay.

753
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,680
This is the worst thing I've ever read.

754
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,480
This is the world's worst sentence.

755
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,280
Thank you for listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

756
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,960
This is the world's worst sentence.

757
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,640
You're hearing the debut of the world's worst sentence right now.

758
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,440
Here it comes.

759
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,880
All right, you're not, your life is not gonna be the same.

760
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,760
This is going to be the moment that you'll always remember

761
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,520
of where it all started to go bad.

762
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,080
Your whole existence.

763
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,960
There's still time to get out.

764
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,160
There's still time to leave before the world's worst sentence.

765
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,080
Billy goats pee in their mouth and beard when they're horny.

766
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,720
And that's from Cassandra and Micah,

767
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,960
who just ruined the lives of 30 million people.

768
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,920
What Cassandra and Micah do not include is the phrase on purpose.

769
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,600
Is it like an accident thing?

770
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,160
Is it like they're like so horny, like shit, not again.

771
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,440
Oh man, not again.

772
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Piss beard.

773
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,000
I gotta stop getting so horny and then peeing on myself.

774
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,200
Horny all the time.

775
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,280
Uh, hey, Greg, uh, yeah, Mitch, what's going on?

776
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah, Greg, uh, just so you know, I noticed that when my wife stopped by earlier this week,

777
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,840
you know, Darla?

778
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,800
Yeah, I know Darla.

779
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
Yeah, I noticed when she stopped by, your beard smelled like piss.

780
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,760
And I, I want you to explain that to me right now, or our friendship is over.

781
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,240
The reason for that, and I think I figured it out,

782
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,080
is that I watched you piss in your mouth and beard.

783
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,880
So, should we dissect this?

784
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,560
Is there something we need to talk about?

785
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,080
Is there something going on here?

786
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,800
What I want to find out, but I'm not willing to look it up,

787
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,600
is if it's like they do it and react to it,

788
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,720
or if it's just like something that happens and they just stand there

789
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,320
continuing to be horny, gently peeing in their mouths and beards.

790
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,480
Do you think that's why they eat all that garbage?

791
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,600
Because they're trying to find something.

792
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,880
Because they feel like garbage?

793
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,240
I feel like garbage.

794
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,480
This is what I deserve.

795
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,760
I deserve this.

796
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,080
Look at me, I'm a monster.

797
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,760
It's, it's super weird.

798
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,600
This past summer, I went and saw Disney planes fire and rescue,

799
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,240
and I started pissing in my mouth and beard.

800
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,920
So I guess, is it planes that talking planes do it, do it for me?

801
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,680
Is it maybe the whole Cars universe?

802
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,520
I'm changing, I'm metamorphosizing,

803
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,640
because fucking Cassandra and Micah just ruined my life.

804
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,360
Thank you Cassandra and Micah for that sentence.

805
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,520
Do you think Zambonis are the fat people of the Carsverse?

806
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,360
Probably not.

807
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,240
How about a question?

808
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,600
I'm very awkward when it comes to receiving compliments,

809
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,880
and although it's very nice to hear that someone likes something I'm wearing,

810
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,920
or my new haircut, I always have some very odd responses.

811
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,600
I have a terrible habit of needing to respond where I got something,

812
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,400
or how I got it, as soon as it's acknowledged.

813
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,440
Now, if getting these things from somewhere interesting,

814
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,680
or I had a cool story behind them that might be different,

815
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,200
but most of my clothes I get secondhand, or I cut my own hair,

816
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,960
so our conversation usually ends in a lull,

817
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,600
where the person stares at me, waiting for some sort of point to my story.

818
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,360
For others, how can I learn to respond to things without going on long and boring tangents?

819
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,600
Uh, not unlike this question.

820
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,480
Okay, wait, I want to play this out.

821
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,320
Justin, I need you to compliment my hair.

822
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,880
Okay.

823
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
Okay, hey Travis, your haircut's looking good.

824
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,520
I cut it myself.

825
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

826
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,760
Can I- you know, I was laughing when you were reading that question.

827
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,720
I came to the slow and horrifying realization that nobody in the fullness of my lifetime

828
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,240
has ever asked me where I got an article of clothing or haircut in my life, ever.

829
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,920
Is my shit super busted?

830
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,400
Is it because I only wear clothes I bought at Target,

831
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,920
and Target clothes are designed to be almost camouflage-esque,

832
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,520
almost like razzle-dazzle?

833
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,320
They're super fucking hard to like, get a lock on my clothes,

834
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,120
because they're so normal, all my Mossimo jeans.

835
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,040
Where did you get those Mossimo jeans?

836
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,320
I must know.

837
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,560
Was it Target, the only place where they have those?

838
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,040
Are you even wearing jeans right now?

839
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,880
I'm trying to focus on the bottom half of your body, and I can't-

840
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,360
My attention just slides off here.

841
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,440
I'm trying to focus on the same two flannel shirts you've bought 20 times,

842
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,080
but it doesn't seem to stick for some reason.

843
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,040
You literally blend in with everything.

844
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,760
Where did you get your hair buzzed with a size six guard every fucking time

845
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,880
for the past seven years?

846
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,320
I must know.

847
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,200
You pay somebody to do that?

848
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,080
What do you call that?

849
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,960
Oh, I call it the same haircut I've gotten for a long, long time.

850
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,120
No, Rachel does it for me in our backyard.

851
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,520
It's a pretty good money-saving tip.

852
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,160
Have Rachel cut your hair.

853
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,760
Have my wife cut your hair in our backyard.

854
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,640
She does a great job.

855
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,360
She gets a little nervous about cutting the bangs,

856
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,720
which I don't blame her because that is the money zone.

857
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,080
That's my money zone.

858
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:51,040
You know where this gets awkward is I have a shirt that I made with Justin Russo.

859
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,440
Uh, we, we had a clothing line, uh, for a while called 100% Juddalo

860
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,680
because I thought it was pretty funny to replace Jug in Juddalo with Judd

861
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,960
and make a shirt that said 100% Juddalo and it had a picture of the Judds on it.

862
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,680
And I will occasionally receive compliments on this shirt

863
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,720
and then I have to look at this person straight in the eye and say,

864
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,160
Thanks, I'm an idiot.

865
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Thanks, I'm a stupid animal.

866
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,480
You can find some if you want.

867
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,000
But if the question is, I need an interesting response,

868
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,880
I don't feel like you get more interesting than thanks.

869
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,080
I made it myself.

870
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,760
And then they go, what?

871
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,720
No, you didn't.

872
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,320
Yes, I did because I thought it was funny, but now I feel stupid.

873
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
I guess, I guess that's true.

874
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,480
The problem is I forgot the link for so long that I can't tell people where to get their own.

875
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,920
Geocities.com slash 100% Juddalo.

876
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,240
As it turns out, it's Juddalo.spreadshirt.com.

877
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,600
And apparently the last tweet from at Juddalo,

878
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,920
Juddalo apparel official Twitter account was June of 2012.

879
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,760
And I said, the people who have spoken,

880
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,960
Juddalo begins work on his Judd Nelson shirt coming soon.

881
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,040
That lies, empty promises.

882
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,960
So that is not a thriving, I thought that would get me out of the podcast racket,

883
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,920
but it didn't.

884
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,680
Justin, I feel like more than either of us,

885
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,200
you have a lot of distinctive apparel in the form of your,

886
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,640
I mean, obviously the gold standard is your fat mama t-shirt,

887
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,880
a t-shirt celebrating the personal brand of fat mama,

888
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,520
who you might know, you won't know from the television show,

889
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,760
who wants to be a superhero starring Stan Lee.

890
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,920
I do have a fat mama shirt that I bought from fat mama.

891
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,400
The problem is I can't see that shirt in the dark.

892
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,920
Oh wait, I can.

893
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,480
You can, because it does glow in the dark and of course there is a donut.

894
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,840
I've gotten to a point, another fun tidbit about my wardrobe is that,

895
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,480
is that my in-laws, Sidney's family,

896
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,360
have made trips to Tybee Island in Georgia for a long time.

897
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,320
That has been their vacation spot of choice for the past five years or so.

898
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:28,080
And every time they went, they would bring me back a Tybee Island t-shirt that they purchased.

899
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,680
And since I've been going with them,

900
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,160
I have continued the tradition by buying Tybee Island t-shirts.

901
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,520
So I started getting them ironically,

902
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,440
like I laughed because her little sister picked them out.

903
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,120
She was like six or seven at the time.

904
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,960
So they maybe weren't the most fashion forward.

905
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,240
And then all of a sudden it turned out that half of the clothes that I own say

906
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,680
Tybee Island on them somewhere along with some other rejoinder,

907
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,360
like it's five o'clock somewhere in Tybee Island.

908
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,320
This is breaking Southern California news.

909
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,680
Jesse Thorne is burst into flames somewhere and nobody knows why.

910
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,720
You've been listening to Take This Off starring the McElroy brothers.

911
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,440
Beach t-shirts relax me now.

912
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't know what it is.

913
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,800
We're killing fashion one shirt at a time.

914
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,280
Take that.

915
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,520
So sue me.

916
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,800
It's October in West Virginia.

917
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
I'd like to live on island time for a day.

918
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,640
I have Spotify open right now on my computer.

919
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,920
Do you want me to blast you?

920
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,280
Do you want me to put you on blast?

921
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,880
Because I got your history right here in the sidebar taken back by Jimmy Buffett.

922
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,480
Nautical Wheelers by Jimmy Buffett.

923
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400

924
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,840

Treat Her Like a Lady by Jimmy Buffett.

926
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,040

When Salome Plays the Drum by James Buffett.

928
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,640
Havana Daydreaming by Jimmy Buffett.

929
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,320
What the fuck happened to you?

930
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,960
I had a case of the Mondays.

931
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,720
Are you fucking possessed?

932
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,680
You used to be my brother.

933
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
I had a case of the Mondays.

934
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,200
I had this old Monday blues and I was just trying to chase it away.

935
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,240
I just want to remind people of the concept of the show is that Justin makes up one-third

936
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,680
of the team that feels qualified to tell other people how to live their life.

937
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,800
How did you fuck all?

938
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,040
You guys want to Yahoo?

939
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,920
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

940
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,140
Sure.

941
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,440
This Yahoo was sent in by Justin Rubio.

942
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,480
Thank you, Justin.

943
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user JB who asks,

944
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,240
Best fast rap hip-hop songs to have sex to.

945
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,840
I love really fast and loud hip-hop songs.

946
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,200
E.G. Drop by Timbaland and Magoo.

947
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,480
Is that a person?

948
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,640
I believe so, yeah.

949
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,720
Or songs like Lip Gloss by Lil Mama.

950
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,080
I also like fast-paced club music like Warp 1.9 by the Bloody Beat Roots.

951
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,880
That's fake.

952
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,380
Thanks.

953
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,480
Fast rap hip-hop songs to have sex to.

954
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,760
Fast rap hip-hop songs to have sex to.

955
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,680
I like that mystical track, Hit Me.

956
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,280
That'd be a good one.

957
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:01,920
That's pretty good.

958
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,280
I like Bombs Over Baghdad by Outkast except if you do that,

959
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,720
the friction would break all the bones in both your bodies.

960
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,120
Is there a point at which it becomes so sexy that it stops being sexy like Anaconda?

961
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Oh, that's the least erotic song, I think.

962
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,200
Great job.

963
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,360
You made a song about butts which are basically the best part that any of us have

964
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,800
and you just kind of ruined it.

965
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,440
You just kind of ruined the whole sort of concept of what a butt can be.

966
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,800
It did come out of the point where there are like six other butt songs though.

967
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,840
That is true.

968
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,560
I didn't get that all about that bass was about.

969
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,440
So I got confused and I was talking to friends about this the other day.

970
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,400
Is all about that bass about big butts

971
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,280
or is it about like them actually preferring like the low parts of songs?

972
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,400
Griffin, the bridge is I'm bringing booty back.

973
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,960
It just seems like I want her to pick one thing or the other.

974
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,680
But she's all about that bass.

975
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,240
You know what I mean?

976
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,360
Like, like, you're not comfortable with the double entendres.

977
00:44:59,360 --> 00:44:59,840
I just don't.

978
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,560
Do you like the song by JLo and Iggy Azalea simply called Booty?

979
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,600
Is that clearer to you?

980
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,240
Does that like fit more into your concept?

981
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,720
I do.

982
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,440
Yeah, I do.

983
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:09,920
I do.

984
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,040
And I'll tell you why.

985
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
It's because what are we all about?

986
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,760
Booty.

987
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,720
Fantastic.

988
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,280
Thank you.

989
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,680
Me too.

990
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,200
What are you all about?

991
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,760
I'm about bass, like the low parts of music, but I also butts.

992
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,960
And it's like I have.

993
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,720
I've got a hit Bubba Sparks featuring Ying Yang's track for you.

994
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,160
Griffin called Miss New Booty.

995
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,560
Okay.

996
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,800
Wherein the Ying Yang Twins just say booty booty booty.

997
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,720
Yeah, no, that's fantastic.

998
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,440
That's so many songs about booty, but not a lot of songs about breasts.

999
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,320
That's a good.

1000
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,880
That's a great point.

1001
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,760
I mean, you never hear a song that's like, I like big boobs.

1002
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,560
They're pretty great.

1003
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,360
Brass everywhere.

1004
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,480
Brass, brass everywhere.

1005
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,320
Travis, you're apparently not familiar with Sir Mix-a-Lot's

1006
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,880
less popular follow up.

1007
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,840
Put them on the glass.

1008
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,720
But but we.

1009
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,440
Sorry, Travis.

1010
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,200
Sorry, Travis.

1011
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,000
Put them on the glass.

1012
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,040
My ticket and it in a little.

1013
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,400
Put them on the glass for me.

1014
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,040
I just did.

1015
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,600
And it was great.

1016
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,080
I put them on the glass.

1017
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:12,800
I think to get back to my point about all about that base is I think I just think it

1018
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,680
could be two songs.

1019
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,000
I think she could have one song that's like, isn't the low parts of music really great?

1020
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,280
And then another song that's like, hey, now now that we're done with that other song,

1021
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,640
let's talk about butts for a little while.

1022
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,200
I don't think that's what you're saying here with like a like a like queen did with

1023
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,880
we will rock you and we are the champion.

1024
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,920
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1025
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,720
It's a two part song.

1026
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,480
I'm saying it's like the Pure Prairie League Amy into in and out of love with you.

1027
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,800
I'm saying it's it's four play long time.

1028
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,720
I'm saying it's let's talk about butts.

1029
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,880
OK, next part of the song is her Layla and weird ending of Layla.

1030
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,000
That's what I'm saying.

1031
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,840
Travis, that's what I was just about to say.

1032
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,320
Why did Eric Clapton ruin Layla by putting a part at the end?

1033
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,920
That's not as good as the rest of the song.

1034
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,160
Please listen to this for another three minutes.

1035
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,480
How about you already started listening to this and here's some more of a song.

1036
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,760
I hope you weren't looking for the next song on the radio because it's going to be a while.

1037
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,840
I'm saying we have a brain stew situation on our hands or we could.

1038
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,760
I think it would be a much, much improved thing.

1039
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,320
It could be like all about that bass, about that bass.

1040
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,520
No treble and butts are cool and butts are great.

1041
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,080
They are better when they're big.

1042
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,840
That's what my mom said.

1043
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,640
That is just a prototype, I'm assuming you're going to smooth out some of these baby wrinkles.

1044
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,480
Butts and butts and butts and butts.

1045
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,440
Good job, butts.

1046
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,400
Keep it up.

1047
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,040
Hey, but let's talk about you now.

1048
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,960
You have nothing to do with music.

1049
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1050
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,600
And then it's mostly hey after that.

1051
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,720
I would buy that track.

1052
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,600
It's a good track.

1053
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,720
It's two tracks.

1054
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,600
Double your money.

1055
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,400
This is what I'm saying.

1056
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,760
So many young artists, musical artists are fucking broke nowadays.

1057
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,960
All of your favorites, Coldplay, they have nothing.

1058
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,760
They have no money.

1059
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,400
They have no dollars.

1060
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
Because of their song about butts and music.

1061
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,040
It's all about butts and music.

1062
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,600
Exactly.

1063
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,760
Sorry, Travis.

1064
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,400
Sorry.

1065
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,040
Hold on.

1066
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,320
Breaking news.

1067
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,960
Travis, your fucking 100 Lives of Blackjack Savage pull has just been outdone by your

1068
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,520
obscure reference to the hit musical, A New Brain, starring the guy from Caroline in the City.

1069
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,920
It couldn't be done.

1070
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,680
It was so obscure that I didn't even realize it was a fucking reference.

1071
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,800
So that's where we are as an entertainment show now.

1072
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,880
So now one third of us got it.

1073
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,200
What I'm saying, the point that I'm making is that this young lady, this young musical

1074
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,880
artist can double her profits.

1075
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,200
She can have two chart toppers instead of just the one that is going to get the iTunes

1076
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,920
downloads.

1077
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,040
It's all about fucking diversifying.

1078
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,160
But here's the question.

1079
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,520
Does the song about music have the same draw as the song about butts?

1080
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,160
It does if you fucking attach them.

1081
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,240
You know, the good thing about it is that I feel comfortable giving my baby daughter

1082
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,920
a song about music and the low parts of music.

1083
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,400
Exactly.

1084
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,320
Her hearing is fully formed.

1085
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,200
I'm excited about that.

1086
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,160
I can't let her hear a song that's even obliquely about butts.

1087
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,680
Exactly.

1088
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,600
She'll find out about butts in her own good time.

1089
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,720
I'm not exposing her to that.

1090
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
So have you not let her listen to Back to Pooh Corner?

1091
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,400
Travis Patr- Travis Patrick McElroy.

1092
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,560
That was the only good thing left.

1093
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,240
That was the only good thing left.

1094
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,840
And you just took that from me, Travis Patrick McElroy.

1095
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,120
It's all Pissed Beards and Pooh Corner here this week.

1096
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,720
This is the worst show ever.

1097
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,680
Fuck.

1098
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,080
It was the only good thing left.

1099
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,960
The only source of pure joy in this fucking world.

1100
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,800
Oh my god.

1101
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,960
They can't invent good things fast enough for us to ruin them.

1102
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,480
God.

1103
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,360
I gotta call- I gotta call Kellogg's up.

1104
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,440
You need to up your output, dog.

1105
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,800
Okay, Travis.

1106
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,680
I want you- this is not a joke.

1107
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,680
I want you to find the contact information for Kenny Loggins.

1108
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,840
Probably his management, okay?

1109
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,400
I want you to find the contact information for Kenny Loggins

1110
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,080
and I want you to write him an apology for what you did.

1111
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,120
I will do this.

1112
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,000
I want you to apologize to Kenny Loggins.

1113
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,760
You can use our pod- 30 million people listen to this fucking thing

1114
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,360
is gonna get a lot more draw than any change.org petition ever will.

1115
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,720
I want you to use this as your platform and I need you to start right now.

1116
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,680
Travis, right now I want you to go to Twitter

1117
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,760
and I want you to type period at Kenny Loggins

1118
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,160
and I want you to write an apology to him right now.

1119
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,640
And then I want you to read it on our show to our massive fan base.

1120
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,880
I want you to tweet that right now

1121
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,280
because I want people to see it without even knowing what you did

1122
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,480
and then it'll make sense later.

1123
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,320
I want you to tweet your apology to Kenny Loggins right this second

1124
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,800
saying I'm sorry for ruining your song on my hit show.

1125
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,320
Please retweet.

1126
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,440
Make sure you actually use our at nbmbam

1127
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,000
because that's gonna get- if he retweets that, oh my god.

1128
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,960
While Travis is apologizing to Kenny Loggins, we should wrap up, I think.

1129
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,360
We should wrap up our program.

1130
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,680
Max Fun Week is coming up.

1131
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,760
This is very exciting.

1132
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,960
It's been a big time for Max Fun these past couple weeks.

1133
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,280
We just added three new goddamn shows.

1134
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,480
Do you remember when they added Us

1135
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,280
and we were like the first one they had in like 14 years?

1136
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,880
And now they're just like all the time.

1137
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,720
But these aren't throwaway podcasts.

1138
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,440
These are fucking phenomenal podcasts that we've added.

1139
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,280
Yeah, not junk podcasts like ours

1140
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,240
where we just talk about nonsense and apologize to Kenny Loggins.

1141
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,080
These podcasts are not-

1142
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,920
Dear Mr. Loggins, sorry for implying that Back to Pooh Corner is about butts.

1143
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,400
Please forgive me. Hashtag nbmbam.

1144
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,800
Oh, that was perfectly organized.

1145
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,080
These new podcasts are definitely not all piss beards and Pooh Corner.

1146
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,560
It is.

1147
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,280
These are tremendous podcasts and some of them aren't even new.

1148
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,800
Let's talk about the Flophouse.

1149
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,480
That cannot be our featured show of the week.

1150
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,280
I feel ashamed that I hadn't listened to it before we picked it up.

1151
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,400
But fuck me, I listened to it my whole-

1152
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,280
I just got back from Chicago, had a really shitty day

1153
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,840
where like two flights got canceled out from under me.

1154
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,720
But it's okay because I had these good, good goofs in my ear.

1155
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,640
Go listen to the Flophouse. It's a good one.

1156
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,920
Also, go listen to Baby Geniuses and Destination DIY.

1157
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,520
You're gonna love these new shows. I guarantee it.

1158
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,360
And you know, while you're at it-

1159
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,920
Go listen to the other shows that you don't already listen to

1160
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,440
and they'll be new to you.

1161
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,240
I'm coming up on an episode of Lady to Lady that I think not this week, but next week.

1162
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,360
It might be the 15th or the 16th, but they're great.

1163
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,600
And if you've never listened to the show, go treat yourself.

1164
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,520
Go treat yourself. Also, go listen to Bullseye.

1165
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,480
Justin's on that one.

1166
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,080
Travis, blast me through- what?

1167
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,240
What did I say? I said Bullseye, didn't I?

1168
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,880
It's phonetically similar to Sawbones.

1169
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,160
All right. Travis, why don't you blast through the schedule of Max Fun Week?

1170
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,600
Okay, here's what we're looking at.

1171
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,280
We didn't really set up Max Fun Week,

1172
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,280
so why don't we talk about what it actually- with the fucking-

1173
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,160
I don't understand that.

1174
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,680
Okay, so Max Fun Week is just kind of like a community building exercise.

1175
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,000
It's saying, hey, we're not asking for money.

1176
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,720
We're not asking for anything from you.

1177
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,040
We just want you to feel more like a part of the community, the Max Fun community.

1178
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,640
So it's an excuse to get you to listen to shows you maybe haven't checked out yet

1179
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,840
and maybe just kind of reach out and make a new connection.

1180
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,080
And so we have a whole schedule of fun events.

1181
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,960
So it starts Wednesday, October 15th, Max Fun Trivia Day.

1182
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,840
How deep does your Max Fun trivia knowledge go?

1183
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,480
They'll be posting trivia questions on the Max Fun HQ Twitter account,

1184
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,080
and the first person to answer each question

1185
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,800
will get entered in a drawing for like prizes and shit.

1186
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,120
So make sure you're following Max Fun HQ

1187
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,240
and make sure you're paying attention on Wednesday.

1188
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,640
On Thursday, it's all about leaving reviews on iTunes

1189
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,040
and checking out shows maybe you haven't checked out before

1190
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,080
and then writing a nice review or liking someone else's review

1191
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,920
and just kind of getting the word out, building up our, you know, our base

1192
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,280
and our brand and all that shit.

1193
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,280
Friday, October 17th is, well, this one's pretty awesome, you guys.

1194
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,160
Basically, they'll post an audio clip

1195
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,000
of one of Judge John Hodgeman's signature interpretations on Twitter,

1196
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,840
and it's up to you to guess the reference.

1197
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,640
And the first correct answer gets entered in a drawing for a prize.

1198
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,360
So that's fun.

1199
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,800
You're John Hodgeman.

1200
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,000
How about this next one, though?

1201
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,880
Oh, this one's all about the base.

1202
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,960
Chill. All about that base.

1203
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,720
The butts of the music, because you have to fucking clarify.

1204
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,920
It's about butt music.

1205
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,320
Okay.

1206
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,040
On Saturday, October 18th, here's your challenge.

1207
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,920
You got to draw the Adventure Zone Adventures.

1208
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,680
So you can, who can, basically,

1209
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,840
in case you for some reason haven't heard it yet,

1210
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,800
we did an episode of this show that you're listening to now.

1211
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,600
Were you about to say-

1212
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,280
Were you about to read that copy about us?

1213
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,240
Who can forget that dumb shit that they did that one time?

1214
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,600
Basically, what we're looking for is some kind of visual representation,

1215
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,320
whether it's like drawing or painting or sculpting or whatever

1216
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,960
of the characters that we played in D&D.

1217
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,560
And the person who does the best one, the winning artist,

1218
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:12,000
will get a signed D&D Player's Handbook 5th edition signed by all of us.

1219
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,960
All the brothers.

1220
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,920
We should probably do that.

1221
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,920
Yeah, we'll like get on that and shit.

1222
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,200
We'll do it.

1223
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,000
We'll like do it.

1224
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,160
Boy, I miss the Adventure Zone.

1225
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,120
I wish we did more of that.

1226
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,640
I wish we had recorded some.

1227
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,840
I wish we had recorded more of that.

1228
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,340
Jesus.

1229
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,880
It just seems like poor foresight for us to start a grand campaign

1230
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,480
and then not follow through.

1231
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,200
Yeah.

1232
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,360
And then on Sunday, it's all about scheduling meetups in your hometown.

1233
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,120
Make sure to let people know about it.

1234
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,280
Monday, share your favorite episode.

1235
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,480
Tell all your friends about it.

1236
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,440
Make a post on Facebook or on Reddit or on Twitter.

1237
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,200
And then Tuesday is the Max Fun Rocket Coloring Contest.

1238
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,200
They'll post a line drawing of the Max Fun Signature Rocket

1239
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,000
and then you color it, decorate it, whatever you want to do.

1240
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,800
And then the favorite will win a prize.

1241
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,480
So lots of chances to win prizes.

1242
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,840
Hang out with people.

1243
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,760
Get involved and do some shit.

1244
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,960
It's not about anything other than just like celebrating you fine folks

1245
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,120
for listening to our shows.

1246
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,800
There's going to be a schedule posted on the Max Fun Facebook group

1247
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
on the Reddit Max Fun thing.

1248
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
If you follow Max Fun HQ on Twitter,

1249
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,520
you're going to get all of the information.

1250
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,520
There's also going to be some fun crossovers.

1251
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,160
And for our Max Fun episode, our Max Fun Week episode,

1252
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,360
we have a very special guest.

1253
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,880
We're very excited about this.

1254
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,560
Not only is he like an amazing dude,

1255
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,960
but he's like super cool and we're really happy.

1256
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,120
We're going to be joined by John Hodgman himself.

1257
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,760
Who is going to be pleased when he finds out

1258
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,320
that we think he's amazing and super cool.

1259
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,560
Yeah, so if you guys want to let him know

1260
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,880
that we think he's a super cool dude,

1261
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,200
make sure, so if you're listening to this today,

1262
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,760
on Monday, then you need to send us some desperate questions ASAP

1263
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,960
and then get them answered by John Hodgman.

1264
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,880
That'll be very exciting and intimidating and terrifying,

1265
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,600
but mostly we probably won't be funny at all.

1266
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,640
I'm scared about it.

1267
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,400
Every guest that we've had on the show has been more entertaining

1268
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,920
and charming and funny and smart than us.

1269
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,440
So this is nothing new.

1270
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,200
Cool.

1271
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,160
That's Max Fun Week.

1272
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,960
It's going to be great.

1273
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,040
It's going to be a good, good time.

1274
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,360
I actually won't be in America for it,

1275
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,000
but maybe I'll do a Japanese Max Fun Week.

1276
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,600
Maybe I'll try and spread the seed over there.

1277
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,840
Our Japanese listener base is not as big as I need it to be.

1278
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,680
So plant the seed.

1279
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,400
Thanks to people tweeting about the show like Rick Sammy,

1280
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,480

1285
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,560
and we really appreciate it.

1286
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:03,600
Thank you.

1287
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,880
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winter

1288
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,600
to introduce our theme song.

1289
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,520
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1290
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,800
It is, guys, we talk about it all the time,

1291
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,080
but it really is so, so good.

1292
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,160
I was listening to it while I was landing yesterday

1293
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,640
and it put me in a very wistful, intensive mood.

1294
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,160
Also, thanks to naturebox.com.

1295

1296

1300
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,520
I love you to my wife.

1301
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,200
Today is our one year wedding anniversary.

1302
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,840
Holy shit.

1303
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,480
Congratulations.

1304
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:38,800
You did it.

1305
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,080
Happy anniversary, Travis.

1306
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,560
Thank you.

1307
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,800
That's going to do it for us.

1308
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,320
She doesn't listen to the show.

1309
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,360
Well, no, why would she?

1310
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,480
To my brother, my brother, me, Griffin.

1311
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,280
Do you have a final Yahoo?

1312
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,320
Sure, I got a good one.

1313
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,760
This final Yahoo was sent in by Laura Sasha or Sacha.

1314
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,480
Thank you, Lauren.

1315
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jackson, who asks,

1316
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,560

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1320
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,760
This is my brother, my brother, me.

1321
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,400
Kiss your dad.

1322
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:18,000
Square on the lips.

And we are the cast members.

1331
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,320
What?

1332
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:40,960
I don't know.

We break it down so it can forever be broken.

1340

Hilarious jokes.

1341
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,560
Plus, sometimes there's a dog in the studio.

1342
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,840
Sometimes there's a dog here.

1343
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:13,040
We'll see you in your earbuds.
