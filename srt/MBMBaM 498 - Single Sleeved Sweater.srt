1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,520
This is your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Are we really doing the intro?

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,640
Uh, baby, uh, Griffin, don't sew yourself short. Baby brother and mouth sounds aficionado.

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
Okay, but it's just like, I sometimes I say things when we're like scrambling to think of

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,360
an introduction, and then there's an earned period of astonished silence,

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,040
and then we decide to do something else. But you guys are sure you want this one?

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,200
Well, Griffin, why don't you walk it out, take this horse out for a trot, and see how she gallops?

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,880
Let's hop in. Let's check out the mileage on this bad boy. I was just telling the fellas,

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,880
and there's a lot going on. Oscar's politics, and this is the one we decided to do.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,080
Yeah, roll it out.

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,520
Other ones aren't funny. This one's funny.

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
Well, I got this new mouth noise I can make that I just found out about.

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,080
Let's hear it.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,040
And you know, I've made such a big deal out of it now that I'm almost certain

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm not going to be able to do it again, and that's going to be hugely embarrassing for me.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Oh, absolutely.

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,440
All right, here goes nothing.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,960
Now, Griffin, as you pointed out before we started recording, this is an audio medium.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,680
Could you describe visually what we might be seeing watching you?

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,960
Well, it would be impressive. You'd see just sort of my left cheek

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:21,120
convulsing wildly as I created a sort of wet sort of meat slap sound

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,440
of my cheek against, nope, see, it's hard to do it sometimes.

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,480
Griffin, if you were doing Foley, what would you say that this sound is?

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,040
Because I would say that this sound is recreating perhaps a nude person with a penis skydiving.

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,920
Yeah, just sort of flipping and flapping around in the wind.

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,240
Yeah, this is it, isn't it, guys? This is the last thing to joke about.

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,120
Yeah, this is, we've joked about all the other things, we've done jokes about all other things,

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
this is the last thing we haven't done jokes about.

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,040
It says right here, 499, then it just says Griffin mouth sound.

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, I mean, it might be juice, but can I say something?

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
That sounds like the jealousy talking that you can't do this.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
No, it seems like this is the end of it.

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Justin, can you see the mouth sounds?

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
I gotta say juice green's not a great color on you, bud.

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
Nope, that's not it at all. Nope, that's not it either.

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,360
I can kind of hum and whistle at the same time.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
No, that's not anything, we've done that one before.

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Episode 302 is all about Travis's whistling noise.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,520
Justin learned how to do that funny clicking noise back in 103,

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,320
like this is the last sound, Justin's got a point here.

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm not saying it's the last sound, I'm saying this is the last joke.

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
Joke, this is the last one, and I mean, it's not even,

48
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,160
we used a lot of our best material early on and that's fine, but this is it.

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah, I think it sounds like the inside of a cat while it's purring,

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,840
you know what I mean, like if you could really hear in it.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,360
Or maybe a thin steak in front of a high-powered fan.

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
That's a good one, yeah, or like, yeah, that's probably what it is.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,240
Well, okay, wait, Griffin, I'm gonna set it up like this is an old-timey radio drama,

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,920
and you just cue the noise when you think I'm setting you up, you ready?

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,400
Yeah, all right.

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
Hold on, Justin, if you want to play along in the bit, too,

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,640
and play in the space with your two brothers who are out on the playground

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,760
and having a lot of fun together.

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,520
My mouth hurts, I have a sore on my mouth, okay?

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,760
We've all got fucking sores on our mouths, Justin.

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,480
You can be maybe the femme fatale in this radio drama I'm creating.

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Just play, we just want to fucking play with you, dude,

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
because you're our brother and our co-host.

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
Okay, all right, let's get the drama started.

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll do the opening narration, okay?

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,640
Well, starting out like any other day in my detective office that I have,

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,000
and I pop my feet up on the desk, and there he was in the doorway,

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
making a sound that sounded like this.

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't do it if I'm smiling.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Okay, Justin, I'm sorry, hey, pause, time out real quick.

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
I just ramped up to it, Trav.

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,760
I know, but Justin, maybe you've never listened to radio dramas before.

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,480
Rarely is the fully set up as now listen to a character make a noise.

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
That's actually bullshit.

75
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
There's a lot of those radio dramas where it's like,

76
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
and the clumping of hooves was very loud, and it was like this.

77
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,880
That's fair, Justin, but you've proved my point,

78
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,680
because what you did not say is then someone walked in

79
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
making a sound like the clumping of hooves.

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
No, they were making this sound.

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,880
My newest client at Slim Leeds Detective Agency.

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
Oh, I like that.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,800
If you let me get to it, it was the good name of it,

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,920
and that was my next client.

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,160
Let me please pick the audio drama back up,

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,480
and yes, this is going to last the entire episode before you ask aloud.

87
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,120
Are you going to say something about wet jerky to establish the sound?

88
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,240
I think that would be good.

89
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,480
Hey, can I see if I can do it with my right cheek?

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,640
Yeah.

91
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Nope, I can't.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,880
No, that's much more of a broken down jalopy.

93
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
Can we start doing the show?

94
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,200
Is that enough-

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,040
If Travis, if Griffin making these bizarro horse noises

96
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,600
is making the hair on the back of your neck stand up,

97
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,760
we call that nay SMR.

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Oh no, that's the last joke.

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,480
That was the last joke, if one might even call it that.

100
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,160
So there he was making the sound, see, with his voice,

101
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,280
and he said, I have a case for, well, no, you would say to Slim Leads.

102
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,040
Hey, I've got a case for you.

103
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:51,360
I do, hold on, and my dog is sick.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
And also, hey, I'm here, the guy who set up the radio drama.

105
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
I guess I'm sweeping the floor outside the hallway.

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
We've been talking to the casting director on this one.

107
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,600
Yeah, but I'm the casting director.

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,320
Sure, but this happens a lot in this business,

109
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,360
is that you got boxed out a little bit.

110
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
Damn it, I can't believe I cut myself out of this.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,400
It's your look, honestly, Trav, it's just not right for this one.

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,360
We had Justin come in and sometimes an actor just really takes a role-

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
Because he was supposed to play the femme fatale

114
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560
and he took over, I was gonna be the detective.

115
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
He took over, yeah, he's got the look.

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Yeah.

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
What were these two talking about?

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
I couldn't make a hill of beans out of it.

119
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,160
He's so in it, he's so fucking in it.

120
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,040
I didn't know what this had to do with me,

121
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,360
but I could smell mystery was the case.

122
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,680
He's good.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
So what brings you to Slim Leeds, huh?

124
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
Cigarette, cigarette, cigarette.

125
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Hey, what's our first question?

126
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,720
All right, here's my first question.

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,640
What brings you in, what's the case?

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,560
I'm ready to get cracking.

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,880
You know, in retrospect, I don't think I sent out the questions.

130
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
Tough guy, huh?

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,480
Playing tough.

132
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh my God.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm about to send out a few questions.

134
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,080
Here's my first one.

135
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,520
Ah, you just punched, you punched me in the mouth.

136
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,880
That's not a question at all.

137
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,200
Yeah, a little chin question.

138
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,520
And you, you, the smart looking one over there.

139
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
You're giving me a hug.

140
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
Now I'm hugging you again.

141
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
Oh, oh, I feel better.

142
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
It's less threatening now.

143
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,360
Oh, it's so nice.

144
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
Yeah, see?

145
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,640
Unconscious guy on the floor, snap out of it.

146
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
Oh, the noise persists.

147
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,880
Hey, it's me, the Plumber Gamer.

148
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,200
You gotta call a bunch of pipes, make it a funny noise.

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
I can't do it anymore.

150
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
I formed this callus on my cheek

151
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
that's made it impossible to make the noise.

152
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm gonna read the first question, if Justin does it.

153
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,600
I don't have the questions.

154
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,960
I just sent them.

155
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Justin, there's a lively security officer at my office

156
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,640
who walks around and has a rhyming nickname for everything

157
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,200
like Mrs. Brown from downtown or Mr. John who's rocking on.

158
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
I got too depressed by this person to continue

159
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
with the great character of Slim Leads,

160
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
but Slim Leads will return later in the podcast at some time.

161
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
That's a breakout, we might have to do a spinoff.

162
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
When they come to me, they just say,

163
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,560
hey, Zach, I don't have any beef with the security officer

164
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
and I've been here for over six months.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
What can I do to get a great nickname

166
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,240
that's from default name in DC?

167
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
Yeah, there's not a lot of words that rhyme with Zach.

168
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
Yep, Zach Jack Nicholson.

169
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,080
Here comes a sack full of Zach snacks.

170
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
There's a lot of good ones that you could do.

171
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,400
So you want this to happen to you?

172
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,840
Hey, you want this?

173
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,560
You want to be Nut-Zach like you want that?

174
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,600
Griffin, why would that be it?

175
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
The other one or Mrs. Brown from downtown

176
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
and John who's got it going on and Nut-Zach.

177
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,480
He clearly doesn't like you.

178
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
So if I say, hey, I want a nickname too,

179
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,480
he's gonna be like, okay, Nut-Zach.

180
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,960
And then he's gonna give you Nuggy

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
and that's not gonna be any good.

182
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
I don't know why you would want that.

183
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,560
I don't, I had a gym teacher that called me macaroni

184
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,960
and I fucking hated that dude.

185
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,880
Yeah, dude, I used to get that, it's the worst.

186
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,080
I think that this security guard

187
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,000
has come up with mnemonic devices

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,280
to remember people that he thinks

189
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,600
or they think are shady.

190
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,960
So maybe Zach just seems like a real upstanding individual

191
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
and the security guard's not worried

192
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,200
about remembering anything about Zach.

193
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Or he's the only Zach.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
Zach, and he's not, I don't want to call you Zach,

195
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
Zach, the only Zach.

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,840
Right.

197
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,880
The prime Zach.

198
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,920
Either one of those are great nicknames.

199
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
If I was called Zach, Zach, the only Zach,

200
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,920
I would love that.

201
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,320
That'd be good.

202
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
That would be good.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,520
There's a lot of, and you know what, Zach?

204
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,600
You really should count your blessings

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,680
because there's probably a lot of people

206
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,760
that can't even, that aren't eligible

207
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,440
for this treatment.

208
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
Poor Exemplet.

209
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,920
There's a Philip.

210
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
What are you going to do with that?

211
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,960
Yep.

212
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Here comes Philip.

213
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
Philip the Tank.

214
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,840
There's nothing that you can do with that.

215
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,440
So you should at least celebrate

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
that you could one day earn a Nutsac.

217
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
Hey Griffin, did my microphone cut out

218
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
when I said Philip the Tank?

219
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm just making sure because I thought

220
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
that was a really good one

221
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,520
and you didn't acknowledge it at all

222
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,720
and I thought maybe my microphone

223
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
might've gone staticky for a minute.

224
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
No, I just didn't think it was funny.

225
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,000
Philip the Tank, right?

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
Because it sounds like you would fill up a tank.

227
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
It might just be a brain thing

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
that I've got going on.

229
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh, okay.

230
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,480
Yeah.

231
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Zach Braff.

232
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,800
Now maybe it is Zach Braff.

233
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
Zach Braff, did you write us a question?

234
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,400
That's why he doesn't need to nickname

235
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,960
because it would be absolutely wild

236
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
to think that he wouldn't instantly recognize

237
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,800
the star of Alex Inc and Scrubs.

238
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,400
Hey, can I fucking lay it out on the line

239
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,160
for you here, Zachary?

240
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
You don't know his name.

241
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,640
You wicked don't know the security officer's name

242
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,920
or else you wouldn't have called him

243
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
this security officer.

244
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
So that's for damn sure.

245
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,080
Okay Griffin, though, counterpoint.

246
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,520
Zach wouldn't have written an email

247
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,120
that was like, hey, there's this guy Ted

248
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,400
who doesn't know my name.

249
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,560
He's not gonna dox this poor fool.

250
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
But there'll be so cavalier

251
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
about Ms. Brown from downtown.

252
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm just saying you don't know

253
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,080
the security officer's name.

254
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,360
If you do say their name is Craig.

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,520
You can just be like, Craig, Craig,

256
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,960
to the bitter dregs.

257
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,200
And then you know that you're safe

258
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,480
to play with.

259
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Oh, so maybe you're going to initiate play.

260
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,080
You gotta start the play

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,760
in a safe, comfortable place

262
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,520
so that Craig feels safe to play.

263
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,160
I like that.

264
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,920
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

265
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,680
I wish you would.

266
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
This one was sent in by Emma Cant.

267
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,680
Thank you, Emma.

268
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,560
It's Yahoo Answers user Noah who asks,

269
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
is Buzz Aldrin allowed to climb

270
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,000
into the exhibits in the Air and Space Museum?

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
If Buzz Aldrin wanted to go

272
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,520
to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum

273
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,480
in Washington, DC

274
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
and climb into the original Apollo 11 capsule

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,360
that they have on display,

276
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,280
could the museum staff stop him?

277
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,600
Regular people can't do this in museums,

278
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
but he's the whole reason it's in the museum

279
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,400
in the first place.

280
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,480
This question also applies to other situations

281
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
like if Leonardo da Vinci was alive

282
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,280
and he went to the Louvre,

283
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,440
and took the Mona Lisa off the wall

284
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,400
and walked out with it,

285
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,680
could he do that?

286
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,200
Okay, now these are two different questions.

287
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,960
These are two different questions.

288
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,760
Wildly different questions.

289
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,080
Unless once Buzz Aldrin got inside

290
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,680
the Apollo 11 capsule

291
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,080
and he blasted off with it out of the museum

292
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,440
to take it to his backyard

293
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,280
where he would charge children $5

294
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,800
to climb inside and experience a space adventure.

295
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,200
I don't think that that's the same thing though.

296
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Now, could Buzz Aldrin go in

297
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,760
and just take a moon rock?

298
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,200
Was it his?

299
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,880
This is my gift to you,

300
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm gonna take this back now.

301
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,320
I let you all hold my moon rock for a while,

302
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,600
but I need it for a project at school.

303
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,560
Was that an option?

304
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,680
Do you think that he had like one for them

305
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
and he had like another one

306
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,600
bolting out of his space pocket

307
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
and he's like, no, this one's for Buzz.

308
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
I wanna keep this weird moon rock for myself.

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Okay, first of all,

310
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,720
Buzz Aldrin would swallow it

311
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
if he was trying to smuggle it, come on.

312
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,400
Yeah, that's true.

313
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,880
And that's how he became Moon Man.

314
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,600
Now, great hero.

315
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,120
Here's why I think these are two wildly different questions.

316
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,280
Because if Leonardo da Vinci was alive today,

317
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,760
I think he could do whatever the fuck you wanted.

318
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,400
Yeah.

319
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
Right, he's Leonardo da Vinci,

320
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,000
maybe a zombie,

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
but at the very least,

322
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,560
he's Leonardo da Vinci

323
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,880
and he's like 800 years old or whatever.

324
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,200
Right.

325
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,400
Right, Buzz Aldrin.

326
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,480
He's only 90, so.

327
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,800
Right.

328
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,760
Nice try.

329
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
I don't think,

330
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,080
like, do you think,

331
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
like say Tom Banksy,

332
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,120
the street artist,

333
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
walked into your museum and said,

334
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,240
that's mine, give it back?

335
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,480
No, okay, but this is foolishness

336
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,160
and I'm gonna curtail it right now

337
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,920
because we're not talking about stealing.

338
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,800
Thank God.

339
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
I've been to the Air and Space Museum,

340
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,760
it's pretty radical.

341
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,800
You go there,

342
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,640
you see these big spaceships

343
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,000
and there's only like one of them

344
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,800
that they let you actually like get in.

345
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,960
Yes, and it doesn't go anywhere.

346
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,240
It doesn't fucking go anywhere,

347
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,000
you can't touch the steering wheel

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,360
or the go pedals,

349
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,800
like it's dog shit,

350
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,440
but whatever,

351
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
like it's the closest you get

352
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,080
to that big, beautiful, starry sky.

353
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
But if you're Buzz Aldrin

354
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,000
and it's your essentially space car

355
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
that you drove to outer space

356
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,120
and landed on the fucking moon?

357
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,240
Yeah.

358
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,480
Yeah.

359
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,400
I do not see,

360
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,080
I do not see,

361
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,880
okay, putting aside the question of legality,

362
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
is there anyone working

363
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,640
at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum

364
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,960
that would have the fucking gall

365
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,680
to say, hey, Buzz Aldrin?

366
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,760
Get out of the rocket ship, Buzz.

367
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,840
No, and I can tell you right now,

368
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,360
all Buzz Aldrin would have to do

369
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,080
is to say,

370
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,840
while looking in the eye of this person,

371
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
I'm allowed to do this.

372
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,400
I can do this.

373
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,480
Smithsonian said I could do this.

374
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680
And you would say,

375
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,640
I don't even think you would need

376
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,840
to invoke the name of Smithsonian,

377
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,800
I think you could just say,

378
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm allowed to do this.

379
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,280
And no living human being would say,

380
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,520
no, you're not, Buzz Aldrin.

381
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

382
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm not stealing it.

383
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,760
I left my wallet in here

384
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,600
back in like 1969

385
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,280
when I plonked this shit down

386
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,400
on the lunar surface.

387
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,000
So like-

388
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,960
Bad news, you little dipshit.

389
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,760
I gotta go back.

390
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
I promised.

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,920
I promised the moon lords.

392
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,040
Oh, I didn't, shit.

393
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,640
I should have mentioned that actually.

394
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I checked the book out from the moon library

395
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
and I need to return it.

396
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
The fines are piling up.

397
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,120
You can use any excuse.

398
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,560
And that's why you don't have to use any,

399
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,120
I don't think,

400
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,040
because they're just gonna assume

401
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,320
you have moon books

402
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,280
that you need to return

403
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,840
or something like that.

404
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,800
Yeah, they're just gonna assume

405
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,680
you gotta hanker in for some moon chow.

406
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
We are telling a lot of fun jokes

407
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,360
about the moon and space right now,

408
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
but I do not believe

409
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,400
there's somebody working at that museum

410
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
that would tell 90 year old Buzz Aldrin

411
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,840
to get the fuck out of the spaceship.

412
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
This is what I'm saying.

413
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,320
Yeah, but you are gonna need a CID, right?

414
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,040
Cause you probably have a grip of old men

415
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,960
trying to get in that rocket all the time.

416
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,080
You're gonna need a CID on that.

417
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
I'm Buzz Aldrin.

418
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,760
I heard you.

419
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,240
Haunted Doll Watch.

420
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,960
Hi, Haunted Doll Watch.

421
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,440
What do you think about that?

422
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,400
I feel good about it.

423
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720
It's been a little bit bum bum.

424
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,720
In sort of our,

425
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
the closest we're gonna get to a haunted doll

426
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
named after our show, Bum Bum.

427
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,960
Oh, okay.

428
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,520
I didn't know.

429
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,120
I thought that you had just sort of said

430
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,800
like a fun little onomatopoetic sort of like,

431
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,960
like a drum leading us into the bit.

432
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
It's called Bum Bum?

433
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,920
I thought it was like a news sound,

434
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,520
like bum bum bum, like that.

435
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
This one's called Bum Bum?

436
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,280
Okay, is this Tom Green's Haunted Doll or what's up?

437
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
No, he's Bum Bum,

438
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
the haunted clown doll vessel.

439
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,560
Super freaky.

440
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,720
And I have a, actually, before I get into this,

441
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,680
I do wanna ask you guys,

442
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,600
there's nine bids.

443
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
There's 26 minutes left.

444
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,080
What's the highest bid?

445
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
What do you think, 1750?

446
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,120
That's not bad.

447
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,800
Should I try to get in here?

448
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Well, let's hear the descriptors.

449
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,280
We have time to read.

450
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,400
Okay.

451
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,960
Give us the info.

452
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,920
We'll make a decision at the end.

453
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,960
This is like a,

454
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
we've turned this into a reality show.

455
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,640
Yeah, we can play along at home.

456
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,600
God, don't even.

457
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,920
Bum Bum, the haunted clown doll vessel.

458
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,600
You're purchasing a tangible doll.

459
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,160
Okay.

460
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,480
He is a 21 inch plush doll.

461
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
Meet Bum Bum, the haunted clown doll.

462
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,560
Can I, we've done a lot of haunted dolls.

463
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,640
Is this our first plush haunted doll?

464
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
Usually they are like a porcelain.

465
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
Porcelain, yeah, creepier.

466
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
This one's pretty bad though.

467
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
This one's pretty creepy.

468
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,920
So Bum Bum is a haunted clown doll.

469
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,040
And here's the description.

470
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,600
I know this will sound so weird,

471
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
but I can honestly not tell you

472
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,120
where in the world this doll came from.

473
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,080
Okay.

474
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,120
Good story.

475
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,280
I have asked everyone that comes in and out of my house,

476
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,480
if they brought it and put it in my office as a joke

477
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
and everyone denies it.

478
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
I bet you're fun.

479
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
I bet you're a fun person to talk to.

480
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,400
Excuse me, do you have a second?

481
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,760
I have a couple of questions for you.

482
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
I don't know how we got here.

483
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,360
That's what it says.

484
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,920
Oh, okay.

485
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,960
Not how he got here.

486
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
I don't know how we got here.

487
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,640
Neither do I.

488
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,760
Trisha, neither do I.

489
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,160
But I definitely want to get rid of him.

490
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,720
Okay.

491
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,080
I think he may have been passed around a lot.

492
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,320
He is not.

493
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,040
I don't enjoy that verbiage at all.

494
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,320
He is not in perfect condition as you can see from the pics.

495
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,320
Take that, Bum Bum.

496
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,800
Someone has rode Bum Bum hard and put him down wet.

497
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,080
Yeah.

498
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
Bum Bum has had what I would describe as a challenging life.

499
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,520
Bum Bum is not in perfect condition.

500
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,840
I have given him, or the spirit that resides in him,

501
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,480
the name Bum Bum.

502
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,280
Because I hate him.

503
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,560
I named it because I want to be murdered in my sleep.

504
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,840
I named him that because in the middle of the night,

505
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,840
I will hear a sort of chanting and a very low weird voice saying

506
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,760
Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum and then laughter.

507
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,160
So fucking maybe Tom Green actually.

508
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,480
Yeah.

509
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,640
This is like why our son's original name was Guh.

510
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,280
Just because that's the sound he likes to make

511
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
and that's how names do work sometimes.

512
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,280
Yeah.

513
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,120
Because almost every morning when I come down into my office,

514
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,880
he is on top of one of my other dolls.

515
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,960
Do you have any kids in your house, Mayhaps?

516
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
He has also pushed things off the shelf

517
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,480
and has made strange laughing sounds when I'm not in the room.

518
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,920
Well, you didn't call him ha ha, did you?

519
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,120
No.

520
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,000
And also made strange laughing sounds

521
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
is maybe the wildest way of saying laughs.

522
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,920
Like we're just, okay, not an efficiency of language.

523
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,600
I honestly don't think my other spirits like him very much.

524
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,080
Oh.

525
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,080
I just need to be honest about that.

526
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,640
Wait, hold on.

527
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,200
I honestly don't think my other spirits like him very much.

528
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
I just need to be honest about that.

529
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,360
Finally.

530
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,720
Let me get this off my chest.

531
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,560
Yeah, he seems like kind of a predator.

532
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,240
I don't really enjoy Bum Bum.

533
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,600
I can see Trisha doesn't either.

534
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
I'm guessing that if you had time to spend with him

535
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,320
and figure out what the backstory of the spirit that resides in him is,

536
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,920
then he probably would settle down and act better.

537
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,520
Yeah, Trisha, it sounds like you're taking

538
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
some pretty fucking big logical leaps

539
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,040
to get this thing out of your house, huh?

540
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,280
I also, I love it in these haunted dolls

541
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,320
when you can see where the seller remembered

542
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,920
like they're trying to sell something

543
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,720
where they're like, yeah, this doll really blew out.

544
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,800
Do you want someone to buy this?

545
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
You know, if you really took the time with Bum Bum,

546
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,360
I bet he'd come around and be a great friend.

547
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,880
A great friend.

548
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,440
At this time, I have too many dolls

549
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,160
and cannot spend enough time with all of them.

550
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,680
I hear that though.

551
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,400
I hear that.

552
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,680
That's a tough, that's a tough scenario.

553
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,400
Most of these dolls do not need so much attention,

554
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
but for him to settle down, he will need it.

555
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,800
Handle with care.

556
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
And then it has a thing about-

557
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,040
This is fake bullshit.

558
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,480
This is fake bullshit.

559
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,360
Now here's what's up.

560
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
1750.

561
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,760
Let me go ahead and crank $20 down on it

562
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
and you all can tell me when, okay.

563
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,560
That was not high enough.

564
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,400
I've been instantly outbid.

565
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,320
I can do 24, 25, 26.

566
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,960
What do y'all think?

567
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
I think you should do 26

568
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
because frankly, Cooper's birthday's coming up.

569
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,240
Outbid.

570
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,600
Damn it, 30.

571
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,560
So, wow.

572
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,600
People, you think 30?

573
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
Don't let Bum Bum slip through your fingers.

574
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,960
Cut your losses, Juice.

575
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,040
30, no.

576
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,240
I've been outbid again.

577
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,000
I am driving up the price of this.

578
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes.

579
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,400
This doll.

580
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,040
$36?

581
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,440
Yes, that got it.

582
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,480
What are you gonna-

583
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
Oh wait, I don't want it.

584
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,520
Oh no.

585
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,920
Well, looks like we got ourselves a new mascot.

586
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,720
That was so fast.

587
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,280
It should be here before our show in Cincinnati.

588
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,600
Okay.

589
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,320
So I can throw it into the crowd.

590
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,120
Throw Bum Bum out there into the crowd.

591
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,280
I'm just gonna raise my maximum bid

592
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,320
because now I really want him.

593
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,360
$5,000.

594
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,960
Your eBay just emailed me.

595
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,840
Your bid's winning now,

596
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,040
but watch out for competition for Bum Bum.

597
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,240
The haunted club doll vessel's super freaky.

598
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,560
He is super freaky.

599
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,120
He's a nasty little doll.

600
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
He's a nasty little nasty boy.

601
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
And you don't take home the mother.

602
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
So I just raised that bid one more time.

603
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,240
Now I feel comfortable.

604
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
I still want to get an email during the show

605
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
that's like Bum Bum is gone

606
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,720
and I have to interrupt the entire show.

607
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,440
How's the show going?

608
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
Bum Bum died.

609
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,800
You and your brother's telling fun jokes.

610
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,560
You'll never see Bum Bum again.

611
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,680
I miss Bum Bum already.

612
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,800
Can you read the next question?

613
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,680
It'll get the taste of Bum Bum.

614
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
I love that, Griff.

615
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
I work at Dunkin' Donuts.

616
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
They put donuts in parentheses.

617
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,000
Have the strength of your convictions.

618
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,360
You're just called Dunkin' now.

619
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,520
And I have many customers that I see every day.

620
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
One of my regulars is a guy,

621
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,080
maybe late twenties, that smells really fucking good.

622
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,600
Every time he walks in,

623
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,680
the whole store suddenly smells better.

624
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,440
How do I compliment him on his good smell

625
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,480
without it being weird?

626
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,360
Could I at least ask him where slash how

627
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,040
he got this good smell?

628
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,280
That's from good smells in the Smoky Mountains.

629
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,240
I recently got a new cologne

630
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,440
from a service that kind of tells you

631
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,040
what cologne would be good for you.

632
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,880
And I'm not gonna fucking name them

633
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
because they didn't pay,

634
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
but like basically I did this.

635
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,160
And the first day I put it on,

636
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,320
I was signing my daughter in at school

637
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,400
and there was several parents gathered around

638
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,720
and one of the moms walked up

639
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,040
and was like, hmm, somebody smells good.

640
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,880
And this woman next to me has the fucking audacity.

641
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,720
Has the sheer gall to announce

642
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,440
that it's probably her body splash.

643
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
Is it Trisha?

644
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,800
Is it probably your body splash?

645
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,720
It sniped your stink, bruh.

646
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,200
Wow.

647
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
Is this, or is it the fucking heat

648
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,200
I am bringing today with my new perfect stink?

649
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,440
No, it's not you.

650
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,760
It's not your body splash.

651
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
It's my amazing aroma.

652
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,800
The point of this is I knew that compliment was for me

653
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,160
and my ego dined off of it for the rest of the week,

654
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,120
just feeling like a cool, good smelling person.

655
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
I think, J-Man, I think that that was

656
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,720
a win-win scenario for you

657
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,360
because I think everyone knows it wasn't her

658
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
and everyone knows it was you.

659
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,200
So not only did you smell great, she sounded bad.

660
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
Yeah, that's great.

661
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
I would argue that if somebody walks into a room

662
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,920
and changes the entire aroma dynamic of that chamber,

663
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,960
it doesn't matter how good or bad that smell is.

664
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
I think that smell is probably too assertive.

665
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
Especially a bakery.

666
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,560
A bakery has its own cologne.

667
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,800
Well, are we calling Dunkin' a bakery?

668
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,920
I mean, it is a lowercase b bakery.

669
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Very stuffed, baked there.

670
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,440
Is that, do you know that to be true?

671
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,160
I don't think you do.

672
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,400
I don't, I don't.

673
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,960
Now that you mention it, I assume so.

674
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,960
Something's baked there.

675
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,880
I'm sure I've seen an oven for my sandwiches.

676
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
So let's just try a few things, okay?

677
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:22,800
Okay.

678
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
Okay.

679
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,720
Hey, that smells good.

680
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,120
Is that you?

681
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,640
Nope, nope.

682
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:27,920
Why not?

683
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
I don't think you say that smells good.

684
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,760
Hey, what's that good smell?

685
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,240
Is that you?

686
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Hey, Choice Aroma.

687
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
Ooh, that's getting closer.

688
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,200
Why don't you just say that?

689
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
Just say it, folks.

690
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,680
YOLO.

691
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,720
Just tell somebody they smell fucking good.

692
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,720
Okay, let me try something.

693
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,520
Let me try something.

694
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,080
What cologne are you wearing?

695
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,200
It smells great.

696
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,120
Uh, presumptuous.

697
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
What is your scent?

698
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,240
That's bad.

699
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,560
You obviously know that you've ramped into a bad sort of-

700
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,080
Tell me about your musk.

701
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,400
That's-

702
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Enumerate your musk.

703
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,320
Let's play a fun game, and we'll-

704
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
You've got a lot of great notes.

705
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,880
Let's try and say an innocuous thing in a terrible way,

706
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
or a terrible thing in an innocuous way.

707
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,200
I don't think either one is gonna get you there.

708
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,960
Okay, let me try.

709
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,240
All right, this is gonna sound a little weird,

710
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
but I would love to eat your smell.

711
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,040
Now, which one was that, Justin?

712
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,720
Yeah.

713
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:28,960
Okay.

714
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,200
So obviously, don't say that.

715
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,880
Let me try this.

716
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,160
Is someone wearing perfume?

717
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,560
Yummy!

718
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,480
Is not gonna get you there either.

719
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:38,640
No.

720
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,360
Hey, I was just huffing what you're bringing, and I love it.

721
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
Hey, can you walk a little closer?

722
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,600
I'd love to get another huff.

723
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,040
Ooh, I like that.

724
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,080
I think what we're hitting on is it is intensely personal

725
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
to comment on another person's aroma, right?

726
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,040
Yeah, but-

727
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,320
It's intensely personal.

728
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,800
Unless-

729
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
Unless-

730
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,880
Unless-

731
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,480
They wouldn't put on an odor that waffable

732
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,680
if they didn't want to get waffed.

733
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,760
I don't know that that checks out.

734
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,480
If you walk into a room and change the scent matrix of that room-

735
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,160
Right, which you shouldn't be doing.

736
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,080
You put on a scent hoping it will be detected by others.

737
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,400
Yeah.

738
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,520
I tell you this, sometimes I'll get ready in the morning, and I shower,

739
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,920
and maybe I put on a little lotion afterwards, and I'm feeling very cute,

740
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,280
and then I go to join my family, and my daughter says,

741
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,240
you smell great, and that makes you feel nice.

742
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,920
Yeah, she's a child though.

743
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,280
But here's what I'm saying.

744
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,320
Maybe the problem is you do not have a previous relationship with this customer.

745
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,800
Maybe you smell great needs to not be the first thing you say to them.

746
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,440
Yeah.

747
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,760
So you're saying you develop a relationship

748
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,920
so you have a pretext for complimenting their smell.

749
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,480
Correct.

750
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,760
That seems backwards to me.

751
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,280
Wow, that's weird.

752
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,120
I'm not saying you date for six months before you do it.

753
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,600
I'm saying maybe it's not the first thing you say.

754
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,160
Maybe it's like, hey, thanks for stopping by.

755
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,320
It's good to see you again.

756
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
If I could get some people to co-sign my legislation

757
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,400
mandating that the only smell people are allowed to put on their body

758
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,440
is Old Spice's Pure Sport, the default smell for human beings,

759
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,360
we wouldn't be running into that situation.

760
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,880
We would be working at Dunkin' and someone would come in and be like,

761
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
who smells like Old Spice Pure Sport?

762
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,800
And everybody will crane their necks.

763
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,200
Why that's me, because legally,

764
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,040
the only smell you're allowed to have is Old Spice Pure Sport.

765
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,800
I have some challenging news here.

766
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,520
Nobody wants to get behind this with me.

767
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,600
I'm not giving fucking free plugs to anybody.

768
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
It's 2020.

769
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,040
I'm going to fill my life with Laughter and Love

770
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,640
and fill my wallet with that fucking advertising dollar.

771
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
And get down to business.

772
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,240
And no, you can't.

773
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,360
You shan't, you can't.

774
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,320
I have a troubling alert.

775
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,240
There's 13 minutes left in the race for Bum Bum

776
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
as I've come to think of it.

777
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,800
And now, Bum Bum, I've been watching the bidding price creep steadily up

778
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,960
to just refreshing the page and it keeps jumping up by twos

779
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,520
as someone tries to get to what my reserve is.

780
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,560
And it's 66, 68, and now I've seen it go to 70.

781
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,960
And now, now we're at 72 and they're just fucking chilling.

782
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,120
And I'm so, somebody wants this fucking doll terribly.

783
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,600
And Justin, what's your reserve?

784
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
They want it terribly.

785
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,360
What's the reserve?

786
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,160
That's not the important thing.

787
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:42,000
The important thing is that it's for the bid.

788
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,040
That's huge.

789
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,040
There's someone with a W at the beginning of their username.

790
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,240
And they just bid.

791
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm looking at the history of this now.

792
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,480
60, 62, 65, 67, 69, nice, 71.

793
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,480
And I'm still sitting pretty.

794
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,880
And apparently at 71, they're like, that's too much for this.

795
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,160
Too rich for my blood.

796
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,280
Here's the thing that is tripping me out about this.

797
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,160
I want to talk about right now.

798
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:16,240
If you're going to bid $71 for a very bad doll,

799
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,720
you believe that it is haunted with a ghost, correct?

800
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,200
Right.

801
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,480
You must on some level, unless you're doing a competing podcast,

802
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
let's rule that out.

803
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,800
You must on some level believe this is a doll with a ghost inside it, right?

804
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,040
Yeah.

805
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,360
Yeah, so what is it in your psyche where you're like,

806
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,760
I'll buy a ghost for $71, but I'm not going to buy a ghost for $73.

807
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,360
That's too much.

808
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,520
Well, Justin, I'll tell you, I've been doing a lot of budgeting.

809
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,440
And I think the problem is we're only halfway through the month.

810
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,400
And they're worried that they're going to use up all of their haunted

811
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,960
toy budget early on in the month.

812
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,800
And then at the end of the month, they're going to see something

813
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,200
they really want for $73 and oh, no, they don't have it left in the budget.

814
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,080
Relatable.

815
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,720
Speaking of budgets, let's go to the money zone.

816
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,240
Yeah, I'm going to need to go to the money zone

817
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,160
after I just raise this fucking reserve again.

818
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm going to brush those teeth.

819
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,000
Now let's talk because I was excited about mine.

820
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,960
Okay, what was yours?

821
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,480
Because it's probably better than mine.

822
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
Going to brush those teeth with Quip.

823
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,480
So that's like saying that's like me planting my flag in the ground.

824
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:34,960
Like, hey, everybody.

825
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,320
Oh, okay.

826
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,200
Can I try mine?

827
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, sure.

828
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,360
You got to Quip it.

829
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,400
Quip it good.

830
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,960
Ah, shit.

831
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,960
That's pretty good.

832
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,160
I feel like they were both good.

833
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,280
You take this then.

834
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,360
Since I just want to get a hand on the ball.

835
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,240
Justin, you want to?

836
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,120
I put my hand up on your hip.

837
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
When I Quip, you Quip, we Quip.

838
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,240
It's pretty good.

839
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,480
Fuck, I think that's the end of the ad.

840
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,040
Thanks Quip.

841
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,120
Quip, it's tooth.

842
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,600
Quip, it's tooth is pretty fucking good, man.

843
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,440
I Quip my hair back and forth.

844
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,000
I Quip my hair back and forth.

845
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,360
These people make toothbrushes.

846
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,720
Yeah, can you believe it?

847
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:12,960
What?

848
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,080
In this day and age, the audacity.

849
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,320
These are toothbrushes with electricity in it.

850
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:27,520
That's right, the stuff from Lightning and they do it for two minutes.

851
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,200
It's got sensitive sonic vibrations with a built-in timer and 30 second pulses.

852
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,120
Are there tiny people in there who are shaking the toothbrush?

853
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,920
We don't know.

854
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,520
The science isn't back yet.

855
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,320
Is the electricity hurting the little toothbrush people?

856
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,400
Probably, but your teeth are going to be so clean.

857
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,200
Your mouth so fresh.

858
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,120
Go to getquip.com slash my brother right now.

859
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Get your first refill for free.

860
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,280
That's a new stand in defiance of God and hold electricity in your hand

861
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,400
and let it touch your teeth.

862
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,280
Quip is the Prometheus of tooth brushing.

863
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
You will harness the power of the cosmos.

864
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,480
Go to getquip.com slash my brother and that's Quip.

865
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,320
That is the Good Habits Company.

866
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,200
Hold on just one second.

867
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,160
I need to email Max Fun and just figure out when we're going to reschedule

868
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,200
this ad that we're going to have to make up for Quip.

869
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,480
If you just give me a second.

870
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,280
Oh, you know what?

871
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,880
I don't have to email him.

872
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,880
I can send a letter because sending a letter can be as easy as sending an email

873
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,560
when you can do it at home.

874
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,280
Fuck off.

875
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
With stamps.com.

876
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,720
What?

877
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,360
You know, it could be if you got a busy day ahead of you

878
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,680
and maybe you don't have time to get to the post office.

879
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,800
Well, good news.

880
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,280
You can do the stamps for yourself.

881
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,720
Everybody do the stamps.

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,680
That kind of savings really adds up, especially for small businesses.

885
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,840
If there's a business listening to this, hello.

886
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,840
Hi, business.

887
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,280
Hi, business.

888
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,920
You sentient weirdo.

889
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,280
Why are you listening to podcasts?

890
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,560
Get back to earning capital.

891
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,760
Stamps.com brings all the services of the US Postal Service right to your computer.

892
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,680
Whether you're a small office sending invoices, that's impossible.

893
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,960
You can't be a small office and a person listening to a podcast.

894
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
It just doesn't make sense.

895
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,840
It's that small an office, Justin.

896
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,960
The office is inside one person.

897
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,720
You don't need me for this.

898
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,840
It's a computer that lets you print stamps, okay?

899
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,240
Oh no, don't give it away.

900
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,520
Stamps.com, it's a website that does stamp.

901
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,360
Right now, our listeners can get a special offer that includes a four-week trial

902
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,880
plus free postage and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

903
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,760
Except the commitment of telling people it's not for drugs

904
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,440
every time they see it at your house.

905
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,360
That is a commitment you are making.

906
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,200
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage,

907
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,120
and type in my brother.

908
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
That's stamps.com.

909
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,560
Enter my brother.

910
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,480
Hey, everyone.

911
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,080
It's I, John Hodgman of the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

912
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,800
And I, Elliott Kalin of the Flophouse podcast.

913
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,040
And we've made a whole new podcast.

914
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,400
A 12-episode special miniseries called iPodius,

915
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,200
in which we recap, discuss, and explore

916
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,800
the very famous 1976 BBC miniseries about ancient Rome called I, Claudius.

917
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,400
We've got incredible guests such as Gillian Jacobs, Paul F. Tompkins,

918
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,920
as well as star of I, Claudius, Sir Patrick Stewart,

919
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,720
and his son, non-sir Daniel Stewart.

920
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
Don't worry, Dan, you'll get there someday.

921
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
iPodius is the name of the show.

922
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,360
Every week from Maximumfun.org for only 12 weeks.

923
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,480
Get them at Maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

924
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,840
Reach for the stars.

925
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,720
Oh, okay.

926
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,160
I got scared there for a minute.

927
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,440
No, it's the only one of my bits that's any fun.

928
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,400
Reach for the stars.

929
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,640
I'm going to give you reviews from the service Amazon.

930
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
I'm going to tell you the number of stars in the review,

931
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,120
and you're going to try to guess the product.

932
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,620
Okay.

933
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,980
Now, this is one out of five stars.

934
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,820
The subject line is dirty and looked used.

935
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,100
I bought this as a gift for a friend.

936
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,620
She liked the thought,

937
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,260
but when she opened it from the shipping package,

938
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,540
it was dirty, sticky, and looked gross.

939
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,380
I wish I had opened it first

940
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,780
because I would maybe have been able to clean it up

941
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,300
and make it look new.

942
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,800
Hmm.

943
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,180
See, I was going to say some sort of funny prop, like a fake.

944
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,780
Well, hold on, I feel like my best bet here

945
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,060
is to always lead with fake poopy of some kind.

946
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,140
So I'll start with that.

947
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,580
I will say along that vein,

948
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,620
you are in the right ballpark.

949
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,020
These are all gag gifts.

950
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,520
Okay.

951
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,300
I'm just saying this bit's going to get awfully easy

952
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,780
if it's always fake poopy or throw up or pee pee.

953
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,180
It's not always going to be fake poopy or throw up.

954
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,420
They're just, the reviews for them are so good.

955
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,940
X-ray specs?

956
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,380
Oh, good guess, good guess.

957
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,180
Okay, this next one, there's another one out of five stars.

958
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,700
Subject line, not cute.

959
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,860
I bought this for a gag gift, but it wasn't funny.

960
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,780
It was just ugly.

961
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,280
Hmm.

962
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,620
Hmm.

963
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,220
Maybe like a nasty face?

964
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,740
Like a mask that makes your face look like a nasty face.

965
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,500
Faked teeth?

966
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,860
Like funny fake teeth?

967
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,900
Ooh, that's a good guess.

968
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,700
Okay, one more.

969
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,700
One out of five stars.

970
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,100
Hollow plastic, not durable.

971
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,940
Got it for a gag gift for the wife.

972
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,860
Knocked it off the counter before ever using it and it broke.

973
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,100
The plastic is hollow and is not durable for drops and use.

974
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,620
With wine, dot dot dot, things will be dropped, dot dot dot, eventually.

975
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,260
Okay, wait, okay.

976
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,060
Is it a giant novelty wine glass?

977
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,560
No.

978
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:52,900
Damn.

979
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,100
Is a wine glass by the slope kind of supposed to be a wiener?

980
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,820
Oh, so close, Griffin.

981
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:05,060
It is the Sir Perky novelty bottle stopper, where the stopper is his penis.

982
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,700
Shit.

983
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,500
So it's like a guy, but his dick's out and he fucks your wine to keep it fresh?

984
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,620
Correct.

985
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,620
So someone got that and they're like, this isn't cute.

986
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,860
I don't know what I was doing.

987
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,220
Now, this isn't cute.

988
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,660
This next product, I normally tend to stick to the one star reviews or the five star reviews,

989
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,580
but I found a new plethora of fun in the three out of five star reviews.

990
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,340
The nice middle of the road.

991
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,860
This is three out of five stars.

992
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
Not sure how good it is going to be.

993
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:38,660
What?

994
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,180
Is that it?

995
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,420
Yep.

996
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,780
Three stars, not sure how good it is going to be.

997
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,420
Uh huh.

998
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:46,660
Okay.

999
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,060
This is a kind of preemptive review.

1000
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,700
Right.

1001
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,140
There's literally nothing I could use.

1002
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,500
A preview, if you will.

1003
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,380
Uh, this one's another three out of five stars.

1004
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,740
Subject line, nah.

1005
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,100
And the text is, nah.

1006
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,820
You know we can't guess it from these clues.

1007
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,300
Oh, I know.

1008
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,780
Don't worry.

1009
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
I've got one at the end here, but here's another one.

1010
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,380
This is another three out of five.

1011
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,140
Subject line, fair.

1012
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,620
The text, not a bad product.

1013
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,740
So kind of the perfect three out of five star review.

1014
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,180
It's not bad.

1015
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,300
That's like life minutes you don't get back.

1016
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,780
You know what I mean?

1017
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,140
I'll be like, I sort of like this.

1018
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,740
Okay, I'm going to go let everyone know.

1019
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,180
I'm going to go spread the word.

1020
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Now, this one I think is going to give it away.

1021
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,780
This is a four out of five star.

1022
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,980
Uh, bought this and it's going to give it away because it says what it is in the review.

1023
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,860
But I like the direction the end of the review takes.

1024
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,300
Bought this for a random gift exchange with friends.

1025
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,900
Cute, easy to use, held up well over multiple uses in the microwave, and enjoyable for most

1026
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,900
people who love s'mores, even when not camping or near a fire.

1027
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,580
Otherwise unnecessary.

1028
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,300
Just use a plate on top of the s'more on top of another plate.

1029
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,700
So prevent the marshmallow from pumping up too much rather than melting properly.

1030
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,220
Is this a microwavable s'more maker?

1031
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,180
That is Craig's.

1032
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,300
But this person just chose to just undermine the whole industry by giving away the secret of

1033
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,620
just use another plate on top of it.

1034
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,340
Yeah, wait a minute.

1035
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,780
You don't need this.

1036
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,900
No one needs this.

1037
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,060
Wait a minute, what am I doing?

1038
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,660
What are any of us doing?

1039
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,780
Oh, how about another question?

1040
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,460
Yeah, how about a yahoo actually?

1041
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:29,940
Whoa.

1042
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,300
Oh, sure.

1043
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,340
I have a hole in the armpit of my sweater that I've just found.

1044
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,740
Oh, is this the yahoo?

1045
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,180
No, this is just like my day.

1046
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,300
I got it, by the way.

1047
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,860
I didn't want anybody to know, but I got it.

1048
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,020
Cincinnati, Bum Bum is coming for you.

1049
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,140
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1050
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,340
This is my home where I live.

1051
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,020
Yeah, well, now Bum Bum moves there too, because I'm going to hide him somewhere.

1052
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,420
The rafters of the city.

1053
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,260
Are you ripping your shirt open like the Hulk?

1054
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,660
What did you do?

1055
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:19,380
Did you just live on camera destroy your shirt?

1056
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:25,860
Griffin has now, boy, I'm glad I'm recording this call.

1057
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,860
Griffin has now ripped his shirt sleeve off.

1058
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,940
He's ripped his shirt sleeve off and is flexing for us.

1059
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,380
Which one do you guys want?

1060
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,380
The bear barracuda here?

1061
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,660
Or this guy that's still in a big, long sweater sleeve.

1062
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,700
What are my options again?

1063
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,100
Griffin, why did you ruin your sweater just now?

1064
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,500
What are my options again?

1065
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,780
Do you want this guy?

1066
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,940
You know what you're going to get when you go through this door.

1067
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,220
This door, you don't know.

1068
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,180
Maybe it's weaker.

1069
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:03,060
It has to be weaker than this one, because this one's fucking huge, but maybe it's not, right?

1070
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,460
Right, yeah, that's true.

1071
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm half intimidated right now.

1072
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,100
Good, you should be.

1073
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,220
The sweater was already ruined.

1074
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,860
It had a huge hole in the armpit, and that's no good for me.

1075
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,820
Here's a, I got to get this big, intimidating picture of Buzz Aldrin off my fucking screen.

1076
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,540
Okay, here's a Yahoo.

1077
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,860
This one was sent in by Michelle.

1078
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,900
Thank you, Michelle.

1079
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,140
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Carol, who asks, as I turn my video off,

1080
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:40,180
Willard, you like pine cones more if they were alive and could crawl around.

1081
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,980
Huh, huh.

1082
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,380
You know, okay, I have been looking for a way to like pine cones more.

1083
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,980
Yeah, I don't, I don't dislike pine cones.

1084
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,780
I certainly wouldn't say, like, if we were walking through a pine forest,

1085
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,580
somebody pointed at one of these little spiky bastards on the ground and said,

1086
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,900
do you like that, I think I would probably say, like, yeah, it's fine.

1087
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,660
I'm pretty, I'm pretty, like.

1088
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,740
It's okay.

1089
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,700
Yeah, now, smear one in peanut butter, roll it in bird seed, hang it up on my porch.

1090
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,820
I love the thing.

1091
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,340
Who's that ever, who's that been for?

1092
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,420
I've seen, I've done that before, I think.

1093
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,540
I did that at like a church camp almost certainly at some point,

1094
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,980
but like, even when I was doing it, I was like, who's this for?

1095
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,820
Like, is a deer going to come eat this?

1096
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,460
It's for birdies, for birds.

1097
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,820
Do birds like peanut butter?

1098
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,620
That's wild.

1099
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,220
I think the, I think the peanut butter is just a means of conveyance

1100
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,980
for the bird seed treat.

1101
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,480
Right.

1102
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,060
I, I, we had a bird feeder out back of the house

1103
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,500
and we had to get a little ladder and we filled it up, right?

1104
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,180
Was the little ladder for the birds, Justin?

1105
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,980
Cause they have wings.

1106
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,420
These fucking birds ate it in 24 hours.

1107
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,500
So then it was just like, I had this moment where I was like, I'm not going to fill,

1108
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,740
these, these guys are obviously starving.

1109
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,820
And also I'm not going to get into this fucking codependent relationship

1110
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:06,260
where I am like every 24 hours getting out the ladder to go feed these birds.

1111
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,500
And before you tweeted me, yeah, it might've been squirrels.

1112
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,780
I don't monitor it.

1113
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,260
Okay.

1114
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,340
They're the same to Justin.

1115
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,100
It's the same outdoors animal to Justin essentially.

1116
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:19,780
Here's the problem.

1117
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,860
This is the problem with bird feeders in general.

1118
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,900
And I'm sorry to get up on my soapbox again about this,

1119
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,780
but I am providing food for one of like the top three

1120
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,500
most important things for living beings.

1121
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,460
And I guess maybe they're helping with, I don't know,

1122
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,340
pollination or bugs or whatever, but I don't notice that.

1123
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,540
They don't bring your newspaper.

1124
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,540
They don't pick up your newspaper and fly it in.

1125
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,860
They certainly aren't making you fucking dresses

1126
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,300
so that you can go to the ball.

1127
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:45,700
That's some bullshit.

1128
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,820
And I fast them.

1129
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,620
Yeah, that's some bullshit.

1130
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,620
Holly was trying to shove down our throats.

1131
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,740
And here's the thing.

1132
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,580
I feed my kids.

1133
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,020
They do cool stuff.

1134
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,380
I feed my dogs.

1135
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,820
They do cool stuff.

1136
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,780
Feed my cat.

1137
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,620
She sometimes lets me pet her.

1138
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,300
What's this bird bringing to the table?

1139
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,700
Then I'm going out there.

1140
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,380
I'm getting it seed.

1141
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:05,620
Yeah.

1142
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,700
What do you want a bird to bring to a table, Travis?

1143
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,500
Like a scrap of hair?

1144
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,540
A small twig?

1145
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,660
I read about these birds who are bringing shiny rings

1146
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,420
and lost camera lenses and stuff back to people.

1147
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,340
Where's my army of birds?

1148
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,060
So let's, I mean, I've had some time to think about it

1149
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,140
while you two have been talking a bunch of bullshit

1150
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,340
that doesn't mean anything.

1151
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,260
I think it'd be pretty bad-ass if pine cones

1152
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,700
were just scuttling around.

1153
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,460
What if they did it whenever you weren't looking?

1154
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,500
That's a fun little Toy Story thing.

1155
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,020
But I think you know what would be better

1156
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,540
if they did it while I was looking.

1157
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,420
So I could see it and be delighted by it.

1158
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,660
I do think, though, if you go to a Michaels

1159
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,780
and they have craft pine cones,

1160
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,540
those shouldn't move around.

1161
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,380
Because Michaels is a place of business.

1162
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,500
It's not the forest.

1163
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,620
That is true.

1164
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,620
In 99.9% of cases, that is absolutely true.

1165
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,540
But you know what would be fucking funny, guys?

1166
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,660
What?

1167
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,220
What, dude?

1168
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,780
When like kids make little turkey,

1169
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,020
like craft turkeys out of pine cones.

1170
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,220
Would those move around too?

1171
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,500
You would never seen it?

1172
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,220
Oh, that would be cool.

1173
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,660
They use it like the body of the turkey

1174
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,740
because it looks like a turkey's body.

1175
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,100
Oh, okay.

1176
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,700
So it would be like crawling around

1177
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
and it would have sort of turkey paper stuff on it.

1178
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,460
I like that.

1179
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,260
That would be great.

1180
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,020
But then why not just look at turkeys?

1181
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,100
What if the pine cones were turkey sized?

1182
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,460
What if, okay.

1183
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,300
Here's a fun thing that Travis just said

1184
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,660
and he didn't even know it

1185
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,340
because that's not how his brain works.

1186
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,140
If pine cones could move around

1187
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,020
and put turkeys now could not.

1188
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,380
So he just shifted it all one to the left.

1189
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,020
I think that, and just to keep things fresh,

1190
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,260
I think we should probably do that every once in a while.

1191
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,780
Now, does that mean that eventually

1192
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,780
human beings won't be able to move around anymore?

1193
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,900
Yeah, like in Wally.

1194
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,100
Wally's sitting on scooters.

1195
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,340
Well, no, it'll be more sort of just like

1196
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,180
we can't move around anymore.

1197
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,540
Tulips can.

1198
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,820
And it's like, well, it's our turn to cycle out.

1199
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,580
I just installed Pluto TV.

1200
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,020
I'm basically there right now.

1201
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,700
How am I supposed to get up?

1202
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,820
They're showing guts.

1203
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,460
Oh, really?

1204
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,220
Yeah, dude.

1205
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:17,540
Do you think if pine cones started to move around,

1206
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,380
then we would start eating more of them?

1207
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,460
Huh.

1208
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,100
Ha.

1209
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:22,900
Like if you're-

1210
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,580
Well, would they develop-

1211
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,300
A meat-

1212
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,140
Sort of sinew and a meat?

1213
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,380
Yeah.

1214
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,540
And an attitude that would make you feel kind of superior

1215
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,580
when eating them.

1216
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,500
I mean, what we're saying is basically

1217
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,260
how Hedgehog did happen.

1218
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,900
That is true.

1219
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,580
I would-

1220
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,460
Have you guys been imagining pineapples this whole time

1221
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,980
and you just not realize?

1222
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,340
What's a pineapple?

1223
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,540
No, that's different.

1224
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,180
No, no.

1225
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:48,980
You mean the fruit?

1226
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,540
Pineapple?

1227
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,660
Travis, did you just forget the word pineapple?

1228
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,940
Okay, but to be fair,

1229
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,620
you said it like it was two separate words.

1230
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,020
A pine apple as opposed to pineapple.

1231
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,780
Hey guys, lean in.

1232
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,700
What I've been picturing is like hermit crabs of the forest.

1233
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,660
Just carrying them pine cones on their backs.

1234
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,700
It's funnier to me though if it's just the pine cones.

1235
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,380
Yeah, what you're describing, Travis,

1236
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,540
is sort of a natural phenomenon that could-

1237
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,300
Griffin, the video's back on accidentally.

1238
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,820
Accidentally, your video's back on and I see you again.

1239
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,940
And I can see a nipple.

1240
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,060
I can't see a nipple.

1241
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,940
I could just see anyone if you could just-

1242
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,940
It feels like maybe you've got some sugar all the way down the side.

1243
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,940
Griffin, somebody got a light dusting of cinnamon on your armpit, Griffin.

1244
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,100
You should try to get that scene too.

1245
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,100
I got it. I got it out.

1246
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,460
I don't want to do this show anymore.

1247
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,380
See, the problem is we did one Monday and this is Wednesday.

1248
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,380
We did one two days later and here's the problem.

1249
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,540
That's the fucking grand reveal, okay?

1250
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:51,220
Just we didn't have a lot of good jokes saved up and I'm sorry, okay?

1251
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,020
I'm sorry, but it had some good jokes.

1252
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,860
Just go tweet about other episodes.

1253
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,180
If you didn't like this one, we'll do another one in a week

1254
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,620
and you'll like it more, okay?

1255
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,260
The next one's gonna, guys, the next one's gonna kick ass.

1256
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:04,740
Yeah.

1257
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,540
That's what we have to tell ourselves after every recording.

1258
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,820
The next one is gonna kick ass.

1259
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,620
Not this one though.

1260
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,820
Hey, can I give everyone a little reward for sticking around?

1261
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:13,940
Yeah.

1262
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,460
We're gonna announce our new tour dates.

1263
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,700
Oh, well, shouldn't we have done that after a good one?

1264
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,820
I think we may be.

1265
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,100
Yeah, let's not announce that.

1266
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,060
We're going to be at the Orpheum Theater in Boston, Massachusetts,

1267
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,660
April 1st with my brother, my brother and me and Sawbones.

1268
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,300
And then April 2nd with the Adventure Zone.

1269
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,740
And then on April 3rd,

1270
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,140
we're going to be at the Grand Theater at Foxwoods

1271
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,900
in Manshantucket, Connecticut

1272
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,140
with my brother, my brother and me and Sawbones.

1273
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,380
Then, believe it or not, three weeks later,

1274
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,300
we're going to be in Baltimore on April 22nd at the Hippodrome

1275
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,540
with my brother, my brother and me and Sawbones.

1276
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,820
And the 23rd with the Adventure Zone.

1277
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,940
And then on April 24th in Norfolk, Virginia

1278
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,500
at the Chrysler Theater with my brother, my brother and me

1279
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,220
and Sawbones.

1280
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,380
So that's a lot of April shows.

1281
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,980
And they bring May flows.

1282
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,660
May shows, yes, May shows.

1283
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,420
May will probably have some shows as well.

1284
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,640
Yes.

1285
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,820
And also, just so I know,

1286
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,140
we're really excited to see everybody on the JoCo Cruise.

1287
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,380
That's not a thing you need to buy tickets for or whatever.

1288
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,580
I'm just excited about it.

1289
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,420
That's a thing you can't buy tickets for,

1290
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,300
one might even say.

1291
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,060
I don't even know why we're talking about it right now.

1292
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,020
I'm just so excited.

1293
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,140
We are going to need questions for that, by the way.

1294
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,700
If you're going to be on the JoCo Cruise

1295
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,620
and you would like us to do questions,

1296
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,340
we're doing two of these bad boys on there.

1297
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,500
So you can go ahead and start emailing those in.

1298
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,100
JoCo Cruise questions.

1299
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,140
Is that the email address?

1300
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,820
No, just in the subject line.

1301
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,420
And if you know, like if you're in the red group

1302
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,940
or the gold group, let us know.

1303
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,300
So thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1304
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,500
Max Fun Drive's coming up soon.

1305
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,060
We got a fun bonus episode ready for everybody

1306
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:01,860
that we all had just a squealing good time on, I would say.

1307
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,740
And thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1308
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,260
for the use of our theme song,

1309
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,300
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1310
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,420
You can find a link to that online.

1311
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,180
You can find a link to that in your pocket.

1312
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,140
You can find that song for sale.

1313
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,460
You can find that song for sale.

1314
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,900
This is the end of the episode.

1315
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,380
Yes.

1316
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,220
I do have a final yahoo, this one.

1317
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,180
Oh, wait, hold on.

1318
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,700
Sorry, there's one more thing.

1319
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,180
If you're listening to this on Monday the 17th,

1320
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,740
we still have a couple days before the Cincinnati shows.

1321
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,660
Go to mcroy.family, click on tours.

1322
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,780
We're gonna be at the Taft Theater

1323
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,420
with my brother, my brother and me on February 19th.

1324
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,460
And on February 20th, we're doing the Adventure Zone.

1325
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,860
I assume Sawbones is performing on Monday,

1326
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,940
or on the 19th as well.

1327
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,500
So go get those tickets and check out all the merch,

1328
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,220
mcroy.family, hugs and kisses, Travis.

1329
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,980
All right, here comes the final yahoo.

1330
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,260
Yeah.

1331
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,020
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

1332
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,700
Thank you, Adrian.

1333
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,900
It's yahoo answers user Disco Stew asks,

1334
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,580
is it me or is the purge totally implausible?

1335
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,260
My name is Justin McElroy.

1336
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,300
I'm Travis McElroy.

1337
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1338
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,580
It's been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad,

1339
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,740
square on the lips.

1340
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,140
Maximumfun.org.

1341
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,500
Comedy and culture.

1342
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,700
Artist owned.

1343
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,740
Audience supported.

1344
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,340
Hey, you've reached Dr. Game Show.

1345
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,340
Leave your message after the beep.

1346
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,940
Dr. Game Show is my favorite podcast.

1347
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,660
And the only podcast my parents want me to listen to

1348
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,100
because I'm 12, but even old people love this show.

1349
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,540
Basically you call in, play games and have fun.

1350
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,500
If you win a game, a baby will send you a magnet in the mail.

1351
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,940
I have so many magnets and put them all over my locker.

1352
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,100
And pretty much everyone at school is jealous

1353
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,260
because they are very cool custom magnets.

1354
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,980
And it also means that I'm really good at winning games.

1355
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,540
And they even let me practice my record live on the air.

1356
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,460
Listening to this show is like going to a real doctor,

1357
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,860
but pretty much kind of better.

1358
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,980
Dr. Game Show rocks.

1359
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,300
Listen to Dr. Game Show on Maximum Fun.

1360
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:51,460
New episodes every other Wednesday.
