1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,520
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show from the modern era.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,360
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis of McElroy.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. And amber is the color of our energy. We made it.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,600
Guys, we did it. I knew that this would come around the bend. Now I see. Now we finally done did it.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,040
This is the one we got. Travis, look at the email you sent out about the show notes,

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,400
and you tell me what we done did. Now see, I tried to do a 7-Eleven branded episode,

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,600
and you said no. But 3-Eleven branded it? Ugh. 7-Eleven happens every year. I mean, that's

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,320
optimistic. But like, we'll probably get another one of those. This only happens once. It's 3-Eleven,

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
the episode. Alright, well now I'm just like taking the email full of questions and all the

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
Yahoo answers I found and throwing them right in the dumpster. And I'm shutting the dumpster

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
and calling the dumpster company to come take it away. Well, this is all of your 3-Eleven related

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Yahoo answers questions. Yeah, well there are a few of those. Uh, yeah. Um, what other songs did

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,360
3-Eleven do? All Mixed Up? Was that them? That was one of their hits, right? Yeah. Let's establish

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,000
some parameters before we get too deep on this. What's our main number 3-Eleven? I know that

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,080
amber is the color of their energy. Whoa. I think they did Bubbly Toes. Okay, they did Bubbly Toes.

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:15,760
Now, um, a lot of people say, Justin, how do you, uh, identify a, uh, a real artist? You know,

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,600
how can you judge by their music? No, you can't. Can you judge by their look? No, you can't.

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,200
Um, what you can judge by is whether or not that they have sponsored a, uh, NASCAR stock car

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:40,320
as a 3-Eleven for Jeb Burton in 2015. If you're, uh, looking for it, look between the logos of,

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,800
uh, Dr. Pepper and Maxim magazine, and right there you'll find the logo for the band 3-Eleven.

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,480
Oh my god. Couldn't really afford a lot of car space, huh? No, not a big car space on that one.

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,520
Can you pay to have somebody else's logo put onto a NASCAR? Yeah, it's kind of like how you can put

27
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,040
by somebody's name on a star. By the way, I did buy a name for a star and I named it 3-Eleven.

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,720
You guys know which star? The sun. The sun is named 3-Eleven. It was crazy. Like I was on the

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
star registry website and they're like, pick a star. And I was like, let's just try the sun.

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,800
Nobody damn thought of it first. So now the sun's named 3-Eleven. Please only refer to it as that

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,880
because it's, and it's appropriate because it is the only source of light and heat in my life.

32
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,400
Do you think it's possible that Jeb Burton was looking at his car and he's like,

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
all right, you guys put whatever you want on here. This one's for Jeb.

34
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,440
Just fucking slapping the 3-Eleven sticker on my car. That was just a sticker he picked up at a

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,680
concert. That was not a sponsorship in any way. Could we pay to have 3-Eleven sponsor every car

36
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,200
in NASCAR a little bit so that no matter what car wins, it's the 3-Eleven car?

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,400
Do you guys know about the rumor that 3-Eleven was a racist name for a band?

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,160
Learning about this from Yahoo Answers because the letter K is the 11th letter of the alphabet

39
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,920
and so three Ks would be KKK and it doesn't necessarily seem to sort of align with the

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,920
message of most of the band 3-Eleven songs, which are mostly just sort of about chill beach vibes.

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,880
Are they?

42
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,920
For the most part, yes. The actual origin of it is-

43
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
Wait, can I guess?

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,520
Yeah, please.

45
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,360
See if I know this. Is 3-Eleven the police code for smoking weed?

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,040
No, it is the police code for indecent exposure. You see, a man named P-Nut.

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
They were skinny dipping in a public pool.

48
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,600
Peter Nut.

49
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Peter Nut got arrested. He was cuffed naked and taken home to his parents.

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
There, he was issued for a citation for a code 3-Eleven.

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,200
We thought this was funny, so we took it as our band name.

52
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,640
After the humor-

53
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
It really got famous and now we hate it.

54
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
After the humor of the name wore off, you mean like 15 minutes later?

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,080
We still kept it because we liked that it was just abstract and did not define us in any way.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
Cool.

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
I mean, that's true. I have basically no impressions about 3-Eleven as a band.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
I have no like, concepts of it. I do want to give them their propers, though.

59
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,120
I want to give them some credit.

60
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,360
According to Wikipedia, their music is a blend of rock, reggae, hip-hop, and funk.

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,160
So God bless them, because somebody had to read that and say,

62
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,520
hmm, okay, good. Let's make a CD out of it. Let's make a CD out of that.

63
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,320
Yeah, here's some money.

64
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
Here's some money. Let's make a CD out of this.

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,120
We have a ton of it, apparently. It's the 90s. We don't know what to do with money.

66
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
We're children tickling ourselves with razors.

67
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
Truckin' Peanut was like, but I want to make a reggae CD.

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,880
And fuckin' Zach was like, nah, man, all rock for me.

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
And he lowered his shades and started smoking.

70
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,600
You got your rock in my reggae. You got your reggae in my rock.

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,760
So there are other genres that they've been classified as are alternative rock, reggae rock,

72
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,720
rap rock, funk rock, alternative metal, and nu metal.

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,360
Jesus. Alternative and nu metal. Both of the metals. Great.

74
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,720
Whatever you're doing.

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,040
You guys heard the story about how Amber came about, right?

76
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,640
One of their dads had a cold, and he was trying to sneeze.

77
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,920
And he went, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

78
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,840
They're like, that was crazy. Can you do that at games?

79
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,120
Like, yeah, sure. Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
They just fuckin' recorded it. Put that down on the track. Put some reggae over it, baby.

81
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,640
311 has a Caribbean cruise.

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,680
No.

83
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,840
Yep, the 311. It's called 311 Caribbean Cruises.

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,320
It's a partner between 311 and Jonathan Coulton.

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,720
They had Tom Green, Doug Benson, Less Than Jake, Revolution, Ex-Savvy.

86
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,360
This actually sounds not bad. I would probably get on this cruise.

87
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
This sounds all right now that I'm listening to it.

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
What if they're really cool?

89
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,480
They're probably pretty-

90
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,120
Here's what I think. I actually believe this in my heart.

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,120
I think that if you have had a big hit or two, and then you've managed to have any level of

92
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,680
consistency and can still maintain a career from music after that,

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
you're probably a pretty decent human being.

94
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,240
And not only that-

95
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
I feel like that's the only thing that propels you through.

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,040
It may be naive, but I feel the exact same thing, Justin.

97
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:20,080
That I bet people might turn their nose up and say a Dave Matthews or a Sublime or a 311.

98
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,960
But I bet if you got the chance to chill with those dudes, it's probably chill as fuck.

99
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,240
Well, they'll still smoke you the fuck out for sure, Travis, is that what you're-

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,280
Yes, agreed.

101
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,640
And they'll also show you the drawings that their kids did.

102
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,120
You know what I mean?

103
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,000
They're just people.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,480
They seem like reggae rock funk stars.

106
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,640
You know that all of their iPhone lock screens are like pictures of sweet pandas and stuff?

107
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

108
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,960
Hey, before I unlock this to show you some of my kids' pictures that they drew,

109
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
did you check this panda?

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,240
Check out this chill funk panda.

111
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,760
It's a cool panda.

112
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,640
I have to imagine if you grow up and you come out of Nebraska and your whole thing is,

113
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,480
we're going to do a reggae rock band, you probably, I mean,

114
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,400
you at least have some thick skin, I think.

115
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,520
You at least could take some heat.

116
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
We're going to do some reggae nu metal.

117
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,840
Nebraska? Are you ready, Nebraska, to reggae nu metal rock?

118
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
Yeah, a little bit, I guess.

119
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,880
What kind of music are you guys into?

120
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,040
We're into a very steep uphill climb for many years

121
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,920
with very little recognition is what we're kind of all about.

122
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,600
This band started in 1988 AD, the year of our birth.

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
Are you kidding me?

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,560
No.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,960
Are you telling me that we are careening towards 30 years of 311?

126
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,480
Happy 30th anniversary, 311.

127
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,560
Wow.

128
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,840
You're my favorite band.

129
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,600
1988, this band was born the year after me.

130
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,160
I remember the first time I heard 311, I was five.

131
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
It changed my life.

132
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,400
I just drank it in.

133
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Let's do some advice, I think, for people.

134
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,760
Oh, we have a special guest this episode.

135
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
Should we talk about that?

136
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
Just like set it up and then hit that ball right in the hole later?

137
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,520
Yeah, that sounds good.

138
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
Joining us to be a guest, Bert, and I know you're listening,

139
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,880
it's going like, wait, another person is going to be on the show?

140
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,160
Yeah, we used to do that.

141
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,360
It's been like two years, but we have a fantastic author,

142
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,680
fantastic person, Patrick Rothfuss, is going to be on the show a bit later.

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
But for now, let's do our thing.

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,320
All right, here's our first question.

145
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,200
Today on the train, I caught a woman taking a picture of me with her phone.

146
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,760
Oh, boy.

147
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,920
The weird thing is that after we made eye contact,

148
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
she simply smiled and continued taking pictures.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,960
Oh, my God.

150
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
The phone wasn't even muted, and I could hear the shutter noise of each picture.

151
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
I thought that she might be taking selfies,

152
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
but she followed me with her camera

153
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,320
even after I moved a few rows down in the train.

154
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
So my question is, what the fuck should I have done?

155
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,680
Sincerely, Tom Cruise.

156
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,440
Well, okay, so that one is.

157
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,280
That one's pretty obvious.

158
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,700
Okay.

159
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,160
Shutter shy in San Francisco, by the way.

160
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,920
Without discussing it, I want each of us to say

161
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
why we think this woman was taking pictures of this person.

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
Okay, kind of a choose your own adventure.

163
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,720
I love it.

164
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,920
Yeah, Justin, go.

165
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,420
Art.

166
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,620
Griffin?

167
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
Maybe they looked like one of their friends

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
and they wanted to text them a good picture of their face,

169
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
but they kept looking away or something.

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,640
Or alternate second guess, just like, I want to hedge my bets.

171
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,680
She's a pervert.

172
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
Oh, see, I was going to say pervert.

173
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,660
Okay.

174
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,580
You're going to end up taped to a wall with colored yarn

175
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,300
stretching between you and pictures of weapons

176
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,660
and I don't know, maybe the Pope.

177
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,380
Who knows?

178
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,260
What if you get a, you're going to get a parcel,

179
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,460
not through the postal service because that leaves a trail.

180
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,900
It's just going to show up on your door

181
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,340
and there's going to be a note that says,

182
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,740
I believe this should be to your specifications

183
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,140
and it'll be a very tasteful suit jacket.

184
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,780
I knew from the moment I saw you.

185
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,300
I must sue him.

186
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,020
To embroider you with my suitory.

187
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,540
Alternative explanation,

188
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,020
it is your great, great grandchild from the future.

189
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,540
Travel back to capture pictures of the day

190
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,460
that your whole life changed.

191
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,620
Yesterday, I was at a pool party

192
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,740
and a man showed up who was very drunk

193
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,180
and he looked exactly like Till Death Do Us Blart

194
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,660
and Worst Idea of All Time podcaster Guy Montgomery.

195
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,580
The whole like a hundo percent DNA code splice combo.

196
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,260
God, I would have been so fucking excited

197
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,300
until I realized it wasn't him.

198
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,620
I know.

199
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,020
He's got a pool party and Guy Montgomery shows up?

200
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,420
I know.

201
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
So I tried to, I thought in my head,

202
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,500
like it would be fun if I snapped a pic of this dude

203
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,940
and like sent a picture over Twitter to Guy Montgomery.

204
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,740
I bet he'd really enjoy it.

205
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,660
Only the guy was wearing a Speedo

206
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
and he was really partying hard

207
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,420
and I worried like the photog sesh on that would be

208
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,420
a little uncomfy.

209
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,620
The optics on that situation are not ideal.

210
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,740
Hey, stand up for me, bud.

211
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,580
Hey, get out of the pool and just like stand,

212
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,540
towel off, bud.

213
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,500
And just like-

214
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,340
No, no, put that dick away.

215
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,540
Hey, can you tooch?

216
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,180
Can you tooch your booch a bit?

217
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,580
Can you tooch your booch and smize your thighs?

218
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,980
And now our interaction is over

219
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,060
and I don't want you to speak to me anymore.

220
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,260
Yeah, I don't actually know you if you could stop, please.

221
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,020
That's the problem is that this woman,

222
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,580
I feel like there is an unspoken law in society

223
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,220
that if you're sneaking a peek, whether it's a picture

224
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,940
or just like scoping someone out of the corner of your eye,

225
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,620
once you are caught, that exchange is done, right?

226
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,540
Well, you can only get so wet.

227
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,980
You know what I mean?

228
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,300
Like-

229
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,940
That's what I'm saying.

230
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,260
But I'm saying that this is like a level of chaos

231
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,780
in society that I'm not willing to accept.

232
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,060
Oh no, don't get me wrong.

233
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,380
It's 24 seven purge out there, Travie.

234
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,940
Okay, because like I saw you do it.

235
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,220
Like I know you're doing it.

236
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm looking at you while you're doing it

237
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,020
and you're continuing to do it.

238
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,820
And you're just doing it.

239
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,420
My only recourse, which is to notice you, has been weakened.

240
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,140
Has failed.

241
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,420
Yeah.

242
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,620
So now what am I supposed to do?

243
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,420
Confront you?

244
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,540
What?

245
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,660
That's the other thing is like you didn't say stop, right?

246
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,900
Like you didn't say, hey, cut it out.

247
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,700
Can you stop?

248
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,380
I'm going to have to confiscate that.

249
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,700
And then muting, not muting it is really bad.

250
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,420
This is the thing.

251
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,180
I wanted to touch on this real quick, Griffin.

252
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,660
I want to make a push in 2016.

253
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,940
If we can do nothing else, can we fucking cheese it?

254
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,660
With the camera noise when you take a pic.

255
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,860
I believe that that has never been used to any purpose

256
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,620
other than blowing up your spot.

257
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,380
Can you think of a time you've ever been happy

258
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,420
that that fucker went off?

259
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,060
Or is it like constantly your spot getting blown up

260
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,940
every single time?

261
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,820
Even before phones, we were using digital cameras.

262
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,020
When was the last time a camera made that noise ever?

263
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,900
That's a good point.

264
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,860
It doesn't make that noise.

265
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,060
I was in a toilet stall doing my thing in there,

266
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,860
having practice, having my fun, and I saw something very

267
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,500
funny on my cell phone that I was looking at.

268
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,180
And so I did a screen grab, only when you do a screen grab,

269
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,780
it makes the camera noise.

270
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,500
Thanks, Apple.

271
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,220
Thank you, Apple.

272
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,740
So for the optics on that, or I guess the audio on that

273
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,380
from my neighbor in the other bathroom stall,

274
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,180
so I was having a little photo session in there,

275
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,380
a little photog sesh.

276
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,420
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you may have told

277
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,300
this story before.

278
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,140
I don't think I have, Travis.

279
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,540
Or maybe it's multiple times this has happened.

280
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,820
Has this happened to you multiple times?

281
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,460
It's probably happened.

282
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,460
I like to save my phone memories, my internet memories

283
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,700
that I have with my Twitter pals.

284
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,900
Last night, I was looking up how to fight a gym in Pokémon Go.

285
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,300
And I screenshotted the instructions and Teresa heard

286
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,980
the camera go and said, oh, what are you taking

287
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,940
a screenshot of?

288
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,660
And you would have thought I was taking a screenshot

289
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,900
of how to kill someone because I was like, oh,

290
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,980
just directions for something.

291
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,380
It's nothing.

292
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,420
We have a neighborhood Facebook group that's actually

293
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,220
been very helpful for certain stuff and a nice little

294
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,340
community bonding thing.

295
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,500
And people have been talking about Pokémon Go all the time.

296
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,180
Apparently, all my neighbors are just going out

297
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,620
for late night Zubat sessions.

298
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,260
Is that that new exercise down at the gym?

299
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,180
Yeah, but it's all adults.

300
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,380
It is not children.

301
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,780
And I'm wondering if we can sort of take Pokémon Go away

302
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,540
from children so I feel a little bit more comfortable

303
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,340
running around catching my EVs and stuff.

304
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,700
I took Charlie out this morning to go look for Pokémon

305
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,420
and she was so excited and I put on her shoes and we just

306
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,020
went out walking and just looking for Pokémon.

307
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,940
I told her that's what we're doing, looking for Pokémon.

308
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,220
And we walked for like 10 minutes without spotting

309
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,260
a single Pokémon.

310
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,620
Every 15 seconds, she's looking up at me like, well,

311
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,060
any Pokémon yet, old man?

312
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,420
I was sold the pillow goods.

313
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,700
Answer's no.

314
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,020
I've never been more fucking humiliated as a dad.

315
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,500
What more embarrassing thing is there?

316
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,700
Like, no, I'm just waiting.

317
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,460
I'm hoping Mimota's song is going to drop me a Pokémon

318
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:57,860
down here.

319
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,620
Me and my baby girl are going to catch it.

320
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,900
I'm really sorry, sweetheart.

321
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,700
I just pretended because she's a baby.

322
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,660
We saw a squirrel and I was like, oh, come on.

323
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,740
We got one.

324
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,580
That's what she's going to talk in a therapy session

325
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,580
about when she's like 22.

326
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,540
That's more beautiful.

327
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,780
That's like, but this is the fuck thing that I'm saying

328
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,260
to you.

329
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,540
I was looking for digital imaginary Pokémon in my that

330
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,220
only exists in my phone.

331
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,940
And while my daughter and I were like traipsing around

332
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,460
the neighborhood, I saw a squirrel.

333
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,660
I was like, oh, fuck that.

334
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,140
Get out of here.

335
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,860
Get out of here.

336
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,380
Unless you can use quick attack.

337
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,260
Get the fuck out.

338
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,580
You guys want to have some candy?

339
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,780
How about a Yahoo?

340
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,220
Yeah, let me give this Yahoo to you.

341
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,060
Oops, I opened up a best credit cards of 2016.

342
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,180
I opened up an ad.

343
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,780
Well, all right.

344
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,500
Compare cards.

345
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,740
And it's the city simplicity.

346
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,780
No late fees.

347
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,980
Wait a minute.

348
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,500
These are that's a great deal.

349
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,700
I'm going to get on board deal.

350
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,260
You can get a thousand dollars instantly just for signing up.

351
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,820
Holy shit.

352
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,620
I just got somebody just gave me emailed me a thousand bucks.

353
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,020
Man, the Internet is attached.

354
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,700
You see those ads and you think like this is this is they're

355
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,820
trying to grift me.

356
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,300
But no, I just got another thousand.

357
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,100
That's two thousand.

358
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,580
This is by Yahoo Answers user.

359
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,380
They're anonymous.

360
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,380
Let's call them Purvis asks.

361
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,020
Oh, we sent him by level 9000.

362
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,060
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport.

363
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,380
Thank you.

364
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,060
Drew by Yahoo Answers sold me a Nintendo 64.

365
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,020
So I appreciate Drew.

366
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,500
Wow, really?

367
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,260
Any carts?

368
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,900
Any hot carts?

369
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,980
I got the Ocarina of Time.

370
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,660
Oh, nice.

371
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,260
Gold or regular gray?

372
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,460
Just regular.

373
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,980
But I remember my gold version that Justin gave to his ex-girlfriend.

374
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,940
That was fun and cool.

375
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,060
Anyway, was that the same day that you erased my Final Fantasy 7 game?

376
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,940
Yeah, it's a circle of life, the circle of being a shitty brother.

377
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,420
This anonymous user who I have named Purvis asks,

378
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,620
why don't pets need jobs, but humans do?

379
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,860
Good question.

380
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,220
Why don't pets need jobs?

381
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,420
People tell me to get a job, but why can't I be like a pet dog

382
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,860
and sit around all day relaxing?

383
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,100
That's another question that we need to circle back to.

384
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,020
Can anyone explain why pets are excused?

385
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,980
I mostly sit around playing video games or browsing the internet.

386
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,380
I get called useless for not working, but my pet dog gets called adorable.

387
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,540
You never call the pet useless to society.

388
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,180
Why not?

389
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,100
Aren't pets useless to society?

390
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,900
Oh, yeah.

391
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,540
They give humans comfort, but so do I.

392
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,900
I give my parents comfort and I get called mama's boy or childish.

393
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,580
Why do pets get rewarded for doing things humans get shamed for?

394
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,140
Update.

395
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,300
I know it sounds kind of silly, but I'm serious.

396
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,180
Update two.

397
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,460
I know some pets do have jobs like police dogs or service pets,

398
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,420
but most pets don't really do anything except eat, sleep,

399
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,100
go to the bathroom and have fun.

400
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,820
Simple life.

401
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,100
Okay, I want to draw one quick point of order.

402
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,300
Your career aspiration is to be a pet.

403
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,220
I am doubting you're bringing your parents a lot of comfort on the daily.

404
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,740
Maybe some light snuggling or maybe you got them a cold drink,

405
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,220
but on the bigger existential level,

406
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,140
I bet you're providing the absolute opposite of comfort to your parents.

407
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,500
That's an excellent point, Justin.

408
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,660
Are you putting in the comfort work that a dog does every damn day?

409
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,460
Like those dogs are not being comforting 10% of the time.

410
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,500
Can we all agree that this is the prologue to a TLC show about-

411
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:22,980
I'm a man.

412
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm a living-

413
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,380
Hello, I am a man pet.

414
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,340
Yes.

415
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,380
You know, it was just one day I was sitting there and I,

416
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,180
I just realized like this is what I aspire to.

417
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,340
Like why, why do pets get to have all the relaxation fun, you know?

418
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,380
And now I live my life as a comfort dog.

419
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,820
Is there a career opportunity there?

420
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,420
If I ate food,

421
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,780
if I ate the same food every meal and it was relatively inexpensive,

422
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,340
like a kibble, but not a kibble because I, that's gross.

423
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,060
Um, but like, but like, or Luna bars.

424
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,860
If I just ate Luna bars every meal

425
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,500
and you knew just like, let's, we need to get a 36 pack of Luna bars.

426
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,100
This will keep Griffin for a week.

427
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,460
And then I would just like roll up.

428
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,540
You'd feed me a Luna bar three times a day.

429
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,460
And I would just like roll up on the couch and just like put my belly on you.

430
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,380
And that's it.

431
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,740
Like I wouldn't do any, I wouldn't work.

432
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,500
I would just eat my Luna bars.

433
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,820
I would go to, first of all, oh my God, I would beat the shit out of a dog.

434
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,420
First of all, I've been one.

435
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,940
So I know like the tactics.

436
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,540
Second of all, like, if you tell me like, shut the fuck up, we're trying to sleep.

437
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,500
I'd be like, oh, that's cool.

438
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:26,900
That's cool.

439
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,860
That's cool.

440
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,100
I'm just going to get myself one more Luna bar, an extra one.

441
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,540
Cause I've been a real good boy today.

442
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,140
And I'm also going to go to sleep.

443
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,580
This is a good point.

444
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,580
Cause the thing I like best about my dog is that she is both there

445
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,700
and often non-intrusive to my life.

446
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,300
So she's like there hanging out.

447
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,620
So I know there's like another living being accompanying me through this journey

448
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,020
we call life at all times when I am home.

449
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,020
But also she's not like asking me questions or trying to talk to me

450
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,460
while I'm playing video games.

451
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,180
If I could have that in a human being, just like pay someone to like,

452
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,900
just hang out and keep me safe and bark when someone tries to break into my home.

453
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,020
But also like, they don't need anything from me other than for me to occasionally be like,

454
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,220
who's a good boy?

455
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,340
And then I'm back to overwatch.

456
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,620
See, I can do that too.

457
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,340
Like all I need are my Luna bars and you tell me that I'm looking great today.

458
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,060
I don't know how to break this to you guys,

459
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,780
but there are human beings in this situation and they're called babies, okay?

460
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,780
Babies are in this situation.

461
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,740
We have all of us experienced the exact scenario that is being discussed here

462
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,460
and we decided, okay, I've had my fill.

463
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,020
I want to get my own Luna bars.

464
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,180
I want to go get a job.

465
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,260
It's baffling in hindsight.

466
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,820
We've all made terrible mistakes that have gotten us to this point.

467
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Yeah, it was sick.

468
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,700
It was awesome.

469
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
Like, yeah, it was great.

470
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,340
We were all human pets at one point.

471
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,420
Jesus, Justin, you've blown the lid off of this

472
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,020
because I can remember a time when I was like 16, 17, 18

473
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,820
and all I wanted to do was get out there on my own

474
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,020
and own my own way and earn it for myself.

475
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,700
Like that was some trophy.

476
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,740
It was like a lie that had been taught to me for 18 years

477
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,900
that like what I really needed to do was get out from under my parents' wing.

478
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
Now all I want to do is get back under there.

479
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,620
If dad could just take care of me forever

480
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,180
while I played video games that didn't have to do shit,

481
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,260
I work a hard life podcasting.

482
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,980
It's exhausting.

483
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,940
This is the important thing though.

484
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,220
You can't play video games.

485
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,100
You have to watch like what dad's watching.

486
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,820
That's the thing.

487
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,780
I guess that's true because Buttercup doesn't get to play video games.

488
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,940
She has to watch goodies when I'm on TV.

489
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,140
But the thing is dad's always watching like Star Trek Deep Space Nine

490
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,020
and now I'm like, yes, feed me my Luna bars

491
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,820
and let's go on a deep space adventure, Nine.

492
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Let's go on our ninth deep space adventure together.

493
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,220
That's fucking, that's, oh man.

494
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,180
Can, is it too late to become an adult baby?

495
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,380
I would need to do some research to figure out where the circles operate

496
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,940
that I can really ingratiate myself

497
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,780
because I feel like I would need to earn a little bit of cred.

498
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,780
So the next time I rolled up like, whoa, Griffin,

499
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,740
you're kind of, you kind of look like an adult baby right now.

500
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,420
I can, I can be like, yes, I've been a member of this circle for a while now.

501
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,620
Respect this.

502
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,260
You have to slow slope into adult baby.

503
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,900
You can't just go from like wearing, you know, a button up and khakis to diaper.

504
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,380
You gotta like, maybe you start wearing a pacifier on a ribbon around your neck.

505
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,980
And people are like, huh?

506
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,540
Okay, that's probably a better option, but I don't know what the first step is.

507
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,580
I don't, I wonder what the supply and demand optics are right now

508
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,540
on like adult team, like adult babies.

509
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,020
Like, is there a lot of positions sitting open

510
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,740
or is it very competitive, do you think?

511
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,300
Well, let me check on Craigslist real quick.

512
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,500
Oh, God. Oh, God.

513
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,340
It's so competitive. Holy shit.

514
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,940
Anything but that.

515
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,980
What, you need three years experience just to apply

516
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,260
for this adult team baby position?

517
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,500
How am I supposed to get the experience of a baby?

518
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,980
Wait a minute, I do have three years experience being a baby.

519
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,340
I have at least seven.

520
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,900
It took me a while to get over the hump.

521
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,660
You know what, I'm, I wasn't body trained until I was seven.

522
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,460
That's not true.

523
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,780
That's just a goof for the podcast.

524
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,700
That's a goof for the podcast.

525
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
I was six.

526
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,580
So we were very excited.

527
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,220
I'm gonna jump in here, take a little break

528
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,900
from the old questions.

529
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,660
We're gonna do a pre-money zone, money zone real quick.

530
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,660
Yes, a pre-promo, promo.

531
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,460
If you've ever played the game Monikers

532
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,580
or know of the game Monikers,

533
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,500
you know that it is extremely fun and exciting.

534
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,620
It's one of our favorite games,

535
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,140
one of our favorite party games.

536
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,700
And we are partnering with them to do

537
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,060
my brother and my brother and me slash McElroy collection of Monikers cards,

538
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,140
specifically relating to the McElroy's and McElroy family of shows.

539
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,820
Here's a 30 second rundown on Monikers

540
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,460
if you haven't played it.

541
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,340
It's really, really fun.

542
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,300
Your team draws cards and then you look at your card

543
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,380
and you have to guess, make your teammates guess

544
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,220
what the card says just by talking about it.

545
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,100
That's first round.

546
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,780
Second round, use the same batch of cards,

547
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,380
but you can only say a single word

548
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,140
and you have to get your team to guess it.

549
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,300
And then the third round, you just can use actions,

550
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,060
no words at all to make them guess the word

551
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,460
and whoever gets the most cards after three rounds wins.

552
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,780
And the cards are weighted with extra points for more difficult ones

553
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,540
and easier ones are worth less points.

554
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,180
It's fucking great.

555
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,580
It's a super, super fun game.

556
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,980
And it's, we're really excited because we have,

557
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,900
just to give you an idea, I'm gonna read through a few.

558
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,740
We've got like specific Bim Bam ones,

559
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,980
like Bramble Pelt, Corncob Boy,

560
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,540
Griffin's Ghost Who Wants His Internet History Deleted,

561
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,700
King Nugget, et cetera, Torcy, et cetera.

562
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,740
We've also got general ones that people

563
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,580
who don't listen to the show could do,

564
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,460
like regular size Scott Magula or Mr. Belvedere

565
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,220
or a haunted dollar, Austin Powers, et cetera.

566
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,300
And then we have ones related to some of the other shows

567
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,380
in the McElroy family of podcasts,

568
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,620
like Adventure Zone, Sawbone, Schmanter's,

569
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,300
Trance Like These, Bunker Buddies, Rose Buddies,

570
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,380
and then about people involved with each of those shows.

571
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,060
So there's a ton of cards, I think like 112,

572
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,100
something like that in all.

573
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,620
And we have written the card text for every single one

574
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,420
we wrote ourselves,

575
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,660
which was a significant expenditure of energy,

576
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,420
but it was really fun to do

577
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,700
because we've never done anything like that before.

578
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,740
So that was cool.

579
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,020
Now here's the deal with it.

580
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,260
This is an expansion of monikers.

581
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,420
The base game of monikers, if you have it,

582
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,060
you can buy this expansion and it costs you 10 bucks

583
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,820
and then you can get the whole expansion

584
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,620
in a cool looking package and what all.

585
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,140
If you don't have monikers already,

586
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,300
you can go to McElroyCollection.com,

587
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,540
McElroyCollection.com, singular,

588
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,820
and that's actually where you can pre-order

589
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,580
the expansion as well.

590
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,260
But if you go to McElroyCollection.com,

591
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,260
you can pre-order the card set and also a set of monikers.

592
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,660
So you'll have everything you need to start playing.

593
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,820
You can also play it standalone.

594
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,700
It's more fun with more cards

595
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,380
and the base set has like a ton of cards

596
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,900
and is really fun.

597
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,180
And we should also be clear,

598
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,060
we're only selling this at pre-order at this point.

599
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,300
Once the pre-order is done,

600
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,380
there won't be more orders after that.

601
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,300
We don't have plans to sell it.

602
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,820
Right now, we don't have plans to sell it

603
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,660
as a standalone thing after the pre-order.

604
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,380
The pre-order is gonna be the only way.

605
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,100
We may do a second run way down the road

606
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,900
or something like that.

607
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
But for the, like you will not be able to like,

608
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,380
at least the plan currently,

609
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,660
you will not be able to order these.

610
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,900
There'll be 30 days of pre-ordering and then that's it.

611
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,100
And they should be in before Christmas by the holidays.

612
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,860
So like November, possibly October,

613
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,660
but definitely by the holiday shopping season,

614
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,180
you should have them in your hot little hands.

615
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,100
Go to McElroyCollection.com

616
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,060
and at the very least,

617
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,340
check out the amazing art that's going to be up the box.

618
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,220
It makes me very happy every time I look at it.

619
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,580
It's fantastic.

620
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,940
Yeah, it's worth it just to look at that.

621
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,580
McElroyCollection.com, pre-order that.

622
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,620
You have 30 days.

623
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,820
We'll try to remind you a couple of times.

624
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,020
Oh, one other thing.

625
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,780
A portion of sales from this

626
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,020
are gonna go to an organization called Grow Huntington

627
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,100
that actually is an urban farm

628
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,780
that is spinning up here in Huntington

629
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,780
to assist people who are in drug addiction recovery

630
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,300
and are using farming as sort of a therapy

631
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,500
to help them with that.

632
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,220
And that's a really cool organization here in Huntington

633
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,020
and a portion of every sale goes to them.

634
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,420
So you're helping out a good cause too.

635
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:38,020
Let's go to that money zone.

636
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,780
We're sponsored in part this week by Casper.

637
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,620
We've talked about Casper before.

638
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,220
They make amazing mattresses.

639
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,900
My wife and I sleep on one

640
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,820
and I can't imagine ever going back

641
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,540
to any other form of mattress other than...

642
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,780
I used to sleep on those old like crappy spring mattress things

643
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,060
that dug into you and made sleeping a chore.

644
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,140
Casper makes sleeping a dream

645
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,700
and that's a blurb that they can put on the box.

646
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,540
Like video games.

647
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,100
It's a very...

648
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,100
It's kind of a confusing blurb because like...

649
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,580
Casper makes sleeping a dream?

650
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,340
That's a fucking pull quote, Griffin.

651
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,620
That's amazing.

652
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,260
Are you kidding me?

653
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,700
It's clever.

654
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,260
It's witty.

655
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:18,980
Okay, it doesn't matter.

656
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,260
It just shows me it's really great.

657
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,420
And they have a risk-free trial and return policy.

658
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,740
You can sleep on a Casper mattress for a hundred days

659
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,060
and then if you don't like it,

660
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,220
there's painless returns and free delivery.

661
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,460
So I highly recommend it.

662
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,580
And I wouldn't just say that

663
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,420
because they are sponsoring the show.

664
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,180
I would say that if anybody asks me

665
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,620
because it's my favorite mattress

666
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,380
I've ever slept on in my entire life.

667
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,420
And because you are my brother,

668
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,380
my brother and me listener,

669
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,940
you can get $50 off towards any mattress,

670
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,700
which are already a great deal

671
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,820
and you're gonna find them cheaper

672
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,700
than any of those big mattress stores

673
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,220
because they cut down on their overhead.

674
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,420
They save you money

675
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,700
and we're gonna save you money.

676
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,540
$50 towards any mattress.

677
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,420
Go to Casper.com slash my brother

678
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,340
and use the promo code mybrother.

679
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,780
All one word at checkout.

680
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,620
Terms and conditions apply.

681
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,820
I wanna tell you about Club W.

682
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,260
Here's my tagline for them.

683
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,940
As long as we're generating these.

684
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,140
Wine is fine.

685
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,220
It's pretty good.

686
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,100
So Club W, what they do is they will send you wine

687
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,860
and they're gonna figure out what kind of wine

688
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,900
is gonna be good for your special snowflake of a tongue

689
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,540
and all the different buds on there.

690
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,420
You fill out a quick little questionnaire

691
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,780
and then based on that,

692
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,140
they figure out what kind of wine you like

693
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,100
and then they send it to you.

694
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,100
Right now, Club W is offering listeners

695
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,780
20 bucks off your first order

696
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,180
when you go to clubw.com slash my brother

697
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,140
and it gets better.

698
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,260
You don't have to pay for shipping.

699
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,300
They'll pay for your shipping

700
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
on orders of four bottles or more

701
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,460
and of course you're gonna order four bottles.

702
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,420
What's the point getting like,

703
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,260
I'm gonna order one bottle off the inner,

704
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,700
oops, it's all gone.

705
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,020
I watched a single episode of The Bachelorette

706
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,020
and I drank all my wine, dang it.

707
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,380
Because I needed it.

708
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,220
I needed it to get through this show.

709
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,420
I was just gonna say that that's not

710
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,700
because I don't like The Bachelorette.

711
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,380
It's just an extreme intense show.

712
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,020
I just wanted to make that clear.

713
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,300
No, yeah, you need something.

714
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,380
I don't want another fish gate happening.

715
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,380
Just take something off your to-do list.

716
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,220
Go to clubw.com slash my brother.

717
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,140
Get 20 bucks off your first order right now.

718
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,100
That's clubw.com slash my brother.

719
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,460
I got a personal message for us.

720
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,500
It's from McDrunk who says,

721
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,820
hi guys, thanks for the goose.

722
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,020
Now this is a short message

723
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,100
so I wanna make sure you actually get every word right

724
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,620
because it's actually, hey guys.

725
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,180
Hey guys.

726
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,420
Thanks for the goose.

727
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,500
There were six words and you blew one.

728
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,620
You did screw up one of them.

729
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,180
That's like an 18.6% repeating.

730
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,100
But since the message is to us,

731
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,300
we've already consumed it.

732
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,220
I mean, it's there.

733
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,100
Oh, you're right.

734
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,300
We shouldn't have read this out loud.

735
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,340
This was just for us.

736
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,780
This is a private message.

737
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,140
This is a $100 DM that was sent to us by McDrunk.

738
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,540
Honestly, we should put a breathalyzer on the Jumbotron.

739
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,820
We absolutely, oh my God.

740
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,260
It would cut the number down by at least 70%.

741
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,820
Which would be good for us actually.

742
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,940
Especially when you consider that

743
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,780
we're sold out six months in advance.

744
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,860
McDrunk probably bought this in January.

745
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,660
They've probably been dreading this moment for half a year.

746
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,460
Yeah.

747
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,820
Hey, congratulations on the confrontation

748
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,260
of your darkest demons.

749
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,020
I have a message, another one for AJ Cluck.

750
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,500
And it is from D Money.

751
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,940
And it says, for the McElroy brothers,

752
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,100
thank you for making my favorite person laugh

753
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,020
with your internet chit chat.

754
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,900
You are blessed to have his precious Canadian ears

755
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,860
listening every week.

756
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,660
I thank you very much.

757
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,060
For AJ, you are the absolute coolest.

758
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,820
Thanks for being my best friend.

759
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,180
Happy fake Valentine's day.

760
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,820
Oh yeah, 7-11.

761
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,900
The fake Valentine's day every year.

762
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,700
That or we beefed it on the timing.

763
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,100
So maybe the baddest we've ever beefed.

764
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,540
Yeah, we're like at the inverse.

765
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,460
We're very, very far off.

766
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,340
It's hate day.

767
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,260
What's the opposite of Valentine's day?

768
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,140
Six months later.

769
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,780
Here's some butt chocolates.

770
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,980
I don't even know what those are.

771
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,060
Here's some, here's some nails.

772
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,460
Here's some cigarette butts

773
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,700
in a nice decorative heart shaped box.

774
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,780
Um, so good for all that.

775
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,540
For both of you, AJ and D Money.

776
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,420
May you live happily ever after, I guess.

777
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,020
Hey guys, this is Adam Conover.

778
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,700
You may know me from my true TV show,

779
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,740
Adam Ruins Everything.

780
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,540
Well, guess what?

781
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,140
Now we're doing a podcast version

782
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,740
right here on Maximum Fun.

783
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,500
What we do is we take all the interesting,

784
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,020
fascinating experts that we talked to

785
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,460
for just a couple of minutes on the show

786
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,940
and we sit with them for an entire podcast,

787
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,380
really going deep and getting into

788
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,700
the fascinating details of their work.

789
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,900
Find Adam Ruins Everything

790
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,340
wherever you get your podcasts

791
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,940
or at MaximumFun.org.

792
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,620
We are now going to share with you

793
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,220
our interview with guestpert,

794
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,740
Patrick Rothfuss.

795
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,820
Even if you aren't familiar with his work,

796
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,340
I think you're really going to enjoy it.

797
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,380
There's a lot of interesting discussion

798
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,780
about parenthood and creating stories

799
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,340
and he's just a really cool fella

800
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,620
and we really enjoy talking with him

801
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,540
and I think you're going to enjoy that.

802
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,620
But we will be back with you

803
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,580
right after that interview,

804
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,060
which is taking away us from four days ago.

805
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,060
I'm very excited, ladies and gentlemen,

806
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
to introduce our guest,

807
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,180
our special guestpert on this episode.

808
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,940
I've been a fan for many, many years of his work

809
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,620
to the point where my friends and I

810
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,900
would have like conspiracy theory level discussions

811
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,700
on what we thought was going on in the stories.

812
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,620
And I know that that is not uncommon.

813
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,940
We are joined this week by,

814
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,140
I'm going to say at this point,

815
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,540
I'm just going to go ahead and say legendary author,

816
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,820
Patrick Rothfuss,

817
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,500
author of the Kingkiller Chronicles

818
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,700
and regular fixture on the

819
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,380
Dungeons and Dragons,

820
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,820
Wizards of the Coast podcast,

821
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,900
Acquisitions Incorporated member,

822
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,860
just general kind of cool internet nerd dude.

823
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,660
Welcome, Patrick.

824
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,220
Hey there.

825
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,580
Sorry to try to feel the need to label you like that.

826
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,060
Jeez.

827
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,020
Yeah, jeez.

828
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,180
I just, I like to know who my people are at any given,

829
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,220
it makes me feel safer.

830
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,420
I will say I am more comfortable with internet nerd

831
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,220
than legendary fantasy author.

832
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,780
Yeah.

833
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,740
Now-

834
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,060
Legendary makes me feel like a little bit of a collectible.

835
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,580
Master of the quill.

836
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,540
Patrick, a quick Google of you,

837
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,300
according to Google,

838
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,820
you are influenced by,

839
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
and these are the only two it says,

840
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,820
William Shakespeare and George R.R. Martin.

841
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,940
So is that about sum it up?

842
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,460
You know-

843
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,900
Is it just those two?

844
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,340
If I was, yeah, that's pretty much,

845
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,020
those are the only two things I've ever read.

846
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,980
I'm going to squish these bad boys together,

847
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,620
see what happens.

848
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,260
You got your George R.R. Martin in my Shakespeare.

849
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,500
You got your Shakespeare in my George R.R. Martin.

850
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,300
Yeah, pretty much just the histories of Shakespeare

851
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,740
and only the second and the fourth Martin books.

852
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,180
Did it make as much sense as if you had just read them

853
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,140
from the beginning?

854
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,300
I wonder what metric,

855
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,620
what weird fucking Google thing pulled up those

856
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,900
as my influences.

857
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,740
Like how the hell did that happen?

858
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,140
It does say, I will say it says comma more.

859
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,940
So there are other-

860
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,780
Also Judy Blume.

861
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,280
Yeah.

862
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,380
Patrick, we have a big list of questions here.

863
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,340
Travis, you curated these.

864
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,740
How many jerks did we get asking about book three

865
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,580
and did you put those jerks in the garbage?

866
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,220
I did.

867
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,500
I threw those jerks right away.

868
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,660
I burned them off the internet like a wart.

869
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,620
So we won't have to worry about that anymore.

870
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,820
All the questions,

871
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,020
we asked you some topics you felt comfortable giving advice on

872
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,460
and you just kind of went with it.

873
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,300
I felt comfortable giving advice on

874
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,020
and you said storytelling and parenting.

875
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,820
So we've got an interesting grab bag of those two sets.

876
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,700
Let's start off.

877
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,620
We've had to start putting those expertise areas out there

878
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,820
because I think we had like Elizabeth Gilbert,

879
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,580
author of Eat, Pray, Love on the show,

880
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,500
dear friend of the family.

881
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,780
And everybody's like, my garbage disposal is broken.

882
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,820
How do I fix it?

883
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,660
Oh man, I really missed out.

884
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,300
Did we in turn go ahead and ask her that question?

885
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,340
I mean, we could have at any point stepped in

886
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,620
and not done that.

887
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,460
Listen, there were a lot of steps in that process

888
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,260
that we fucked up.

889
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,260
We did bad.

890
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,140
We get that.

891
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,100
We get that now.

892
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,420
And now Elizabeth Gilbert won't talk to us anymore.

893
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,180
I understand that we did bad.

894
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,380
But here's the first question.

895
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,300
I've never held a baby

896
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,460
and me and my wife are trying to conceive.

897
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,420
I'm genuinely worried that I'm going to hold the baby wrong.

898
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,900
What would be the best way to hold a newborn in your opinion?

899
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,660
That's from Nathan and Yukon

900
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,780
and like two of the three brothers on this show right now.

901
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,980
Yeah, also, yes.

902
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,620
Oh, are you like gearing up for babying?

903
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,020
Yeah.

904
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,380
Travis and I are both,

905
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,660
and with our respective wives,

906
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,700
we are both expecting.

907
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,980
We're not expecting with each other

908
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,500
in some sort of weird incestuous junior situation.

909
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,420
It's worth noting, Patrick, before you hop in,

910
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,860
I do have a two-year-old

911
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
so they could have fucking asked me at any point,

912
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,900
but that's fine.

913
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,940
You know, here's the thing, we're grown ass adults, Joseph.

914
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,300
Patrick Roth is on the show

915
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,580
and he'll tell you how to hold a baby.

916
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,700
We're grown ass adults

917
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,020
and sometimes it's really disheartening

918
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,460
and kind of embarrassing to go,

919
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,300
how do I hold a tiny human?

920
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,220
So how do you?

921
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,900
The thing is, I will say,

922
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,420
actually, I'm going to come to your defense.

923
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Generally speaking, there's not a community

924
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,740
of guys talking about being dads.

925
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,180
You know, culturally, women get together.

926
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,380
It's valued in the culture.

927
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,380
Women feel free to ask these questions,

928
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,660
share information,

929
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,900
but it's not a typical dude thing.

930
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,020
Now, what I've discovered is that geek dudes,

931
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,140
we like to do everything to the best of our ability

932
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,740
and we like to mine for data.

933
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,380
And so we're an interesting subsection

934
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,660
of the population.

935
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,940
And so there is a lot of geek dad talk.

936
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,980
But anyway, with holding a baby and here,

937
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,860
I'm sorry, this will be irritatingly frank advice,

938
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,700
which is kind of boring.

939
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,820
But the most important thing is to get in there

940
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,220
because the baby's going to get born.

941
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,900
You're going to be freaked out

942
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,460
and you're going to be thinking

943
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,140
exactly what everybody thinks.

944
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,140
They're going to be like, oh no, I'm going to fuck it up.

945
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,260
It's, this is such a like essential part of it,

946
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,500
but this is one area in which

947
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,100
like I think we have it not great off.

948
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,100
And that is that parenting books

949
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,660
and like baby books aimed at dudes

950
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,420
are almost invariably the fucking pits.

951
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,660
Like without any useful information whatsoever,

952
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,260
the stuff in these books is like,

953
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,100
make sure to build yourself a man cave

954
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,540
that the baby's not allowed in,

955
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,220
that you put all your football trophies.

956
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,980
In dudes you're getting a dad,

957
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,980
the book that I read and encouraged you,

958
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,980
it said you probably have a hard time connecting

959
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,260
with your unborn baby.

960
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,660
And it suggested drawing football plays

961
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,260
on your pregnant wife's stomach

962
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
and explaining them to the fetus

963
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,700
to encourage some sort of basic human connection.

964
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,140
And I'm like, and I'm like,

965
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,060
which bones in there do I need to not touch

966
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,580
because they're crazy baby bones

967
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,540
and they're super weak.

968
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,460
And if I touch it while holding it wrong,

969
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,660
like I lose.

970
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,260
Well, I think what Patrick is saying,

971
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,340
if I might paraphrase,

972
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,660
there's no wrong way to hold a baby.

973
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,980
Well, no, no, actually what I will say,

974
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
and as you will quickly learn,

975
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,340
I lack the ability to make simple declarative statements.

976
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,060
Every question that I respond to,

977
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,980
if not everything that I fucking say

978
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,980
ends up being a little story.

979
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,940
So here's the story.

980
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,300
I'm in the delivery room.

981
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,700
I've been on team baby.

982
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,940
I've been minding my position, right?

983
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,860
Because in the delivery room,

984
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,180
you are not the fucking captain of the ship

985
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,620
and you are not the first mate.

986
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,020
And you're just, you're like way down.

987
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,060
You're the poor orphan that's stowed away

988
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,820
in the basement of the ship,

989
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,460
hiding in a discarded gin barrel,

990
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,660
hoping you're not discovered.

991
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,980
Just trying to get to the new world.

992
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
At best, you're some sort of bosun,

993
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,300
you know, like Gideon Forsen.

994
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,820
And so baby gets born

995
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,100
and I have an amazing midwife there

996
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,900
who's helping out, which is a whole different story.

997
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,100
You know, because the first thing is

998
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,460
you gotta cut the umbilical cord

999
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,380
and she goes and she hands me the scissors.

1000
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,300
And I'm like, oh no, I'm fine.

1001
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,660
This has been a great experience.

1002
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I'm full of all sorts of emotions,

1003
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,620
but like, you know how to do this

1004
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,460
and I'm a fucking idiot.

1005
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,260
So how about you use the surgical implement

1006
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,380
and I will just stand here.

1007
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,340
And she handed it to me and she goes,

1008
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,900
do it.

1009
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,900
And so I did it.

1010
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,500
You know, and I'm like, okay, I did it.

1011
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
She was right about my capabilities.

1012
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,900
I could do this.

1013
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,700
First thing, of course, you get the baby

1014
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,220
on the mom's chest.

1015
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,140
So the baby gets skin to skin contact,

1016
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,700
super important.

1017
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,460
And then after a little bit,

1018
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,020
I did get a chance.

1019
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,460
And what I said was, oh no, no, that's okay.

1020
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,980
Let's get a bunch of that skin to skin.

1021
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,420
Let's leave the baby on the mom.

1022
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,140
But all I was doing was like, I don't know.

1023
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,500
I don't want to do it wrong.

1024
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,140
That's the fear.

1025
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,980
And so she said, do it.

1026
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,140
And she puts the baby in my arms

1027
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,180
and I'm super careful.

1028
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,300
And that's how I started doing it.

1029
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,420
And the more you do it,

1030
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,460
the better you get at it.

1031
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,260
But you can't start getting good at it

1032
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,060
until you start.

1033
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,300
And so you got to start like fucking hour one.

1034
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,580
Get in there, hold it, and then you'll start.

1035
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:37,060
You'll be a fucking pro inside of three months.

1036
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,580
You'll learn the upside down.

1037
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,940
You'll learn the leg over the top.

1038
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,460
You'll learn the backwards.

1039
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,780
You'll learn if you lay them on the left hand side,

1040
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,820
they fart better.

1041
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,380
Yeah.

1042
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,180
What really?

1043
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,620
Does that work for adults too?

1044
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,220
See, skin to skin was your first mistake, Patrick.

1045
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,060
You got to go skin to football.

1046
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,620
I had my baby on a football.

1047
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,700
The moment she was born,

1048
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,020
she was lying on a football just to get that connection

1049
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,660
between her and football, which I love so much.

1050
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,420
I was, of course, referring to a pigskin.

1051
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,220
A pigskin.

1052
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,020
Fantastic.

1053
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,140
Fantastic.

1054
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,620
Very good.

1055
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,100
Naturally.

1056
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,500
It's good.

1057
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,780
You can do the skin to skin as a dad too.

1058
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,900
Don't be afraid, guys.

1059
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,860
Take that shirt off.

1060
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,980
Get some skin to skin going.

1061
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,300
It's good.

1062
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,780
No matter what the doctor or midwife says.

1063
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,260
Yeah.

1064
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,460
But I mean, not right away.

1065
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,460
You can do skin to skin for a long time.

1066
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,500
Yeah.

1067
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,660
And honestly, I mean, here's your interesting science fact.

1068
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,460
If you put the baby on the mom, if the baby is too hot,

1069
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,540
the skin to skin contact, the mom's body will regulate

1070
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,980
the baby's body temperature.

1071
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,780
That's babies.

1072
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,780
Crazy babies, too.

1073
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,340
It is.

1074
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,860
This is fucking like this is why we've survived as a species.

1075
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,900
The baby's too cold.

1076
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,580
The mama actually heats up and warms up the baby.

1077
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,660
But here's the here's the tricky bit.

1078
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,980
If the baby is too hot, the mom's body cools down to bring

1079
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,820
the baby's body temperature down.

1080
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,460
What?

1081
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,020
Yeah.

1082
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,500
Yeah.

1083
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,260
What does my body do?

1084
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,500
And here's you get you get half of that.

1085
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:06,900
Okay.

1086
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,540
You're not, you know, you're not, you know, Wolverine.

1087
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,220
You don't get the full suite of powers.

1088
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,700
But you're like Dazzler, right?

1089
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,260
You know, where if you have the baby on your chest, you know,

1090
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,660
skin to skin, if the baby is too cold, a dad's body will warm

1091
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,020
up and warm up the baby.

1092
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,740
But you don't get the other side where you can cool it down.

1093
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,700
So it's half.

1094
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,140
Dads aren't cool.

1095
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,420
You heard it here first.

1096
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,220
Well, I think we all knew that already.

1097
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,780
Can I read one off this list?

1098
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,420
Yes.

1099
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,140
We got a bunch.

1100
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,140
And I really only want to hear about the stuff that's

1101
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,060
interesting to me.

1102
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,060
That's a pro interviewer tip that I learned from Barbara Walters

1103
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,580
is the one who does the interviews.

1104
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,020
I've been slowly building a world for use in DMing or maybe

1105
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,820
try my hand at writing short stories when it comes to creating

1106
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,100
a world from scratch.

1107
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,620
What was your first step or maybe baseline, i.e. geography,

1108
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,020
religion, world events, Brian?

1109
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

1110
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,180
Brian is the person who has that.

1111
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,780
You got to get a good Brian in there.

1112
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,540
And then you sort of spiral out from there.

1113
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,580
I think a lot of people are looking for a recipe, which is

1114
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,460
very understandable.

1115
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,340
You're kind of you want to do a good job at this thing.

1116
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,540
And so you're like, how do you make a good fantasy world?

1117
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,100
And what happens a lot of times is people look to the classics.

1118
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,020
You look to Tolkien because he's like granddaddy.

1119
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,940
Tolkien has this.

1120
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,860
His shadow is long over the fantasy world.

1121
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,660
And and so people look at that and they go, OK, you need a

1122
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,540
bunch of poetry.

1123
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,460
You need a bunch of fake languages.

1124
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,300
You need mythology.

1125
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,140
You need a big history that goes back 5000 years.

1126
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,060
But here's the thing.

1127
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,460
That's not what makes a good fantasy world or a good world

1128
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,820
of whatever sort you're creating.

1129
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,540
What made that good is that Tolkien was a huge geek for all

1130
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,660
of those things.

1131
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:07,060
He studied the like Norse Edda's and he was a linguistics

1132
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,540
nut and he loved history.

1133
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,220
And so, of course, all of those things that he was super

1134
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,700
passionate about informed the world that he was creating.

1135
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,460
But odds are, you are not all of those things.

1136
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,620
So if you try to follow Tolkien's recipe, you're just not going

1137
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,380
to know as much about those things and you won't be as

1138
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,260
excited about them.

1139
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,500
And that passion won't show up in the world you're making.

1140
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,060
So generally speaking, I mean, in my world, there's a lot

1141
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,180
about economy and about coinage and money.

1142
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,820
And that's because I'm kind of a geek for that stuff.

1143
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,660
There's a lot about like religion and philosophy because

1144
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,780
I'm kind of a geek for that.

1145
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,540
Some sociology and psychology, a lot of hard science because

1146
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,140
I was almost a chemical engineer.

1147
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,980
Those things, you know, are what kind of make the cornerstones

1148
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,020
of my world.

1149
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,820
But nobody ever says, where's all your elf poetry, Rothfuss,

1150
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,940
because you need that.

1151
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,440
Yeah.

1152
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,820
Well, at least not to your face.

1153
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,900
Not to my face, right?

1154
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,300
Whenever I start reading a new fantasy series, I'm always

1155
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,500
impressed that it always seems like they put so much thought

1156
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,540
into how magic works in their specific world.

1157
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,740
Is that a good, because that's one of my favorite things

1158
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,260
about the Kingkiller Chronicles is like the explanation of

1159
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,740
sympathy and like how magic works specifically in the world

1160
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,020
you've created.

1161
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,060
Is that a good base point for a fantasy writer or is that

1162
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,460
something that comes out of the world you've built?

1163
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,380
It definitely has a big impact on the world.

1164
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,100
And if you are interested in it and if you like it, you can

1165
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,140
you like it, then absolutely you should you should do that.

1166
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,700
It's really interesting to note that Tolkien doesn't do any

1167
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,540
of that, you know, and like those books are fairly

1168
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,100
successful.

1169
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,500
And but think about it, like, what do you know about what

1170
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,380
Gandalf can do?

1171
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,100
He can blow a smoke ring and then put a ship in it, I think.

1172
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:09,780
Right.

1173
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,220
Well, that's not that's not magic.

1174
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,340
Like, look at any vape tricks compilation video that goes

1175
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,740
viral on Facebook and like people are doing way crazier

1176
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,460
shit than that now.

1177
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,540
But like he like actually Gandalf is kind of crap in terms

1178
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,740
of the magic department.

1179
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,420
You look at the Hobbit, what does he do?

1180
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,340
He like makes a couple of like flashes and sets pine cones

1181
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:30,980
on fire.

1182
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,620
Big deal.

1183
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,500
I could do that.

1184
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,220
But there's no big magic system there.

1185
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,260
You may have just ruined those books for me because I'm

1186
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,580
thinking back at like all this stuff like, wait, he turned

1187
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,100
gray and then he turned white.

1188
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,900
What did? Why? Why did that?

1189
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,020
Why did he do this?

1190
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,820
Why did this happen?

1191
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,980
Yeah, he not he had a there was a big monster coming at him

1192
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,500
and the Balrog, you know what he did?

1193
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,020
He knocked himself off a bridge.

1194
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,220
He broke a bridge he was on.

1195
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,860
Good job.

1196
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,140
Good magic, bud.

1197
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,780
Good magic.

1198
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,460
Get your shit together Gandalf, geez.

1199
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,900
Yeah, do something.

1200
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,380
Hey, Patrick, I understand starting a fantasy world with

1201
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,380
what I like, but what if I only like garbage?

1202
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,700
I can't very well build a fantasy world about discontinued

1203
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,460
cereals, which is the only thing I'm interested in.

1204
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:14,180
You know, I would argue that I would I would love I would

1205
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,340
maybe not a fantasy world, but I could see a dystopian future.

1206
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,700
Yeah, or that's the currency.

1207
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,300
Yeah, it's three.

1208
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,260
See, there you go.

1209
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,580
Three crunch berries to a to a boo berry.

1210
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,260
I can't tell if Justin's joking or not because we've been

1211
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,860
taught the three of us with our dad.

1212
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,460
We do a Dungeons and Dragons podcast that I DM and we've

1213
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,020
talked about like when my campaign is over, us taking

1214
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,860
turns trying the DM mantel on and Justin, you seemed to

1215
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,340
prickle at the thought of of of building a fantasy world.

1216
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,500
I'm wondering how much truth there is to you there.

1217
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,940
It's infinite truth, Griffin.

1218
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,140
It's 100 percent true.

1219
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,660
I feel like I don't have a creative bone in my body as far

1220
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,700
as that stuff goes.

1221
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,260
I just don't have you know, not every the world needs

1222
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,300
farmers to Griffin.

1223
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,300
Not everybody can create a fantasy world.

1224
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,740
Yeah, Justin's too busy working the land to get in there

1225
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,420
and make up a D&D campaign.

1226
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,140
Watch me bridge this, guys.

1227
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,780
This is the best segue I've ever performed in my life.

1228
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,900
I really want to back that up.

1229
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,300
My two boys because I got one who's six, one who's two, and

1230
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,140
I tell little stories with with the older boy.

1231
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,900
And a lot of them are, you know, you could call them

1232
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,100
collaborative storytelling.

1233
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,340
But what I'm really doing is I'm role playing without the

1234
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,580
dice, you know, and I put him in a situation and I say, you

1235
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,660
find a cave and you go into the cave and what do you do?

1236
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,380
And then he gives answers and I tell the story.

1237
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,660
And I always kind of was hoping that he would take off more

1238
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,620
and more and tell the stories himself.

1239
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,220
But he doesn't like that.

1240
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,460
He likes being the character in the world.

1241
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,380
Now, my littler boy, who's only two and a half, you give him

1242
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:07,220
the slightest starting point and he will, like, launch into

1243
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,020
telling a story.

1244
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,740
My daughter is almost two.

1245
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,180
Currently, she's only interested in ingesting Pee-Wee's

1246
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:14,740
Playhouse.

1247
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,620
So the the pretending in our house currently is one hundred

1248
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,260
percent Pee-Wee's Playhouse themed.

1249
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,500
I portray Terry and Captain Carl when I can find the hat.

1250
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:32,660
My wife is Cowboy Curtis and my daughter is Pee-Wee sometimes

1251
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,260
and also Missy Vaughn when I feel like going to find the

1252
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,340
dress that she has to wear to be Missy Vaughn.

1253
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,380
So, yeah, it's great.

1254
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,220
It's actually like makes my life super weird because sometimes

1255
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,660
I walk in my room to talk to my wife and my wife's not there.

1256
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:51,140
Cowboy Curtis is, so I've got to talk through Cowboy Curtis.

1257
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,780
It sounds like you already started a really cool DM session,

1258
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,340
Justin.

1259
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,820
Yeah.

1260
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,740
We have a question here from Andy.

1261
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,340
Do we have a responsibility as parents to sometimes deliberately

1262
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,020
frighten our children with scary stories, movies, video games,

1263
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,820
et cetera?

1264
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,180
That's a great question.

1265
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,020
And I'm so torn to give, like, some really bad advice here.

1266
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,940
I don't think there's good advice to be had.

1267
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,660
Yeah, man.

1268
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,860
I'm not going to lie to you.

1269
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:19,220
There's a huge amount of delight to be gained by terrifying

1270
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,020
your child.

1271
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,140
You know, like, especially if you're in a bit of a mood or

1272
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,180
they're being, like, a little bit of a dick, that will happen.

1273
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,380
I mean, we love our kids, right?

1274
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,660
But they can still be dicks.

1275
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,060
Well, I love my brothers and they're dicks all the time.

1276
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,180
And he spooks us.

1277
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,340
He sends me pictures of ghosts, like, every day.

1278
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:42,660
And so here's a great example of maybe I can show you the good

1279
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,940
and the bad.

1280
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,260
You know, we're all in bed.

1281
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,100
Sarah still sleeps with the boys.

1282
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,780
I don't, because I'm huge and the bed isn't big enough.

1283
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,180
And so we're all in bed.

1284
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,780
We've been reading some stories.

1285
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,380
It's time for sleep.

1286
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:05,220
And Sarah says to the older boy, says to Ute, OK, go pee.

1287
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,740
It's time for bed.

1288
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,100
And it's nighttime.

1289
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,820
And it's really easy to forget, as an adult, how terrifying

1290
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,820
the dark is, you know?

1291
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,700
And he's like, come with me, come with me.

1292
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,820
And I'm like, you know, it's down the hallway.

1293
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,900
You can turn the lights on.

1294
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,620
You can do it.

1295
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:28,180
And it's important for him to get over this a little bit.

1296
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,140
Sarah has worked out a compromise where she'll let

1297
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,180
him go, but she'll tell him a story so he can hear her

1298
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,580
voice, and that's reassuring.

1299
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,900
And it gives him enough so that he can go and turn on the

1300
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,580
lights and be brave.

1301
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,140
And to practice being brave.

1302
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,820
And so he goes, will you tell me a story?

1303
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,940
And I go, sure.

1304
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,220
And so he starts to go.

1305
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,060
And I hear his little feet going off.

1306
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,820
And I go, once upon a time, there was a little boy, and he

1307
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:01,060
lived in a house with a thousand ghosts made of bone.

1308
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,140
And I hear him go, ah.

1309
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,220
And then, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop,

1310
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,940
like his feet as he's running back into the room.

1311
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,580
And he jumps onto the bed.

1312
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,460
And I laugh.

1313
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,660
And he's like, dad.

1314
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,020
And it's OK.

1315
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,300
This was a play.

1316
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,300
It's a play we're doing.

1317
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,020
And so then I go, OK, I'm sorry.

1318
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,940
So he gets up, and he starts going again.

1319
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,540
And he goes, no bones in this story.

1320
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,700
And I go, OK, I'll tell you a story with no bones.

1321
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,900
And he goes, OK, once upon a time, there was a boy, and

1322
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,580
there was a ghost that ate pee, and it was under the

1323
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,940
floor, and it lived near the toilet.

1324
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,100
And he comes running back, you know?

1325
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,780
And it turns into this big joke.

1326
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,580
He keeps going, and I keep telling him a story about a

1327
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,900
pee ghost that lives in the floor, and it would come up

1328
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,460
when he pees in the toilet, and it's going to get his pee.

1329
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,260
Just want to say real quick that ghost that eat pee, you

1330
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,300
are completely on brand right now, Patrick Rothfuss, for

1331
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,540
the MBMBAM sort of milieu.

1332
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,140
And then finally, I've talked about this for a long time.

1333
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,340
So and then finally, I've told too many of these stories.

1334
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,820
I legitimately freaked him out.

1335
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,780
And then he says, and then he's like, he's just not going

1336
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,940
to do it anymore.

1337
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,340
And Sarah's like, OK, you fucked this up.

1338
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:16,980
Go.

1339
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,940
You have to walk him to the bathroom now.

1340
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,380
I'm not getting out of bed, because you've

1341
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,820
made a mess of this.

1342
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,060
So I go, and we go into the bathroom, and he pees.

1343
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,980
This has been fun.

1344
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,140
This has been a ton of fun.

1345
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,580
It's playful.

1346
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:33,260
And I'm in the bathroom, standing behind him, and it

1347
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,980
occurs to me how hysterical it would be to just do a little

1348
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,460
like, ah, and maybe grab him a little bit, and maybe tickle

1349
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,940
him a little bit.

1350
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:49,660
I have the foresight to not do this while he is peeing,

1351
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,180
because I don't want to clean that up.

1352
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:57,100
He finishes peeing, and then I just, again, very gently,

1353
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,220
because I know my boy, and he can get spooked pretty easy.

1354
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,700
He's very gentle.

1355
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,500
And so I do just a little one.

1356
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,060
I get down, and I get my fingers on his rib, and I go,

1357
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,940
wah, but instead of him just having a little jump and a

1358
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:17,940
squeak, he screams bloody murder and completely curls up

1359
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,660
into a ball.

1360
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,860
And I'm like, oh, I failed.

1361
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,900
I've really failed as a dad.

1362
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,500
And Sarah's like, what the actual hell is

1363
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,300
going on in there?

1364
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,020
And so I pick him up, and I sit down on the floor with him,

1365
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:36,300
and I'm like, oh, my sweetie, I am so sorry.

1366
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,460
I'm so sorry.

1367
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,220
I thought that would be funny, and it wasn't funny.

1368
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:46,020
And he's like, that was dad.

1369
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,860
That was super scary.

1370
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,940
And I'm like, I'm so sorry.

1371
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,700
That was not fair.

1372
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,820
I shouldn't have done that.

1373
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:54,940
And he hugs me, and we go back in.

1374
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,540
And at this point, I'm like, he's going to remember this.

1375
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,900
And when I'm in the hospital as an old man, this is the

1376
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,700
memory he's going to flash back to.

1377
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,980
He's going to put me in a home because I've

1378
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,540
betrayed his trust here.

1379
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,220
But we get back, and I'm thinking, I'm the worst dad

1380
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:18,100
ever, and the next day, I'm still dwelling on it.

1381
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:25,100
And I go, you know, I am super sorry that I did that.

1382
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,900
I want you to know I won't do that.

1383
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,660
And he goes, I thought it would be funny.

1384
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,380
He goes, you know, dad, it was a little bit funny.

1385
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,540
Oh, that's a cool kid, man.

1386
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,500
I would not have let you.

1387
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,420
I would have seen how many Nintendo 64 cartridges I could

1388
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,620
have shucked out of that situation.

1389
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,500
Yeah.

1390
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,500
I think it's super important to be just honest with them.

1391
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,020
And you don't want to use them as a confessional, but I

1392
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,140
think it's really helpful when you screw up, if you say,

1393
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,140
boy, I just made a big mistake, and I'm so sorry.

1394
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,100
Modeling that behavior for them is really helpful, I

1395
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,020
think.

1396
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,340
The tricky thing, I feel like, is you don't know which of

1397
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,380
those little spooky goofs is going to get deep in their

1398
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,460
brain and then be a thing that's scary.

1399
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,420
We got Christmas, 1996, McElroy household got a Sony

1400
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,500
PlayStation, what's up, best Christmas ever, except the

1401
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,980
games that we got were Resident Evil and Blood Omen

1402
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,220
Legacy of Kane.

1403
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,540
So like nine-year-old Griffin was like, cool, I'm just

1404
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,020
going to like, I know I have the first bedtime, so I'm just

1405
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,820
going to probably just like chill and sit at the top of

1406
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,260
the stairs while I can still see the light coming from the

1407
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,740
first floor hallway and just like the comforting voices of

1408
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,700
my family before I go to bed and will definitely be like,

1409
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,940
you know, eviscerated or eaten.

1410
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,060
I still remember, why do all of our fears center around

1411
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:42,900
video games?

1412
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,340
I remember the American Final Fantasy III with Palim and

1413
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,380
Porom turned to stone to stop walls from crushing you.

1414
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,620
Yeah, spoilers, sorry.

1415
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,860
And like, that was my fear until I was like 18, that I

1416
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,020
would be crushed by walls or turned to stone.

1417
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,700
Travis, that was American Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy

1418
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,500
IV, in Japan, sorry.

1419
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,220
Sorry, I just wanted to get ahead of the tweets.

1420
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,580
Just want to get ahead of the tweets.

1421
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,540
Justin, do you want to talk about your phobia or another

1422
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,180
question?

1423
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,100
No, I've detailed my phobias and excruciating.

1424
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,300
Justin's afraid of fiction.

1425
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,020
Yeah, I'm afraid of creativity in all its forms.

1426
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,660
Burn it from the earth, I say.

1427
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,380
I want to do this last question.

1428
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,300
Does that sound good to you guys?

1429
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,140
Yeah, go for it.

1430
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,980
Okay.

1431
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,400
How do you balance working on so many projects from home

1432
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,980
and raising two kids?

1433
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,040
I know two of the brothers Mackroy are expecting and the

1434
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,940
other already has a little one, so I failed the discussion.

1435
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,700
Everyone could weigh in on.

1436
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,540
That's from Mish.

1437
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:41,540
Yeah, I don't know.

1438
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,860
Okay, so here's-

1439
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,300
Well, that's all the time we have, everybody.

1440
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,440
Thanks so much, Patrick, for joining us.

1441
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,820
Very good discussion.

1442
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:48,640
How about this?

1443
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,580
I knew I would be okay on this podcast because my true

1444
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:56,220
specialty is giving really bad advice that once you hear it,

1445
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,660
you're like, oh shit, anything I do will be better than what

1446
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,700
Rothfuss suggested.

1447
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,700
Hey, watch out.

1448
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,020
There's only enough room for one of us in this town.

1449
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:08,020
And so, you know, I still remember when my older boy,

1450
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,080
when he was, you know, maybe 18 months, which again,

1451
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,660
is this golden time because they're just full of joy

1452
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,900
and wonder and love.

1453
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,460
And I came home from working on book two and I see him

1454
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:28,660
sitting on the floor, like naked, just like this pink,

1455
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:33,660
hudgy, like ball of raw joy.

1456
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,780
And he's found a plastic hanger and he's moving it.

1457
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,020
You know, he's like using it and he's hitting the floor

1458
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,140
and he looks up at me and he moves this hanger and he's

1459
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:49,040
like, he's looking at me thinking, holy man, dad,

1460
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,660
did you know that you could like move a hanger?

1461
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,180
You know, and he's full of joy and excitement over,

1462
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,540
like just banging a hanger around.

1463
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:01,960
And I'm like, I am missing this, you know?

1464
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,100
And like, for the rest of my life, I will regret putting

1465
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,560
in these 16 hour days to try to get book two done

1466
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,700
because my child was here having this, like,

1467
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,060
and I'm never gonna get this back.

1468
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,820
I'm never gonna get another chance.

1469
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,340
And like, I will, I'll feel bad about it forever.

1470
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,660
Now, that's not to say that I didn't get some good times

1471
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:28,860
and I didn't spend time, but I tell you, nobody

1472
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,260
on their death bed thinks, boy, I wish I would have spent

1473
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,520
more time at work.

1474
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,500
Sure.

1475
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,680
Although book two's real good.

1476
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,660
It is pretty good, turned out pretty good.

1477
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:43,300
I guess, I guess, thanks, thank you.

1478
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,140
Thanks.

1479
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,560
You know, everybody always says that about no one

1480
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,400
on their death bed.

1481
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,420
I bet there was one guy who had like just the sickest job

1482
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,620
that he was like, he was just like the captain of parties

1483
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,460
or something and he was like,

1484
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,060
I wish I'd spent more time at work.

1485
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,940
I hated my house.

1486
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,140
The guy who invented like the showbiz pizza company

1487
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,280
is just gonna be like, nice, did it.

1488
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,120
Crushed it.

1489
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,620
Well, but what if there's people on their death bed

1490
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,740
who think, dang, I wish Roth was finished book three.

1491
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,820
I would have loved to tuck into that bad boy.

1492
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,820
Now, that I actually believe, yeah.

1493
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,220
But no, I think the important thing,

1494
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,180
and actually I was talking to Sanderson.

1495
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,580
Sanderson's way better at this,

1496
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,600
not only because he writes 18 times faster than I do,

1497
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,300
but we were talking and he's like, yep.

1498
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,980
He goes, and how's this for gross?

1499
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,380
He says, yep, he goes, I keep it to 10 hours

1500
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,220
of writing a day.

1501
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,920
He goes, 10 hours and I promise myself that I stop

1502
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,460
and I go home and then I spend time with my family.

1503
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,380
Like, you know, 10 hours of writing in a row.

1504
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,380
It's like, ah, you know, I put a lid on it there

1505
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,860
and then after the kids are in bed,

1506
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,580
I can always come back and write more.

1507
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,980
Makes it sound so easy.

1508
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:55,300
It's weird because it doesn't, there's not a,

1509
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,300
I'll be like completely frank about this

1510
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,200
as long as we're just getting into it.

1511
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:04,580
The first year that my daughter was alive,

1512
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,720
I was really bad at this.

1513
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,300
I mean, things had really started to pick up with the show

1514
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,820
and I suddenly had a full plate.

1515
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,740
I mean, it was like full, you would think that that's like

1516
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,700
horse apples considering what I do for a living,

1517
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,180
but like the stuff got busy.

1518
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:28,180
And the thought I would have a lot of the time is,

1519
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,980
well, she's with people who are caring for her,

1520
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,060
so she's fine.

1521
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,460
And the crappy thing about finding balance like that

1522
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:41,620
is like they will spend time with somebody.

1523
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,760
Like there will be people to fill the gap there

1524
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,580
if you're not like there putting in the hours

1525
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:50,580
and actually like investing the time into it.

1526
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:55,220
And like they, I think one of the last realizations you have

1527
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:00,180
in the process of maturing into a full-blown adult

1528
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:04,060
is that the time that you do have is precious.

1529
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,380
And like that was, it actually took me I think a year

1530
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:11,380
after Charlie was born to really like absorb that lesson

1531
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:16,740
and really make that a part of my day-to-day existence.

1532
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,540
And I still don't think I'm great at it.

1533
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,580
I get to the end of a lot of days

1534
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,820
thinking that I haven't done either particularly well,

1535
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:30,220
but I guess that's not particularly helpful advice.

1536
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,500
Well, you know, it's, and I'll chime in there as well.

1537
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,620
For me, it's bad enough if you work too long

1538
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,040
and then you don't get in, then you don't get home

1539
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,380
and you only get to spend two hours.

1540
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,280
I remember at one point,

1541
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,460
just to maybe make you feel better about yourself,

1542
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:48,500
I remember at one point saying,

1543
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,060
like resolving to myself

1544
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:53,620
that I would spend at least two hours a day with my kid.

1545
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,860
And of course that resolution by itself

1546
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:59,020
is an extraordinarily like sad thing

1547
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,820
because it implies that I was not spending

1548
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,860
two hours a day with my kid, which is ridiculous.

1549
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,880
You know, it'd be one thing if we were starving to death

1550
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,620
and I was a coal miner,

1551
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:11,860
but you know, different things shake you in different ways

1552
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:14,420
and it's kind of a shame a lot of ways

1553
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,780
you don't learn how to do something right

1554
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,820
until you screw it up or until you see

1555
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,060
somebody else screw it up.

1556
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,820
And that's, I feel the service I provide

1557
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,660
to the entire world is screwing things up very visibly

1558
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,740
so other people can learn from my mistakes.

1559
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,460
And you're a real hero.

1560
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,540
I've always said that about you.

1561
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,900
I, you know, I was going to,

1562
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,660
it was one of my first San Diego Comic Cons

1563
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,260
and I went and it's a long con

1564
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,540
and there's a day of travel on either side

1565
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,020
and I'd spent other trips away,

1566
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,140
but they were much shorter.

1567
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,440
I get on the phone and I hear him

1568
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,540
in his tiny piping voice and he's just started to talk

1569
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,380
and he goes, daddy.

1570
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,980
I go, hey, sweet baby, how are you?

1571
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:01,500
And he goes, daddy, daddy, hold you in my arms.

1572
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,060
Oh, out, out, damn it.

1573
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,780
Now see, the only, I would do,

1574
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,540
I would pull a move like that if I was a child,

1575
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,660
but again, only to get some like

1576
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:15,340
guilt Nintendo 64 games out of it upon my father's return.

1577
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,060
When he said, hold you in my arms,

1578
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,700
I knew he was expressing that to me,

1579
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,380
but it wasn't his own phrase.

1580
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,600
I knew that phrase came from Corduroy,

1581
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,980
the book, the kid's book,

1582
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,060
because, you know, the Corduroy is looking for an owner.

1583
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,500
He's trying to find his button

1584
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,620
and the little girl picks him up

1585
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:39,940
and, you know, and holds Corduroy in her arms.

1586
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,940
And so he was thinking of that book

1587
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,140
and somebody bigger holding him

1588
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,460
and taking him to a place.

1589
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:52,780
And it wasn't that I felt he was ripping something else off,

1590
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,740
it's that I knew the context

1591
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,700
for this little phrase he was using.

1592
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,300
So yeah, I guess that's kind of the overarching thing

1593
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,580
is just kind of get in there and do it

1594
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,900
and know that you'll goof it up and it's okay

1595
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,820
and you'll get better at it, be smart.

1596
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,620
And it's like a muscle, you know,

1597
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,180
you will not be the most patient in the world,

1598
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,580
parent in the world at first,

1599
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,600
but if you don't practice being patient,

1600
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,140
you're not gonna get better at it.

1601
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,620
See, this is why I gotta have a second one

1602
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,940
because I would love to get it right.

1603
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,820
I mean, just like really to get it, just like-

1604
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:25,220
You really think you could stick the second,

1605
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,060
I could stick the landing.

1606
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,980
I feel like I could really crush it with a sec.

1607
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,780
The first one's like, okay.

1608
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,940
Well, I mean, look at what our parents did.

1609
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:32,780
Yeah, well-

1610
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:35,580
Yeah, took them three.

1611
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,260
Took them three to really nail it.

1612
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,780
But as long as we can all agree

1613
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,920
that the second is better than the first.

1614
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,760
I think we can all-

1615
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,600
Well, in a lot of ways,

1616
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,820
you can over-correct on the second one.

1617
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,820
Sure, right.

1618
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:48,520
Patrick, thank you so much for joining us.

1619
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,620
Thank you so much.

1620
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,580
I will say I've had a ton of fun.

1621
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,980
I can talk about being a parent for days,

1622
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,380
but you know, if, I feel like I've kind of betrayed

1623
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:01,740
some of the underlying, you know,

1624
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,620
the brand of the podcast here,

1625
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,460
I would love to come back at some point

1626
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,260
and talk about like some stuff that I'm really bad at

1627
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,460
and give bad advice.

1628
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,300
Great.

1629
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,120
Oh, sure.

1630
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,040
What would those areas of unexpertise look like?

1631
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:13,880
What are we-

1632
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,700
Dating.

1633
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,540
Oh, okay.

1634
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,360
Mm-hmm.

1635
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:21,360
And maybe I could give some really bad dating advice.

1636
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,120
Pretty much anything socially interacting

1637
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,060
with other human beings.

1638
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,300
Oh, shit, dude, you're gonna be a total fit in

1639
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,140
on this podcast.

1640
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:29,960
Yeah, you're gonna be great.

1641
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,800
It's gonna be perfect.

1642
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,620
It's gonna be perfect.

1643
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,420
Patrick, obviously, sometimes when we ask guests on the show,

1644
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,920
where can people find your work?

1645
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,420
Like, for you, the answer is like bookstores and Amazon.

1646
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,200
You also have a podcast, I don't think we've talked about it,

1647
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,220
called Unattended Consequences that you do with Max Timken

1648
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,540
from Cards Against Humanity.

1649
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:55,300
Anything else that people can find that you do on internet?

1650
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,860
One big thing that I do is it's sort of,

1651
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,680
you know, on again, off again.

1652
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,740
I run a charity called World Builders.

1653
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:09,060
We raise money for various charitable causes,

1654
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,020
primarily Heifer International,

1655
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:15,880
but also a charity called First Book,

1656
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,460
which gets books into the hands of little kids

1657
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,780
who have maybe never owned a book in their life.

1658
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:24,820
Or we did some stuff for the Syrian refugees.

1659
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,400
World Builders, you know, we do a bunch of different stuff.

1660
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,780
You can find them on worldbuilders.org.

1661
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:34,500
We've raised, I think, maybe $5 million

1662
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,720
for various charities over the last couple of years.

1663
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:41,340
We rally geeks who wanna make the world a better place,

1664
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:45,100
and we help make that happen, and we sell cool merch

1665
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,500
and giveaway books and games and stuff, so.

1666
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,340
Cool.

1667
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,820
Great, so yeah, Patrick, thank you for joining us.

1668
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,660
Thank you for doing the show.

1669
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,480
Thank you for maybe once in 311 episodes

1670
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,420
offering some real sincere good advice.

1671
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,420
Much appreciated.

1672
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,380
Thanks so much for having me, guys.

1673
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,380
Thanks for breaking the streak.

1674
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:04,020
Thanks for putting up with me.

1675
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,220
This has been such a treat.

1676
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,420
Let's wrap up here real quick.

1677
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,460
Some things we need to talk about.

1678
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,300
We are doing live shows in Boston this next weekend.

1679
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,060
Live Adventure Zone and a live Mabim Bam.

1680
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,060
We need questions, both if you're gonna be

1681
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,380
in the audience in Boston and wanna ask advice.

1682
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,260
Send that into, what's our email address even?

1683
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,140
Nobody's quite sure, huh?

1684
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,780
MBMBAM at maximumfun.org.

1685
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,320
Oh, tricky to remember, huh?

1686
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,700
Could also use some Yahoos,

1687
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,000
so any of my Yahoo soldiers to come out in full force.

1688
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,400
Again, we're doing a Monikers expansion.

1689
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,620
Go to mackeroicollection.com.

1690
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,020
We're doing a pre-order for 30 days.

1691
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,420
You can get the expansion for 10 bucks

1692
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,280
or a collection with the expansion

1693
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,180
and the base game for 35.

1694
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,900
Again, mackeroicollection.com.

1695
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,460
I wanna say, if you're looking for other shows to check out,

1696
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,020
check out all the other amazing shows on maximumfun.org.

1697
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,300
There's a ton on there that you're gonna like.

1698
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:57,200
We also do a couple shows that are a little more independent.

1699
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,060
One of my favorite podcasts in the world

1700
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,320
that I look forward to and listen to every week,

1701
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,020
even if I don't have time for anything else,

1702
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,260
I make time for it, is Rose Buddies

1703
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,260
with Griffin and Rachel,

1704
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,900
where they watch and recap The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.

1705
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,060
It is, no joke, one of my favorite things

1706
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,180
that exist in the world right now,

1707
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,060
so I encourage everyone to check it out.

1708
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,800
I also do a show with my friend Tybee called Interrobang,

1709
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,300
where we talk about the things in the world

1710
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,260
that are frustrating us and frustrating you.

1711
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:27,020
Every fifth episode is an audience submitted topics episode,

1712
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,420
and we just did one,

1713
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,000
and you know, there's a lot of frustrating stuff

1714
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,100
going on in the world right now,

1715
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,140
and I'm just trying to build kind of a safe place

1716
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,080
for discussion in podcast form,

1717
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,660
so check that out, called Interrobang.

1718
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,940
And also, you guys have put out a new episode

1719
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:43,220
of The Monster Factory recently that I thoroughly enjoyed,

1720
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,820
and I want everyone to go check that out too.

1721
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:49,060
Griffin and Justin do probably the funniest thing

1722
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,500
on the internet called Monster Factory on YouTube

1723
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,260
through their website Polygon,

1724
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,300
where they create just the most abhorrent characters

1725
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,420
through character creation engines in video games,

1726
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,460
and it's pretty much everyone's favorite thing

1727
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:04,140
on the internet, so go check that out.

1728
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,100
Thank you, Travis.

1729
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,700
Thanks again to Patrick Rothfuss

1730
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,860
for being our guest for this week,

1731
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,820
and thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1732
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,020
for these four theme songs that set apart

1733
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,620
drop the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1734
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,460
It's a wonderful album,

1735
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,620
and you can find it wherever albums are sold.

1736
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,300
Is that it?

1737
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:23,660
Oh, oh, oh, we're gonna be at Max Fun Con East.

1738
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,100
If you haven't picked up your tickets yet, go get those.

1739
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,140
We wanna see you there, we wanna hang out with you

1740
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,500
in the scary, shining hotel in the Poconos Mountains.

1741
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,380
You get to hang out with all the Magroys

1742
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,220
and I think the Smurls as well.

1743
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:39,300
It's gonna be a crazy fun time hanging out in the mountains.

1744
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,460
Come see us, hang out, it's gonna be great.

1745
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,980
We really want you there.

1746

I think you can go to maxfuncon.com for all the information.

1747
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,380
Well, we should make it clear, we're doing not in Bim Bam,

1748
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,180
we're doing Adventure Zone there, so.

1749
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,380
Yep, come hang out.

1750
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,900
Last Yahoo Time, this one was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

1751
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,580
riding high, Zoe Kinski, thank you Zoe,

1752
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:01,380
by Yahoo Answers user, RG778SX, who asks,

1753
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,820
how many people agree that Smash Mouth

1754
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,420
at the end of Rat Race was a crummy way

1755
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,460
to end a classic comedy?

1756
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:14,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
