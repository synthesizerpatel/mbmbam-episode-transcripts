1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,320
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna? Just say, hey I wanna. Just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,720
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I am, at least according to my birth

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,600
certificate, your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. Summer's here.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,560
What? Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. The hot season is here, summer. Check the thermostat.

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,720
The beaches have sand, and you know what that means. The drinks have ice. Then it's summer

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:20,480
stuff all over. And May flowers bring June powers. Sun power? Sun powers. What are the songs of the

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:28,240
summer? Well shit, I mean it's, I don't know that we're far enough in because I like to think that

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,480
mid-July is when the Black Eyed Peas are finally gonna get their shit together. You think they're

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,480
finally gonna get it going? Middle of July is what I expect. I think they're gonna get together.

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,760
They're gonna do the, you know, theme song to a big, the new Spider-Man is gonna have a Black

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,040
Eyed Peas joint as the theme song, and it's gonna be partially about Spider-Man, but also about how

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,800
good it feels when you're together with your friends having a party. Yeah, something about

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:03,120
like let's, let's party responsibly. I have been, uh, to try to get the, um, the pulse of this. I've

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:11,440
been enjoying, um, NBC's Songland, a show where the woman who wrote Super Bass and the young boy from

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,480
One Republic and another gentleman with a beard and a guitar help young songwriters make the next

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:30,000
big hits for today's artists, and I was watching an episode with Jonas Brothers, uh, tried to create

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,520
their song, uh, Greenlight with a new, um, a new song named Able Heart, right? And so they have their

23
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,760
choice of songs to pick, okay? Um, and that this song includes lyrics like, um, just say I got the

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,760
green light the things we do past midnight just me and you and it feels right just an empty room

25
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,080
and the green light and it it I just can't help thinking about so another bit they say before you

26
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,080
come around yeah I was feeling blue so tell me if you're down and I'll fly you to the moon got me

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,160
begging you for more yeah it's nothing new ain't nobody in the world does it like you do I just

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,760
can't help every time I would they would start to improvise about this song about fucking I can't

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,400
help but think about yeah that's the thing it's not about stock car race no sir it's about sex

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,480
and every time I think about it I just think about how these men these men who are brothers in much

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,600
the same way that we are brothers are like well guys let's fucking pump that song about sex will

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,840
you harmonize with me my brother on this song about how we get down with people can we do that

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:52,080
together as brothers together at the same time we'll sing the same thing in this song about pure

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,200
sex joe what rhymes with juices on my fat hog let me get my rhyming dictionary

35
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,960
joe you know how it is whenever you get you know the good stuff

36
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:13,680
uh-huh you know joe hey joe is it is it four or five r's in jerk because I want to get it right

37
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,440
for the song our new number one single it's not the thing to get hung up on in the lyrics you

38
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,600
just described but why is empty room invoked there that's not sexy in the original version

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,120
of the lyrics they the the gentleman even says like don't need a bed like we don't need a bed

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:41,680
i think you probably do if someone said hey come have sex with me and i said yes i am interested

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,840
and then they led me into a room that was just ceiling and floor and like four bare walls

42
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:55,280
they're gonna dexter me yeah yeah yeah all the lock star exterior green light um i don't think

43
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,600
that i could sing that song i mean we talk about a lot of adult content here i guess that's true

44
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,720
true not in an earnest way when you're writing that people will put us on in the background

45
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,160
to make love well that yeah it's not a seductive show entertainment weekly has actually named us

46
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,880
four years running the least seductive podcast in the business just try to have sex while you

47
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,400
listen to my brother my brother impossible can't do it can't just can't get the rhythm going

48
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,920
yeah that is what most people will always be legal as long as my brother my brother and me

49
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,520
is legal to be downloaded yes because it is impossible but with our anti-sex with our

50
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,560
fucking twisted south park humor who knows before they shut us down that's true they have been

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
talking a lot about shutting us down lately they're always trying to come for us but no one

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,800
else is coming for us the um the preview of the uh the next next week's episode i'm extremely

53
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,120
excited about because the songwriters the young songwriters for next week's episode

54
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,120
are going to be working with aloe black to create a song for the soundtrack of fast and furious

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,520
presents hobbs and shaw so that is a massive opportunity but wait just a huge opportunity

56
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,120
i would love it's probably too late to get in on the filming of that isn't that movie already done

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,880
yeah but at the end it's just going to be like boop do do do do do i don't know i haven't heard

58
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,160
this song yet here's a song about hugging hobbs and shaw hobbs and shaw saving lives by breaking

59
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,400
the law people say that you're fast and i'm too furious but i know that is claim is spurious it's

60
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,760
the other way around i am the quick one and you are the one with a quick trigger on the gun fast

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,640

63
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,680
indris elba is in this one

64
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:09,680
we've done it songland al aloe please call us uh we're ready to get started this is an advice show

65
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,200
and we do questions do you want to do one i would love that griffin thank you you read my mind i was

66
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,360
i was about to segue into it because i felt that energy going that way but of course you and your

67
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,120
infinite wisdom you sense the energy going that way just a split second justin's looking for the

68
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,520
question i just i have heard it been said that any internship remains unpaid as long as you don't

69
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,480
steal enough stuff from the company i actually have a pretty well-paid internship in an office

70
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,960
but i still want to take the lamp from my desk when i leave the position okay i've done my

71
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,920
research and this desk lamp is valued at 50 it's a special brand damn that's a good lamp it's a

72
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,840
special brand that mimics natural sunlight so artists who work with color have a more honest

73
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,600
relationship with their art but it's a good lamp this lamp i like the phrasing of that like this

74
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,080
lamp makes me able to date my painting this lamp does not belong in a cubicle hidden around the

75
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,880
computer for the next intern to not totally appreciate as a hobbyist artist the lamp belongs

76
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,680
with me how do i steal something this large from my internship or is there a more chill way to ask

77
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,240
for it that's from lamp lust in little saigon damn this person's got it all figured out i

78
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,440
wish i was this confident about any of my life decisions first of all i would like to address

79
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,720
the first sentence and maybe it's just i haven't worked enough internships but i have never heard

80
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,920
it been said that any internship remains a pain as long as you haven't stolen enough

81
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,680
yeah as has been said by me here in this sentence in this question to you uh here's a chill way

82
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:52,400
okay ask your boss do you mind if i move this lamp oh good oh that's so good that's really

83
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,440
good and non-specific yeah you leave that what now listen this is risky because if your boss

84
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:07,840
says move it where and you say my home the jig is up i think that if you asked for the lamp as

85
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,800
you're walking out the door on your last day it would be so disconcerting i think for lack of a

86
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,760
better word it would be so jarring that the person might just say like yeah um yes yes and then you're

87
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,480
gone like you're already out the door um but at that point it's a huge risk right because that's

88
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,240
you're waiting to the last minute with my plan so it may if they say no there you're out of options

89
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,440
here's what i'll say here's another uh way to ensure success here ask it like this and it's

90
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,160
cool if i take this lamp right so good travis damn and you don't even need you don't even need

91
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,280
something to come before the end but the implication is like we've had a whole conversation

92
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,760
about the cool things that will happen when i leave and this is one even better just sort

93
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,040
of hold it up in front of your boss and say it's cool right you know what let's shorten and just

94
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:09,280
say huh cool yes um you could say hey i'm gonna steal two of these lamps and your boss is gonna

95
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:16,320
be like no you're not and you'd be like you're right just the one could can you can you maybe

96
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,360
go with like i loved this job was sort of like the best things ever happened to me and i really

97
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,560
treasure it and want to remember it and i'm gonna go ahead and take this lamp to remember all of

98
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,200
you because you were a light that lit up my yes yes you're the light in my life and this is now

99
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,000
the light in my apartment if i maybe just say like i brought this lamp from home and when your boss

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,840
is like but it's like all the other lamps and you say that's why i brought it in because it reminded

101
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,960
me of all the other lamps oh see i was gonna say you could bring in another lamp and just swap them

102
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,400
indie indie style swap them but they would notice that you're taking the lamp that looks exactly

103
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:05,600
like all the other lamps and you left a garfield light up lamp that you found in your sister's room

104
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,640
that's not great so uh you're gonna need to start bringing a really large felt puppet to work with

105
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,680
you now now and start getting everybody comfortable and not only comfortable accustomed to the idea

106
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,240
that you always bring this huge huge felt puppet with you uh that keeps you company in your cubicle

107
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,680
uh that you have conversations with it when you needed you know to blow off some steam

108
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,400
or talk about the new episode of game of thrones that hbo is sending directly to you uh and then

109
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,720
once everybody sort of appreciates the fact oh well that's just you know their big big felt

110
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,120
puppet you'll know by the way the the key there will be when you don't have the puppet if someone

111
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,880
says hey where's the puppet now yes now you know you're in the clear to stuff that fucking lamp

112
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
right up in that puppet and carry it out and it's never even been a thing and you know what the you

113
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:08,560
know why that's such a good idea why why because there's nothing else you could put the lamp in i

114
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,120
want to describe a bit of prop comedy that you could do here to get away with this and i want

115
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,240
you to really don't interrupt me but i want you to close your eyes even if you're driving especially

116
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,840
if you're driving and and really imagine this okay as you're walking out they're applauding

117
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,800
as you're walking on your last day say i just want to let everybody know that this internship

118
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,920
has given me a really bright idea and then you hold the lamp above your head about what i want

119
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,880
to do with my future and then you keep the lamp above your head and slowly back out the door and

120
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,240
they will be so confused as to what is happening or laughing their asses off laughing their asses

121
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,360
off thank you griffin yeah absolutely like losing it with this great prop comedy you did

122
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,080
that they won't even think like he'll they'll assume that you'll bring it back that will be

123
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,000
the assumption that's made is that you'll be bringing it back at your earliest convenience

124
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,840
also get a big parachute tie it to the lamp throw it right out the freaking window

125
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,520
first floor this isn't great if you're on the first floor it's not great just thank you you

126
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,400
kind of do need it to get to terminal velocity but if you're on the first floor it's not a problem

127
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,960
yeah i would say the first floor is probably fine second third and fourth it's probably an

128
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,080
issue but fifth you probably have enough yeah there's four floors there where it's no good

129
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:35,760
or you really need the wind to sort of pick up maybe tie the lamp use fishing line yes they

130
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,280
can't see it tie it to your belt buckle so it looks like it's hopping behind you and just

131
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,200
keep saying like come on come on and they'll be like the lamp wanted to be with them the lamp

132
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,840
chose them over us okay i know this internship has given me a really bright idea then you hold

133
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,680
it above your head right and then you put it back down and you say about what i want to do

134
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,440
with my future i'm gonna be a lamp repairman and i'm gonna start with this guy right here

135
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,480
and you just yank it out of the wall and walk out the door and they'll be like he's gonna be

136
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,400
the greatest labor pair man ever because he's really dedicated to his craft there it is one

137
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,720
of these certainly has to work certainly one of them i got a yahoo answer here that was sent in

138
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,840
by jack thanks jack it's an anonymous yahoo answers user who i'm going to call theodore asks

139
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,440

142
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,240
what i'm so there's there's so many things there well i mean i would rather have a drawing room

143
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,360
than a parlor right because i you know me i'm always sketching something and it's true yeah so

144
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,920
my plants my is that why it's called the drawing room maybe it's more like the drawing together

145
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,280
of new ideas or perhaps where you might draw cards for a game of dude it's sketching doodles

146
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,840
and doing fun cartoons uh yeah people love that shit back down in abby they were always just

147
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,600
whipping up little you know ziggies uh just that little doodle where it looks like the guy with

148
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,360
frizzy hair is poking his nose over the horizon what's his deal what's he hiding he even doing

149
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
here's the thing that i think through me about the further details of this question griffin

150
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,120
the question asker saying you're just picking up things like yeah like it's i don't know like you

151
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,560
traveled abroad for two years and came back with a bit of an accent yeah also the 19th century

152
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:46,960
yeah also the 1940s is really when these words came to power the 1940s during uh you know world

153
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:54,240
war ii is when we really started calling shit the scullery uh i i'm no uh historian but i'd be

154
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,080
willing to bet that basically for as long as you've been dining in it i think the dining

155
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,360
room has been called the dining room no it's the morning room because you only eaten there in the

156
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,640
morning anyway we're dodging the question and the answer to it is you're going to be made fun of so

157
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,280
savagely uh you may actually die from it yes you may actually experience death from how bad the

158
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,560
making fun of you is if you say if you call your kitchen the scullery and there's no amount of

159
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,560
explaining a way that i feel like you can do to get over this one that's the big one because i

160
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,280
think if you called your living room the drawing room even your family who loves you the most they

161
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,520
would be like hmm that was weird okay that's fine and then you call the dining room the morning

162
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,480
room they're probably gonna say do you mean the dining room but the second you say scullery it's

163
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:53,600
done yeah it's done fetch me my pita chips from the larder and what are you fucking saying what

164
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:02,400
do you mean how i i look at houses sometimes to kill the time until i die and i was on zillow and

165
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:09,840
they i saw one house that had a room that was labeled popcorn room hell yeah i tried to google

166
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,080
it and google had never heard of it so i don't know it must just be this person saying self-explanatory

167
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,880
did you look with their photos nope no photos just a one label popcorn room i don't know if there

168
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,600
were doors or not i guess there was a door but it was just labeled popcorn room did you put

169
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,080
in an offer right i mean did you go in a little bit under asking oh shit no i did almost buy a

170
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,760
house one time that when i was very young except i didn't have the money to do it but it did have

171
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,960
a door hidden behind a bookshelf oh i've always really wanted that if you what do you think would

172
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,440
be the hardest room to pull off saying that you have with a straight face because i think

173
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,120
it's conservatory oh yes i think that would be the one that would be the toughest to say like oh this

174
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,120
is the conservatory that or i think the ballroom the ballroom is tough the ballroom is tough if you

175
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,680
say you have a conservatory though it's just to murder someone in hands down that's my main sort

176
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,520
of familiarity with the room it's and which is weird because you're not conserving something

177
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:20,000
you're snuffing it for it should be called a snuffatory probably sex dungeon yeah that's

178
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,920
tough that's tough um you know they also call conservatory solariums that's even worse i think

179
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,120
i think you could get away with solarium only because people would like if you walked into

180
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,640
you know sometimes people like screen in their back porch or they like you know have windows

181
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,440
in the back porch or whatever if you walked in and said this is my solarium i wouldn't know that

182
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,400
you're right but i also wouldn't know that you're wrong and i wouldn't say anything you could get

183
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,360
away with that but if you walked me back there and you said this is my conservatory i would say

184
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,720
no it is not the solarium is a room where you watch the george clinty vehicle solaris yes that

185
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,640
is the main purpose of that but don't use your desk looping don't even fucking think about eating

186
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,920
popcorn while you enjoyed the movie there is a separate room for that you should know better

187
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,400
you have to go into the other room if you want a salty snack my favorite is like how it differs by

188
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,320
country like if you're in london and you say where's the water closet they'll be like oh

189
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,160
it's right over there but if i said that shit here i'm getting booed out of town and people

190
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,440
are just gonna make fun of me till i cry water down my face i didn't know this when i first the

191
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,760
first time i traveled internationally i went to cologne germany for a games conference and i

192
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,480
didn't know i didn't even know what water closet was so when i saw the you know restroom sign with

193
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:42,560
wc on it i thought like this is where wc fields goes to shit and i think they are dead um and then

194
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,600
i remember asking somebody like where the where the toilet was and when they corrected me i felt

195
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,880
like such a boob because it's that must be like somebody over here was like where's where do you

196
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,440
keep your shitter and pisser at where i can make where i can make my dirty trash in a hole because

197
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,600
i didn't say the good way to say it i guess wc must stand for worst conservatory this is the

198
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,640
worst conservatory i've ever seen in my life if i ever end up selling my house i'm gonna walk

199
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,440
people through it saying and this is the bed conservatory and this is the bath conservatory

200
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,160
and this is kind of the living conservatory uh and this is the scullery i work in the office

201
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:30,320
at a factory and we have random spirits days with themes i rarely participate yeah that sucks but i

202
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,280
woke up this morning and put on a floral tank top hawaiian shirt shorts and hula girl dress socks

203
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,880
for vacation clothes day hold on a second the name of that is fucking chilling and i have to

204
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:53,280
put my head between my legs that's grueling can you even imagine what it would be like if you

205
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,840
had imagine you got to wear these for their intended purpose now you will wear them as a

206
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,440
cruel joke i have made a mockery of your vacation clothes couldn't couldn't we just call it vacation

207
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,120
day no because then they might not show up no no no we have vacation days but they're pretty much

208
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,840
just for going to your nana's funeral they're not for actually like fucking relaxing because you get

209
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:21,920
four of them vacation clothes day as i pulled into the parking lot i had the sudden realization

210
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,040
that i only glanced at the theme schedule once jotted it down on my calendar and heard no word

211
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,320
of it since i'm now second guessing myself what if today isn't a spirit day should i call in from

212
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,600
the parking lot and go home and that's from floral in fort wayne this took a this took a chronological

213
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,480
turn that i wasn't quite expecting like it was it was not a a perspective shift as much as it was

214
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,120
like a time a time shift i think this question asker is a time shifter i like questions where

215
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,520
people send them to us and they're the answer is only applicable for about a five minute window

216
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,600
several weeks ago it gives you the sense of urgency but not you're right it's like some

217
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,760
simultaneous urgency and the complete lack thereof i think it is completely legitimate

218
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:20,480
for you to put on vacation clothes and then drive to your workplace and then look in there and look

219
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,160
at what you're wearing and think this is so fucking grim i'm gonna actually just do the

220
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,480
vaca i'm already dressed for it this is what this person is debating right right should i

221
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,480
just take a vacation day like yeah probably yeah yeah you're already dressed for it just fucking

222
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,360
piss off this all day this is the start of at least two different movies that i can think of

223
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,840
joe versus the volcano in office space look at this moment of like you know what i'm just gonna

224
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,120
wear my whole lion shirt to work oh also i fucking hate this place this place sucks also you know it

225
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,880
all comes out in the wash sometimes you'll be out on spring break and you'll wake up and you'll put

226
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,920
on some khakis and you'll put on a nice oxford and you'll be like oh i guess my body wants work

227
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,720
and then you'll go to work because it's what your body craves at that moment you gotta go

228
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,040
or the clothes make the person is what i say it makes them go to the places that they need to go

229
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,400
that day the traveling pants the ice cream suit all of those things ice cream suit you know what

230
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,960
you're doing that day you know you're going down to cold stone and you know that you're robbing it

231
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,440
oh no why did i put on this ice cream suit you put on the ice cream suit you pull the hood over

232
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,000
your face you say i gotta have it i would say have no fear walk into work wearing it and if people

233
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,040
are like why are you dressed like that just say it's a spirit day because here's the thing it's a

234
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,120
completely arbitrary thing and if someone says no it isn't then you say well point me towards the

235
00:23:51,120 --> 00:24:00,240
spirit day authority and we'll find out that's good you could also look at the calendar and

236
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:08,000
that and be more diligent about that is a one step you need it for today yeah i know i know i know um

237
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,600
i'm just saying in the future it would be cool to do whatever tomorrow's spirit day is gonna be

238
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,080
just to give people a sneak peek of what it's gonna what how big a jackass they're gonna look

239
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,800
like for the next one hey guys why are you wearing pajamas i'm just saying next week this

240
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,760
is what you're all gonna look like so really think about it it is it is interesting to think

241
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,720
that it sounds like there's a really loose grasp on what day is what you could just wear whatever

242
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,240
the fuck you want to work any day and if someone sees you be like why are you like oh i thought it

243
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,040
was and it's like okay cool like just wear whatever you want this is it sounds like wild west

244
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,800
you're you're speaking as someone who has worked out of their home for the past several years you

245
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:58,800
you have lost perspective that is true i have worked many a job with many a dress code and man

246
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:06,160
it's uh you started i hate khaki pants so much y'all i can't i've worked so many oh khaki pants

247
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,040

248
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,760

your head through the crotch hole and you wear the legs like sleeves now you're getting it

311
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,320
okay uh yahoo time you want to yeah i love that all right this one's sent in by nick thanks nick

312
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,080
it's anonymous yahoo answers user alissa who asks okay no joke i found a four-leaf clover

313
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:36,880
clover in your opinion should i eat it to get the luck out of it would that let me absorb the luck

314
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,160
in parentheses if you want to see the clover it's on my instagram and then they've provided

315
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:47,280
their instagram handle here's the thing if you hold the clover you get a little bit of luck over

316
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:53,440
time right spread out over time until it's all used up interesting eat the clover you do get

317
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:01,600
a big burst of luck yeah right so one big good luck for eating the clover right so the question

318
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:09,280
maybe the question is what do you have planned for the day if you're like i've got i've got the

319
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,880
big game coming up yeah eat the clover eat it but if you're like i was just gonna sit around

320
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,800
maybe hold the clover and you find like a dollar in the couch you know what i mean i'm saying

321
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,880
uh griffin would you eat it well i'd if it's for the big game as you know when you eat it you get

322
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,760
about four seconds of super good luck so i would need a whole big old ziploc bag full of these

323
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,640
things which i probably have to crowdsource you could do like okay you got two strikes it's the

324
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:48,800
bottom of the ninth you're down by two right you're you're at bat you got two players on

325
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:55,120
base already you see the pitcher wind up real quick you pop it in your mouth chew it up and

326
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,760
then you swing i mean a satellite a satellite falls from the skies and destroys the pitcher

327
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,000
which of course counts as a home run for the batter which is a weird rule i don't know what

328
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,200
they allow if the pitcher's destroyed mid-pitch it's called interference and his automatic home

329
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,160
run here's what they don't tell you this is what leprechauns won't tell you i'm gonna pull the

330
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,960
curtain back what leprechauns won't tell you is the good luck you get from four-leaf clover is

331
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,120
because that four-leaf clover has siphoned luck away from someone else and given them bad luck

332
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,520
so in that circumstance you're getting a burst of good luck and the pitcher is getting a pretty

333
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,840
solid burst of bad luck right like what are the odds because if you're gonna have good luck

334
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,520
someone else has to suffer just remember that recently looking at traf yeah i know listen i'm

335
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,480
telling you what those leprechaun big wigs won't tell you i'm ready to give you all the secrets

336
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,920
that the leprechauns don't want you to know buy my book for $29.99 buy my book

337
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,560
you guys like the critic

338
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,360
so like it's been our new segment you guys like the critic it's a pretty good segment

339
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:06,960
it stinks justin it stinks oh i love that it stinks right if you're if it's in you

340
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,520
you're still making content does it have to be physical contact for the luck to get on you or

341
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,960
what's this what's the story uh yeah i mean you have to be in possession of it that's nine-tenths

342
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,840
of the law read a book but the thing is is when you consume it your tummy acids start breaking

343
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:30,240
down the luck molecules oh so that's where the energy is released right big burst but then

344
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,640
they're gone how many three leaf clothes can my tummy tell if i've taken a three leaf clover and

345
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,520
glued a fourth leaf onto it now if you have four three leaf clovers you do have three four leaf

346
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,680
clovers so that that's another thing the leprechauns won't tell yeah your stomach is your stomach

347
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,440
the people working in your tummy factor you're like oh shit we got a lot of four leaf clovers

348
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,760
coming in whatever that's one two three twelve okay yeah whatever the fuck oh man i don't know

349
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,520
this job's so hard oh corn corn corn alert corn we still haven't figured out what to do with this

350
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:14,960
shit oh no i want a munch

351
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,560
for some reason that one gave me the feeling of like a janitor rolling in in the middle of a

352
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,280
meeting just like hey don't mind me just here to empty the cans i want a munch

353
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,440
do

354
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:49,200
that's my manhattan transfer version yeah it was really good good news for dirt bags

355
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:59,200
okay kfc's cheetos sandwich is going national baby following the limited time launches of

356
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,400
pickle fried chicken kentucky fried chicken and waffles and cinnabon dessert biscuits

357
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,720
the kfc cheeto sandwich is another example of how kfc is continuing to take food innovation

358
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,080
in to new heights after an overwhelmingly successful test earlier this year kentucky

359
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:28,240
fried chicken and fan favorite cheetos are giving fans nation they just they should just say dirt

360
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,280
bags but okay giving fans nationwide access to the sought after cheetos sandwich for just

361
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:45,200
just four short weeks beginning july 1st this is a special twist on the kfc crispy colonel sandwich

362
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,320
this and i think this is literal in this case dangerously cheesy combination

363
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,720
is made by coding kfc's juicy hand breaded okay i'm not going to tell you guys we're

364
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,480
much called quiz how do you think the kfc cheetos sandwich is constructed

365
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,520
give me your recipe for if i come into the meeting and i'm like boys we gotta do it kfc

366
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,080
g x cheetos make the sandwich what is it i'm going to say it's hand breaded including did

367
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:27,920
you say ham breaded because that you're on the right track it's okay i think there's cheetos

368
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:36,080
dust in it and then maybe some kind of like cheesy sauce cheetos has to be a part of every

369
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,120
yeah whole ass cheetos right there on top i think whole ass cheetos are on there i think cheetos

370
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,280
i think they will call it cheetos milk cheetos blood i think they'll just call it it's it's

371
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,640
hand breaded and i love how they say it's hand breaded as if i care about the fucking like

372
00:38:52,640 --> 00:39:00,080
the tlc that went into this fucking yeah i think it's cheetos all the way down and and with each

373
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:07,120
sandwich we put just a little bit of irony in every hand breaded fillet yeah eat ironically

374
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:14,560
kfc the dangerously cheesy combination is made by coding kfc's juicy hand breaded extra crispy

375
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:23,040
chicken fillet with special cheetos sauce that's what it says special cheetos sauce

376
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,600
get that regular cheetos sauce the fuck out of here this is for jeremy he deserves the best

377
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,760
this and placing it on a toasted bun with a this is a quote that i fucking cannot parse

378
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,520
with a quote pinch of the thumb index and middle fingers layer of crunchy cheetos huh

379
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:50,000
huh i don't know what that means but that's what it said i i guess it's like how many you can get

380
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,360
with three fingers if you imagine that grabbing motion like that amount of cheetos out is like

381
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,800
on there and then it says with the colonel's mayo and i don't know if we can hold that

382
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,520
but i would like to not include the colonel's mayo just waiting for an expose doesn't it

383
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,560
yeah what did you think the colonel's mayo was this is why they keep going through the actors

384
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,720
so fast it's because reba steps in she's like gosh i'm excited to be the colonel and they're

385
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,760
like okay so we do have to tell you the company secret they open up the briefcase and she looks

386
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,680
at it and says no i'm done y'all let's find another one at the end you are processed and

387
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,520
turned into the colonel's i haven't seen reba in a while where's reba reba's gone i love the new

388
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:45,200
barbecue flavor of the colonel's mayo chaos colonel's mayo is reba to celebrate the nationwide

389
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,520
launch of the sandwich chester cheetah will be murdered summarily no he doesn't say that

390
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,920
chester cheetah will be taking over manhattan's 14th street kfc restaurant can't the police do

391
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,400
something what does that mean he's gonna be taking i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you

392
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:12,160
travis i'm excited uh yeah well it's gonna be an exclusive all orange everything pop-up event

393
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,440
where customers can try the sandwich for the first time in advance of the restaurant in

394
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,600
restaurant availability on july 1st why does that stuff always happen in new york

395
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:29,200
it just doesn't seem fair i'm not there um both cans kfc and cheetos have dedicated and passionate

396
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,640
fan bases which if you have to say it in a press release is probably a lie so it only made sense

397
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,200
to merge these two iconic brands together did it to provide an irresistible and flavorful sandwich

398
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:49,840
that offers the best of both worlds oh my god planet planet cheese and kfc help best of both

399
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:58,560
worlds fought um it's uh they're creating delicious menu items that flan fans flock toward which is

400
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,240
accurate because they are sheep i am looking at a picture of this sandwich and what i want to discuss

401
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,640
now is the textural difficulties that this thing's gonna provide first of all it's bigger than any

402
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,240
human mouth like you're gonna have to attack this thing from the side good good news the people

403
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,280
eating this can only loosely be described as humans okay so that's fine let's just go through it

404
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,320
bottom to top and talk about the textural experience bottom bun that's soggy as fuck

405
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,720
at this point there's no way that bun's getting to you with any amount of crisp toastiness left

406
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,440
then you just have wet that's the colonel's mayo and you know how i feel about that then you have

407
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,800
whole ass fucking cheetos that's gonna be you know they're toothsome they're a toothsome bite

408
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,320
and there are they're gonna flop all around they're gonna be loose that's a challenge and

409
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,840
then you have very very heavily crusted fried chicken you get the more crunch meat crunch on

410
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,920
top of that and then another wet bread there's like that's so that is gonna suck there is no

411
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,840
way that you pull your mouth away from that thing with what you would call a good bite of it a good

412
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:08,240
cross-section good representative bite of this fucking thing this looks like a real agro crag

413
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,240
i would eat the hell out of this oh my god travis listen i wouldn't be proud of it but i'm saying

414
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,360
that given the opportunity to try it i wouldn't i don't think i'd come away well i don't think i'd

415
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,520
walk away from the experience at all but i don't think i'd walk away from the experience saying

416
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,360
like this is it this is the new chase sensation but if you gave me the opportunity to eat a cheetos

417
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,360
you know chicken sandwich or whatever i'd probably do it i like cheetos i like fried

418
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:43,840
chicken if we can hold you know the colonel's mess then i would totally check it out the colonel's

419
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:51,040
made such the colonel ancestors made such a big mess they're selling such a big big mess

420
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,120
um and also quick munch quad jr just so people don't send it to me arby's made a carrot out of

421
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:02,960
meat yeah it's just a fucking they're not gonna sell it i'm only interested in things that they

422
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,280
think that you a human would consume with your but want to consume with your body um so yes that

423
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,560
also happened it's called the merit because it's made of meat that man they sure do like meat there

424
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,360
huh i've noticed i've noticed a thread a sort of common thread with all of their sort of messaging

425
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,600
they sure do like meat and you know what they hate fucking vegetables yeah they don't like

426
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:31,040
vegetables they do love meat this next question that we got we don't normally do these like help

427
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,080
me like make a judgment call here but this one just baked my noodle so hard i had to include it

428
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,960
because i want to know what you guys think oh yeah this is this is an important subject uh

429
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,120
justin would you please read the question i would read it but i think that would weird people out

430
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:54,080
because it's just not what we do at a gaming convention last summer what i needed a gaming

431
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:00,960
convention uh last summer i needed to quickly grab lunch between panels i was muttering the line at

432
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,280
the food truck was huge so i walked to the person who was first in line and offered to pay them for

433
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,680
their meal if they ordered for me too oh my friend says this is the same as cutting in line and was

434
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,800
bad i think it's more like postmates where i paid someone to get lunch for me but on the other hand

435
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,760
i recognize that this increased the wait in line for the time it would take to cook my order i'm

436
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,800
worried my friend might be right they are so i haven't done this since then brothers was i cutting

437
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:35,360
in line or no and that's from genuinely concerned at gen con let's yes this was bad can we obviously

438
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,840
back can you've run the numbers already you know it was bad you've run the numbers can we can we

439
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,680
tweak it can we tweak reality just a little bit i got this i got one of thanos's cool stones and

440
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,920
i snapped my fingers and the thing changes okay what if instead of going to the person in the

441
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,200
front of the line and saying like hey it's like postmates you work for hey look you work for me

442
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,080
now instead of that what if your buddy is like like in the middle of the line or close to the

443
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,440
front of the line you're like oh shit hey can you go ahead and get me a burrito too is that bad no

444
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,520
this is what i'm saying i don't think this is bad i think what it is is it's revolutionary and

445
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,040
sometimes when something is revolutionary it can seem bad it can seem scary at the time but then

446
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,400
we look back on it in the future and it's like wow on that day they changed the game of ordering

447
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,720
at food trucks now here's the problem if everyone starts to do this there's going to be one person

448
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:34,720
in line who's ordering 500 meals yeah yeah and the 500 the 500th person is going to have to

449
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:41,120
get stuck with the bill which is too bad have have you guys noticed that i i my hat does do

450
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:47,920
go off to this person in one regard that i have found with food trucks that you are either ordering

451
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:56,560
um and getting your food in like a few minutes or spending a good amount of your life and missing

452
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,680
your daughter's high school graduation as you wait for a slimy taco have you noticed this

453
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,080
like there's an immense amount of variability in food truck speed that we've all just decided to

454
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:11,920
accept yeah yeah what's what's the deal can you say it like that can you do it again justin but

455
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,960
do it like what's the what is the deal with food what is the deal with food truck jerry never got

456
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,280
to do that do you ever think about the the jokes that seinfeld didn't get to do i bet he'd have

457
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:28,880
some stuff to say i bet he'd have some fun with that what no but can i just say but for real guys

458
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:36,800
what is the deal with food trucks is it a car this sucks uh it's it's obviously cutscenes if

459
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:45,040
you put your body in the line yes but it's like psychic cutscenes if you just put your desires

460
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:54,240
in the line i would argue that it's only cutscenes if you are adding one more sale between like if

461
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,320
if i if someone said like if someone said i'm gonna get a burrito right and someone walked up

462
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,760
and said make it two burritos the order time is the same now someone said i'm gonna get a burrito

463
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:12,640
and they say cool let me step in behind you and i too obviously obviously we're talking about the

464
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,840
other thing i have i have a new i have a new plan stand at the front of the line with a stack of 20

465
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:28,480
us dollar bills as people have um received their order in the moment in the flush of victory upon

466
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,600
receiving their order you offer to buy hey can i have three chips oh can i just have three chips

467
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,640
for this one dollar bill you won't want those three chips by the time you're done consuming

468
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:47,840
your dish just give me three chips and then i think you can just sort of give me one of your

469
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:53,600
burrito it's like food antiquing you know you're just you're just getting a little bit off the top

470
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:00,320
you're at the sampler table you're getting your points on the back end exactly exactly hey here's

471
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:06,960
here's the deal i'll stand in line with you massage your back i'm just gonna need 10 points

472
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,600
on that burrito and merch rights merch rights to that burrito did i say merch i meant munch rights

473
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:19,760
on your burrito uh just three chips you can have the first bite because i know how that i wouldn't

474
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:26,800
like it but i get the second slice me off one fifth of that kit kat bar and i bring me off a

475
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,760
well-measured piece of that kit kat bar now i'm off to dessert now you don't want my mouth on your

476
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,000
food that's fine i got two buckets here one's full of quarters one's about to be full of little

477
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,880
slices of food that my friend my new friends whittle off into it and then there's a third

478
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,520
bucket that's for cleaning the other two buckets don't look at that bucket it gets so fucking nasty

479
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,360
and don't put the food in the quarters one i don't want that metal stink all over my falafel

480
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:01,520
this is time theft don't fucking do it i think it's fine do it your friend was right don't do

481
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,000
it i think your friend is just afraid of the change you've made in the world the ripple that

482
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,640
you've begun the bad ripple the ripple of painting there maybe you're a doofus maybe maybe it's bad

483
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:22,480
maybe it's not sometimes change is scary we are fucking hanging on by a thread we are hanging on

484
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:32,240
by a thread and waiting in line for food is like ground level society do not start dismantling what

485
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:39,360
little fabric we have left as a people wait in line for your fucking churro and then get it like

486
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,400
everybody else okay we're hanging on by a fucking thread and we're all just going to wait in line

487
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,760
and enjoy our burritos all right all right you know what you've convinced me justin what if

488
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:57,440
there was 60 windows on this what is now becoming a sort of food train and you have to catch up with

489
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,320
the food train food train is better because that's the problem is there's just the one window

490
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:09,600
and no one's talking about that no one's talking about food train no one's talking about how if

491
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:16,000
you had 60 windows we could all just get our food the moment we want it you know what's it thank you

492
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,320
you know it's a kick-ass spot that millennials love to go and nosh down at is amtrak stations

493
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,480
amtrak stations get there after the big game head over there after church get to the amtrak station

494
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:35,840
hit up the food train okay listen can i hit you guys stop the podcast and let's talk about food

495
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,200
train for a second right what if there was a single train track that wound its way through

496
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:50,080
this great land we called america and there are food train stops wherever like all throughout the

497
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:57,200
country right but it's just the one train and the one train track and then when you started to get

498
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:03,360
a line you have like a single car right and people are lining up there at the carnival because it's

499
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,480
in town for the carnival that you're having all events will take place on the food train track

500
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:16,880
okay so you if the line gets to be more than two people in line another car on the food train

501
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,360
comes and joins that one and all of a sudden you got twice as many windows no one is waiting if

502
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:29,280
those people dissipate the food train goes to the next station where it is needed do you understand

503
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:36,880
it's infinite capacity and it only does hamburgers you can't special order it yes there's just the

504
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,440
hamburgers on your fault is it they are good hamburgers not the best hamburgers it's not

505
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,920
it's not burger king you can't have it your way you have it train way that's it that's the only

506
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,120
way available this train this idea beats so much ass that it's going to become the only legal way

507
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,600
to obtain food now we've entered into a program that i would like to call snack piercer and in

508
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:05,760
this one we have to we you have to live on burger train you know you never hear about how these

509
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,760
dystopian societies start with a kick-ass idea like food train they all like maybe it was supposed

510
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,680
to be like dope like wouldn't it be cool if we could just watch everybody big brother happens

511
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,760
you know what i mean but at the beginning it was like that would be cool like we could watch

512
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,400
everybody and just make sure they don't get into trouble it would be so sick if some of us started

513
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,640
eating the other ones of us and then it's like walking dead it's like oops you took it i didn't

514
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:38,320
mean i didn't mean all of us ah shoot dang it i stand by food train though i feel pretty good

515
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:43,840
just need some investors the oils they have hot oils inside and when it takes a turn

516
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,560
that's why only automatons can work on food train that thing's giving away american jobs justin

517
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,640
they're i'm create it's a zero-sum game travis i'm not taking away any jobs there isn't a food

518
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:08,640
train right now it's a zero-sum game you are taking away hypothetical jobs dystopian jobs

519
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:14,560
yes now what i do like is you're also creating american jobs because someone would need to build

520
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:20,960
both the train and the automatons i like that part and destroy so many buildings to make way

521
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,640
for the food train tracks it i i estimate to have a train track that it weaves its way through our

522
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:34,880
entire country will take let me just check my mouth here 783 years so there is that especially

523
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,360
just put it where there are especially because it's going to purposefully weave directly through

524
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:46,000
every mcdonald's and burger king that already exists in america also it's on roads we got rid

525
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,440
of roads and it's just food train what about my car you don't drive cars anymore the earth is

526
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,880
dying the train comes no cars there's just food train solar-powered hamburger slinging food train

527
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,040
is the future yes get on board now literally but don't get on board because it is there's

528
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:09,520
hot grease in here there's so many moving servos if you just like that's what i'm saying don't get

529
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,000
too close to food train because you will be caught up in it like an old-timey industrial worker

530
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,560
every surface on food train is a broiler we couldn't afford to just have single

531
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:25,680
boy every service robot train and it will annihilate you and now you might you might

532
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:32,400
want to get on because we have bulldozed every forest in america to make way for this train track

533
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,640
we get that if you want to get on because it's bad out here it is a if the robots are made of

534
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,600
metal why do we need discrete grills do you understand what i'm saying they're cooking on

535
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:50,080
their grill these hot sexy robots are grilling the burgers on their chests and peeling them off for

536
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,960
you a delighted carnival goer they're peeling them off each other's chests it's sexy in there

537
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,400
we get why you'd want to get on the train but you gotta resist the siren song of the robot food

538
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:08,880
train if you get on this sexy hot wet greasy train you will die i don't know why the scientists made

539
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,280
them all look like mark ruffalo i don't understand guys this sexy burger train will fuck you up fam

540
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,040

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:26,240
town whether you like it or not do not get on this train or you will die but also do not miss the

542
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:33,600

545
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:53,120
enjoy this burger that's 5.99 it's all of our budget goes to food train and war because everybody

546
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:02,000
else hates us for our food train everybody wants our food train now in the case of a foreign invasion

547
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,760
the ruffalo bots will will militarize so they will continue making hamburgers though so do not fear

548
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:16,240
but it's sort of uh they just see people situation so it's gonna be that is gonna be bad that's also

549
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,840

550
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,800
