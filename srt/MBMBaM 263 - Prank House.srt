1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm your babiest brother Griffin Liebowitz. Boy, Griffin are you using your married name?

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm using my stage name Griffin Liebowitz. Griffin, Griffin the experience Liebowitz.

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,440
I like that. You know guys I'm getting pretty excited. It's back to school time.

10
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,040
And how does that affect your day-to-day life Justin? Well finally I can ship this kid off for

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
eight hours a day and get a little time back to myself. I don't see why you can't. Get it get a

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,840
leg up get an early start. It takes 10,000 hours to become a master of school. Start it now. Start

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:44,240
it now. All right does your uh are your is your entire school are all the sharp edges foamed over?

14
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,040
Have you foamed over every sharp edge in your school? Listen I'm gonna. These stairs that you

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,320
have what is that about like stairs? I'm gonna need a strict no bullying guarantee from you

16
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,360
because my baby can't stand it can't she's an amazing child she cannot stand up to much

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,600
physical bullying. She can't stand up very well. She can't stand up either but but if she starts

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,840
getting bullied it's she doesn't have the tools to protect herself. I noticed that uh at 10 a.m.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,440
you have her scheduled for uh pre-algebra that's crazy because she'll be asleep. Where is her

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,440
where is her nap zone? Um is there a class I can enroll her in where she watches shapes and colors

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,960
move on an iPad? Do you have any uh parental incentives for good grades like some sort of

22
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:42,400
Pizza Hut program for me? Wait that doesn't happen for like regular kids in school. Yeah but I've

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,160
never been a parent before Travis I don't know this stuff maybe that maybe parents have been

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,120
getting pizza kickbacks the entire time. That's the only reason I can think of that parents care

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,280
about grades. Maybe the whole reason parents have been so uptight about grades since time

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,160
immemorial is that they've been getting pizza kickbacks. You're suggesting that when kids pull

27
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:11,680
down a tight GPA their parents reap the the that sweet pie that sweet pizza pie as a reward? They

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,040
get if the kids get a good GPA the parents get a PWATF which is a pizza with all the fixings. Okay

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,360
and some maybe some tokens if they do real good. Maybe a few tokens for the folks. Is there an

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,720
adult equivalent to like back to school is it first day on the job? This is that that is Travis

31
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,200
you have highlighted one of the primary problems with adulthood is the lack of like sort of a

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,120
a cyclical period of renewal. You know that that's what adulthood is lacking that's why

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:51,600
adulthood is what it is bad because they lack. Hey turn it off now we're getting real. Nobody

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,640
said like when you're a kid it is the okay being a kid is the time in your life where I think you

35
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,240
least need someone to be like just take a break my man. You are burning the candle at both ends

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,040
Devin. Yeah just this is so what you work from seven to three and then you have nothing to do

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,920
at all like you can literally have a time when you sit and say I don't have anything to worry

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,040
about right now like I don't have anything I should be doing. That's crazy. Yeah that's insane. Do you

39
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,520
know how crazy it is there are humans walking across this earth who like can sit in a chair

40
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,720
and not have something they should be doing at that exact instant and then someone comes and says

41
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,080
hey you look tired take three months off. Oh and by the way in taking three months off you are

42
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,480
generating another thing for the adults that live with you to be worried about like you're creating

43
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:59,280
more stress for them but you seriously you look beat take three months off. It's insane. Do you

44
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,520
guys think that the three of us are slowly becoming this this this um this weekly podcast that we put

45
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,400
out is slowly becoming some sort of digital embodiment of Andy Rooney like it's somehow

46
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,720
you know that movie transcendence where Johnny Depp uploads himself into the matrix or some

47
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,640
shit I didn't see it I watched a little bit of it on I'm playing muted. I listened to Flophouse

48
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,360
they pretty much ran through it for me. Okay um I think that might be I think Andy Rooney might

49
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,680
be us in the podcast form. Maybe but maybe it's like not that Andy Rooney like maybe we're not

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,600
growing into like cantankerous old men like Andy Rooney maybe like the older I get Andy Rooney just

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,160
starts to make some sense right like what are all these different fruits the supermarket right?

52
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Do you remember when yogurt used to just taste like yogurt?

53
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
Maybe it just tasted like tangy yogurt. I can't go with you guys on this one.

54
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,560
You will Griffin, see you in three hours.

55
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
I like exotic fruits I like exotic yogurt flavors.

56
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,360
I had a I had a fun exotic fruit experience a couple weeks ago I bought I was at the the

57
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,000
Cha-Cha Kroger again epicenter of all the best anecdotes and I found a fruit that I didn't

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,680
recognize it was really weird it had like a spiny outside and like it looked kind of good like I

59
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,720
don't know I'll try anything once and I got to the cash register and the woman didn't obviously

60
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,480
like because who does she didn't notice what the fruit was called there was no sticker or anything

61
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,640
on it so she asked me what it was so she could ring it up and I had no like I had no glare so

62
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm in this situation where I'm looking like this woman's like so you're buying it yes

63
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:49,680
you know what it is I do not know I don't Justin to be fair she's the most in the wrong because

64
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,200
she should be like the the experienced professional working there you're you're going on a new flavor

65
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,080
experience she's the one who's supposed to be in the know she's paid to work there yeah but like

66
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,240
I okay Travis this poor woman works at Kroger at like one o'clock in the afternoon like I don't

67
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,320
expect her to be my exotic flavor sommelier but don't you feel like you look cooler when she's

68
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,880
like do you know what it's called and you're like nope but I'm gonna eat it no I look like an idiot

69
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,240
you look like an impulsive idiot yeah because you're also in that moment you're also admitting

70
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,840
I don't know I just saw it and I thought me and you are this is destiny I can eat this you're a

71
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,320
weird fruit get in my face was it a durian maybe it was a no it was like a it was like inside it

72
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,160
was like a grape but on the outside it had hard I think you ate like some sort of alien seed

73
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400
that the government put there and now you're gonna have like superpowers it's gonna be like district

74
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,280
nine I would like to think that it's that would have started this culminated with me this culminated

75
00:07:51,280 --> 00:08:00,560
with me googling a loose description of the image of the fruit in the hopes that I could figure out

76
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,880

86
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,840
you know the cops off duty and then he won't show up and like write down his badge number and yes

87
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,720
Travis I have some hacks that I read on the internet 10 years ago that I've never tried

88
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,520
that may or may not work that's the first one is figure out when the officer the arresting

89
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,880
officer will have the day off because you're supposed to be able to face your accuser in court

90
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,240
how do you get that information you call them and say hey I'd like to give you a free vacation you

91
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:47,600
got any time off coming up this is uh Disney this is Walt Disney this is Craig Disney you got kids

93
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,400
you gotta get down here right on the mystic mountain have the other one I've I've I heard

94
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,880
is that if you go to the uh like the courthouse and you file a discovery motion on your case

95
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,520
then you can find out when the last time the speed gun that they used to get you was uh uh

96
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,520
updated or like checked for and there's like a certain time period in which they're supposed to

97
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,480
be checked and if it hasn't been checked in during that time period then you can get it thrown out

98
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,400
I've heard that too have you guys ever contested anything in court yes I got a ticket for an

99
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,000
expired inspection wiped a few times because that's how I would know when it was time to

100
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
actually get my inspection oh yeah that's a McElroy special I did that took me three years

101
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,920
they towed the car and the dude tearing the car when I was like I'll go get it right now and he

102
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,040
was like it's been three years man I don't know what you want me to do um like he apologized to

103
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,240
me for towing my car Griffin what did you what did you contest in court so there was after Justin

104
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,200
you gave me the Oldsmobile and thank you I don't thank you enough for that thank you the Cutlass

105
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,120
thank you for that Supreme car that tight Cutlass Sierra um that had no brakes when you gave it to

106
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,200
me and I never just repaired that particular malady uh I uh there was a cop that came by

107
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,880
and gave me a ticket every day for like two weeks he just drove by the house and gave me a ticket

108
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
and like there's a long period where the car wouldn't run uh we didn't like have the title for

109
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,480
it for some reason I was in the process of like requesting a new title but there was so much other

110
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
paperwork I had to get there was nothing I could do this car was just gonna sit in place and get

111
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,280
tickets until I could get the paperwork and I was waiting on the paperwork and this dick cop would

112
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,040
just like roll by every day and give me a ticket in the same spot uh and so I stopped paying them

113
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,480
until I got all that stuff figured out and knowing that I could like go to court and explain the

114
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,120
situation away and one morning he caught me getting into my car going to school and he was like

115
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
riding me up a ticket and he was like you can either come with me to court right now and pay

116
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,520
these off or I'm gonna take you to jail and I was like whoa damn because at that point it was like

117
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,200
maybe almost a grand I was in college I didn't have a grand so I went and I paid half of it and

118
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
then they said you have to pay half of it now and you can contest the rest later and so I went to

119
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,760
jail I went to I didn't go to jail I was in jail I went to court I was facing like 500 other dollars

120
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,360
in fines and uh my secret here's my little pro tip for you drew davenport I was a I was a freshman

122
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,280

123
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,800
sophomore in college because like I had been driving for like a month I was like I just don't

131
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,440

132
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,840
I got in college because I couldn't read it uh like I couldn't read what they were charging with

133
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,720
like it was literally it was chicken scratch and I told the clerk I was like listen I can't contest

134
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,040
this I can't tell you if it like what the deal is because I can't read the ticket so I don't

135
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,960
I don't know what it's for I knew what it was for but I was like I don't know what it's because it

136
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,400
was I was too far away from the curb that used to be a big problem for me because I only drove

137
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,000
big cars I drove a Chevy Malibu and then a Cutlass Sierra it's hard to park those bad boys here's

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,160
what I'll say Drew Davenport I know you you are a you are a mountain of a man statuesque uh very

139
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:09,280
tall and I don't think anything is sadder than a very big man crying am I right you get that

140
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:16,000
you got like shoulders shaking oh my god because yeah you can put a lot of a lot of like muscle

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,720
behind that cry and you can you oh a whale herd down the street mine mine was sort of a pitiful

142

if all else fails Drew just mention our name well there should be an asterisk under after every tip

148
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,000
we just gave in the past like 10 minutes that just says only if you are a white oh right right

149
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,720
right white person like get like that that it's it's it's important to recognize that the loopholes

150
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,160
in the system that we have mentioned here are are pretty much just applicable to white people

151
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,840
because the the country is broken but other than that go go go for it but i think i i don't know i

152
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,240
think white people is a pretty big group of people and it's oh you think there are a lot of white

153
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,480
people go on griffin i'm just saying more malcolm gladwell i'm not i'm not i'm not saying that we've

154
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
won the numbers game what i'm saying is that our advice is rarely applicable to

155
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,560
to modest groups of people and this is a lot of white people there's a lot of them you guys want

161
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,280
this up and i don't think we're gonna get a lot of talking talking points out of this but this week

162
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,720
ronda rousey the strongest human being currently living did an interview on some red carpet where

163
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,280
she talked about pokemon flight five minutes god she just keeps getting cooler and cooler

164
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,040
she buys every pokemon game all the pokemon cards she's got them all she catches them all

165
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,920
and i think i want to get we have a lot of listeners at this point billions basically

166
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,000
i want to try and get some sort of campaign going to have a pokemon duel with ronda rousey

167
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,720
oh can we please make that happen okay here's how we'll sweeten the pot ronda rousey if you're

168
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,400
listening griffin will duel you in pokemon and then you guys can fight like in a ring

169
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,920
so that way you get griffin's strength you get your strength and then we'll do a tie breaker

170
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,800
if it comes to that griffin are you prepared to get beat up by ronda rousey i

171
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:26,000
i think i could stand a pretty good chance i don't know she beat up turtle real good

172
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,560
in the entourage oh god i was hoping we could talk about ronda rousey without talking about

173
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:38,560
the on you hoped wrong you can't hope wrong i will tell you two things i know of two celebrities

180
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,000

181
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,480
anybody knows ronda uh i'm not even i'm not even like bragging like i want to take down ronda i

182
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,840
i'm i she would probably beat me in that like she's she probably knows the best way to fight in any

183
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,880
like terms right like if right if we played uh canasta like she would she just would know how

184
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
to be a champion how did you punch me how did you find a rule that let you punch me in the head

185
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,120
it says right here i can't contest it this is a this is a deep index how about this other yadru

186
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,160
uh it's in my drew davenport it's by yadru answers user miss who asks

187
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,720
i need good ideas on a trap to set up on my roommate who is snooping through my

188
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:12,080
my four asterisks i'm gonna guess shit but who's snooping through my butt every time i leave

189
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,640
i don't oh that's funny i don't want water traps i want something that is going to make her think

190
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,840
twice about going in my room ever again so like incendiary devices we're looking how deadly do

191
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:35,200
you want to go is this like punitive or like uh i have a suggestion uh that i'd like to suggest

192
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,400
if i may be a so bold oh my god i know exactly where it's going this is a suggestion that you

193
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:50,320
can employ with uh under three dollars i think probably two if you buy store brand how could i

194
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,080
not see this coming what if you the next time your roommate goes to peruse your belongings

195
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,960
in your underwear drawer they find oh surprise surprise their hand has not been embedded in

196
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:14,720
your delicates your delicate unmentionables but in fact has found its way to a jar of jelly okay

197
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,520
so now just wait i have a very important question here yes do you remove your unmentionables first

198
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,560
before you fill the drawer with jelly yeah there's gonna be flies that's uh that's one

199
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:34,000
of many problems the jelly underneath a particularly tantalizing pair of oh my god

200
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,480
one that they definitely try to rifle through maybe you put on the jar drugs and money here

201
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,120
uh-huh and you replace the label and then they go to retrieve their treasure and instead find

202
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,520
some strawberry preserves wait hold on you're changing your story are we talking preserves

203
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,960
or are we talking jelly sir uh it depends on the part of the country and seasonal availability you

204
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,400
have to buy locally grown fair enough is the thing or else she could become allergic go to your

205
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,280
farmers market ask for the jar that the people would least like to have their hand stuck in

206
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,680
they'll know what you're what's your best prank jelly can i justin i don't want to be contrarian

207
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:24,400
here because i know how deeply you subscribe to this this jelly notion also jelly the knobs

208
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,960
oh my god you jelly those drawer knobs oh big okay now you're just being redundant then because

209
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,800
if you're if you jelly the knobs they're not going to move they're not going to go deeper into the

210
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:41,200
drawer unless they're using unless they're using a handkerchief to hide their fingerprints in which

211
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,320
case they wouldn't even notice the primary oh i see always always have backup jelly um let me

212
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,160
hit you with this idea though without jelly because jelly's good it'll stain your whites

213
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:02,080
and that's i guess has a sort of a long-lasting prank effect and um i'm into that i think a more

214
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:10,000
more effective deterrent solution would be honey you get honey on your hands that's your whole day

215
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,840
i used to watch winnie the pooh and i would have anxiety attacks oh that's his whole day he's got

216
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,480
honey on his face and his hands and he's covered in fur and that's going to complicate things even

217
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,160
further i don't have fur and it takes me a good two to three hours of scrubbing to get any honey

218
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,680
off my body but even if it's only a smack roll a smack a smack roll doesn't matter the amount i'm

219
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,840
saying the effort is going to be the same i'm sorry it doesn't matter the amount griffin i

220
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,160
think it does there is one huge flaw with your plan okay the the difference and i hate to get

221
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,920
into the aesthetics of this no get into it that's why that's why people listen to the show if you

222
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,960
dip your hand in a jar of honey you human instinct will will kick in and say well just lick it off

223
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:01,440
you're fine if you put your hand in a jar of jelly you can't it's too you just can't you can't lick

224
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,200
the jelly off like honey you can lick off you can't lick the jelly off you feel like an animal

225
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,520
there's no way there's no way that's not a deterrent because they'll lick the honey off

226
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,000
thanks for the smack roll and then they'll dig right back into your jar but then they will get

227
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,640
stuck in the hole trying to climb out of your room and then piglet will have to push on them

228
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,080
eeyore will have to push on them you just you're gonna get stuck you're seeing honey as being uh

229
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,760
almost a treat a a prank reward if you will i'm we can channel human nature to further the prank

230
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,360
what's that you go off to lick lick the honey off your hands but it's prank stink honey

231
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,360
it's stink honey it's jb custer's stink honey and you go to lick it off you get one taste of that

232
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,560
your mouth oh no this isn't funny at all hi folks i'm jb custer oh settle down butch that's my dog

233
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:04,320
butch listen when you're looking for the best in prankables reach for a jar of jb custer's stink

234
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,760
honey it's delicious it tastes great and it tastes great and stinks to high heaven how does it taste

235
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,640
smell is such a big factor in taste how does it smell so bad and tastes so damn good

236
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,760
the trick about my stink the stink honey trick is if you wait like a half hour it smells good

237
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,760
so it's like uh it's like invisible ink disappearing stink is like it you you it smells

238
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,920
bad and then if you wait long enough you just have patience aerate it out a little bit then it starts

239
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,840
to smell good again but if you wait too long it does harden into an unbreakable crust the other

240
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,640
problem with your playing griffin is that honey is poison to babies so if there's a baby going

241
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,880
through your drawer you just killed a baby so congratulations but they would sway you

242
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,440
but the person knows that unless do you have unless do you have a baby roommate do you have

243
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,280
a roommate who's using a baby as a front line of defense oh a baby agent a disarming baby a baby

244
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,800
in the coal mine if you will you're they're sending the baby out first to check for trap jars

245
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,080
how is it living with ashton kutcher it's pretty good um the rent isn't as expensive

246
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,440
as you would think it would be but i did have to have to hire a safety baby to just like enter in

247
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,880
rooms before i do and to like open any drawer that i need to like access for any reason because

248
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,720
you never know there there might be like uh i don't know like a naked man and it's uncomfortable

249
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,400
it's like an uncomfortable situation or you open up the toilet and there's like a human head in

250
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,520
there or he'll leave his door slightly jar so you think it's okay to go in and then you'll find him

251
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,240
in flagrante with a young hollywood starlet how is that a prank what he looks up he looks

252
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,360
up from the act of love making and says gotcha because that's what they that's what they said

253
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,080
wait just to be clear just to be clear ashton kutcher looks up after his prank and what he

254
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,840
says is gotcha yeah that's what he says that's what the name of the show gotcha punks hey let's

255
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,040
do another question uh my wife always chides me in the way i carry groceries from the trunk of

256
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,080
the car to the kitchen counter i take as many bags as i can carry so i can make the fewest number of

257
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,760
trips she calls it the lazy man's load but i completely disagree i feel like it's the opposite

258
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,240
it's the strong man's load since my arms are way down to the max am i being truly lazy and carrying

259
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,240
only one bag at a time as opposed to being truly lazy and carrying only one bag at a time what say

260
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:41,680
you brothers that's from shooting in chicago i i'm 100 with the question asker yeah absolutely i

261
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,080
don't have much i don't have much opportunity for strength training in my life so i need that i mean

262
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,880
it's it's good because it gets the job done quick but also i feel like macho man randy savage

263
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,440
carrying all those bags there has never been a time when i've come in from the car with bags

264
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,960
weighing down my arms when i haven't looked at my wife and like expected like a whoa look at how

265
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,800
many you're carrying i want i want some sort of sensor embedded above the door so that whenever

266
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:16,000
i come in carrying a big old arm of macho man randy savage groceries i want the john cena theme

267
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,120
song to play like just trumpeting me in the room look at his arms look at the definition look at

268
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,000
the tone how could he carry so many bags whenever i'm carrying the bags in from the car i wish that

269
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,800
there were like big stair steps in front of me so i like the judges could judge how many stair

270
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,680
steps i get up before i quit and like the lithuanian competitors that i could only do the

271
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,400
three steps like that what was that it was a lithuanian accent griffin read a book you can't

272
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:51,280
hear accents in books audiobooks uh i just love every part of it i love just being one and done

273
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,840
i love like when someone gets in my way and i'm like get out of the way because i'm carrying so

274
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,960
many bags and like that was rude but oh never mind he's got he does have a lot of bags i like

275
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,280
the inspirational moment when my arms are completely weighed down and i've got two 12

276
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,880
packs of soda and there's no way i could carry a single bag and then i realized i am not gonna

277
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,400
walk all the way back out here to close the trunk no way on earth am i making another trip and i

278
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:25,120
just dig deep digging that well that 127 hours well and just flex all my muscles available to

279
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,560
me and like somehow fling the 12 pack up and let it use its weight to carry the trunk back

280
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,800
to its closed position i'm also gonna be honest i also really like the moment when you're carrying

281
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,200
those 12 packs and one of them like the handle starts to rip a little bit and you're like oh

282
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,360
this is 24 now now the clock's a ticking i've only got like 30 seconds tops to get inside

283
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,280
before all these cans go everywhere whenever i see whenever i see somebody with those new fangled

284
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,840
cars or you kick the back bumper and it opens and closes the trunk i see them get their groceries

285
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,800
out and just give it a little a little punt to shut the door i just look at them and i think you

286
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:12,000
cuckold i don't think you're using that word correctly and i think i'm using it exactly

287
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,240
correctly you cuckold shut it with your hands i once uh was uh pulling this trick helping uh

288

my in-laws loaded some groceries in and uh my father-in-law is an an actual strong person

289
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,040

363
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,160

364
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,440
show elf it's like a 90 minute massage where the masseuse is two people talking to each other with

370
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:23,200
ghostbusters question what happens if one of the ghostbusters dies and becomes a ghost

371
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,600
holy shit here's a question i always had what happens if one of the ghostbusters

372
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,640
dies and becomes a ghost do the other ghostbusters suck him up like they do with the other ghosts

373
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,160
okay i would say that if they've made an arrangement with a ghost that's literally named

374
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:51,120
slime yes that is defined by its sliming that that he can just like chill at their house yeah

375
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,640
which is like by the way by the way okay if i just say okay just give me a second yeah by the way

376
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,040
by the way by the way if i'm going in to procure the ghostbuster services which i'm assuming i'm

377
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,200
doing at a premium once they become the toast of new york if i'm going in to procure their services

378
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,400
and like i'm talking to janine i'm setting up a time for my uh consultation an estimate which

379
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,680
i'm assuming they'll do for free uh i and i'm like setting that up and out of the corner of my eye

380
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,240
i spy slimer like just jamming hot dogs down his throat let's fucking equate that if you were an

381
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,960
exterminator and like people came in to hire you and there were just like rats hanging out on the

382
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,600
floor that's not a good look not just rats hanging on the floor like a giant rat emitting green goo

383
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,240
and eating hot dog and you were just like oh that's our rat that's ratty the rat he's our buddy

384
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:51,840
like the grossest rat was slimer a pet or like was he sharing the office space like what i never

385
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:57,840
quite understood because he had to be like the embodiment of a human being who had died like

386
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,800
that's how ghosts work but he didn't seem to like speak english or have any human characteristics

387
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,960
except that he was just kind of hungry all the time and terrible and yet he was the ghost that

388
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,840
was allowed like free reign of the place yeah sure not like ghost around not like einstein

389
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:26,880
or like gondi but slimer two things number one slimer was like on the cover of the ecto cooler

390
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,120
box right and he was like right and the the juice was green are we to like i'm thinking about that

391
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,760
now and i wish i'd never let that beverage cross between my lips and slip down my throat

392
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,840
i always assumed it was slimer blood is it slimer milk

393
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,960
did someone grasp his teats firmly but also ghostbusters themed jelly that was green

394
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,600
green probably at some point i feel like there was ecto jelly they had teenager ninja turtles

395
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:05,120
fruit pies that were green in them oh they were pudding pie green in the middle i guess just

396
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:12,320
ground up turtles yeah i guess turtles i had two points and i did my first one and i forget

397
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:20,160
what the second one was don't it always seem to go um uh do you okay slimer we can all okay let

398
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,840
me ask this as a setup slimer was nasty right give me like like a headless ballroom dancer or

399
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,680
something anything anything anything okay so i was nasty anybody anything right do you think

400
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,880
there was ever a moment when one of the ghostbusters was using the bathroom and they

401
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,880
just saw slimer's face like peek in expectantly like just wait because here's what i'm was there

402
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,560
a moment when they were using the bathroom and they had to deal with slimer watching them waiting

403
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,920
to go eat their bathroom this is what i'm that's what i'm what i'm wondering aloud that why would

404
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,720
you wonder that internally why would you wonder that in any assets now everybody has to wonder

405
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,320
okay good i think maybe this is i remembered my second thing if dogs do it there's no reality

406
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:16,400
which dogs do it please do it even as the little ghost do it everybody's eating bathrooms you meet

407
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:24,400
a nice girl or guy when you get one of your rare off nights from ghost busting and you go uh uh uh

408
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,080
and up to the room things are going well and what is that mid coitus bursting through the like flying

409
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:38,960
through the wall it's slimer and he's there to watch you fuck um i remembered my second point

410
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,400
thank god maybe it's like michonne on the walking dead how she carried two two zombies around with

411
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,840
her and so no zombies would mess her like ghosts would come by more listen simon's the worst

412
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:58,240
aesthetically and um just sort of just sort of having him around it gives you a sense of unease

413
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,920
and also there's all the slime that you have to deal with that's like a full-time job taking care

414
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,040
of slimer um but he's not gonna he's not going to kill you he's not gonna he's not gonna you know uh

415
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,760
he's not gonna inhabit a wolf and attack you right he's just slimer he's just gonna slime around

416
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,640
so so a more malicious spirit a lesion comes by and is like what's up time to get spooky

417
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,640
oh slimer you're already here sorry dog this one's yours later takes off oh so he's the devil you

418
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:40,320
know yes is he the devil hold on i'm not saying the slimer is the devil but he's definitely of

419
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,000
the devil it's never addressed in i don't think in any of the ghostbusters extended universe

420
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,880
that there are ghosts that are not malicious except for slimer it is like the one chill ghost

421
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,000
but no i would say that slimer is at least one percent malicious because like he eats your food

422
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,600
and gets his detritus leavings all over everything so he's not exactly like benevolent

423
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,760
but they don't seem to ever bust a ghost and then have someone say you busted my grandfather

424
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,160
i didn't i didn't want that you turds there's one in the movies just a jogger he's just he's

425
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,080
just trying to lose a couple ghost lbs and they bust him yeah they do they do and it's hard it's

426
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,560
hard he's working hard out there because when you're a ghost your metabolism doesn't exist

427
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,120
because you don't have a physical body yeah and in the song i always got so sick there's an

428
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:36,640
invisible man sleeping in your bed who you're gonna call ghostbusters why it's an invisible man

429
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,440
not a ghost too he's just napping he's a sleepy bag he's not bothering you he's not messing with

430
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,720
your shit he's taking a fucking nap and you're gonna bust him mid nap mid nap you jerk my dog

431
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,880
jumps on me sometimes when i'm sleeping and bust him setting bust that dog bust my dog

432
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,040
goes murdering dogs makes you feel good i wish we could i wish you could see that moment when

433
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,800
the ghostbusters are just circling your bed with their proton packs all loaded ready to blast then

434
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,160
one of like egon looks at vancom and it's like does this feel wrong to you i'm having a crisis

435
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,680
of conscience like i'm just gonna bust him like why he's not should we wake him up and see if

436
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,720
he's like a jerk or something yeah should we try talking to him maybe just explain that like

437
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,600
it's not his bed and he's like oh sorry i don't have eyeballs i'm invisible yeah hey by the way

438
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:38,320
we um we have we have back at our house a living fart that emits goo everywhere do you think maybe

439
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,920
the invisible man could stay with us like it probably wouldn't be that big of an inconvenience

440
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,280
yeah oh so you're suggesting that there can only be one ghost at a time it goes

441
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:55,520
busters hq so fucking vinkman dies and slimer's like well shit writing's on the wall yeah like

442
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,880
if you want to keep one ghost mascot like wouldn't you upgrade to the invisible man who you don't

443
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,280
have to see or think about you just know he's there at most he's napping in your bed at worst

444
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:16,720
yeah for sure and not shitting his green slime all over your lunch i hope that there's some

445
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,200
story joke in the new ghostbusters movie where slimer's like smokes weed or something

446
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:30,880
why why would that be a thing it would be fun that'd be pretty funny it would be good

447
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:37,760
i would get that on a t-shirt man i love slime i love slimer too i take back every mean thing i

448
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,840
said about him i can't stop thinking about slimer it doesn't make sense do you think they tried to

449
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,440
bust him and it just he was too fast they did justin in the first movie they bust him he's

450
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,800
their first victim right and then they take him back and then he's just there and then he's like

451
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:02,480
driving a bus what the fuck you professionally bust ghosts and he escaped he's the stupidest

452
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,560
goat he's like he's the least he's the least of them he's the most trappable most trappable most

453
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:16,240
he's the most travel and then he's driving a bus and rick moranis is just like okay cool what the

454
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:24,880
fuck oh like after your entire city is in the thrall of vego and mood slime like do you really

455
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,080
want to leave open any window to the paranormal like wouldn't you just insatiate like listen

456
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,480
we've had a lot of fun with this ghost slimer but i think we really need to get serious about

457
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,000
but there's not even a scene where they're like playing checkers with slimer going on a beach

458
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,240
vacation with slimer he's like catching a frisbee in his mouth he's just there he's just a shitty

459
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,040
roommate although i do i do not want to see a scene where everyone's like having fun with slimy

460
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,640
right then they all leave the room and he just turns and looks in the mirror and his eyes like

461
00:47:52,640 --> 00:48:00,880
blaze red as blood like drips from his mouth and then he smacks my knife and he smokes a huge pile

462
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,640
of weed maybe slimer is the only one of the ghostbusters team that knows where to get

463
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:16,720
weed well hold on let's not be too hasty i've got i've got my uh my uh chronic vego ain't

464
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:25,120
gonna smoke us out gozer ain't gonna smoke us out slimer he's not a great roommate he's a

465
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:33,920
gatekeeper not the not the weed haver what do you think oscar's gonna get us some weed he's a baby

466
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,760
does he make sense he's in school right now he can't get us well actually he probably would

467
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,000
have to hook up schools today it would be a really nice call back if they cast the baby

468
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,480
that played oscar as slimer in the next movie don't you think that would be a nice call back

469
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,960
do you think slimer i'll have kids in the next movie he's been sliming all over town justin

470
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:01,440
you know what i mean you gotta pay the piper wear a condom slimer where where would he put it

471
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,400
on his everything what happened to sliver didn't you guys used to have a ghost here uh this is a

472
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,600
scene for the next movie okay what happened to sliver did you guys used to have a ghost to live

473
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,560
here well he got too old and he died that's what happens to ghost and then sliver like peeks up

474
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:27,840
through the floor just kidding ah it's me slimer i can talk now i sound a lot like harvey feisty

475
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,520
slimer what a character what a what a great what a great character slimer is

476
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:46,240
do you think he had a room or do you think they just like made him float

477
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,320
like just like he probably doesn't sleep so what's he doing during the night just

478
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,040
sitting down in the office by himself just waits he's like the the dog in

479
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,160
futurama just waiting for them to wake up i'll see you guys in the morning i guess

480
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,520
anybody want to sit around play this is a sad lonely existence for slimer because he loves

481
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,360
them right and they love tolerate him right at most at best can one of you can one of you guys

482
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,000
turn the tv on just so i can have something to watch some white noise or something just leave

483
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:26,960
on in pr my big so lonely my big mushy fingers can't work the remote so lonely so cold so dead

484
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,520
i i was married when i was alive i had kids i was i was the mayor it's like the dread pirate

485
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,000
robber it's every night they're like good night slimer sleep well uh would like to bust you in

486
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,040
the morning like he he's on concert if he leaves the refrigerator open one of them might get a

487
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:49,360
wild hair and just bust him i would like to bust him often and then just let him back out to be

488
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:55,840
like just remember we could leave you in there anytime fuck i fly right turn it around right

489
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,520
the ghostbusters obviously it's insane that they have a ghost that lives at their house

490
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,920
it's crazy this is a debate team that point has been executed that that point is what's wrong

491
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,920
with slimer that of all the world that he could haunt he haunts the building full of people that

492
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,080
could kill him it's like he's got stockholm syndrome at this point it's real it's really

493
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,120
what it is he should haunt anywhere else like where people are exclusively devoted to busting

494
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:28,400
him on some level slimer believes he deserves to be busted he does he wants to be busted it's his

495
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,800
fetish it's the only way he can feel he's been a ghost for 453 years right in my fan fiction

496
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,400
and the only way that he can feel now is to be busted 50 shades of close to being busted like

497
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,200
dancing the razor's edge of being busted yeah so that's why he's being such a shitty roommate he's

498
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:52,080
not a bad guy but he needs to antagonize him just enough so that they bust him a little you maybe

499
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:58,640
could say that busting makes him feel good exactly maybe he likes the smug sense of superiority he

500
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:06,080
gets every time they drag in a trap full of another guy he's like a bitch he's out there

501
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,480
he's got his ear to the ground he's their confidential informer he's got his ear to the

502
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,720
ground his his ectoplasm ear and then he's like i hear there's a ghost down on 53 in maine who's

503
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,840
jogging and they're like we'll get him slimer and that's how he stays out he is a traitor to his

504
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,400
people maybe the reason he can't like he has to stay with him is no ghosts will have him no

505
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,800
he burned those riches no those bridges are gone maybe it's just because other ghosts would beat

506
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,000
the hell out of him like he's a he's not safe there he can do he can listen if you need a

507
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,840
prank done slime is your guy oh what if it's like what if it's like animals like if you feed the

508
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,040
like wild animals and they become like oh now now they'll starve to death because now they're just

509
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,120
so used to people like feeding them cheetos that they don't know how to hunt anymore slimer has

510
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,680
become like domesticated he wouldn't survive out in the wild he doesn't know how to haunt anymore

511
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:04,560
like he just he doesn't have the chops he couldn't spook anybody couldn't spook a fly let me hit you

512
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:13,840
too with this idea ashton kutcher and slimer in prank house and they're roommates and they live

513
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:20,080
together and slimer comes home from work and ashton's bedroom door's open so slimer goes in

514
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:25,200
he opens it up kutcher's making love to a young hollywood starlet he looks up and yells gotcha

515
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,480
and then slimer says oh did you and then ashton kutcher looks down and it's not a young hollywood

516
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,200
starlet he's making love to it's a big pile of slime roll credits roll credits roll title screen
