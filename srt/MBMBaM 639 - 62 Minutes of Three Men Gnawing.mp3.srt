1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,540
It's better it's better with you

9
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,780
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:24,180
Well me, I'm your miller's brother Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

11
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,980
Got some new tech. Can you tell I'm looking at your tech? It's so sick, dude

12
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,740
It's buttery gone are the days where the microphone was a desk guy now

13
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,860
He lives on this cyber robot arm that I can make I'll go all over. Yeah, you have a mic buddy

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,220
I've never felt more like

15
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,300
Daddy than I do right now. You mean our daddy not just like the state of being of like

16
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,880
Not the way internet people say it like us like I don't know a sexy older person

17
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,620
Santa Claus, I mean I'm

18
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,020
We'll get we'll come back to that

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,420
I mean it like our actual I mean it in the way that God intended it when he came up with the word daddy

20
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:11,660
Yeah, when he was like, I'm your I'm your daddy. I shower you with gifts. Enjoy this these loaves of mana

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,580
Enjoy this copy of secret of mana that I got at the local electronics boutique. He's enjoy this

22
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,140
box set of Hana Montana

23
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,460
yeah, when he rained down Hana Montana down on the

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,140
Pilgrims been a while since I've read the old BI BLE but

25
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,220
Brand new tech very stoked about it

26
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,260
Yeah, you guys you guys are more sort of tech savvy than I am

27
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,900
Well, that's not true, but at least for me but go on well in terms of recording gadgets and gizmos

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:57,020
I think that you do take the take the K. Yeah, I've got a light up juice pop that light up for me, buddy. He's

29
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,180
So much better I got a thing that's supposed to make the microphone louder and cleaner

30
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,980
I'm not gonna say the name of it because I will disparage the brand and it could be a me problem and not a brand problem

31
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,900
But I plug this this do hickey in and it introduced a loud hiss to the recording

32
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,980
I said that's unacceptable. I reached over to fix it and when I touched the box

33
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,180
Uh-huh

34
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,240
It started to play radio station at first. I thought this was in my mind

35
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,740
Yeah, I thought that it was like a pizza mom

36
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,060
Brain plate that maybe I had a big sock

37
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,740
There's a lot of references for this because I was gonna say like Lucio ball and her fillings when she talked about being able to get

38
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,700
Like government CIA wiretaps through her teeth when I was a kid. I read a book

39
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,340
It was like a young like a beginning reader chapter book about a cat who when he brushed his teeth

40
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,940
He could read minds and get radio stations. Oh, yeah

41
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Whatever it there was also

42
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,180
Track this book down before so if I could use my bully pulpit for a second

43
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,220
If this ring junior bells for you, cuz I'd love to track this one down. It was in the same vein as like

44
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,900
Can you teach me how to pick my nose or?

45
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,500
Yeah, the bubblegum monster or the bubblegum monster a month or kid minus

46
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,240
Kid might talk fucked up by the way

47
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,380
But I was also gonna reference the are you afraid of the dark episode where the kids in the hearse and he listens to the

48
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
radio station for dead people and

49
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,460
This show is winding down. By the way, we got references for another ten years. Do not worry about it. Easy

50
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
They made a lot of are you afraid of the dark?

51
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,740
but there was a lot of there was a lot of are you afraid of the dark spaghetti at the wall of just like

52
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,740
They say that he's in a giant pinball machines the same thing. How's this?

53
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,300
sick, so like this could add a

54
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,420
new cool, you know how on like

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
daily show

56
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,740
The British daily show on HBO like yeah

57
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,100
You know how they do sometimes they'll just like pull the newspaper out and they'll be like, oh, you'll hear something

58
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,940
And then they'll like do jokes about that

59
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,300
That does always feel a little graspy to me by the way when they're like we forgot to write anything

60
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,020
Let's just look at the headlines the newspaper and do jokes. It's it's yeah, I mean

61
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,980
They are overpaid Hollywood elites. Thank you. I was thinking maybe this could be fun for us

62
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,660
I can't control what the radio station is gonna be but I could just sort of pipe it in

63
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,580
I think it comes out of my mouth when I touch the box and then like you guys can listen to make

64
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,980
I've removed to the bar. I removed the by the boxes. Oh, see I thought we could play pretend for a moment

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,420
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry. Let me touch the box

66
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
Today baseball news

67
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,300
we got a big home runner coming at you from the state of

68
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,960
New York City Derek Jeter's back and he's got a big

69
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,380
Bump bump bump bump traffic is traffic time. It's

70
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,740
1018 a.m. Eastern Time and the Brooklyn Bridge is very crowded. You're getting a lot of New York right here

71
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,740
I

72
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,060
Even more bigger breaking news

73
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,060
Nintendo World Store at 30 rock have a big sale got to get down there. They have half off Mario's and

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,860
Donkey Kong is bump bump bump bump

75
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,900
This truck this this GD traffic guys the Brooklyn Bridge

76
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:28,300
It's rare that you hear a triple breaking news interruption on the same program the peak problem this show is enough about the traffic

77
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,700
I just want to hear more about Derek Jeter's triumphant return to base bump up bump. Yeah, it was great

78
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,380
He every time he got up there he scored a point

79
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,660
He got up sometimes when it wasn't his turn

80
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,300
Is that if one of us is laughing while the other one is doing something?

81
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,640
They are legally mandated to keep doing it. Even when there is no more meat on the bone

82
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,500
They're just chomping on there wasn't meat on it to begin with

83
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:00,060
If it's working for somebody but at the center of the bone is where the marrow is and restaurants charge like a

84
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,420
Hundred bucks for that stuff. That's an excellent point

85
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,260
If you chew on the bone long enough, even sans meat, you're gonna get to the good stuff

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:14,280
Eventually, that's our new tagline for this this this show my brother my brother me just the marrow. Yeah, you know

87
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,060
Oh, that's interesting. Just the marrow, but no, no, you misunderstand Justin the marrow doesn't come from outside the bone

88
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,580
it's not ever gonna be just the marrow you're gonna have to put up with a lot of like 55 minutes of

89
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,140
Three men gnawing and then maybe five

90
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,100
Then a minute of marrow and then four minutes for ads and announcements

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,460
Sounds like a good deal. I'm so glad you're sounding we now

92
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,860
Griffin is continuing his streak of using a different mic from Travis and I just to be special and

93
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:52,180
Unique my voice wasn't made to be condensed guys. It needs to be I have a more sort of dynamic personality

94
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,300
My voice simply must be contained

95
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,860
Safety of all this is not what I sound like in real life. This is only what I sound like in microphones in real life

96
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,860
It's so good. You guys like listening to the Lord speak

97
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,100
Yeah

98
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,420
And if I do it without Metatron there to like for so which is what I call my microphone then everybody's ears would bleed

99
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,780
Because it would be so buttery good and beautiful and I don't interrupt when I'm not on microphone

100
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,020
The microphone makes me interrupt people when we say Travis has the voice of an angel

101
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,220
We mean it in a sort of menacing

102
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,940
Yeah way like a menacing through dangerous way and I can't I can't have that on my conscience anymore

103
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,740
No, this is an advice show

104
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,620
We are gonna I want to try to help more people today because I feel like the holidays are coming up

105
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,140
It's good to be of service. I want a very close when this episode we were recording this one well in advance

106
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,100
Yeah, so the holidays are even close like people are gonna think there's a deficit of candlelight spirit. It's not that we're just

107
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,260
Like almost two weeks out. So I recently moved into student house and where I share a flat with 18 people own room

108
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,540
Bathroom slash kitchen are shared. What a giant flat. It's a big

109
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,780
Huge flat. Wait, are you the only one with their own room? Is it 17 people in one room and you?

110
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,540
That's fucked up man

111
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:13,420
Since I arrived late all the others got to know each other and started little traditions together one being brushing their teeth together every night. Oh

112
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,740
I

113
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,160
Like that actually a lot of people

114
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,100
That's a lie. It would be a loud sound just the sound of 18 brushes going at it. Yeah quite loud

115
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,700
I think it would vibrate the whole building if you're using even the gentlest quip. Yeah, sure. It's been uh,

116
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,020
It's been three weeks and they haven't invited me yet. Mm-hmm. I had a brush. I don't even know how it started

117
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,060
My question is how to get invited to their tooth brushing club

118
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,820
do I ask outright or should I show up without saying anything and that's from at a loss in Amsterdam and

119
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,460
This is PS. There's only two sinks and the group is around eight people. So it will be crowded

120
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,340
Okay, wait a minute

121
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,820
You've changed it with numbers you change this and this is why I don't like numbers

122
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,120
Is that I thought I was following the plot pretty clearly here

123
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,300
But the numbers at the end suggests that this is a rebel. Okay, is it pause?

124
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:14,280
I wouldn't I want to take a second. Is it possible that this person mistyped the initial 18?

125
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
because that is

126
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,900
Quite a lot of people sharing a house. Is it possible?

127
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,860
But then they did specify later the number again, which they had

128
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:34,380
Yeah, if it's student housing we could be looking at more of like a dorm scenario where it's a large dorm building. Yeah

129
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,260
Two sinks for 18 people. Yeah, I'm just gonna say that's on

130
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:47,520
That's a lot with the amount of stuff your body makes in a given day that even when you put it in the right

131
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,460
You know holes that go into the ground like the amount of residue

132
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,300
I feel like I've lived with two people two other people before

133
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,460
With two a kitchen sink in a bathroom sink and neither one of them

134
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,820
Was acceptable what's acceptable in the eyes of the Lord or anyone who ever saw it either

135
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:13,500
You know what this situation reminds me of what's that Trev? It's Terrace House. I always think about this of like the initial six

136
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,720
Always like have time to like bond and do shit together

137
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,420
And then like if you're the next person who comes in and you come in and like so oh you guys do a thing

138
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,180
Oh, okay. Cool. Can I do no no, no, I can't do that. You guys already do the thing

139
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,020
I would be a tradition guy. I would show up and be like I've got I've been watching on TV

140
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,900
And I've got some great issues that I'd love to start with everybody

141
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,060
Yeah, what do you think is the worst-case scenario of you?

142
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,820
just like rolling up when you see them getting ready to do it and you just like bust out your toothbrush carrying case and

143
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
You like open it up and you're a simple

144
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,140
Elaborate toothbrush and you start brushing your teeth with them unbidden

145
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:01,700
Yeah, I mean worst-case scenario is that they all turn and then they take their toothbrushes out and then they stab you with them

146
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,460
Yeah, that's like worse. I guess that's the worst possible thing that could happen just below that

147
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,020
I would say is all eight people stopping their toothbrushing exercise looking at you with a blank expression like

148
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah, what are you doing like that's even worse this is our special perversion

149
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,660
It is what it is. I think that it's weird to think that this perversion of

150
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,580
Wanting to brush your teeth in a group also has the limitation of but don't but not more than eight people or else

151
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,180
It's too wet wild and yucky. Maybe this is an accountability thing

152
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,840
When it's late at night, maybe I'm a little bit I've been having a good time and I'm feeling a little relax party in

153
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,820
Sometimes I want to give I want to cut loose a little bit. Okay, I'm 42

154
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,660
Yeah, so for me that cutting loose may be like, you know, I'll get him in the morning

155
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,000
You know to me just like a little treat to myself like you're already comfy

156
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,940
You got your two race wrist braces on for your carpal tunnel already

157
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,980
Yeah

158
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,580
Your sleep mask with the Bluetooth in it cuz you're like a baby like that needs to be working in the matrix

159
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,540
And maybe I got your super your super sloppy ASMR piped in. Yeah

160
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,540
I got my wet my weighted blanket for my anxiety

161
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
Yeah, yeah

162
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,100
I'm not gonna unhook. I'm not gonna disengage from the sweet pot

163
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,780
Yeah, sometimes you lay down your head hits the pillow and then you remember like oh I started there's a load of laundry in

164
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,780
The washer I need to switch it and then you're like, yeah, I'll wash it again in the morning

165
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,180
I'll just I'll just run it. It'll be fine. That stink comes out. The stink always comes out

166
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,580
I think here's what you do next time that all eight of them are brushing you go and brush your teeth in the toilet

167
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:52,140
I like using the toilet water. Don't be gross, but like they're brushing it looks crowded

168
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,780
You get like a quick rinse and then you start brushing and kneel down

169
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:04,000
Kneel down over the toilet or standing up looking down into the toilet. That's a really that's a really that's a really good question

170
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,700
Straddling the toilet backwards using the reservoir in the back. Obviously, that's the cleanest water in the whole toilet

171
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,660
I think with 18 people you need to look for every opportunity you can find to stand out. Yeah and being

172
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,100
Maybe you're the one who every time you go into the bathroom to brush your teeth you

173
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,620
stand over the toilet and peer deeply down into the bowl like you are seeing some sort of

174
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,060
Like you're scrying some sort of suspended memory or future

175
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,180
Future vision the hope would be that they would look at you and say like you don't need to do that

176
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,660
Come on yeah, let's get over Jerry, but I didn't want a crowd

177
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,820
There's like 18 or eight of us already in here. Yeah, I just don't crowd you guys

178
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,200
So I'm actually fine in the toilet and then make them want it because they hate

179
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,260
Show off all your elbow room

180
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,340
Yeah, listen guys someone someone's got a brush your teeth in the toilet

181
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:06,700
We could rotate out if you want, but you're gonna fight me for it. Yeah, I'm I love you guys

182
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,060
I've only just met you much later than you met each other

183
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,620
And I know you guys love each other and don't have that for me

184
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,560
But I love you and so I'm willing to be the toilet one

185
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,120
Yeah, I'll stand on I'll take that cross and put it on and I know you guys ate my wagyu beef admit it

186
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,660
I know you ate my wagyu and now a special wagyu

187
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,060
Did you use oil? You don't have to use oil. It's special fatty wagyu

188
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,620
Hey, we're making a lot of deep terrace house. Yeah, we should move

189
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,760
How about how about a wiki how from the wizard for this one? We got a jack into the computer space

190
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,340
And this one's for gamers is a timely gamer. This is our second gamer

191
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
This is another gamer one

192
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,680
Right. We did it wasn't last one about how to shit talk how to shit talking gaming

193
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,120
Well, it's yeah, I mean holiday season is when everybody gets the Xbox from their group from graham graham

194
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,960
The hand me down the Xbox. I've used up it all the noobs. Don't

195
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,440
I've got a I've got a 10-year morrow in to save on there. Don't touch it dipshit

196
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,440
This one's how to create a Pokemon when and and and I think they're talking about the individual monsters not how to create your own

197
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,520
Franchise like how to have the next but this is like how to create your own whole cloth

198
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,520
Imagine yeah

199
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,240
There's already so many of them. Yeah, there's like 900 of these fucking guys and

200
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,760
But that's not for some people not enough

201
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Also, a lot of them aren't don't count a lot of them have only appeared in one game

202
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,920
And then game freak in Nintendo. We're like, that's these are keys guys

203
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,920
Somebody took Pokemon and made my keys and they're like that one's not coming put that one in the Disney vault

204
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,040
We're not gonna do the keys one again. That was this is just a big garbage bag guys Griffin

205
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,920
They're in Pokemon the concept of extinction like this. Oh that Pokemon went extinct. Well, there is right because there's like the

206
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
The fossilized ones, right?

207
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:15,560
Yeah, but then they can just plug them back into a cool machine and then a humanity's blight upon the planet can just be reversed

208
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,440
I just don't know how I'd feel about them announcing one day like well

209
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,120
There's no Pidgeys in this game because they were overhunted to the point of extinction

210
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,360
We fought with them too hard killed them all. Can you blame us?

211
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Okay, so step one

212
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,840
Choose what type of Pokemon you want like fire water grass, etc

213
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,400
Keep in mind that better designs come out of more unique types

214
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,760
For example, there are no poison slash steel types. Really steel steel is immune to poison

215
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,160
I mean one of this article come out this made this. No, I mean it was updated a month ago

216
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,040
So mine will be a psychic poison

217
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Yeah, they rot your mind away

218
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,800
Oh, I do like that. How about this is good

219
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,880
We can kind of polish it up over the course of the question. Justin. What kind of type is your Pokemon gonna be?

220
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,720
Say

221
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,240
This is gonna be a fun bit that Justin does where he pretends like he doesn't know great

222
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,000
That Justin does where he pretends like he doesn't know Griffin just listed off a bunch of them

223
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,560
thunder now

224
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,920
Shock thunder type thunder thunder type emo thunder shock type, which is also my basketball name

225
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Okay

226
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
I didn't even want to make that shot

227
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I don't care

228
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,400
Mine's just normal buckets or mine's normal type

229
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,240
Think of something you want the Pokemon to portray ghastly is based on gas. Piplup is best based on penguin

230
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,960
Don't let this limit your creativity. However, a Pokemon like Skarmory is modeled after armor and a bird

231
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,040
Obviously, but there are nuances in its design that aren't over the top and make it look unique yet still like a Pokemon

232
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,960
I think I want to style my psychic poison one after just like a friend who's kind of a bad influence

233
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,760
Okay

234
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,640
So there I mean this would be continuing the grand tradition of

235
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,600
continuing the grand tradition of Pokemon who are

236
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,600
bi-bi-bipedal humanoid sort of yeah

237
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,200
Just just kind of guys just a Pokemon that you really need to justify to your friends a lot before you pull it out

238
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,720
Just like no once you get to know this book. I promise he's he's cool, man

239
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,320
Like it's I know at first it's hard to get to know him, but trust me. He's a good guy underneath all that

240
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,440
He's a good guy

241
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,880
I know when I tap the button on this book

242
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,640
Well, it's gonna look like a dude just comes out of here and that's gonna be fucked up to see

243
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm not going to lie to you, but it is important to know it's not a dude. It is a Pokemon

244
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
His name is his name is

245
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,720
Ted uh, and um, he does eat human food. Yeah, uh, but he loves it in here

246
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
He loves it in these little guys

247
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,320
I watched a tiktok on the McElroy family tiktok channel and it was a clip from a bim bam

248
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,720
And it was uh about pokemon and I watched the whole tiktok and it was just you guys going off

249
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,080
And I kept waiting. I was like, all right

250
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
When's jayman gonna bring the thunder?

251
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,040
I mean usually he comes in he's sitting back like a sniper

252
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Yeah, one of those where you waited to the very end to come dunking in like Shaquille O'Neal

253
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,760
I watched the whole tiktok and then it started back over again and I didn't get a hand on that

254
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,960
Uh, maybe you will the next time you watch it. Maybe the second loop

255
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,800
Yeah, you know for the frequency with which we discuss pokemon in this show

256
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,480
It is wild to think only two-thirds of us have any interest in it

257
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,960
And of those two-thirds only one is a passing interest like and what's infuriating to continue this this

258
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,600
Triune venn diagram. Justin actually knows shit about pokemon, but he plays a character on tv that honey

259
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,800
I swear to god. I swear to god to you. I won't pretend I don't that part

260
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,000
I have played them but like you've driven right?

261
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,800
You've driven around. Is there a drive? But when you lived in austin that you made constantly right? Like you've driven past this like

262
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,400
uh

263
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,240
Abandoned pawn shop, you know three times a day. What does it look like? It's like I don't know i've i've

264
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,200
Shuffled that off. I may room for other things. I don't keep it but to

265
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,960
Continue the analogy though. If i'm driving past this abandoned pawn shop, I would look inside and see you

266
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,440
Kind of just like squirreling away little treasures into your into your shirt

267
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,840
And be like, oh justin loves that pawn shop

268
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,040
I paid my daughter to play the new pokemon game. So I didn't have to play it for besties. Thank you

269
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,600
Okay, choose a name for the pokemon justin your excuse from the bay if you want to go no no

270
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,160
No, I want to continue with the bit. I feel bad. I don't have like cool

271
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,120
Cool stuff to say that's all I feel guilty

272
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,280
Well, just take the stuff that travis says and then try to put your own sort of twisted skew. Okay, got it. Yes. Yes. Yes

273
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Okay, my pokemon's name

274
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,480
My psychic poison, uh problematic friend is named doug bader

275
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,000
Because it's a combination of doug and the fact that he likes to debate everybody about everything

276
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Oh, I like that and he comes out and he's just like

277
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,800
Doug bader. Yeah, like what doug bader this dude only says his own name. Oh my god guys guys guys

278
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
I'm, so sorry. This is my pokemon doug bader

279
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,600
He got out

280
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,880
Again, I swear to god he loves it in here. He's got a little home gym doug bader. Yeah

281
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,400
I actually have my uh degree in urban planning. I have a master's in it. Oh doug bader doug bader doug bader

282
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,320
What why would you?

283
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,280
I mean nobody has to argue. He's arguing you don't need to insert yourself into this doug bader

284
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,160
He just said that he has a master's in urban plan

285
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:34,280
Um doug bader doug bader doug bader try what you try what you want the pokemon doug bader to look like

286
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,240
Doug bader just always has one finger up and he's going doug bader. Oh, that's good one moment one moment

287
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,480
Uh, he's like a squished ruffalo kind of like if you take ruffalo

288
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,680
You know how ruffalo is like perfect and you just squished him kind of yeah, you squished him down

289
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,880
Like a ruffalo that's a copy of a copy of a copy of a ruffalo. Multiplicity ruffalo. Thank you

290
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:08,520
Okay, it's when you squish him down. Does he keep his dimensions the ratio no more like one of those hydraulic press

291
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,840
Once again to reference tiktok videos as you put you put ruffalo in there, but you stopped about halfway down

292
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,800
So there's just a little bit of ruffalo coming out the sides

293
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Don't let it go too far or else ruffalo will momentarily disappear and then shoot up in an incredible ruffalo cone

294
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:31,640
That is indiscernible for hi guys. We wrapped 1000 rubber bands around this ruffalo. You won't believe what happens next

295
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,880
And ask yourself this do you want the pokemon to evolve or is it a non-evolutionary or legend

296
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
No, doug bader never changes

297
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
He does not have the capacity to grow

298
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,760
I like that because then in a future generation we can decide to add a pre-evolution of doug bader

299
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,920
That's just called like I mean doug or dougie bader

300
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
uh, and then when he

301
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,120
Dougie bates gets old and becomes doug bader and then maybe he has a third evolution where he becomes dr. Douglas bader

302
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,400
Now to reach that point you do have to introduce the rogan stone the rogan stone will force the evolution into dr

303
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
douglas bader

304
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Uh think of the moves it can learn

305
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,760
I can help you guys come up with I mean, there's a lot. I mean there's poison tail tail tail tail whip

306
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,520
That's one tail whip. I like doug bader just shakes his little booty

307
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Just shakes his little tushy. I like that

308
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,720
uh

309
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,560
Use mansplain

310
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,480
That could be a psychic type move except it's not one and I would love us to so I can create

311
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,680
A doug bader from whole cloth, but the idea of creating specialized moves irks you the problem is you could create a specialized move

312
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,920
Teach it to pikachu. He becomes godlike like there's one that you could give poke like pikachu a move

313
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,560
That would make him invincible

314
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,480
Use use eat other pokemon god, I wish I'd said a pokemon other than pikachu. I mean, it's just like

315
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,720
Just any other pokemon would have been great here. I'll give you like so much funnier

316
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,280
Why don't I tell you some and then you say some out loud?

317
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,960
We'll get some good takes and then rachel can like chop and screw it so that it sounds like, you know

318
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,840
Good ones so gar chomp gar chomp

319
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,680
Try and try give just yeah, don't say it like you're in a french restaurant trying to get the waiter's attention gar chomp

320
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Pardon me gar chomp

321
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,520
Is this supposed to be room temperature butter because uh

322
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,000
Not loving it. And if the baguettes are not coming soon, uh

323
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Uh lay tip may be affected

324
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,680
Gar chomp, that's good. Um

325
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,560
So this is up in the air bread. Sorry. Say cup holder con con cup holder

326
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,720
cup holder

327
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
cup holder

328
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,040
This is good, this is good

329
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,920
This is a play. It's fun in the space. It's good. Okay, I think it's good in here

330
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,960
Let me let me duck my head through this curtain and see if there's anything

331
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,960
Um, it's a pokemon that has cup holders built into it and just walks around with you

332
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,240
And carries your drink

333
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,880
Now can it do hot drinks? I can't hear your sound. Can it do hot drinks justin?

334
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,000
What it can but you can see it wincing

335
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Oh, no

336
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,680
Yeah, that's good and he can pop out of his ball that would be cool too what about like ice chest but it's a

337
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,440
It stores your drink. It keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold

338
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,660
I like the idea of just a cup holder pokemon that pops out and he's like chevrolet equinox

339
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,960
It's like this is my pokemon chevrolet equinox and then doug bader gets in

340
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,680
And drives the other pokemon doug bader. This doesn't make any sense

341
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,480
Um, and he holds up his license doug bader and then the license says

342
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,840
Yeah, yeah, that's good too it's pokemon all the way down do this

343
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,280
Lightning round real quick. If you want extra credit add catch rate to doug bader real quick. Just a number one

344
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Six, okay

345
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,680
gender ratio

346
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Oh a hundred percent

347
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,280
100 male and he's insistent on that. Yeah

348
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:23,640
Announces it loudly. Yeah. Wow, doug bader is a is a rough customer species name like help for his pronouns

349
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
He says i'm all dude

350
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:34,120
Yeah, that's the worst it's the worst. Okay. Pokedex number 69. Yep. Yeah egg egg groups

351
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,280
What's in this one's you justin how what's the egg group farm raised

352
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,640
Yes

353
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,320
hatch time

354
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Always always a party

355
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,320
Height weight

356
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,000
Um, and then I I guess this last q a it does say can I sell my pokemon ideas to the company?

357
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,800
You can try they may not do anything with it, but it's a good idea to share anyway, so um

358
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I'm open to it by the way

359
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,840
If nintendo is listening and I know they are and they're like, oh I like doug bader challenging

360
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,020
Challenging challenging ideas. I'm willing to sell doug bader for a premium

361
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
i'm already having

362
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,660
An anxiety attack thinking about being in a live show and i'm going to look for my uh, uh

363
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,020
A lime scooter to get home on and I run into a listener who's at the show and they pull back their uh, uh

364
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,900
Hoodie to show off their doug bader t-shirt that we definitely sold them

365
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,480
And they look at me with anticipation and I give them the blankest possible. The t-shirt will need to say justin

366
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,260
This is from that time

367
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,820
It was a pit that you did

368
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,460
What can can I get three clean? What are you guys in your head? What is doug? How does doug bader say his own name?

369
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
doug bader

370
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
doug bader

371
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,780
doug bader doug bader

372
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,700
Bader

373
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,300
I like that one doug bader. Oh, that's what he's like

374
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
Playing basketball. Yeah

375
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,780
Then he's emo thunder you guys want to hear another question could come in like mike jones does on a track where he's just like

376
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,940
Doug bader like yells it pretty loud. Yeah, that's or you could do like a jason derulo thing doug bader

377
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,260
Uh, my partner surprised me and packed up all our fall decorations this year

378
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:32,300
When I asked where the two real mini pumpkins from the grocery store went they responded which pumpkins all of them look fake

379
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,820
Brothers what do I do?

380
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,980
I don't want to undo their hard work, but I also don't want to possibly create a stinky situation for next year not possibly

381
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,020
Definitely. Well, I can't remember if I already threw the real money pumpkins out or not context

382
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,380
There are eight perfectly packed boxes with everything wrapped in newspaper already on the garage top shelf

383
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:01,760
That's from stinker treat in socal. Wow. Well, oh wait. Okay, hold on reaction. That's a lot of fall time decorations

384
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Good news. Okay

385
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,220
at worst

386
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,040
It's only a quarter of those boxes that will be contaminated

387
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,260
It will not reach beyond if there's one pumpkin in one box and another pumpkin in another box and there's eight boxes

388
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,820
That means six untouched boxes

389
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,980
That's a good point potentially seven maybe both pumpkins ended up in the same box and then it's like

390
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,180
That maybe whatever's in that eighth one who gives a shit

391
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,780
you you raise a good point, but like if you can

392
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,500
So if you can save future you from opening a box of puke like this is what you'll have right?

393
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,420
You'll have like it's already a pain decorations in and out who cares?

394
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,860
But then you open one that's like just vomit and trash

395
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,740
That's that's sad. You don't want or even worse. It could attract pests

396
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,460
And the only animal I know that loves to eat pumpkins is a porco upine

397
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:01,100
So maybe that could actually be great. You set a little porco upine, uh nest up in the in the oh, yeah

398
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
But the infestation will follow

399
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,380
Every every dirty animal loves to get their their paws on

400
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,660
Rotten pumpkins. I feel like that's a big draw

401
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,500
I don't want to disparage your partner here, but i've picked up real pumpkins and i've picked up fake pumpkins

402
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:23,900
And the difference between the two is noticeable not many pumpkins many pumpkins

403
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,500
Are we talking about the little gourds that are like that small because I think those things last forever

404
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:36,220
They maybe could hang I feel like the tiny little gourds could hang they have very little juice inside. There's no juice

405
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,660
There's not much pumpkin juice in the little ones if you try to ever eat one of those like a like an apple

406
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,220
Uh, there's not a lot of juice to go around

407
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Have you I think you're good. Did you do that?

408
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,900
My daughter's decorated two pumpkins with like paint and stuff this year

409
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,860
And they're still sitting on our porch because I can't quite puzzle this one out

410
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,380
Can't quite figure it out what to do with these guys. Oh you throw them away

411
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,660
Yeah, but they really like they're really proud of them. Oh, yeah, sometimes though. You got to teach hard lessons

412
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,020
It's true. Take a picture of it. Take a picture

413
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,580
I have to be careful. My daughter made a cat out of trash when she was three and it's still in her

414
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,700
Yeah, that is a good trash cat. Wait, which wait, which daughter?

415
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
What well, I mean charlie

416
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,020
Yeah, that was she was three a long time ago

417
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:31,100
Uh, yeah trash cat's been there a long time and i'm not like he's got a fucking stupid

418
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:36,380
Diet, dr. Pepper body and a cool whip tub head and I hate him. He's been in my house longer

419
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:42,140
You know, she he's in the house longer than cooper has it's more trash cats home than cooper's

420
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,220
Does she routinely check up on trash cat to make sure he's still around?

421
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,540
You want to hear some fucking wild slumdog millionaire shit. It's like last year

422
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,260
She had a project where she had to make a recycled toy

423
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
And she didn't tell us about it

424
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,980
And then like the morning of she's like, oh I was supposed to make a recycled toy

425
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:06,300
And guess who was there trash cat and I was like, this is amazing. We're finally I can't believe it

426
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,260
We saved trash cat for a reason but then after that I kind of felt like

427
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,420
It's time for funeral with a friend, you know, like yeah, sure served his part

428
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,580
Like this is what he was put here for his unfinished business. Like where was that?

429
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,900
Where was that character in charlotte's web?

430
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:28,300
That's like after the pig put the thing in the in the web like wow, that's amazing. Well completed his purpose

431
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,540
I guess wait, why are y'all looking at me like this?

432
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,540
What i'm just saying he put the thing in the web pretty cool. He did it so

433
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:41,260
But that is charlotte's web. She's like she spins. She makes a picture so good with her ass that she could die

434
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,220
That's it. Yeah, she makes the picture to save

435
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,460
Wilbur right and she does it so good. She's allowed to die

436
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:56,780
Travis is saying that in this story wilbur gets the blue ribbon and the farmer is like wow damn first place. Great job pig you have

437
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,740
Yeah, you're done now. You did you did what all things can aspire to

438
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,540
It doesn't get better than this

439
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
You are now sandwiches

440
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,220
After charlotte kicks it. Do you how long do you think before they're like?

441
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,740
Hey that pig hasn't spun any more webs in a while. You notice that is he done. Can we

442
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,580
can we

443
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,860
stop

444
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,820
His whole thing if that was you just reminded me

445
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:28,540
Of this wild thing that like a talking animal is one thing but humans who are like god

446
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:35,260
That's a cool web must have been a cool pig that did it. Yeah, and no one's like some pig in it. It says some pig

447
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,820
He's braggy, but I guess he can he shoots webs out of his ass

448
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,820
Hey, uh wilbur. Listen, some people came by we need you to make another web. Okay, buddy

449
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:52,960
Nobody believes us, please. It's in six months. You haven't even a single web out of your pig ass, please

450
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,700
I'm just saying he maybe had three months. I've just been big spider ham fans

451
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,980
Maybe that was it. Like I can't believe spider spider ham secret identity is wilbur the pig at our farm

452
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
We can't eat this delicious boy

453
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,580
It would have been cool if before charlotte

454
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:16,300

512
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:51,180
Exactly. And so it's like imagine that it is like a box and then they open it up

Yeah, you have to I mean they'll eat your food you won't have to chew it up

533
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:26,040

534
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,720
I don't know if you know this. It's a holiday season. I do. Yeah. No, I know you did

535
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Okay, and it can get a little bit chaotic and no matter how prepared you think you are now

536
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:42,160
How much man every year every year it gets to be like the week before and I'm like, oh

537
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,980
I forgot to buy something for Griffin. Yeah every year. I forget to buy something to Griffin. You know what I mean?

538
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,120
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense because you give me a lot of

539
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,880
Like teddy bears. Yeah. Well, I can get those like at the gas station, right?

540
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:03,400
And it's and I know always that that's what is happening. Yeah, cuz they kind of still kind of smell like gasoline a little bit

541
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,680
On the ground outside and I always say this is gas station, isn't it?

542
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,680
So it's like you're not being particularly clever about it. Yeah, but this year I'm gonna buy you a teddy bear from the gas station

543
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,340
But then I'm going to ship it to you using stamps calm because stamps calm is my one-stop shop

544
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,560
For all my shipping needs and mailing needs and I get access to both USPS and UPS services

545
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:32,280
So I could send you a gas station teddy bear through both of those and see which one gets there first huge huge for me

546
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Because I can do it right from my computer with no lines, no traffic

Jordan crucial of the host of feeling scene where we talk about the movie characters that make us feel see and I'm the show's producer

552
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,680
Marissa Jordan, you've interviewed so many directors actors writers film critics

553
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,600
And I like to play this little game where I take a sip of coffee every time someone says that's such a great question

554
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,520
That's such a fabulous question or they tell you how smart you are

555
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,080
I think that you are rather brilliant. And of course the big one is when they cry unexpectedly. Yes, Jordan

556
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,920
I don't want to cry on your podcast. I wasn't expecting to cry. I mean, it makes me kind of want to cry

557
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,740
Feeling scene comes out every Thursday on maximum fun.org. Listen already. What are you waiting for Jordan? That's such a great question

How Lapland here with breaking news on a revolutionary form of entertainment professional wrestling

560
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,300
For more we go to our correspondent Danielle Radford

561
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:59,100
Professional wrestling is the craze that's sweeping the nation featuring fisticuffs and colorful costumes

562
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,460
But who can help us make sense of this world of body slams?

563
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,860
Lindsay kelk has the answer sources tell us of an amazing podcast called tights and fights

564
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:15,140
filled with discussions of the absurdity of professional wrestling plus all the sincerity and hilarity that you could shake a stick at

565
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:24,780
Listen to the tights and fights podcast every week find it on maximum fun or wherever you get your podcasts and your old-timey radio

566
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,780
You

567
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:34,100
Another question another question. All right, you're the boss

568
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:41,420
Three years ago. I went to my first candle nights white elephant gift to change at my job. I was gifted a cartoonish

569
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,380
Ten-gallon cowboy hat crafted entirely from Bud Light beer cases

570
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,280
So it's fun. It's cold thinking nothing of it

571
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,220
I re-gifted it to my father-in-law now after the pandemic folks at work are asking about the hat trying to track it down

572
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:01,220
Apparently was a re-gift fixture of the Christmas parties. Oh, and my boss's boss

573
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,340
misses it

574
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:08,320
Brothers, it's been three years and I don't even know if my father-in-law has the hat. What do I do?

575
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:14,740
That's from hatless in Houston. I mean the obvious first answer is ask your father-in-law if he still has the hat

576
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:20,180
We have to assume that's happened already. No. Yeah, actually we don't there's a lot of I would not

577
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,300
I mean my father-in-law. I don't think I would ask Tommy like you got that hat

578
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,060
I gave you that would be well, there's no fucking way Tommy would get rid of a cool

579
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,180
Bud Light that's true. That's he's a man of taste and distinction. He will be good

580
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,260
I had around now I will say I know I flippantly said just ask your father

581
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:41,740
But you do run the risk of if the answer is no if your father-in-law is the type of person that's like

582
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:49,220
gonna one tell you he got rid of a gift you gave him and two does he then feel bad now that you've asked so

583
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,980
You've introduced guilt into the mix as well

584
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,100
Yeah, it's like pay it backward. It's like this is now you're now

585
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,340
This is your burden this guilt that I feel now is also yours. I don't know if it helps you

586
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,020
We're family question asker

587
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,460
I don't know if this helps you but I think it's real messed up for someone to give you a gift and

588
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:14,460
And like at a white elephant exchange without telling you the context of like and next time you'll pass this on to somebody else

589
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,980
And then just expecting you to assume that

590
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:25,980
What you didn't know is this cartoonishly oversized 10-gallon hat made out of Bud Light cases is very important to our company

591
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,560
You could tell him actually I gave it to my father-in-law so he could regift it at another party and their party

592
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:40,960
Doesn't have as much around the holidays. It really means a lot to him. It really meant a lot to help them to have a special

593
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,840
Budweiser hat that they could pass around well

594
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,040
You see I was wearing the hat because I cherished it so much when I was walking by and I saw a burning building and there

595
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,400
Were children inside and I rushed him to save them and the hat valiantly gave its life to protect me from a falling beam

596
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,860
It was actually really sad my father-in-law. I gave him the hat and he gave me

597
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:09,300
24 loose Bud Light cans that had no container, and it's like that's Christmas. You know that's that's Christmas

598
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,680
I gave it to my father-in-law and he ate it. Can you make a new hat out of whatever the Bud Light cans look

599
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,260
The case looks like now obviously it's gonna be different

600
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,180
But if you bring it in and somebody be like this is a different hat you'd be like yeah

601
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,740
This one's light

602
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:33,100
This is a light hat. This is an 11-gallon hat. This is Bud Select 11 gallons

603
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,360
This is a much nicer hat. Give this to your boss's boss. Tell him it's a nicer hat in every way

604
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,320
It was featured in Southern Style magazine

605
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,660
Maybe you just go around to everybody in the office and say hey I

606
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,580
Threw away the hat and I'm sorry and here's a $15 gift card to Sheetz

607
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:58,500
If you do that with everybody. Everyone? What if it's a large company? There's only six people. Yeah, it'll be fine

608
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,860
Yeah, that's a possibility. What?

609
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,300
How do you know that? That's so funny that you asked that

610
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:13,180
You checked LinkedIn. What? You checked LinkedIn. I interned with the company for a couple summers

611
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,240
Yeah, it was tough. It was a tough environment. Did you ever get the hat?

612
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,960
Ah, did you guys ever see Boiler Room with Vin Diesel? All the time. Fuck yeah

613
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,960
Yeah, it's it was I'm just saying it's a sick flick. Yeah, I've seen it all the time

614
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,180
Yeah, that was when you had you had a pretty long commute, right? Cuz where are they based?

615
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,280
hmm

616
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,280
Where were they based? Yeah

617
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,580
Go ahead say it. Scanlan. Scanlan's. Oh

618
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,440
Oh, that's the good part. Scanlanburg, Maryland

619
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,120
Okay, yeah

620
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,120
And what and what do they make?

621
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,480
Hmm, what do they make? What do they do? They make life easier for a lot of really deserving customers every day

622
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,800
Okay, as long as there's not more than six customers that need assistance. So what's

623
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,920
What specifically did you do?

624
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,720
My what was your day to day life? My job there? Yeah. Yeah, I was the I was the honeycomb guy

625
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,200
I was the guy who would come after they put the honey in the jars

626
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,760
I was like I would come and reclaim the comb and suck whatever honey I could out of it

627
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,680
And then I was a paid position. It was an internship

628
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,960
I mean, but I was paid in honey

629
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,860
So I would suck the honey out of the combs that they couldn't squish out

630
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,720
Yeah, and now those in bottles to sell like discount stores from your mouth to the bottle. I had a

631
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,440
like a dental dam like a

632
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,980
Was there a risk of in there what?

633
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:45,100
Oh, there's always a risk of bees. Sorry. That's not it's no different from any other job any I could work on a freighter

634
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,180
You know when I was out in Alaska and the crabbing ships and stuff

635
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,460
Yeah, you didn't ask them about bees, but bees were a constant problem

636
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:58,220
They go on the ship who knows when you're in port at a spooly like flour or y'all

637
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,180
Yeah, sure. Did you guys have a ship's be like they used to have ships cats what?

638
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,540
won't be bees can't live in the ocean if they

639
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,200
If you take a bee in the ocean, it dies

640
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:16,940
I love Justin how sort of the info you were giving us about your job went from being not specific at all to I sucked

641
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,660
honey

642
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:25,220
Sucked honey. I would shotgun honey out of the the nest and then spit it into jars to be sold at Dollar General

643
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,420
I found that helpful for me to know what you were talking about. Yeah, I feel like a little context

644
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,340
I didn't they said it was top secret the work I was doing

645
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,540
but

646
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:42,020
Government safe safe place. What was it government work? I really I've said too much. I've said too much

647
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,060
We should ask another question. That would be ideal. I think

648
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Hey

649
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,380
I want a munch

650
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,660
Baby I want to

651
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,620
Munch bop bop bop bop bop

652
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:08,860
Welcome munch squad. It's a podcast within a podcast profiling latest and greatest in brand eating and folks. I'm

653
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:15,220
So excited to tell you we've talked about the subway series if you know this the subway series is not

654
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,340
The the Yankees versus the Mets like that. It's a subway series in New York

655
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,300
This is a subway series that subway does where basically they were like, we're tired of making so many different sandwich

656
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,860
Yeah, here's 12 of them. Yeah, please don't order other things other than this

657
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:38,860
These are the easiest 12 sandwiches to make we can't teach people how to make 13 fucking sandwiches guys

658
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,340
We're tired. We're tired of this. We're tired of this. So we have we now have

659
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,460
Subway creates footlongs made from cookies, huh?

660
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:58,060
Huh? Subway the brand this is gonna trip the brand that sells more freshly baked cookies than any other

661
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,220
Restaurant company in the United that can't be true

662
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:08,060
Now my buy a cookie every time I go to I'm just saying that there's like the great American cookie company where their whole deal

663
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,860
It's cookies. Subway is the number one

664
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:16,340
Fast food franchise in America. There's more subways than anything else. They're number one

665
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:22,820
So it would make sense that they sold cookies. They're the number one cookie place, but let's we're getting hung up on

666
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,420
inspired by the Subway series

667
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,380
Signature subs cookie lovers can sink their teeth into four limited edition footlong flavors

668
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:39,520
Exclusively at cookie way the brand's pop-up restaurant that serves only its fan favorite cookies for so let's talk about

669
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,640
Let's talk about you restaurant a restaurant that sells just the four cookies

670
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:51,360
First up is the Subway cookie club. Just like the perfect combination of proteins on some ways number 11, which is

671
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,200
Ham roast beef and turkey

672
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,160
but this one has

673
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
double chocolate favorites

674
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,640
Just like the perfect combination of proteins the Subway cookie club stacks cookies on I say

675
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:11,640
protein with a double chocolate cookie base and vanilla frosting then topped with chocolate chip white chocolate macadamia and raspberry cheesecake

676
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,440
cookie chunks rainbow sprinkles and chocolate raspberry sauce the Mexicali

677
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:24,620
Whoa inspired by the south of the border flavor of the number seven the Mexicali starts with a vanilla sugar cookie based

678
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,680
Smothered in dulce de leche then topped with mole and corn nuts

679
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,760
Drizzled with white chocolate sauce and finished with ground coffee tahini and espresso chips

680
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,280
I think I would I don't you guys that's long enough not being able to see these bad boys

681
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:45,960
Let me just hook you up real quick. That's a lot. That's a lot of flavors. Yeah, it's a complex cookie experience

682
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,960
It's a lot of flavors and textures

683
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,840
You guys seeing this

684
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,020
Is it loaded for you seeing it no

685
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,480
It also bothers me to think about oh

686
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,560
my lord

687
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,040
Holy shit gang juice are cooking oats

688
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:09,960
It's a footlong I mean it's a footlong it's a footlong sub it's a footlong cookie sub

689
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:18,160
Can you describe for the listeners Griffin what they know I can't describe what for the listener I can't at all

690
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,160
It's I mean if I might attempt

691
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,520
imagine

692
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,360
you have a plank of cookie and then

693
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,320
you loaded a bunch of toppings into a cannon and

694
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,120
And from about eight feet away

695
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,760
launched

696
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,640
Said toppings at your plank of cookie and then a man on a 30-foot high ladder

697
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,720
attempted to drizzle stuff on them

698
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:50,020
This looks like a family double dare challenge in cookie form if I could try if I could try I think it looks like an open

699
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,480
casket funeral for some gorp made by a psychopath

700
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,760
Yeah

701
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,320
Trav look at can you are you able to zoom? Can you see the cookies with any level of specificity? Yes

702
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Okay, I'm actually

703
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,320
You know what? I'm gonna send you I'm gonna put a link to this image in

704
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,480
The in the chat, right? Sorry, so you you can just look at this image because I need you to

705
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,180
Look at this and guess for me what you think is on the number two cookie

706
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:29,140
Is that the second from the bottom or the second from the second from the top? Oh my lord Justin just looking at it pickles

707
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,340
peanut butter

708
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
potato chips

709
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,380
Strawberries

710
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,620
bacon crumbles bacon crumbles, of course

711
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,580
sour cream

712
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:48,420
That's marshmallow cream on top of a vanilla sugar cookie base topped with salty potato chips savory bacon crumbles and Subway's brand-new

713
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,380
dill pickles

714
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:58,360
Lordy Lou bringing together two of Subway's most iconic menu items footlong subs and Subway cookies was the only way

715
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:05,240
We could top our celebration of National Cookie Day from last year when we opened the first cookie way says Paul

716
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,420
Who works at Subway?

717
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:14,800
We wanted to give Subway fans even more cookie to love with flavors and ingredients that are just as craveable as the sandwiches

718
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,140
They're inspired

719
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:23,540
Do you think these are just as they may be just as craveable as a place that that when people said?

720
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,820
That's not tuna all of America said. Yeah, that sounds right

721
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:35,260
Tracks three out of four of these have things jammed on top as

722
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:40,860
Though a Subway City Council decided they were sick of people taking naps on these

723
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,660
Yeah

724
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,740
These are brutalist pigeons. Oh, yeah

725
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:52,020
This is these look like they're designed to challenge you to try to figure out how to eat them

726
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,940
I find within myself a boiling anger

727
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,820
Witnessing these we can't feed everybody in this country, but we're gonna do this

728
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,940
We'll just have these benches these edible benches

729
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:09,480
These look like if all six of our children were let loose in a Subway cookie

730
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,480
Factory and given complete reign to do whatever the fuck they wanted. Yeah, and they started on cookie

731
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,720
Number one looking for a cookie they'd eat and by cookie number four

732
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,920
They were like, we're gonna force our parents to eat these that it'll be funny as shit

733
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:30,040
Like the thing you would dare little Greg to eat at the lunch table for $5 that five of your friends pulled

734
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,840
$1 in to get him to eat this mess

735
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,840

It's it's a Travis hates lenticular material, but I love how cool this sticker looks

762
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:42,660
