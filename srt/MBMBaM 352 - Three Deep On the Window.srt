1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,960
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm Travis, what's even the point?

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. I'm just

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,640
gonna stick with it. Travis, what's wrong? We seem to have joined Travis in media res.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,160
I missed it. Let's take a step back and see what happened. I missed it.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,120
What? I missed it. Which one? Which did you miss of them?

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
I missed 420. Oh, shoot. Oh, Trav.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
I know. I know. What were you doing?

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,400
I wasn't paying attention. I was just, Griffin, nothing. That's the thing.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
Oh, shoot. I just didn't, you know?

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, so you got up and you were just going about your day,

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
and you did smoke a little bit of weed, like one or two joints.

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,840
But just normal, just the normal amount. The normal amount, not like the buck wild

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,640
amount that you're supposed to do on a funny weed day. Trav, I'm so sorry, buddy.

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Well, you know, it's one of the things, it happens when you work from home

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,320
and you don't own a calendar and like, you just, you know, all the days start to run together.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,120
Like, I forgot it was April for a while. You know what I mean? So like,

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,800
and it wasn't until, you know, on the 21st, all my friends, all my weed friends were like,

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,000
so what did you get up to yesterday? And I was like, yeah, I just sort of

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
smoked a normal amount of weed and went on about my day. And they were like, what?

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
And then, so not only did I miss it, I was also embarrassed in all the forums.

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,760
It's such an inspiration to me that 420 is able to, you know, usually people would start to think

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,920
it passe. They would start to think that scene is over. It's played. 420, we get it. Everybody

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,720
hysterical. But 420, it's just so good and right to have a day about weed that everybody's just

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,360
like, let's not ruin this for ourselves. Like, let's just all try to be cool about the fact

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
that this is a day about weed and like, celebrate that.

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,400
If you want to come for my 420, you better be prepared for me to come for your Halloween.

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,320
It's like, what if today it's just all pumpkins and candy and costumes? Like, why?

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,120
Why? Why today that?

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,880
It's just like the way that people have embraced June 9th or like March 11th is like-

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,360
Well, March 11th is National 311 Day where we all get together. And we also, I will say,

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
smoke a considerable amount of weed and listen to 311 together.

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,760
True. And which is funny because on 420, I usually listen to 311 and smoke

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200
an inordinate amount of weed.

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,840
They're interchangeable, really, those two dates.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,520
But then there's June 9th, which I think is special for everyone, obviously. Nice.

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,080
Nice.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
You idiot. You know, the-

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,400
Dumb. I think I'm going to start becoming a Halloween hipster in the same way that some

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,600
people are hipsters about 420. I think- I just say like, you know, I wore costumes every day

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,640
last week. I don't need a special day for it. You know, that kind of thing.

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,000
You're being childish with your jokes about pumpkins and candy and sweets and costumes.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,680
I'm being childish. Fuck off. Life is so fucking hard. Can you not give me these little checkpoints

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,800
where I can have just like a little unnecessary celebration?

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,440
Some people need to wear costumes to help with chronic pain. Like, yeah, I get it.

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,960
I just- I just- I don't like people who are down on holidays for any reason. It's just the year

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,880
is just long stretches of bullshit garbage, and then we get one day where we can log on to Twitter

52
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,360
and say that we're smoking weed even though we haven't known where to buy weed in 15 years.

53
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,440
Just let us have that. Let me have it. Please. Please let me just make jokes about it.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,920
I haven't weeded in so long, not since I lived in California, where it's everywhere.

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
Where it's all over.

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,960
Well, I can say that's inaccurate, Travis. I can confirm. I may have-

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,920
That was not recreational though, Justin. That was professional weeding.

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
Yeah, we expensed that.

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,120
That was expensed weed. Boy.

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
How did you spend the fourth 20, Justin?

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,280
Well, I was doing interstate travel, which yes, did make things a little more challenging

62
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:06,720
for sure, but I just sort of drew a lot of pot leaves on my binders, my various binders.

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,240
I drew pot leaves and white out on those. Took a couple coats, but I got a look that I'm very

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,320
proud of, and then I drew a guy with a big hat and a funny coat kind of giving a thumbs up.

65
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,040
And he was like, yeah, it was cool too. And he was kind of like having some weed.

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,200
You could tell he was about to or knew where or had been with weed in that way.

67
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,600
I spent it by unloading about 18 ounces, made about 40 Gs.

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,200
So I think you probably took it a little far.

69
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,640
I'm like fucking Walgreens, you know? I come for that Valentine's Day candy momentum.

70
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,280
The best time to buy pot at Walgreens is April 21st. A lot of people forget this,

71
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,440
but if you go there on April 21st, they are giving the stuff away.

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,640
I mean, basically. Listen, but if you don't get there till like 3pm,

73
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,120
it's all just gonna be like white marijuana, you know what I mean?

74
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,400
The gross kind that nobody wants, you know? Those crunchy Nermal flakes.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,320
Exactly. No, thank you.

76
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,640
Should we advise? Yeah, this is an advice show, ostensibly.

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,360
So we take your questions, turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

78
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,480
This first one is, well, I don't know who it's from. It's a very short question.

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm going to play paintball for the first time. Advice? Strategies?

80
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,960
That's from somebody. I don't know. That question made me really,

81
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,880
really happy because it's been a long time since we got this really straightforward to the point.

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,280
I just want to say, side note, hi, everybody. This is Travis McElroy,

83
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,200
who goes through all the questions every week.

84
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,840
Please stop ending your questions with, am I good?

85
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,640
It's like all of them, huh? Please stop.

86
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,000
It's like 75% of questions end with, am I good?

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,400
And am I good is not an actionable, advisable position.

88
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,040
That's not a good question. In the retail industry,

89
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,520
we call that a closed question. We need an open-ended question here.

90
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you. That's what I like about this.

91
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,320
Like for instance, this essentially Yahoo answer question,

92
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,400
can you give me advice and strategies for paintball?

93
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,520
I will say this. The last time I played paintball was at a buddy's bachelor party,

94
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
and it was about 48 degrees outside.

95
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
I ran around and scampered and did my fucking Sam Fisher techniques all over that battlefield,

96
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,880
and I breathed in so much of that cold Texas air that I got extremely sick for the wedding

97
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,880
the next day. Just watch that. I'm not saying you're going to a wedding tomorrow,

98
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,480
but just don't. This is very much the same as my laser tag advice.

99
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,560
Do not overexert yourself in all things.

100
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,200
I want to congratulate this person because they have obviously come to the right place.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,880
They've come to My Brother, My Brother, Me, a tactical podcast,

102
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,720
and I think that that shows a lot that your head's already where it needs to be,

103
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,440
turning to the right people to support you.

104
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,400
If you have even a modicum of strategy with paintball,

105
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,800
everybody else is just afraid to get shot. You have to live without that fear.

106
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,720
You have to get beyond that fear and be more sort of a symbol.

107
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
That's the thing that people forget with paintball,

108
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
is that everybody's running around Sam Fisher style,

109
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,000
and what you lack in that way is nobody to stand up and say,

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
I am your god now. Die for me. I'm the reaper.

111
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,920
Get in line, follow behind me, and I will lead you to victory or Valhalla

112
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,080
or whatever sort of promises you want to make of glory and death.

113
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,440
And that's the thing that people forget to do is become a symbol that people can believe in.

114
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,240
Also, just as an aesthetic, wear clothes that are already spattered in paint,

115
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
and then it's hard to tell if they hit you.

116
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,680
That's good.

117
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,280
Or just wear the mask and as little protective clothing as you want that says,

118
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm not, I'm not scared. I'm not scared of the painful welts that I will develop

119
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
from your balls of paint. Come at me.

120
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm looking at a list of terminology here on Wikipedia

121
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,440
because I thought it would be funnier than it actually is.

122
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
There is an entry on here that says,

123
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,840
streetball, paintball played by those who do it simply for the love of the sport.

124
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,200
Yes.

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,280
Aren't you just, you're describing, yeah, you're describing 99.999.

126
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,000
There's like one person out there who is a professional paintballer,

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,920
and I'm sure those people exist who are just like,

128
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,480
oh fuck, another day of paintball.

129
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
Pretty much everybody else is out there like,

130
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,360
great.

131
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,120
You know what?

132
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,480
People don't do enough like covert, like Black Ops paintball maneuvers.

133
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,120
Like bring your own armbands so you can switch teams at will.

134
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,800
You know what I mean?

135
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
This both works as espionage, but also if your team is losing,

136
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
well now you're on the red team and you're winning.

137
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Just like that. You know what I mean?

138
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,320
Or like maybe go hide in the woods until the whole match is over

139
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
so you don't get shot.

140
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
Oh yeah, that fucking Hacksaw Ridge shit.

141
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,840
Yeah, and then you come out and you're like,

142
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,800
actually the last person standing was on the blue team.

143
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,080
And you like take out the last red team member.

144
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
No, that's not how Hacksaw did it.

145
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
Now I did just watch Hacksaw Ridge over the shoulder

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
of somebody sitting in front of me on the airplane.

147
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
And so I feel pretty...

148
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
That movie is, by the way, as far as I can tell,

149
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,280
is a two hour long cut of that one scene in Saving Private Ryan

150
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,160
where all the people get horribly injured on the beach.

151
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,520
It's just like, I think that was Clint Eastwood made that one.

152
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
And he was like, I really liked that scene.

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,280
People walk around, legs blowed up.

154
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,720
That was Mel Gibson.

155
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
Oh, it was Mel doing that one.

156
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, that makes a lot more sense now because he likes that saw shit.

157
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
But it's just like, man, I like that part of the movie.

158
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,840
I'd love for it to be two hours.

159
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,200
Just a lot of people wandering around horribly, horribly injured.

160
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,600
I love it.

161
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,240
You know what, Griffin?

162
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
I agree.

163
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Why all these war movies always have to show people getting hurt?

164
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,200
You know what I mean?

165
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
Where's the fun side?

166
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,840
It's excessive, it's excessive.

167
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,280
Where's the card games?

168
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,760
Every four minutes-

169
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
The Blackadder stuff.

170
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,680
Every four minutes somebody jumps on a fucking grenade in that movie.

171
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
It's like they had this new like gut launching technology

172
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
that they were like really fucking psyched to use.

173
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
The problem with paintball is that

174
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,960
that no matter how tactically you get,

175
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
if you pull some sneaky shit and some cool shit and blast a bunch of people,

176
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
the problem with paintball is they are immediately able to comment

177
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040
on what you have done for them.

178
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,600
You know, in war, when you kill people in war,

179
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,240
I bet you probably feel guilty later.

180
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,280
But like in the immediate, you don't get people like,

181
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,200
oh man, come on.

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,160
Why did you do that?

183
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,280
Come on, man.

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,280
That's not cool.

185
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,160
We were all facing the other way and you came up behind the thing.

186
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,880
Oh man, come on.

187
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,280
It was Todd's birthday and you shot him.

188
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,680
You shot Todd on his birthday.

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,800
This was for him.

190
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,480
You ran me through with a bayonet off, man.

191
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,120
Come on.

192
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
Come on, man.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,360
You got me with the bayonet.

194
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,640
We were all marching forward in straight lines in our bright red coats

195
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,920
and you guys were just like hiding in the trees in the bushes and shit.

196
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,200
Oh man.

197
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,080
Man, you burned all our Johnny Cakes.

198
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
Come on, what a turd.

199
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
You shot my butt, dude.

200
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,720
Look at that turd.

201
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Those turds are using paint cannons and shooting a bunch of people at once.

202
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,040
Come on.

203
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
These blankets are just soaked in paint.

204
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
You just put paint all over the blankets.

205
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,320
Come on.

206
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,280
Come on.

207
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,840
I don't-

208
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
You're not supposed to go in the river.

209
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Come on, that's off limits.

210
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
They told us.

211
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,440
Do y'all want to know who?

212
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
Who? How come Civil War reenactors don't use fucking paintball guns?

213
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Wouldn't that be the sweetest?

214
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,160
Wouldn't that elevate Civil War reenactment if they were just like pop, pop, pop?

215
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,960
Like I know that you're feeling a little bit of that pain.

216
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,080
Like you want to get in it?

217
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,480
Get in it.

218
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,120
You want to get in it.

219
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,640
Yeah, you want to be in George Washington's fucking mindset?

220
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
Civil War hero George Washington.

221
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,640
You want to be in that mindset?

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,760
Okay, but there will be a cost, a pain cost.

223
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
It's going to sting you and zing you.

224
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,480
Have I told you guys my idea for a maybe billion dollar idea for war reenactments?

225
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
Oh, I thought you were just going to say war.

226
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,480
I'd be like no.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,280
No, it's a gun.

228
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,560
It's two guns attached front to back.

229
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
I call them pre-enactments.

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,600
And it's like future wars that you're staging and how you think they would go.

231
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
And it could go so far as to like, you know, the year 3017.

232
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,000
You know what I mean?

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,640
And it's like this is what I think war will be like in the future.

234
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,840
But the nice thing about pre-enactments is they can end however you want.

235
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,080
Oh, sure.

236
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,720
You don't have to feel like, just because maybe the, you know, the Union one,

237
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,360
that doesn't hold up in pre-enactments.

238
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,160
You could do whatever you want and it could be different every time.

239
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,720
Technically every time that two nerds are flying their drones close to each other

240
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
and then they crash into each other and fall to the ground,

241
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,520
that's technically a pre-enactment of the 3017 drone battles.

242
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,760
And it's also copyright infringement.

243
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
TMTMTO.

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
TMTM, drone battle, war reenactment.

245
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,160
And I think, Trav, we could do a pretty good job

246
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,720
accurately pre-enacting the next war with today's political stuff.

247
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
I don't follow what's going on.

248
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,320
Is there something going on?

249
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,800
A lot of it.

250
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,640
So here's another question.

251
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,440
It's a Yahoo question.

252
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,400
It's a Yahoo question.

253
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,320
I wanted to celebrate Science March,

254
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,880
which, Justin, you and Sydney and Chuck participated in.

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,840
Yes, is Science March, like, 420?

256
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,800
It was 422, actually.

257
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,300
Okay.

258
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
After sort of that good head buzz that worn off,

259
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,840
it's like, let's get out there and win one for science.

260
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,320
This one was sent in by Casey Mayer.

261
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,680
Thank you, Casey.

262
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
It's Yahoo Answers user question mark, who asks,

263
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,320
if all the birds in the world held on to a tree and fly up,

264
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,240
will the world move?

265
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,520
Science.

266
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,400
Damn.

267
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,120
Damn, dude.

268
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
This one would work for 420 or Science Day.

269
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,760
If all the birds in the world-

270
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,560
Grab one, it would have to be a big old tree.

271
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,600
Big, big, big tree.

272
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,320
Deep roots, right?

273
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,520
Not to yank them out of the ground.

274
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,440
Deep, deep, deep roots.

275
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
Here's the thing.

276
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,280
Here's the thing.

277
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm talking about a Yggdrasil situation.

278
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,440
I know the answer to this, I think, maybe.

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
But we often run into this.

280
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,320
I feel this urge to point out actual logical answers to this

281
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,960
because I know that there will be people on Twitter

282
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,560
after the episode goes up and says like,

283
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,800
I can't believe you guys didn't say blank.

284
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
But blank is really funny.

285
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
And everybody listening at home,

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,160
I know there are birds who eat other types of birds.

287
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,560
And so this sort of bird union would never happen.

288
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
I get it, but play with us.

289
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
Just have some fun.

290
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,840
Just play with me.

291
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,480
Like birds on birds on birds.

292
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,800
Like a bird that stands on another bird's shoulder.

293
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
Just because I don't know how big a tree you could find

294
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,320
that would have enough branch space.

295
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,680
But if the birds all kind of locked together, Voltron S-

296
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,880
Eagle holds the branch.

297
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
Hawk holds the eagle.

298
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Fucking pigeon holds the hawk.

299
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,920
Sparrow holds the pigeon.

300
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,980
Yes.

301
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,020
Yes.

302
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,320
And then now we're talking about eight wings.

303
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
That's a lot of torque.

304
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,960
That's a lot of lift.

305
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,460
Yeah.

306
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,440
Is there any actual answers?

307
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,520
Did anybody try to like be smart about it?

308
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,000
I mean, there's a lot of you'll rip the tree out of the ground

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,760
before it will apply for some-

310
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,260
Boo.

311
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,000
Boo.

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,640
Play with us.

313
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,200
Play with me.

314
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,160
Play with us.

315
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,200
If the birds were holding on to trees all over the world,

316
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,640
they'd be going against each other.

317
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,520
Yeah, no shit.

318
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,080
That was never even part of the fucking equation.

319
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,960
One tree.

320
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,160
One big Yggdrasil.

321
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,200
Yahoo Answers user Pranit says, an exciting question.

322
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,000
I agree.

323
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,480
An intriguing conundrum.

324
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,800
I think it can happen.

325
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,440
This could follow Newton's first law of motion,

326
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,000
which I think states that if a bunch of birds hold onto one tree,

327
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,280
they can fly the world away.

328
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,200
You know, there's a lot of people,

329
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
there's probably a lot of naysayers about that,

330
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,280
but there is a chance that after the Allfather,

331
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
creator of the Allspark,

332
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,440
finished creating the Earth and Cybertron simultaneously,

333
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
after the Allfather finished his work,

334
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
he was going over, he's like, everything looks good.

335
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
Everything looks good.

336
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
And then one of the Allangels came to him and said,

337
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,600
Allfather, what is-

338
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,680
And he's like, oh shit.

339
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
Oh God, damn it.

340
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,040
Yo, Allfather, you made a lot of birds.

341
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,560
Did you stop to think that maybe-

342
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,600
Shoot, there's a lot of them, huh?

343
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,680
I'll talk to one of the birds

344
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,080
to make sure at least one doesn't show up.

345
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,880
So I'll make Jerry the bird promise that he won't go.

346
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,440
It'll be fine.

347
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,440
I like to think that if these birds do accomplish this feat

348
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,320
and then Earth is tossed into a state of orbital decay

349
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,160
that leads to our agonizing march into the sun's molten core,

350
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,600
we really can't be too pissed off about that, right?

351
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,400
Because it's like, no human's ever done anything

352
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,200
that cool, birds.

353
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
Literally all of you came together

354
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
to hurl our planet into the sun.

355
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
This is coming back to the war on birds though.

356
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,840
That human bird war that we've been touching on

357
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,880
from time to time,

358
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,280
this is like the ultimate power play of the birds.

359
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,240
If we can't have this Earth, then let it be dust.

360
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,960
If we can't have this planet, no one can.

361
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Then let the big burning star in the sky have it.

362
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,560
I just so badly want to see the meeting of each leader

363
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,840
of every kind of bird all getting together

364
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
to vote on whether or not

365
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
they should all hurl the Earth into the sun

366
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
and there's something about that image

367
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
that just makes me so happy.

368
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
Just to see the hawks and the turkeys and,

369
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,840
well, turkeys don't fly.

370
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,360
Would a turkey, wait, hold on.

371
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh shit, shit, flightless birds.

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
Yes, flightless birds are going to,

373
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,240
especially, can I hit you with our main ally in this quest?

374
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,680
The Judas Iscariot for all bird kind is, of course, penguins.

375
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Penguins, yes.

376
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,040
Sorry, you want to throw it into the sun?

377
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
That's the opposite temperature we like.

378
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,480
I like the chilies.

379
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,680
So you're saying that while all the flying birds

380
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,120
are tugging on this tree,

381
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,040
there's going to be a bunch of ostriches down there

382
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
like, come on, gosh.

383
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,560
No.

384
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Come on, y'all, come on.

385
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,520
Damn, they'll actually all be laying on their backs

386
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
flapping their wings up.

387
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,760
Well, penguins will just be mating nonstop.

388
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
They're like, we got to make more penguins

389
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,640
weigh this motherfucker down.

390
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
There's a penguin nature special

391
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
narrated by David Tennant

392
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,680
and it's called Spies Amongst the Nest or something.

393
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,120
It's called Tuxedo Boys.

394
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,400
It's called Tuxedo Boys

395
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,800
where they've put a bunch of cameras

396
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,240
disguised as penguins in amongst the penguins.

397
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,040
And I bring this up because there are numerous,

398
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,600
numerous times where some penguin

399
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,760
will just try to mate with that camera.

400
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,160
Fuck yeah.

401
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,440
Like penguin, penguins is down.

402
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,160
Penguins are down.

403
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,720
I always say this, all dressed up and somewhere to go,

404
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,120
which is inside of David Tennant's secret camera.

405
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,880
Oh shit, I just realized in my office

406
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,560
that I've been working out of for about three years now,

407
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,960
there's been a completely stationary penguin

408
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,680
this entire time.

409
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,360
And I've never asked any questions about it,

410
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,800
but I'm starting to think David Tennant

411
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,240
is watching me do podcasting.

412
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,360
Well, don't ruin this.

413
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,040
I think I'm going to try to make love to this camera.

414
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,720
The only thing that gives me peace about this scenario

415
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,920
is if you do see the birds trying to pull this shit

416
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,240
and they will eventually, it's fine.

417
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,200
Someday they will.

418
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,800
The good news about it is you just throw

419
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,640
a pack of captain's wafers up there

420
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,880
and they're going to forget the whole enterprise.

421
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
No, hold the line.

422
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,560
If you threw one oyster cracker into that moss pit,

423
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,160
they would fucking dissolve.

424
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,200
No problem.

425
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,240
No problem at all.

426
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
Here's another question.

427
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,920
A few weeks ago, I had a dream that an actor

428
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,840
who I admire and think is attractive,

429
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
Chris Evans, wanted to have sex with me.

430
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
The problem is I turned him down,

431
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
saying that I was waiting until marriage to Chris Evans.

432
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
I have regretted this ever since.

433
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
I don't have any sort of significant other

434
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
that would have been cheating on my doing

435
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
with Chris Evans in my dream.

436
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
And if Chris Evans himself actually asked me

437
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
if I wanted to do it with him,

438
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,520
I would definitely say yes.

439
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
How could I write down his terrible mistake

440
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,760
awkwardly absent in Arkansas?

441
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Okay, I am with this on so many levels

442
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
because I feel like once a week,

443
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,200
I have a dream that is like a movie

444
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,280
that is building up to something.

445
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,800
In this case, Your Mind movie was a Chris Evans

446
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,320
amateur pornographic film.

447
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
Well, don't say amateur.

448
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,920
You don't know what the quality of this person's pornography is.

449
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,120
I mean, fucking if Chris Evans is in it,

450
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,160
it's definitely high budge.

451
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,200
Okay, that's fair, Travis.

452
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,880
But I have a movie where I find these fucking gloves

453
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,800
that let me fly around and give me super strength,

454
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,960
but the mad inventor of these gloves

455
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,040
needs me to train before he'll let me use them.

456
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,640
And so I go into his secret lair

457
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
and I fucking work my ass off

458
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080
just learning to use these power gloves.

459
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
And then the fucking big metal doors open

460
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,880
and I step outside like,

461
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
all right, time to fight some.

462
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,680
Hey, Griffin, the baby's crying.

463
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,480
You need to wake up.

464
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,040
And it's like, I just got the power gloves though.

465
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,080
Like once a week, Rachel will wake me up

466
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,920
because it'll be like, hey, can you go get the baby?

467
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,640
And I'll be like, but I just got the hover bike.

468
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,680
I just got the hover bike, just now.

469
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,480
I think the real concern here

470
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,880
that this person question asker didn't even address

471
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,440
is the issue of what if you were dealing

472
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
with like concurrent dreaming

473
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,040
and this was not just dream Chris Evans.

474
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,160
Oh my God, Travis.

475
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,040
But like real Chris Evans was also having this dream,

476
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,080
sharing this dream with you.

477
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,880
And then Chris Evans woke up like, no, oh man.

478
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,920
I would have liked to.

479
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,960
I would have done that.

480
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,360
Finally, I'd love to have sex.

481
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,240
I'd love to know what sex feels like on my wiener for once.

482
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
It just once, I, Chris Evans.

483
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,360
Sometimes in the movies, they make it pretend like we do,

484
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,000
but I've never actually had the wiener feel of sex before.

485
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,520
I just wanna do sex once where I'm not wearing my trunks

486
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,480
like I have to in the movies.

487
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,920
They make me wear my swim trunks

488
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
when I make sex in the movies.

489
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,760
And it's like, I'm always curious

490
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,200
about what if the trunks weren't there?

491
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
What would happen if you tried to have sex?

492
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
So Chris, it's time.

493
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
Are you ready to have sex?

494
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,240
Yeah, let me just get my trunks

495
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
and we'll get right to it.

496
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,000
Actually, Chris, you don't have to wear your trunks every time.

497
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,400
What?

498
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,960
Wait, huh?

499
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,760
Huh?

500
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,480
Huh?

501
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,920
I could do it without the trunks.

502
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
This is heartbreaking.

503
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,720
I don't, and what's really a bummer is you can't get back

504
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
into the Chris Evans sex situation.

505
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,160
You can't get the hover bike.

506
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,720
You can't always get, you can't always conjure up the gloves

507
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,840
because sometimes you lay down like,

508
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
all right, I'm gonna step back into my movie

509
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,000
and I'm gonna start with the power gloves.

510
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,880
It's a little cheat code.

511
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
And then you close your eyes

512
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,680
and all of a sudden you're having sex with Chris Evans.

513
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
You have to master lucid dreaming.

514
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,000
That's it, isn't it?

515
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,240
That's the only thing.

516
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,160
Now, here's a little factoid about the J-Man.

517
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,320
I did kickstart.

518
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,720
I am sort of on the forefront of this.

519
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,680
Oh, man.

520
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,480
I did kickstart a-

521
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,600
This is gonna be so rough.

522
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,840
What?

523
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,160
I'm just like holding onto the arms of my chair

524
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,640
in like preparation for this whack thing

525
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,080
that you've kickstarted.

526
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
I'm sort of on the forefront of this.

527
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,160
I did help to kickstart a lucid dreaming helmet

528
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,640
where it's sort of a band that will help you

529
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,040
to gain the ability to have lucid dreams.

530
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,480
It's called the Aurora.

531
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,720
And I'm sort of on the forefront

532
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,280
of this experimental technology.

533
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,040
The one thing about it is that we did sort of get over

534
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,760
that hump in late 2013, and I have not gotten...

535
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,480
Oh, shoot.

536
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,520
I haven't gotten...

537
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
I'm assuming it's still in testing

538
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,280
because I have not received my-

539
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,360
You gotta be careful with a product like this.

540
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,280
You don't wanna give somebody spooky dreams

541
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
with the wrong head crystals, Justin.

542
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,280
Justin, how do you know that you're not somewhere

543
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,640
asleep wearing it right now dreaming this?

544
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,680
Justin, I'm just a figment of your shit, dude.

545
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
This is all a dream, Justin.

546
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,080
You can have sex with Chris Evans, whatever you want.

547
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,040
Turn around.

548
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,720
Sorry, you think you are a successful podcaster?

549
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, God, how fucking rich.

550
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
In West Virginia?

551
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,360
In West Virginia, Justin, all of this

552
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,480
is just a weird buffalo wing you ate.

553
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,200
Don't you get it?

554
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,840
One thing is I am reviewing the emails I've received

555
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,200
about the Aurora over time, and the subject line

556
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,800
has now changed from initially it was Aurora,

557
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,680
the ultimate lucid dreaming tool, to the Aurora Dream Band,

558
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,880
the ultimate sleep aid.

559
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,680
So I am worried that maybe somewhere along the line

560
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,280
they realize that lucid dreaming may have been

561
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,720
flying too close to the sun.

562
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,600
It's not just that.

563
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,720
A sleep aid is the opposite of a lucid dreaming tool.

564
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,080
It's a placid dreaming.

565
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,560
It's an extremely placid dreaming tool now.

566
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,800
The next email you guys are just gonna say,

567
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,680
the Aurora headband, it kind of smells like lavender.

568
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,240
You'll like it.

569
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
You can use it to cover your eyes.

570
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,920
Aw, dang.

571
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,840
Aw, dang, that does help.

572
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,040
Please no one Google to find out how much that was.

573
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,040
Actually, legally, I'm putting a legal disclaimer on this.

574
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,680
Please, please don't Google that, okay?

575
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,080
I was really into lucid dreaming at the time, all right?

576
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,560
Thank you.

577
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,360
Did you ever pull it?

578
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,520
Thank you.

579
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,400
Did you ever get good at it?

580
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,000
I don't know, Griffin.

581
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't have the fucking band yet.

582
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,560
But I think they're gonna fulfill.

583
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,920
I have feel pretty good.

584
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,520
It's been about four years now.

585
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,760
I'm feeling good that we can't be that far away from this tech.

586
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,920
Yeah, $150 for the first early bird backers.

587
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,120
$160 for the later birds.

588
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
I would have loved to get on at that level.

589
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
$150 early bird sounds pretty sweet.

590
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,520
I probably have it by now.

591
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,720
Probably about $200 is probably what J-Dog spent on this.

592
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,920
And let me look at this thing.

593
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,640
I mean, it looks like a very shitty, very small Oculus Rift.

594
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,960
If you want, Justin, I could just paint the inside of some goggles black

595
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,480
and sell it to you for $120.

596
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,680
I could print out some fucking high res glossy JPEGs of Chris Evans

597
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,080
and just tape them onto some fucking scuba goggles

598
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,280
and put those on your eyes every night.

599
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,000
Pretty good to sleep.

600
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,920
Actually, I could just probably pay Chris Evans

601
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,840
to come hang out with you for a while if you want.

602
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,080
Yeah.

603
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,760
Should we go to the money zone

604
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,800
so you could recoup some of your lost sleep dream band finances?

605
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,520
Yeah, let's head in.

606
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,960
We're inside it now.

607
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,240
We're here.

608
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,120
Hi, money zone.

609
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,520
Hello.

610
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,400
Can I talk about me undies?

611
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,880
Please do.

612
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,680
Here's what's up with me undies.

613
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,640
I want you to take a personal inventory

614
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,280
of your wardrobe right now.

615
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,000
Something missing?

616
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,080
Something missing in your beautiful wardrobe?

617
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,440
I bet these soft modal underwears are missing from your body.

618
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,560
Me undies are the best underwear that you can get.

619
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
They deliver them right to your door.

620
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,000
It's made of sustainably sourced micro modal.

621
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,840
It's a fabric three times softer than cotton.

622
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
It's literally all I wear now.

623
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,600
I am fortunate enough to have replaced all of my bad garbage underwear.

624
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,360
That's not true.

625
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,840
I have one pair of boxers that I wear just because the whole...

626
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Just to remember the dark times.

627
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,720
Just to remember the dark times.

628
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
But sure enough, by the end of the day,

629
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,800
those things are just soaking wet and I don't know why, but not me undies.

630
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,960
Guess what?

631
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,760
Guess what, guys?

632
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,040
You can save time and money each month by getting a monthly subscription to me undies.

633
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,440
They send you the new me undies to your door and they have fun prints

634
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
and they're really sexy and cute.

635
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
If you don't want a subscription, that's fine.

636
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,840
You can still save because me undies is offering you 20% off your first pair.

637
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,120

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,720
Go to your underwear drawer, upend it, throw all that trash in there away

640
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
and put it, stuff that shit with me undies.

641
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,560

642

You're gonna love it.

644
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,600
I would like to tell you about a box of nature that I received.

645
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,800
They just send you a bunch of pine cones?

646
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,920
Yeah.

647
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,120
Oh God, it's great.

648
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,040
I think we've only made that joke eight times so far.

649
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,400
Are you talking about nature box?

650
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,200
Shut your dick.

651
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
Nature box is a long time friend of the show.

652
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,000
Hey, huff my shorts, Travis, if you're gonna be a balls about it.

653
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,240
They make great snacks that actually taste great and are better for you.

654
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,720
Listen, I'm a bit of a snack monster from time to time

655
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,640
and I don't mean like a cute, like Sesame Street, like, oh, me love snacks.

656
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,440
I mean like, my God, my God, what have you done?

657
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,920
Kind of snack monster.

658
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,000
And when nature box came in my life, it presented me a snacking opportunity

659
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,680
that didn't make me feel like shit for the rest of the day.

660
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,800
And I really appreciate that from nature box.

661
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,440
They make snacks that they don't have,

662
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,280
they're high quality ingredients that are free from artificial colors,

663
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
flavors or sweeteners.

664
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,440
So you don't have to feel bad about snacking.

665
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,200
And they have lots of different options, sweet, savory, spicy,

666
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,280
lots of different things for any snack preference you got.

667
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,760
And they've made their service even better.

668
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,560

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,880

676
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,240
It plays country music when you open it.

677
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,800
Plays country music that may or may not be DJed by our dad

678
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,240
depending on when you open it.

679
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,680
Our dad's a country music DJ.

680
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,040
Yeah, I think folks get it at this point.

681
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,720
Okay, because if they don't know that,

682
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,240
what I have just said is even weirder than it is on the surface.

683
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,200
It is on the surface.

684
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,280
I've got a personal message here.

685
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,560
It's for Charlie, Nicole, Justin, and Brittany, and it's from Nelson.

686
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,400
And there's an exclamation point.

687
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,080
So that was the exact right reading.

688
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,640
Thanks for introducing me to these good, good brothers.

689
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,040
Our annual NOLA trip was a blast.

690
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,960
Can't wait to do it again next year.

691
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,760
Thank you, brothers.

692
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,520
Well, you're very welcome.

693
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,240
You're very welcome.

694
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,360
Where was my invite?

695
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,240
I would love to get down to NOLA and chill with y'all.

696
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Do you think you're the Justin in this message?

697
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,120
I did not go to NOLA.

698
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
I have not been to NOLA.

699
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,920
Oh, y'all, we got to get to NOLA.

700
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,240
We got to get to NOLA.

701
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,800
Hey, what would a NOLA show be like for us?

702
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,160
We should do a NOLA show.

703
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,400
We should definitely go and do a NOLA show, huh?

704
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,520
You know where else I want to do a show now?

705
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,880
Because I was just there, Atlanta.

706
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,600
Atlanta, we can knock those both out in one trip.

707
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,320
Not a big deal.

708
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,240
Not even a big deal.

709
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,440
Can we also do one in Savannah or is that too close to Atlanta?

710
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,320
Oh, I love that.

711
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,440
Get down to Tybee.

712
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,240
Get down to Tybee for a fucking just beach vacation bash.

713
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
Get down to that island life.

714
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,680
I would love to do a fucking show with the beach in the background

715
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,280
and just the waves behind me.

716
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,920
Just like getting powered by that.

717
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,760
I'd love to do a show with the Beach Boys

718
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
where I'm just playing drums for them.

719
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,720
I would love to do that with the Beach Boys together.

720
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,120
Yeah, I love that.

721
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,320
Just us and the Beach Boys.

722
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,040
What a better pairing could there be?

723
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,080
Alexi, Alexi, are you listening?

724
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,520
It's me, Justin.

725
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,280
I have a message for you, Alexi.

726
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,840
It's from Allie, Ash, Ollie, and Natalie.

727
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,840
Hey, Alexi.

728
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,360
We all love you very much

729
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,760
and we wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

730
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,920
Thank you for rolling into our lives

731
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,960
and making us laugh about pooping your baby diaper

732
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,640
while playing Fallout 4.

733
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,000
We're so jazzed that a literal angel brought you to us

734
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,840
with all the joy and support you've given us

735
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,720
in just a few months.

736
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,400
We love you, baby boy.

737
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
That is so sweet.

738
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,560
And that's for Alexi.

739
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,080
It's a happy birthday, Alexi.

740
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,520
What?

741
00:33:59,520 --> 00:33:59,920
Is it?

742
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,400
Sometimes, sometimes, some crimes

743
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,240
go slipping through the cracks.

744
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,760
Do you think that this is for an actual baby

745
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,440
or all of these just inside jokes for a grown person?

746
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,840
You know, I hope not

747
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,400
because Fallout 4 was rated

748
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,800
by the Entertainment Software Review Board

749
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
as being M for mature audiences

750
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,040
because of graphic violence and probably cussing.

751
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,280
And if a baby played it,

752
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,640
it would literally ruin that.

753
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,080
It would literally ruin that baby.

754
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,480
That baby would be, yeah, worthless at that point.

755
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,680
Because right from the beginning,

756
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,560
if a baby was there,

757
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,840
when everybody's running around like,

758
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,920
fuck, a bomb, it would be like,

759
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,000
whoa, hold on, babies shouldn't be hearing that.

760
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,640
And they'd be like,

761
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
fuck, all this radiation everywhere

762
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,480
made these fucking ants so big.

763
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
And then the ant bites you in the torso

764
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,160
and you just hacksaw ridge all over the place.

765
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,720
You can't let a baby see that shit.

766
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,160
Are you easily confused

767
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,880
by terms like cultural appropriation,

768
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,640
cisgender, and woke?

769
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,160
Or maybe you find yourself

770
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
constantly explaining terms like these

771
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,440
and you need a place to vent.

772
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,920
Do you have a love for all things

773
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
pop culture, social commentary, and politics?

774
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,760
Sounds like you need Minority Corner.

775
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,480
Where you can learn, laugh, and play.

776
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
Sounds like blues clues.

777
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,200
Only it's more black, gay, and ladylike.

778
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
James and Anika will happily administer

779
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,880
your weekly dose each and every Friday.

780
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
You can listen on Maximum Fun

781
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,840
or wherever you get your podcast.

782
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,800
Minority Corner.

783
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,520
With a K.

784
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,280
Because the C was taken.

785
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
This one was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

786
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,600
Game recognized game, Rachel Sperling, thank you.

787
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Alkexis who says,

788
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,920
is it weird if two strangers had a mutual agreement

789
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,240
to lean on each other on a plane?

790
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,400
Lehin, you're on a long flight.

791
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,680
Is it weird to ask the passenger

792
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,200
sitting next to you before you take off

793
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,520
if you could lean on them to sleep

794
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
and they could lean on you?

795
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,080
Would you take this offer?

796
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
Well, no.

797
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,400
Because if you're both leaning on each other,

798
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,240
you're getting only half the lean.

799
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,960
Well, okay, hold on.

800
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,180
So.

801
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,240
Because you'd be forming an equilateral triangle

802
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
where you wanna do, is it isosceles?

803
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,360
You wanna lean all the way over with them sitting

804
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,280
at like a 90, they're straight up and down

805
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,240
and you're leaning against them.

806
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,680
So you're getting maximum lean.

807
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,280
Maybe you trade off, maybe take turns leaning.

808
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,800
How long is the flight?

809
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,640
Like there are a lot of factors here.

810
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
How tall is the person?

811
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,240
What angle are you gonna be leaning at?

812
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,280
You know what I mean?

813
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,960
Is their head on top of your head?

814
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,080
How poofy is their hair?

815
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,360
How poofy is your hair?

816
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,560
And then there's accessory questions.

817
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,240
Do they have padded shoulder pads?

818
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,720
That would be like a comfy pillow for you to lay on.

819
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
Big dangly earrings that might get caught in your beard.

820
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,760
Do they have some sort of cheek stink

821
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,960
that you don't wanna be close to?

822
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,720
The problem with this is I'm a fidgeter.

823
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
What if I finish the game I'm enjoying

824
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,680
on my Nintendo Switch and I need, not want,

825
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,360
I need to play some more Knights of the Old Republic

826
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,840
on my iPad, a very old video game

827
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,880
that I'm currently enjoying.

828
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,120
What if I need to do that?

829
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,880
Do I tell them like, excuse me,

830
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,640
I have an important announcement.

831
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
Excuse me, I have some important news

832
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
about our arrangement.

833
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
It's changed, the game is changed.

834
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
Oh, that's the ultimate, isn't it?

835
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's lean on each other.

836
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,120
I'll go first.

837
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,320
And then you do it.

838
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,080
And then you're like, what are you doing?

839
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,320
Excuse me, flight attendant,

840
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,080
look at what this person's done to me.

841
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,480
The fucking most brutal betrayal.

842
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
I love that shit.

843
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,400
I get uncomfortable if my elbow touches

844
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,920
the other person's elbow.

845
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,880
So I don't know.

846
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,560
And then let me be clear,

847
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
not because I have a problem with contact

848
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,840
with another human being.

849
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,120
I feel bad being in someone,

850
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,920
it makes me feel like Shrek the Ogre

851
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,200
to like just go-

852
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,840
Now which one is that?

853
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
Swamping through the world.

854
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
He's the big green one with the horns,

855
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,520
with like his head, it looks like trumpets.

856
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,400
And I feel bad moving through the world

857
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,120
just putting my elbows against other people

858
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,280
and saying, this is my space now.

859
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,720
I'm taking this armrest.

860
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,360
I'm gonna lean on you and drool on your tweed coat.

861
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,880
But this makes me feel bad.

862
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
I want you to imagine you're on that flight

863
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,560
to Hong Kong, about 13 hours.

864
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,120
You are wiped out.

865
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,640
13 hours is such a long time to be seated.

866
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,080
And so you don't have this conversation

867
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,200
with your neighbors because it would be uncomfortable.

868
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,800
But then you look at the people in front of you

869
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,680
and they are full blown Bubba Gump,

870
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,920
person TP together with each other.

871
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,280
And you think like, fuck, that looks nice.

872
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,840
Cause they're getting the best sleep of their lives

873
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,240
touching a stranger and they're gonna get to Hong Kong

874
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,200
and they're gonna be all refreshed.

875
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
And you are not because you were afraid

876
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,240
to have this conversation.

877
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,240
I had a wonderful moment.

878
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,640
I think it was when I was flying back from Portland.

879
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,040
It was near the end of the boarding process

880
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
and there was a seat.

881
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,840
It was a three across seat.

882
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,880
And I was at the window and my neighbor

883
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,760
was in the middle seat and no one was in the aisle seat.

884
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,120
And what I realized through body language,

885
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,360
both of us were just staring at the door.

886
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,240
And as soon as the flight attendant closed the door

887
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,760
and that seat was still empty,

888
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,800
they were in the aisle seat a nanosecond later

889
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,600
without any, and we didn't communicate about it.

890
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
It was not like if that seat stays open,

891
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,720
we take this seat and we share it.

892
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
Half is your empty space and have it.

893
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,440
They did it.

894
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,040
And all I wanted to do was turn towards them

895
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,200
and be like, yes, you've done it.

896
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
You saw it, thank you.

897
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,000
It was just such an amazing,

898
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,320
where it's like there are good people in the world.

899
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,960
There are still good people in the world.

900
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,800
There is kindness, yes.

901
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,640
I gotta read this Yahoo answer response

902
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,440
from Bluebell BKK who says,

903
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
I once traveled with a man I didn't know,

904
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,000
but who turned out in preliminary conversation

905
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
to be the friend of a friend of mine.

906
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,360
Why is it that people on Yahoo Answers

907
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
talk like they're from another fucking planet?

908
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,240
In preliminary conversation, he was at the window,

909
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,120
I was on the aisle and there was an empty seat between us.

910
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,920
We agreed that we would both put our feet up

911
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,160
on the spare seat for extra comfort

912
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,880
and not worry if our legs happened to touch.

913
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,040
We traveled comfortably for the six hour flight.

914
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,480
How did this convo go down?

915
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,720
I'm gonna put my feet up and you can do it too.

916
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,440
And listen, odds are my gams,

917
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
your pegs gonna touch.

918
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,480
We might hit some turbulence

919
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
and it might just become a leg milkshake.

920
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,560
We might have a little calf to calf contact.

921
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
Is that gonna be cool with you?

922
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,880
It's cool with me.

923
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,960
If it's fine with you, let me know.

924
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
Little calf to calf, that's a good touch.

925
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,320
That's an unfair deal for the person on the aisle

926
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,360
because if you're against the window,

927
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,560
you can lean your back against the window

928
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,080
and put your feet up in the seat.

929
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,560
But if you're in the aisle,

930
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,640
you're just like leaning into the aisle

931
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,600
to put your feet up.

932
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,080
Ready to get your head touched by butts

933
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,400
and genitals nonstop over and over again.

934
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,560
And just be killed by the drink cart.

935
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,400
Decapitated by a drink cart.

936
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,280
The aisle should be the only seat on an airplane.

937
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,440
There shouldn't be other seats that aren't,

938
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,320
I do not understand people with a window preference

939
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,120
on an airplane.

940
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,120
Why is your preference to,

941
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,080
especially if your flight is longer than 45 minutes long,

942
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I cannot fathom being locked in a human prison.

943
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,520
Hey, you know how much you like social interactions?

944
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,200
How would you like to be forced to have two of them

945
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,360
and everyone knows that you're going to take a shit?

946
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,400
You have to time it out

947
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,040
and anticipate the person coming out of the bathroom.

948
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,920
That's the brutal part.

949
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,560
Because if you make it to the aisle

950
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,480
and someone has just stepped in the bathroom,

951
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,680
you have to sit back down in the most sheepish like,

952
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,360
well, I guess I missed it.

953
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,280
I was three deep in the window

954
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,320
on my flight back from New York on Friday.

955
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,920
Three deep on the window.

956
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,000
And I immediately recognized this was a problem for me

957
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,320
and where I'm at as a person on Earth today.

958
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,440
I sat down, put on that good Delta screen.

959
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,120
I turned around, saw the movies.

960
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,440
Oh, Fantastic Beasts and How to Get All of Them.

961
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,120
Fucking great.

962
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,000
Tuned in.

963
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,720
How to Catch Them All.

964
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,480
The whole time I'm watching Eddie Redman do his business.

965
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,200
And collect all these wonderful beats.

966
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,480
The whole time I'm thinking like,

967
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
piss sounds pretty good right about now.

968
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,880
And so I had to ask these people,

969
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,200
one of whom had a bottle of wine that they just opened

970
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,160
and it sat out on their tray

971
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,080
and the other one was doing important work

972
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,000
on their laptop that they had sat on the tray.

973
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
I was like, hey, I need to disrupt

974
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,280
both of your guys' whole shit for like 10 minutes

975
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,160
and don't get comfortable

976
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
because you know I'm going to be coming back.

977
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,760
And so I did my business.

978
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,560
I came back to sit down to enjoy Eddie Redman

979
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,600
and I'm not kidding, I put the earbuds back in my ears

980
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,720
and I press play on the movie

981
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,600
and almost instantly I started panicking about like,

982
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,960
I know I'm going to need to piss again

983
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,920
before this flight is up

984
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,200
and it's all I could think about.

985
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,280
Like, I just watched Colin Farrell

986
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,800
do his acting up on the screen

987
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,640
and Eddie Redman do his thing up on the screen

988
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,600
and the whole time I'm like,

989
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,680
I wish I could enjoy this beast capture movie

990
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,440
but the whole time it's just like,

991
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,640
when's that next piss going to come?

992
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,840
And sure enough, it did.

993
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,280
And I had to be like, I'm so sick.

994
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,320
One person was like building a model ship

995
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,440
on their fucking thing

996
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,160
and one of them was painting like an anime mech model

997
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,320
and I was like, I need you to put all the caps back

998
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,920
on your mini jars of acrylic paint

999
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,160
so I can go take my second piss in an hour.

1000
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,840
Three deep in the window, dude.

1001
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,480
Never again.

1002
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,780
Shit.

1003
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,600
Can we all just agree?

1004
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,880
Can we agree from now on

1005
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,720
if the person in the window seat gets up

1006
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,920
to go to the bathroom,

1007
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,720
everybody fucking mad had a tea party,

1008
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,600
change places, scoot one seat over, rotate.

1009
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,120
Oh shit, that's good.

1010
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,920
If you have to get up to go to the bathroom,

1011
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,600
then you've earned the aisle seat

1012
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,560
because you've proven yourself

1013
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,680
the bathroom user of the group.

1014
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,280
I'm the worst.

1015
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,400
I would be the worst person on like a red,

1016
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,480
I would never want to be next to me on a red eye

1017
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
because if I'm on a red eye flight,

1018
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,520
I'm going to sleep.

1019
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,560
That's a whole production.

1020
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,520
One, I'm in the aisle

1021
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,640
and then I'm full sensory deprivation chamber

1022
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,480
wrapping myself in blankets,

1023
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
mask on, noise canceling.

1024
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,960
You're fucking 11 floating in the saltwater tank.

1025
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,120
You are not getting, shit your pants.

1026
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,080
You're not getting past me.

1027
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,640
Shit your pants.

1028
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,680
I'm in the upside down.

1029
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,480
Fuck off.

1030
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:36,980
No way.

1031
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,920
I can't sleep on a plane.

1032
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,200
So if you're next to me on a red light,

1033
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,400
you'll just hear me occasionally go,

1034
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,440
I hate this.

1035
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,920
I hate this so much.

1036
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,080
And enough airplane humor, I think.

1037
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,920
What's the deal with the food?

1038
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,480
Am I right?

1039
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,780
Yeah.

1040
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,280
Yeah, that's our airplane jokes.

1041
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,160
Today I texted my partner to pick up cat litter

1042
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,200
while she was out.

1043
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,600
Only problem is I didn't text her.

1044
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,760
I texted the service department at the dealership

1045
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,200
where my car is being repaired.

1046
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,840
There's a reason for this.

1047
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,960
This is too long to read.

1048
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,600
I may or may not have included several poop emojis.

1049
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,840
They replied asking what brand.

1050
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,240
Then after I tried to laugh it off with a low whoops,

1051
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,560
they doubled down and said they would go get the cat litter

1052
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,060
for me.

1053
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,800
I haven't responded and I'm supposed to pick up my car

1054
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,200
tomorrow and I'm terrified that they'll bring it up.

1055
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,680
Or worse, maybe they did get the litter.

1056
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,480
Should I say yes to their offer?

1057
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
Should I just cut my losses and forget about my car?

1058
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,800
Please help.

1059
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,880
That's from Scooping Scat in St. Petersburg.

1060
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,380
Wow.

1061
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,400
That's a good car dealership.

1062
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,880
That's a very, well, yeah, no, it's not.

1063
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,600
Because they spent, what, $6 on this box of cat litter

1064
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,760
and you come in to pick it up and then you bought it

1065
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,800
for the rest of your life.

1066
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,760
You continue to buy your $20,000 automobile.

1067
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,360
This is a very small investment.

1068
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,200
I'm surprised they don't do shit like this more often.

1069
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,000
I never got a text from my Volkswagen dealership like,

1070
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,960
hey, sorry, we lied to you and oops,

1071
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,080
you're going to have to go through a bunch of stuff.

1072
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,640
Can we bring you some hot dogs?

1073
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,520
I would fucking, yeah, that'd be great actually.

1074
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,880
Bring it on by.

1075
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,240
If I relate to question asking this because,

1076
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,520
because my thought if somebody was like,

1077
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,560
no, we'll get it.

1078
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,040
All I can think is like, okay, that's what you say.

1079
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,280
But are you all just like sitting in like the repair bay

1080
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,280
just fucking laughing your faces off at how stupid I am?

1081
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,560
And I'm going to roll up and you're all,

1082
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,200
you're going to be all smiles and you're going to hand me

1083
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,280
my, you know, tidy cat or whatever.

1084
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,360
But I'm going to like, what am I?

1085
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,680
I'm going to say thank you and be grateful to you

1086
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,000
while you just cackled about how dumb I was

1087
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,440
to send you this text and like, I won't know

1088
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,880
and you won't say and it'll be kind of weird.

1089
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,040
But what if I show up and it's not there?

1090
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,280
Do I be like, hey, where's my cat?

1091
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,600
You can't roll up to any sort of car dealership

1092
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,360
and be like, where's my cat litter?

1093
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,680
It's like, this is a car dealership.

1094
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,160
My cat's been holding her piss for 24 hours

1095
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,960
just waiting for this.

1096
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,600
My apartment reeks of piss and shit.

1097
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,720
Where's my cat litter?

1098
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
Like, this is a Mazda dealership.

1099
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,400
I would be so worried that they would get the wrong,

1100
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,840
even if it's the right brand,

1101
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,520
they wouldn't get the exact right.

1102
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,080
My babies are very particular

1103
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,920
about their Dr. Elsley's cat attract

1104
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,480
that they enjoy using and I really would not want to trust.

1105
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,160
I can't find it in local stores, if you know what I mean.

1106
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,000
I can't find it in the big box, some of the big boxes

1107
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,720
because my babies are very particular about

1108
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,920
where they do their thing.

1109
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,640
Travis, please tell me what you do, Travis,

1110
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,800
because I no longer want to continue talking about what I do

1111
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,920
in a funny joke way.

1112
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,160
The one thing I was hoping while I was talking about that

1113
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,800
is fuck, I hope Travis has something to tell me

1114
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,080
about cat litter because I am just mid-sentence

1115
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,680
and I don't know how to finish it.

1116
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,360
What do people put me in a sentence?

1117
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,720
Well, the one thing, Trav, I really was hoping that you would-

1118
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,920
Justin, imagine my relief.

1119
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,880
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

1120
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,400
Imagine my relief that my brother Travis was there

1121
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,160
to help me out of the sentence I was in.

1122
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,960
You're welcome.

1123
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,680
You are welcome.

1124
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,360
I was a few clauses in.

1125
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,800
What was next, a preposition?

1126
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,240
Alley-oop this ball for you.

1127
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,960
Interjection?

1128
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,840
I had no idea.

1129
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,840
So happy that Travis is here to deliver me.

1130
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,320
So please, I'm all ears, Travis.

1131
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,760
Travis, I get the tiny cat, the one with the black lid

1132
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,400
that is like multiple cat strength,

1133
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,080
even though I only have the one pretty tiny cat

1134
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,360
because, and I don't know why everyone doesn't do this,

1135
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,480
I don't want to smell my cat's piss and shit.

1136
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,280
So why wouldn't I get the one that's four times as powerful

1137
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,760
at masking odors as the basic one?

1138
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,920
Because your fucking cat lowers,

1139
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,960
your cat lowers their bung a little bit too much

1140
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,040
into that stuff and it just dissolves.

1141
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,560
They are corroded.

1142
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,760
What are you talking about?

1143
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,200
I don't understand why everybody just doesn't get

1144
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,040
nuclear waste for their cats to shit in

1145
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,720
that the cat will essentially dissolve in

1146
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,560
as soon as it looks or touches it.

1147
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,160
What are you talking about?

1148
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
I tried to do lavender scented once

1149
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,680
and the cat was not fucking having it at all.

1150
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,480
She was like, hey, this is my shit dirt.

1151
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,600
What are you doing?

1152
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,680
Do you think that I, a cat out in nature,

1153
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,080
would just find some lavender sand?

1154
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,120
Come on.

1155
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,080
I'm gonna exercise my, I'm exercising my veto power

1156
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,400
right now because I want to hear about

1157
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,720
where Justin gets his fancy cat litter for his babies.

1158
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,760
Take that, take that, rewind it back.

1159
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,040
In 2014, I kickstarted a brand new kind of cat litter.

1160
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,080
I'm still waiting.

1161
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,560
It's not here yet, but they say it's very good for cats

1162
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,560
and it helps them have lucid dreams.

1163
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,440
Yeah, lucid dreaming litter.

1164
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,640
See, this is why it's good sometimes

1165
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,480
when Travis interrupts me because then I had time

1166
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,720
to think of that very funny joke.

1167
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,320
It wasn't, sorry, sorry listeners.

1168
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,440
That one wasn't true.

1169
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:11,120
You just got zinged by a joking J-Man, the jokester.

1170
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,480
Jokes is back in the room.

1171
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,400
He was actually in the corner the entire time.

1172
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
He slipped in while Travis so rudely interrupted me

1173
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,720
as he often does.

1174
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,600
That's why I did it.

1175
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,720
I covered for him.

1176
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,280
Thanks, Jokes.

1177
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,760
I have to say non-funny things for a couple minutes

1178
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,240
so Jokes can have a sip of his coffee

1179
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,000
and put his paper down and really just sit there

1180
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,600
for a minute and think about,

1181
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,760
and then he hands a note card to Justin

1182
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,480
with kitty litter that facilitates lucid dreaming on it.

1183
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,320
Justin's like, thank you, Jokes,

1184
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,800
and Jokes just kind of nods and then leaves.

1185
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,760
Jokes has been kind of a prima donna lately.

1186
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,040
I think we've hit a certain level of notoriety

1187
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,720
that Jokes feels like they can kind of push us around

1188
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,080
a little bit, sort of like the Friends cast.

1189
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,880
You know what I mean?

1190
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,480
I'm not fucking stepping foot into the studio

1191
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,520
for less than 20 Gs.

1192
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,000
Can I read this Yahoo?

1193
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,120
Yeah, please.

1194
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,000
It's from Maddie Miller.

1195
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,560
Thank you, Maddie.

1196
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,120
It's from Yahoo!

1197
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,720
Mancers user.

1198
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,720
They are anonymous, but I'll call them.

1199
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:15,920
Ross asks, am I allowed to hold dance classes

1200
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,080
in the sewer?

1201
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,560
I want to start teaching contemporary dance

1202
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,880
and was wanting to teach it in an area that's private

1203
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,800
so my students wouldn't feel embarrassed,

1204
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,400
but I can't afford to rent a building

1205
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,320
and thought the sewers would be a great place

1206
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,760
to hold the classes at.

1207
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,000
I just wanted to know if you are allowed to do it.

1208
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,080
This isn't real.

1209
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,600
There's no way, I'm sorry.

1210
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,160
Sometimes people get a little rambunctious

1211
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,720
on oath answers and they say things

1212
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,920
that I don't think are true.

1213
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,760
And to me, I think this is a joke.

1214
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,360
There is one scenario in which this might be real, Justin.

1215
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,720
This person-

1216
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,280
Uh, teach you Ninja Turtles dance classes.

1217
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,400
No, but also that.

1218
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,160
But this person, they're thinking,

1219
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,440
oh, would I hold these underground dance classes

1220
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,520
and then maybe they watch that scene from Guys and Dolls.

1221
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,080
Yes.

1222
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,720
And would they have the craps game in the sewer

1223
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,760
in the biggest fucking like pipe distribution-

1224
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,600
Coolest sewer ever.

1225
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,800
Yeah, and they're like,

1226
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,400
underground dance classes underground, of course.

1227
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,000
Let me hit you with three arguments.

1228
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,760
Three arguments.

1229
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,840
One is free real estate down there.

1230
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,560
It's the sewers and you don't have to worry about it.

1231
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,880
It's the sewers and you don't have to worry about it.

1232
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,720
Can I go open up a manhole cover

1233
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,960
and just go subterranean and like, I'm cool?

1234
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,160
I'm cool down there, right?

1235
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,360
Nobody's gonna, what are you doing?

1236
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,800
Hey, what are you doing in the sewers?

1237
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,320
It's like, it's the sewers.

1238
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,520
It's the sewers, I'm just down here.

1239
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,200
Am I not allowed to be down here?

1240
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,800
It's just like a sidewalk underground.

1241
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,600
It's the sewers.

1242
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,720
Let me keep doing my dance class.

1243
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,800
Number two, contemporary dance.

1244
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,000
Justin, you're telling me the sewers is not a dope ass place.

1245
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,440
You're telling me fucking Travis Wall

1246
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,240
has not fucking choreographed a sewer-based dance.

1247
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,320
You're out of your mind, of course he has.

1248
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,800
Number three, all that tapping and shuffling

1249
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,160
is gonna sound pretty good echoing down

1250
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,040
those long, long sewer hallways, whatever those are called.

1251
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
So I think maybe go fuck yourself.

1252
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Here's the thing, Justin.

1253
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,080
Justin, Justin, you might not understand this,

1254
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,520
but there are two things legally no one owns.

1255
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,600
And that is the sky and the sewers.

1256
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:19,840
Yes.

1257
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,080
Nobody owns the sewers.

1258
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,840
They've just always been there.

1259
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,960
They've always been there.

1260
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,120
Carrying our ship, carrying our ship from us,

1261
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,680
waiting for me to do my cool dances in it.

1262
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,200
So Justin, your rebuttal about how this is a fake joke, please.

1263
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,960
Now that I think about it,

1264
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,560
it would be pretty great to be doing all of my moves.

1265
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,560
And then when the choreographer's like,

1266
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,400
where did you learn steps like that?

1267
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,280
I look at him all haughty and I'm like, the sewer?

1268
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,360
That's where I got it, of course.

1269
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,480
Now, I will say this.

1270
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,720
You're doing your step ball change

1271
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,240
and you ball change into a human turd.

1272
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,240
End of dance, end of career.

1273
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,440
This is not ideal.

1274
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,280
This is not ideal.

1275
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,200
Travis Wall would be like, why did you fall down?

1276
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,440
And be like, Travis, I have a pretty good reason for this one.

1277
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,960
Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, not Nigel Farage.

1278
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,600
Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel Thornberry is like,

1279
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,960
it was a good dance until you totally stepped on

1280
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,640
and hacksaw ridged that turd,

1281
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,320
that human turd all over the place.

1282
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,000
And it was rough stuff.

1283
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,200
It was really rough and tough.

1284
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Me, Nigel, and Paul.

1285
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,320
I love your style.

1286
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,760
I love your moves.

1287
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,480
It does constantly look like you're on high alert

1288
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,480
to step in human dookie.

1289
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,600
Paul is like, I kind of like when you made the turd explode

1290
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,680
by dancing, stepping on it really hard.

1291
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,040
I kind of liked it.

1292
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,000
It was very evocative.

1293
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,760
It added to Travis's choreography.

1294
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,320
I'm here for my audition.

1295
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,440
Oh, good, come on in.

1296
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,720
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

1297
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,320
Yes, it's going to be very good.

1298
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,400
The one thing is to help me get comfortable.

1299
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,480
I was wondering if I could spread human feces

1300
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,920
and McDonald's wrappers all over the floor of this place

1301
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,920
so I can do the dancing good.

1302
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,040
Because that's how I hit my marks.

1303
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,640
Of course.

1304
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,680
Of course, of course.

1305
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,360
Why would you even ask?

1306
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,760
This is dance.

1307
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,120
That's my favorite scene in Center Stage, by the way.

1308
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,080
Where they teach that class about how to hit your poop marks.

1309
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,760
I've seen Center Stage way too many times in my life.

1310
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,800
It doesn't sound like you actually have maybe at all.

1311
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,200
Yeah, maybe not even once.

1312
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,680
It's been a while.

1313
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,360
I have a hard time remembering if there's a scene where they dance on turds or not.

1314
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,800
It's in the director's cut.

1315
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,080
I wouldn't Google that, folks.

1316
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,160
That's gonna lead you down to dark rabbit holes.

1317
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,240
Just leave that as a mystery for the ages.

1318
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,040
Dark rabbit holes is another good place to teach dance.

1319
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,520
Yeah, it's true.

1320
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,120
Hey, rabbits, clear out.

1321
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,840
Time to boogie.

1322
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,240
I think, let's call it there.

1323
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,840
Let's say that that's an entire episode of our podcast program.

1324
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,640
Thank you so much for listening to it.

1325
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,920
We very much appreciate you.

1326
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,840
We always do.

1327
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,240
Here's one we haven't asked about in a while.

1328
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,880
If you enjoy our program and you would like to help other people enjoy it,

1329
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,560
one of the best ways you can do that is go to iTunes and find our podcast

1330
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,800
and leave us a rating and ideally a review if you enjoy the program

1331
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,680
because a lot of podcast visibility is determined by that.

1332
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,760
And a bunch of y'all have been kind enough to do that recently.

1333
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:39,840
But if you have not done that, it would really be great if you would do that.

1334
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,000
I'm just gonna tell a few recent people.

1335
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,720
Ali P. said, fun show.

1336
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,640
God Away Carson said, I didn't like it, but now I pay for it.

1337
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,640
So I don't know what that is.

1338
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,240
Ha Ha Zombies, good goose from some good boys.

1339
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,280
A lot of great reviews in there.

1340
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,800
If you could leave us one of those, that would just be the best.

1341
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,600
Thank you so much.

1342
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,320
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

1343
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,920
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1344
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,200
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1345
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,120
I say this every week, but it really is fucking super, super good.

1346
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,400
I was listening to some non It's a Departure tracks off that album the other day

1347
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,200
and it's just front to back, it's all bangers.

1348
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,080
I wanna do a quick, we're on the maximumfun.org network.

1349
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,560
I wanna do a quick plug for one of the shows on the network

1350
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,480
that's been crushing it lately called We Got This,

1351
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,280
where they try to settle a debate.

1352
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,720
Very recently, you could hear Ted Leo talk about the best breakfast cereal

1353
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,160
and Weird Al Yankovic talk about the best Money Python song.

1354
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,040
Like come on.

1355
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:47,440
I'm also on an episode, me and Ben Blacker talk about Batman or Superman.

1356
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:54,320
I am team Superman and I get real ganged up on by Mr. Gagliardi and Mr. Blacker.

1357
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,080
It is an unfair show for liars and cheats and swindlers.

1358
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,000
But it's a great program, so go listen to We Got This.

1359
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,240
If you wanna find all the shows that McElroy's work on,

1360
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,080
we have a website called McElroyShows.com.

1361
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,160
It also has our PO box, mailing addresses, email addresses.

1362
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,200
And I also, I realized that with all those shows we do,

1363
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,480
it might get a little confusing.

1364
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,120
So I made a handy dandy weekly schedule of like release,

1365
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,360
what day of the week shows come out on,

1366
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,680
so you can tell people and direct them towards that,

1367
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,840
if that might be helpful to you.

1368
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,880
McElroyShows.com.

1369
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,160
And let's see.

1370
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,080
Oh, Jonah Ray is gonna be on the show.

1371
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,160
You probably know him from a bunch of stuff, but mostly.

1372
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,960
He has recently started the new Mystery Sense Theater 3000 reboot,

1373
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,640
which is awesome.

1374
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,840
And I have watched a bunch of episodes and thoroughly enjoy it.

1375
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,040
So if you have questions for him,

1376
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,000
we know that one of his topics is going to be zombies and zombie related questions.

1377
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,240
We'll probably have additional topics that we will tweet about.

1378
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,640
But if you're thinking about zombie related questions,

1379
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,000
go ahead and email those in now.

1380
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,840
And just put Jonah somewhere in the subject line.

1381
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,480
What else?

1382
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,720
Oh, oh, oh, and start getting in your questions

1383
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,200
for the Austin live show in a month.

1384
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,200
Yeah, so if you've got those questions,

1385
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,000
start sending them in with Austin live show in the subject.

1386
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,720
All right.

1387
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,480
I'm gonna be doing this Thursday.

1388
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,320
I'm gonna be at the Columbus Podcast Festival.

1389
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
Doing, we're doing Still Buffering,

1390
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,920
Court Appointed and Sawbones on Thursday at the Columbus Podcast Festival.

1391
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,280
So come on out.

1392
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,040
Come, just Google that and you'll find the place to buy a ticket.

1393
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,400
Tickets are not bad.

1394
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,440
They're like $10.

1395
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,240
It's a two night event.

1396
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,920
But if you, it's $10 for one night, $20 for two nights.

1397
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,200
So come on out.

1398
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,920
That's gonna be fun.

1399
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,240
Do y'all want a final?

1400
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:48,560
Yes.

1401
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,200

1402
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,280

00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1406
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,520
Sorry, something's going wrong.

00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,880
But we'll call them Charles.

1408
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,240
Charles asks,

1409
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,120

1410
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,960

They do say piss a lot in that one.

1414
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,600
This has been my brother, my brother.

1415
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,400
May kiss your dad.

1416
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,360
Square on the lips.

1417
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:46,880
