1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:45,120
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,800
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me to an advice show for the modern era,

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,840
and we on that time creep. If by we on that time creep you mean that this episode is going to be

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,520
hurried and rushed because I overslept by exactly one Gregorian hour,

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,440
then yeah, that's an accurate thing to say. I actually sprung forward two days,

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,680
and I had to run back to catch this episode. I also don't understand how time works.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,320
Or introductions, either of you, so that's a great.

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,320
I actually introduced myself, but I did it in the hour that we lost, so no one will ever hear it.

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,560
I wish that that's how it worked. I wish that literally it was just an hour of time

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,960
edited out of the universe. It was for me last night trying to go to bed,

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,280
and it's like, ah, two, that seems, oops, three, nope, bad, did it bad.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,840
You know, any crimes you commit in the witching hour, which is what it's called,

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,040
you get away with, but then it comes back to haunt you in the reverse witching hour,

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,920
which you have to live over twice. So just keep that in mind.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Can we just stop it?

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,680
It's really fucking silly.

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,560
Completely made up bullshit, is that what you mean?

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,640
It really rams home the fact that time itself and our measurement of it is absolute horse shit.

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,960
Not just time, right? All measurements.

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,240
All measurements are made up.

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,000
All measurements. Money, fucking, it's a, you know, man, the man, right?

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,720
Like business and politics, and like, Wall Street's not looking out for me,

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,040
and my bank, no thank you. My bank, I don't want it.

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
You know what I'm talking about? Like, savings and loans.

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,600
Yeah, right, exactly.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,480
I don't know what's going on.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,680
The government man is taking your time away, and he eats it.

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,080
Is this Obama's fault? Is Obama hoarding my time?

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
Do you know where that hour you lose goes?

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,400
It goes straight to the 1%, and they go out on a yacht, and they spend all the poor people time.

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,640
That's like that Justin Timberlake movie where they have the time in their arm,

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,240
and when it runs out, they die.

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
Where they keep looking at their watches.

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,840
And then Justin Timberlake is like, I'm going to instill a change in this unfair world,

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
and he does it with the power of his song and dance.

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,960
No, you haven't seen it, have you?

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
I did not see the film.

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,280
It's called Time to Sing and Dance.

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
Man, his new album's not very good.

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,920
Welcome to our pop music review cast.

45
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
Welcome to a music show.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Did you guys introduce yourself? Did you say your names?

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm still Travis.

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
I am now and will always be Travis.

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
This is an advice show, so let's-

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm Griffin.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,840
Let's do that.

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,120
We're brothers.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm in college and recently had my first one night stand.

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,880
We were both pretty drunk and pretty-

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,600
Stop it. Stop it. You creepo.

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,840
Dear Penthouse, I never thought it would happen to me.

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
I had sex with a girl.

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
It was great.

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,600
Pretty drunk and it was pretty clean.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,240
Stop it. What is this yo-yo creepy voice?

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,040
Stop doing it.

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
One night only thing.

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
We parted without exchanging numbers or even adding each other on Facebook.

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
Problem is I'm going to a party in the next few weeks

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,040
and I know the girl will be there.

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
I really want to go because it's a good friend's party

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,760
and I don't want to miss it just to avoid her,

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,840
but I really don't want to act when I see her.

69
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Do I just act like nothing happened?

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Do I acknowledge it in some way?

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,920
How do I stop it from being awkward?

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,000
And that's from Awkward in Adelaide.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Awkward in Adelaide.

74
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Imagine my surprise to find that casual sex among acquaintances

75
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,560
can cause complications.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
What do you know?

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,200
Who could have seen this coming?

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,520
Did you not see the two films that were literally identical shot for shot

79
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,600
that came out in like the same week?

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
Friends with Benefits and then the other one that was like Friends with Benefits.

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
Mm-hmm. Acquaintances with Bonuses.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
Friends with Dental, I think is what it is.

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,320
Yeah, this sucks.

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
Also, why do you think we would know?

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Yeah, man.

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,540
Yeah.

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,400
Dear my Bim Bam, I don't know the proper way to polish all of my ivory.

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,800
I don't know either.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,840
Regata Magazine.

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,360
I mean you...

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,680
Okay, I think that if you are cool,

92
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,240
it is safe to assume that this person is also cool.

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
There's no reason to attach or I think maybe you can project

94
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,480
some sort of emotional connection that this person had or didn't have.

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Like I don't think you need to assume.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,400
They wrote into an internet advice podcast though to add

97
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
this is how concerned they are when the cool ship sailed

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,320
and then was boarded by pirates and burned into the ocean.

99
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,000
No, I'm not saying that this person is aboard the SS Cool.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,520
I'm saying that if they're worrying about it and if they're worrying about it,

101
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,960
they're assuming that the other person is more emotionally invested than they are.

102
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
And considering that they've made no effort to contact you,

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,920
maybe the dick wasn't that good for them.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,500
Wow.

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Justin.

106
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
So I guess what Justin's point is that you're really bad at sex.

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,680
Maybe the more pressing concern is that you have not had any repeat business

108
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
to the dick store.

109
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
Maybe is the thing that you should worry about.

110
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,040
Dear my bim-bam, there's this guy who did not give it to me right

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
and then I'm gonna see him at a party.

112
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,440
Do I tell him?

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
No, you don't.

114
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
Please don't tell that man.

115
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,800
You tell everyone else.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
Tell everyone else and warn them that he's not gonna give you the dick right.

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,000
This seems...

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,120
This seems... I think that we foster a kind of a rapport with our community,

119
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,280
which usually, typically, it does not involve us making fun of their dicks.

120
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,320
Okay, fair enough.

121
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,880
You can get...

122
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,000
Your balls are weird.

123
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
Why don't you go to extremechains.com and get a bigger dick to put on your dick.

124
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,960
Just put it on top of it.

125
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
It's like a dick suit for your dick.

126
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
Like Dick Kighton.

127
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,920
Dick Kighton was the greatest college football coach this country has ever seen.

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,240
And I will take that to my grave.

129
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,480
Dick Kighton, I love you.

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,320
You're like a second father to me.

131
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Go blue and orange.

132
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,600
I think what you definitely...

133
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
You definitely don't want to act like it didn't happen.

134
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,280
That's...

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
That seems awfully cruel to give her the,

136
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
oh, do I know you?

137
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
Like, that's bad.

138
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,480
That's what Dick Kighton would call shutting in the punt.

139
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:51,600
The problem with your unsatisfying lovemaking is that you did not shunt it in the punt.

140
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,160
That's what she was waiting for.

141
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,520
That's like her favorite thing.

142
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,880
It's 2013, man.

143
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,360
Everybody's shunting in the punt.

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,320
You just assume that there should be some punt shunting.

145
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,640
One with hope, right?

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Between friends.

147
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,640
It's such an innocuous phrase until viewed through the lens of coitus.

148
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,680
I think that you...

149
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
I think that you should not worry about it.

150
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
You gotta be confident.

151
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,680
Cool and confident.

152
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,120
This person's giving you no reason.

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,160
If they were calling and, you know, there was some relationship that had ended here,

154
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,800
I could see it.

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,640
But like, you had casual one night stand sex and no one wanted to reach out afterwards.

156
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,720
Or maybe she was waiting for you too and she was heartbroken that you didn't.

157
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,960
There's really no way of knowing until you just go to the party and find out.

158
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,360
And maybe while you're there, ask her if the dick was good.

159
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
Just I'm saying, just ask.

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,280
Give her a comment card to fill out.

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,120
God.

162
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,600
I wanted to let you get back to the party, but if you could just take this brief survey.

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
Let me get my clipboard.

164
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Bit of advice.

165
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Bit of advice.

166
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Give it on a scale of one to ten because one to five leaves so little room for specificity.

167
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,720
Because, you know, like there's such a big difference between a seven and an eight.

168
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,440
But if it's a five scale, I'm just saying that on your sex comment cards, make it one to ten people.

169
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
I actually use a 100 point scale.

170
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,200
So the convert the conversion over to Metacritic is more like it's more equal.

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
You know what I mean?

172
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,320
That is nice.

173
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
You have an opportunity.

174
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
You might be able to turn this into a two night stand.

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,200
And then how I met your mother.

176
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,160
And then you're married.

177
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,680
Now I know what you're thinking.

178
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,080
What is he thinking?

179
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
He's thinking, I thought this was a casual one night stand,

180
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,160
but it could be a casual like one thousand night stand.

181
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
Maybe you could just casually keep having sex and then casually

182
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
have kids together and casually grow old together.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
Just keep it totally casually.

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,400
Get on each other's health insurance.

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Casually die side by side like in the end of the notebook.

186
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,440
Where are you going to bury me?

187
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,920
I don't know.

188
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,360
I don't want to get tied down.

189
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Make a big deal out of this.

190
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm just dying next to you.

191
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,880
We're just getting we have two graves that happen to be adjacent.

192
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
It doesn't mean anything.

193
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,360
Listen, you're free to die next to somebody else too.

194
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,000
If you want.

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
I am too.

196
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,680
It's free.

197
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,240
It's open.

198
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
It's easy.

199
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Breezy.

200
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,720
Beautiful.

201
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,120
Yes, absolutely.

202
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,240
How about this one?

203
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
It's sent by Ira Ray.

204
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,360
Are you Ira Ray?

205
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,360
That was good.

206
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,800
You were in good form today.

207
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,040
Thanks.

208
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rose who asks.

209
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,040
Any ideas on how a dog should carry the rings for a simple beach wedding?

210
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,440
My fiancee and I are planning to have a simple beach wedding.

211
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,160
We love dogs and want our dog to be the ring bearer.

212
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm just looking for ways she can carry the rings without using a pillow.

213
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,160
I really want to put the rings in a ball or something.

214
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,800
Has anyone heard or seen how a ball, stick, rope can be used for this purpose?

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
Any other creative ideas?

216
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
Thank you for your input.

217
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,920
How big are your dog's nipples?

218
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Oh, good question.

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,160
Bad question.

220
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,520
The worst question.

221
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,440
The anti-question is what it is.

222
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
Have your dog eat the rings and then shit them out in front of you.

223
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,760
A little bit, everybody.

224
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,200
One second.

225
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,760
Don't look at her.

226
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,880
If you look at her, she won't do it.

227
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
I'm giving you a sneak preview of Hangover 3.

228
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
Just everybody relax.

229
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
This is total nonsense.

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,960
We love dogs and we love farcical sitcom scenarios.

231
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,840
There's just so many fucking variables.

232
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:38,000
You spent so much time, because I know, because I'm deep in the shit of planning this special

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,720
day, so much time and money, and then you're going to leave one of the more important

234
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,240
aspects of the ceremony completely to chance to your stupid ass dog.

235
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,740
Yep.

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,840
This is, like, Chase and I have had a couple different conversations about this.

237
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,000
We've opted out of Flower Girl.

238
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,160
We've opted out of, like, Ring Bear for this very reason.

239
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,240
When have you ever been to a wedding and seen either a dog or a child just seem super excited

240
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,120
to be participating?

241
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,160
Or when have you ever left a wedding where a child, or Christ forbid a dog, carries the

242
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,560
rings down the aisle and after the wedding you were like, man, that thing went off without

243
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,040
a hitch.

244
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,440
Right?

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
That was a ship.

246
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
That train was running right on time.

247
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,080
They were definitely not crying or peeing on anything.

248
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,800
They got those rings down to their intended target in a quick, efficient, and honestly

249
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,080
professional manner.

250
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,320
And their mother definitely didn't have to carry them down the aisle and make it seem

251
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
just like child torture.

252
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, when have they even made it to the end of their job?

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,360
Even if they had done really shitty, I've never seen a child make it all the way down

254
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,160
the aisle.

255
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
They always have to, like, fucking lie down.

256
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,960
Take a nap right there.

257
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,400
And then you gotta wait for half an hour until they're done with their nap while everyone

258
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,920
stays really quiet.

259
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,360
It's not your wedding anymore.

260
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,520
It's Stevie's wedding.

261
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
It's Stevie's nap.

262
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,640
And then Stevie has to get married to the dog that's the ring bearer.

263
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,880
Yeah, you're having your wedding on the beach.

264
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,080
That in and of itself is already a high risk.

265
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,840
High seagull.

266
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,520
Yeah, that's it.

267
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,240
That's it.

268
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,080
A human being, it can close, they can retract their fingers over the rings when a seagull

269
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,160
comes up hunting.

270
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
A dog has no recourse.

271
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
A dog will just sit there.

272
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,600
That would be an epic battle.

273
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,240
Ring bearer dog versus flock of seagulls.

274
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,920
This is the biggest problem with dogs that we've dulled their instincts against seagulls

275
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,520
of protecting rings.

276
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,920
So you're saying you need to get a wolf to be your ring bearer.

277
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,600
When dog wolves, when wolves came over on the boat from Egypt, they were originally

278
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,480
bred to defend rings from avians, more pterodactyls in those days.

279
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,960
But that was the original use of dogs.

280
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,240
And we have just beaten that out of them with years of potty training and beatings.

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,680
So I think what you gotta do is you gotta double up.

282
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,040
You get a dog, ring bearer, and then you get a falcon security guard for the dog.

283
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,520
Okay.

284
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,800
And maybe the falcon can ride on the dog.

285
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,360
Maybe you wanna be, oh, it's gonna be hard to get that ring over that falconer's glove.

286
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I guess if you use it in your offhand.

287
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
The priest has to do the falcon.

288
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,420
Okay.

289
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,800
Well, but then again, you're trying to get people out of the ceremony to the party as

290
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,520
quick as you can.

291
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,320
Well, see, then the falcon sets in on crowd control.

292
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,160
And you say, falcon, if anyone hesitates, go for the eyeballs.

293
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,480
If anyone gets up to, this is taking too long.

294
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,280
I'm saying, squee!

295
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,640
Okay.

296
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, I guess I can-

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
God, if you could get a falcon attack somewhere into your wedding.

298
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,960
No, everyone would have to stop weddings.

299
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,320
We'd have to be like, well, and that was how weddings ended.

300
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
The end.

301
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Because it would be, no one would ever be able to top a falcon attack at your wedding.

302
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Plus, pay for the honeymoon with that America's Funniest Home Video dough.

303
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,920
Thanks, Tom Bergeron.

304
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,280
I don't think Tom Bergeron would endorse a video where a falcon attacked an old woman

305
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,320
in the face.

306
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
I don't think that's chuckle-worthy.

307
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,360
And now America's Serious Home Videos.

308
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
Everyone bow your head for a moment.

309
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,480
Oh, I would watch that show.

310
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,520
I would watch that too.

311
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,440
I would have to say that Man Sits Quietly in the Corner was the most serious video tonight.

312
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,480
$10,000.

313
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,600
You guys have not watched much AFV lately.

314
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,440
This show is so desperate for anyone, anyone to shoot video of anything.

315
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:53,920
When this show debuted, everyone's dad had a video camera the size of like a stationary

316
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,800
bicycle slung over their shoulder.

317
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,640
Everyone was filming everything.

318
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,200
Now, do you know how hard it is to do that show and just avoid thinking about YouTube

319
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,400
for 30 minutes?

320
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,960
Like to try to forget?

321
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,280
Which leads to awkward situations and Tom's like, hey everybody, have you seen this Star

322
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,000
Wars kid?

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,920
You're going to love the cut of this little kid's gym.

324
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,880
He's got a little pole.

325
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,080
He's like, it's Jedi.

326
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
There's $10,000 Star Wars kid.

327
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm 30.

328
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,280
I am a lawyer.

329
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,240
Thank you.

330
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
I will use this for my startup.

331
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
It's called YouTube 2.

332
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,640
It's the next one.

333
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,680
If you don't have a ring bear, how do you do the rings?

334
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
I guess just the best man and the best woman?

335
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,240
Like just have them?

336
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,760
If I understand correctly, the ring bearers have not been actually carrying the rings

337
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,960
for a long time.

338
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,640
I think that they've got dummies.

339
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,760
Yeah, they got a dummy pillow.

340
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,960
Because it's usually like a little kid that you wouldn't trust with thousands of dollars.

341
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,440
But why?

342
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
This is a little kid that draws on the wall.

343
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,080
You're going to give him the only thing that makes you married?

344
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,880
Yeah, well, yeah, no, you're right.

345
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,760
That is the only.

346
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,560
Right?

347
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,360
That's it.

348
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,560
They're like power rings.

349
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,880
It's like the ring, it is like the one ring.

350
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
If it falls off, you're not married anymore.

351
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
That's what I'm saying.

352
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah.

353
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,280
Although, to be fair, if a baby ring bearer did take my rings and throw them into Mordor,

354
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,840
I think that I would have to honor that.

355
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,240
Oh, yeah.

356
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,200
I'd have to say, okay, baby.

357
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,560
Well, that's, you got me there.

358
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:28,960
That's a good one.

359
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
If the baby puts the ring on, you're married to the baby.

360
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
Yeah, it's a tricky situation.

361
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,840
It is.

362
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,440
Then the fuzz can get you.

363
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,520
You can argue entrapment, but if that baby put that ring on of his own free will,

364
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,560
you don't have a fucking leg.

365
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,360
Listen, I mean, it's the same if the dog puts the ring on.

366
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,760
I mean, you're dealing with a powder keg one way or the other.

367
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Well, unless you're in, there are several states where that would be fine.

368
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,680
If a baby puts the one ring on, you're not finding that bastard ever again.

369
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,640
He's gone.

370
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,240
If you see a baby put the one ring on, you better open every bag of flour you can find

371
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
and just start throwing it in the air.

372
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,320
In the off chance that some of the flakes will land on his curls, so you can maybe see some

373
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,360
sort of silhouette.

374
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Because if not, you will never find that baby again.

375
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,800
Babies don't want to be caught.

376
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,920
Baby's invisible now.

377
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,720
He's happy.

378
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,360
He's out there.

379
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,080
He's living life.

380
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,120
Precious.

381
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,560
So right now, I'm writing the script to Hollow Man 3.

382
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,840
It's sort of like Hollow Man, you know, Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon.

383
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,240
But what if instead of Kevin Bacon, we put some Baby's Day Out heat in there?

384
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,740
Okay.

385
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,180
So that's all I've got so far.

386
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,580
That's the start of the goof.

387
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,620
I've only got the one paragraph.

388
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,300
You've got a great elevator pitch.

389
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,820
Now you just need to flush it out.

390
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,540
Yeah, I've seen more scripts picked up on spec for less than that.

391
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,500
The good news is-

392
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,300
Son of the Mask was just like four words.

393
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,980
It was just like, mask, but with kids.

394
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,420
Following the adventures of an invisible baby would be a cost-effective movie, I think.

395
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,780
Well, you guys can't see this, but boy howdy.

396
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,540
It is hilarious.

397
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,820
This is a precarious situation.

398
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,900
All you see is the cookie jar just fell over.

399
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,780
But what you didn't see was the hour of antics leading up to it.

400
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,340
If you can get a baby to wrap itself in bandages and put on sunglasses,

401
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,100
like in memoirs of an invisible man, you might have a box office smash.

402
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,460
Or if you have an invisible baby walk into a lady's bathroom,

403
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,820
watch her take a shower like in Hollow Man, then you're an evil person.

404
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,940
In this movie that I'm also acting as cast director,

405
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,260
I gotta get Daniel Day-Lewis as the invisible bandit.

406
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
I think that you guys are trying to write a comedy,

407
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,500
and I'm writing the worst horror movie ever.

408
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,620
Yeah, because all my favorite comedies star Daniel Day-Lewis.

409
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,300
My left foot, my left-

410
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,900
My left giant foot.

411
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,180
My left can't stop laughing, too.

412
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,380
I didn't know how he would do playing Mo, Larry, and Curly,

413
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,540
but once they got all the computer effects in there,

414
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,220
you really could not tell that it was just him.

415
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,460
And I loved him in There Will Be Blood in Feces.

416
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,700
Yeah, because that is more serious.

417
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,420
You moved away from comedy.

418
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,300
You moved-

419
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm laughing.

420
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,340
He was in Last of the Lolhekens.

421
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,220
Is that appropriate?

422
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,740
Is that a thing we can do?

423
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,740
I think that the sequel to There Will Be Blood

424
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,020
would just be called Milkshakes.

425
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,060
It's just him, and he's been acquitted for the murder

426
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,140
that takes place at the end of There Will Be Blood.

427
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,100
He's been acquitted, and he opens up his own milkshake stand

428
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,980
and gets in all kinds of milkshakes.

429
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,700
But then a rival milkshake stand opens across the street,

430
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,140
and they have to have a dance-off.

431
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,260
And then he burns it the fuck down and kills the guy's kid.

432
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,380
Two stars.

433
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,940
Two stars.

434
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,060
Would not watch again.

435
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,460
Let's do another question here.

436
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,540
When I met my girlfriend a few years back,

437
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,420
I inherited a load of her friends, most of whom are cool.

438
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,500
There are two in particular who we've especially-

439
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
sorry, who we're especially close to.

440
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,820
We see them regularly,

441
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,460
and they are awesome people to hang out with.

442
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,180
The trouble is that they both insist on calling me

443
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,180
by my surname all the time, which really pisses me off.

444
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
I don't think my surname is particularly odd,

445
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,460
so it's not like it's embarrassing to be called in public,

446
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,540
but it's still not how I like to be addressed.

447
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,220
They even write it on birthday cards, which is really bizarre.

448
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,780
And I've never introduced myself by just my surname,

449
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,020
and no one else insists on calling me by it,

450
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,260
so I don't know where this comes from.

451
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,460
Am I wrong for getting so annoyed at this?

452
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,100
How do I tell them to stop it without coming across

453
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,660
like a massive dick and upsetting two of my best friends?

454
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,460
And that's from Miss Nomar in Manchester.

455
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,940
I don't get it.

456
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,060
To me, I think calling somebody by their surname

457
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,540
is like the ultimate endearment ever.

458
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,820
You know, in college, I would say like half of our friends

459
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,740
were just called by their surnames.

460
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,060
Yeah.

461
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Like I had so many friends that were just-

462
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,540
I knew them as that, like I was known as McElroy.

463
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,460
It was really weird when I'd come home from school

464
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,580
and people would call me Travis.

465
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,820
It really kind of threw me off for four years.

466
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,420
I don't see anything wrong with it.

467
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,940
Well, but he doesn't like it.

468
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,100
I mean, it's irrelevant.

469
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,460
He doesn't dig on it.

470
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,900
But it sounds like a personal problem,

471
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,220
because once you have a name, you know,

472
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,700
once you become like,

473
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,060
ah, it's Nut Chuckles, then like you're Nut Chuckles,

474
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,140
and there's nothing you can do to reverse that.

475
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,780
I don't know why you'd be called Nut Chuckles.

476
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,980
Pardon, are you saying his last name is Nut Chuckles?

477
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,660
No, I'm saying like, that's a nickname.

478
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,140
But like, regardless, if your name is Carl,

479
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,220
and people call you Carl, you can't be like,

480
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,860
guys, I'd actually prefer to be called by my surname,

481
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,140
which is Nut Chuckles.

482
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,380
Well, I'm fucking confusing the whole thing.

483
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,460
Once you introduce the idea, I think that once you say,

484
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,020
like, I don't like that name, I like this other name,

485
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,340
you've either A, like absolutely,

486
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,180
if it was me, you would have absolutely submitted that

487
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,860
from now until the end of time,

488
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,380
that is what you will be referred to.

489
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,020
Or two, it's gonna be this weird thing,

490
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,220
where they'll call you Nut Chuckles,

491
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,260
and then, oh, I'm sorry, Daniel.

492
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,540
Right.

493
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,020
It's gonna be awkward.

494
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,900
Daniel Day-Lewis.

495
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,500
Daniel Day-Lewis Nut Chuckles is the thing.

496
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,940
The time to bring this up was a million times ago

497
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,380
when they first said it.

498
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,880
Yeah.

499
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,520
Yeah, because now it's like,

500
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,720
why, I've been doing this for years.

501
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,200
Right?

502
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,360
I've been calling you Nut Chuckles for years,

503
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,800
and now I'm just a dick.

504
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,760
You've gotta just one day, out of nowhere, just snap.

505
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
Stop it!

506
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,560
Stop it, no!

507
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,720
Just stop!

508
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,560
Start the sentence with, for the last time.

509
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,280
And they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

510
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,760
And you're like, I have told you guys a million times.

511
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,240
You haven't told us any, any times!

512
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,160
It is David, it has always been David,

513
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,440
it will always be David.

514
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,840
I would say that if they're not doing it maliciously,

515
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,400
if there's nothing, like if you didn't ask them not to,

516
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,360
and they keep doing it,

517
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,480
in any way getting upset about it or saying something,

518
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,280
it's just gonna make them feel awful.

519
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,320
It's gonna make them feel bad.

520
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,120
It's not gonna be worth it.

521
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,320
Just suck it up.

522
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,240
You can get used to anything, trust me.

523
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,280
Whether it's being called, not chuckles,

524
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,880
or the butt, or anything.

525
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,480
You can get used to anything.

526
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,240
Those are your two examples?

527
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Not chuckles or the butt?

528
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,480
I don't think, are you saying you can get used

529
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,920
to being called the butt,

530
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
or were you saying something far more?

531
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,760
No, you can just get used to the butt.

532
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,720
You get used to that stuff.

533
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,200
Oh, okay.

534
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,920
You get used to the butt.

535
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,640
You get used to the butt.

536
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,720
Take it from me, ladies, and so inclined gentlemen,

537
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,520
you get used to the butt.

538
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,360
You get used to the butt.

539
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,880
And some dogs.

540
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,800
And some dogs.

541
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,920
And some dogs.

542
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,600
And chairs.

543
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,480
Do you guys want to go to the Money Zone?

544
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,960
Yeah.

545
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,080
Trav, you got this message here.

546
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,360
Who's it for?

547
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,280
It's from my dear friend, Andrew Mead.

548
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,120
I didn't know you two were so close.

549
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,560
Oh, super tight.

550
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,000
Who's the message from, though?

551
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,440
That's the real question.

552
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,080
Oh, it's from some jokers, Michael Pertil and Tyron Bicknell.

553
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,280
I don't know who they are,

554
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,920
but they claim to know my dear friend, Andrew Mead.

555
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,040
Sound like they on some Game of Thrones shit with those names.

556
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,600
I like that.

557
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,560
Yeah, which, are you House Bicknell or House Pertil?

558
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,520
Dear Endazzle, I'm assuming that's their nickname for Andrew.

559
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,720
I don't call him that.

560
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,760
Happy birthday.

561
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,200
Good luck in the new year.

562
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,520
May your lightsaber always ignite to full strength

563
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,120
so you can open her blast doors.

564
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,320
You're a true match tonight, Ty and Mike.

565
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,520
Is the lightsaber his dick?

566
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,200
Good one, Trav.

567
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,560
I think you really pieced that one together.

568
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,920
Good job, Columbo.

569
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,720
Thank you.

570
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,680
One more thing.

571
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,760
Is the lightsaber your dick?

572
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,240
Yeah.

573
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,200
Ma'am, if I may.

574
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
If I may.

575
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,040
One more thing, ma'am.

576
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,680
One more thing.

577
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, the blaster was her vagina.

578
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,720
End of episode.

579
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,400
Get that man out of here.

580
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,160
That's the shortest best friend I'm sorry.

581
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,040
I just wanna, let's talk more about her vagina.

582
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,280
Get out of here, Columbo.

583
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,080
Jesus, my mother is dying over it.

584
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,200
No, I just wanna, what was it about the lightsaber dick again?

585
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,480
I wear a trenchcoat.

586
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,520
What did you expect?

587
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm so close.

588
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,000
Look at this eye.

589
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,760
I have both moral and physiological reservations about this happy birthday message.

590
00:26:49,400 --> 00:27:01,080
Because it's never been my experience, I don't wanna get too blue, but he's saying that you're boner.

591
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,800
I hope that, first of all, this is a public radio kind of thing.

592
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,640
So like there's a lot of people listening.

593
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,200
You just hope that your friend can get his dick hard enough to give you a boner.

594
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,400
Hard enough to get inside of a vagina.

595
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,040
And you made it worse.

596
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,480
I think the greatest sin is you made us complicit in that.

597
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,560
That's what I think really stings here.

598
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,920
You made us complicit in wishing your friend's dick hard.

599
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,160
It is a breach of trust.

600
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,600
Yes, Travis, that's correct.

601
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,040
Speaking of getting your dick hard to get inside of a vagina.

602
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,520
That was, by the way, possibly the most fluid transition.

603
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,600
Except for this thing that I'm saying right now.

604
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,800
That was the most fluid transition.

605
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,000
Until we acknowledged it.

606
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,960
It was pretty sweet.

607
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,080
You can head over to ExtremeStrengths.com and get yourself a penis pump kit.

608
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,080
You can put it on your wiener and then it goes suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.

609
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
And it gets you some penis gains.

610
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,120
And some Chris gains.

611
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,320
And some performance.

612
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,640
The penis pump, you can program it to play Chris gains.

613
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,960
To scare your boner away forever.

614
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
You'll sit there so confused.

615
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Why does he have a soul patch?

616
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,920
Why does he have a soul patch?

617
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,080
This motherfucker looks exactly like Garth Brooks.

618
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,360
Ah, my dick's gone.

619
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,080
My dick ran away.

620
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,280
Bye, dick.

621
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,120
See ya, dick.

622
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,520
They have so many pleasure tools for you.

623
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,600
We need to decide on a new coupon code.

624
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,280
I know, what's the new coupon code?

625
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,360
Our last coupon code.

626
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,120
By the way, guys, we love you.

627
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,280
Don't fucking leak this shit.

628
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,880
Because we leaked, somebody leaked midlist to coupon sites.

629
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,360
And now we gotta start over with a new coupon code.

630
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,080
And we're gonna forget and keep saying midlist.

631
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,880
And everyone's gonna be sad.

632
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,600
And listen, leaking is a serious issue.

633
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:56,840
Yeah.

634
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,440
So let me recommend a butt plug.

635
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,200
Available.

636
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,080
Sydney said that I couldn't use Pontifex.

637
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,200
Yeah.

638
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Well, she's a good Catholic.

639
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,560
How?

640
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,000
So it doesn't make any sense.

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,200
Just pick a word now, Justin.

642
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,920
Look around the room.

643
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,760
Pick a word that has nothing to do with the show.

644
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,720
Jumbo condoms.

645
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,840
I'm just looking around the room.

646
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,040
Man in the corner.

647
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,320
My good friend Dana Carvey.

648
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,240
Did you guys know I'm good friends with Dana Carvey?

649
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,880
It's not a big deal.

650
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,760
I don't like talking about it.

651
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,840
But I am really good friends with Dana Carvey.

652
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,040
Sports car keys.

653
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,920
Peebo Bryson.

654
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,320
He's here.

655
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,200
Sex trophies.

656
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,320
Mel Brooks.

657
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,600
Melva toast.

658
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,120
Melva toast.

659
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,280
So just type in the coupon code Melva toast.

660
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,000
You get 20% off all of your bread goods.

661
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,320
Okay.

662
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,040
I got a great.

663
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,080
I got the coupon code.

664
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,720
You ready for this?

665
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,600
Yes.

666
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,440
Garfield.

667
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,880
How about sexy Garfield?

668
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,160
Use a coupon code sexy Garfield.

669
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,240
All one word.

670
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,040
All one word.

671
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,640
Wait, what is actually the coupon code?

672
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,600
Sexy Garfield.

673
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,080
Okay.

674
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,160

00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,520
And you're going to save 20%.

676
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,320
All one word.

677
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,920
You're going to save 20% on all your, I don't know, whatever weird thing you buy.

678
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,600
You can save 20% on it.

679
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,800
No matter how weird you are, you still like to save money.

680
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
And that's what you're going to do at Extreme Machinists.com.

681
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,160
It's an adult superstore.

682
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,120
Get there.

683
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,160
Use the coupon code sexy Garfield and save yourself 20%.

684
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,800
Let's move on.

685
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,280
Hey, everybody.

686
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,480
My name is Dave Shamka.

687
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,520
And I'm Graham Clark.

688
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,800
And we are the hosts of a show called Stop Podcasting Yourself,

689
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,520
right here on the Maximumfun.org network.

690
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,680
We're the first ever Canadian podcast to win a Canadian comedy award for best podcast.

691
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,360
I think we went with that too early.

692
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,720
I think we seem braggy.

693
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,040
It's a weekly comedy show, a very easygoing chat between Dave, myself, guests.

694
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,920
We'll talk about things that we've overheard during the week and also Hulk Hogan.

695
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,280
Stop Podcasting Yourself.

696
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,640

697
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,960
You guys want a Yahoo?

698
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,440
Yeah, I do.

699
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,560
This Yahoo was sent in by John Davis.

700
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,200
No, it wasn't.

701
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,960
It was.

702
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,840
Big fan of the show.

703
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,640
Big fan of the show.

704
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,320
Please don't use sexy Garfields.

705
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,000
I can't believe that just happened.

706
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,040
Is John Davis the Garfield guy?

707
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,540
Yeah.

708
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,120
Of course he is.

709
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,680
Jim Davis.

710
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,320
Jim Davis.

711
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,720
Yeah, that's right.

712
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,920
Jim Davis is the Garfield.

713
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,440
His friends call him John.

714
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,940
Okay.

715
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lord Donald Farnsworth who asks,

716
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,080
what do you dislike most about people who don't own horses?

717
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,000
I am also including people who lease horses.

718
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,080
For me, it is that they are always trying to get into the horse scene

719
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,760
when they clearly don't belong there.

720
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,040
These horse poseurs.

721
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,440
I think what I really love about this question is the pretension.

722
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,740
Yeah.

723
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:19,800
Yeah, to say if you lease a horse, your bond with that particular equestrian

724
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:27,080
is not as strong as somebody who wholesale owns that motherfucker.

725
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,600
And that's my biggest problem is you don't understand horse love.

726
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,360
I also didn't know you could lease living beings.

727
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,080
Yeah, sure.

728
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,880
Yeah, of course.

729
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,200
Man, I got a sweet down payment on a cat.

730
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Couple more months, I'm gonna own that baby.

731
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,320
Few more payments.

732
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,640
Yeah, I just hope the repo man doesn't come to-

733
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,360
You know what I'm saying?

734
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,440
Man, you don't make the payments on your cat, I gotta take your cat.

735
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,160
No, but I was gonna make it, I was so glad.

736
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Whiskers is coming with us.

737
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,600
Unless you can answer these three trivia questions.

738
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm sorry, what repo reality shows are you watching?

739
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,800
Have you not seen repo quiz?

740
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,080
What's that fucking show called?

741
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,680
It's an actual show where they're like,

742
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,400
we're gonna take your car unless you can answer these three questions.

743
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,760
Is it repo games?

744
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,840
Is it repo games? Is that right?

745
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,320
No, that's the slice of the lemon movie.

746
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,120
Guys, what do you dislike most about people who don't own horses?

747
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,400
The smell.

748
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,680
Of them?

749
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:27,880
I guess.

750
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,240
They don't smell like the leathery oil of a horse's back?

751
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,840
I'm just saying that they don't look like they've been riding a horse all day.

752
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,440
I hate that.

753
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,280
If you're gonna buy a horse, you need to-

754
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,000
You know what I hate?

755
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,680
I hate those short boots that people who don't own horses wear.

756
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,720
Get some long boots, you know, with spurs.

757
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:48,920
Yeah.

758
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,160
I hate how they never yell like, yeah!

759
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,320
Or kachoms.

760
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,520
Or a sippy-ed up.

761
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,840
Zip it up, horsey.

762
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,120
Let's do this horse friend.

763
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,520
Can we not kickstart a horse?

764
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,440
Guys.

765
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,320
Are you saying that-

766
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,280
Guys, hold on.

767
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Are you talking about revving up the engine?

768
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,400
We gotta get out of here.

769
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,480
And that's the sound of it idling.

770
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,520
Jon Bon Jovi, I'm not making a shitty metaphor between a horse and a motorcycle.

771
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,960
What I'm saying to you is-

772
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,800
Wait, he wasn't riding an actual steel horse?

773
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,360
Oh my god.

774
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,240
That would make it the fucking best song.

775
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,200
On my cybernetic horse!

776
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,600
I ride the wastelands with my katana.

777
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,960
With my vibra sword.

778
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,800
And my emerald visor.

779
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,680
I smoke a pack of nano stems.

780
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,920
Oh my god.

781
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,720
Oh, Jon.

782
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,040
Somebody write that, baby.

783
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,880
I've seen a million faces and I process them for fuel for my metal horse.

784
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,720
I'm a cowboy.

785
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,040
I sell water at a great profit.

786
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,360
The land is not a myth.

787
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,960
So, no.

788
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,960
We've talked about kickstarting a European tour before.

789
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,160
We've talked about kickstarting a trip to London and Scotland and all that stuff.

790
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,160
And I don't know if enough people would want to kickstart for that to happen.

791
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,880
But I do know that if we made a kickstarter to buy a horse that would be owned by us,

792
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,800
the MBM nation, I think people would really get on board with this.

793
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,840
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

794
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,960
So you're not just talking about a horse that you and Travis and I would share.

795
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,760
You were talking about everybody throw down a fiver on this horse.

796
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,400
And then based on the different reward tiers,

797
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,840
you would get a minute or two on our collective horse.

798
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,960
Well, no, no, no, no.

799
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,240
So like the world would own this horse.

800
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,280
It would belong to all of us.

801
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,840
But really, us.

802
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,960
So like specifically, us.

803
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,920
Like any good kickstarter, it would give people the feeling of being invested

804
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,960
without actually the chance of any sort of return on that investment.

805
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,440
But if you pay in at the highest level, you get the choicest cuts of meat.

806
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,760
Once the horse is dead, you will, of course, get like a $20 donation.

807
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,120
Or maybe you could get a hooves.

808
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,840
And there is no sweeter meat than the meat of a horse

809
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,520
that we have been aging beneath us for decades.

810
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,400
I just think that I would really love it if we owned a horse

811
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,040
and then just had like a series of photos of like the horse listening to our podcast.

812
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,960
The horse chilling out on a beanbag chair.

813
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,280
But never like ridden.

814
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,000
The horse inevitably and quickly dying.

815
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,520
Because what the fuck do we know?

816
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,680
Because we fed it like, you know, red stripe.

817
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,480
You like greasy cups?

818
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,440
Ah, fuck.

819
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,040
We need a second kickstarter.

820
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,520
I gave him a bunch of red vines and now he's dead.

821
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,840
Launch the sequel to our first kickstarter.

822
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,760
And it's called Oops, We Did It Again.

823
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,560
Oops, We Gave Our Horse Diabetes.

824
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,120
And Diarrhea.

825
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Diabetes Horse 2013.

826
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,360
I want to give him-

827
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,160
That was his name.

828
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
I want to give a horse red vines.

829
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,720
I bet he'd love them.

830
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,840
I bet he would like them.

831
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,280
And then I bet he would diarrhea.

832
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Diarrhea is hard.

833
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,560
The horse might wrap this carrot in red vines and bacon.

834
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,360
You are welcome.

835
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,920
Enjoy this culinary treat.

836
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,600
Justin, you were saying how hard, how hard with this horse diarrhea?

837
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,640
I feel like you were, you know, there was more to that thought.

838
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,120
I'm sorry.

839
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,200
I didn't mean to interrupt the quantification of how hard the horse with diarrhea.

840
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I think we would not be popular amongst other horse owners.

841
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,080
I feel like we would not fit into whatever sort of socioeconomic circle that is.

842
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,040
We would be like Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack.

843
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,000
Yes, exactly.

844
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Or Rodney Dangerfield in anything.

845
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,440
We would be the animal house in like the yacht race of the boat that we built ourselves.

846
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,600
Diabetes horse?

847
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,840
Your horse diarrhea-ed on my horse and now I lost all the contests ever.

848
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,440
We would get in there first and, guys, clear something up for us.

849
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,280
We know none of you are the actual dean, but we do have to thwart someone.

850
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,080
So whichever one of you is closest to the dean, just let us know so we can thwart them, please.

851
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,280
I just assume everybody who owns a horse has been the dean of some institution in their lives.

852
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,600
And we roll up in our big sunglasses and sweatshirts and red vines.

853
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,320
The twist of the story is that rather than having a scrappy horse that ends up

854
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,320
showing up all the rich guy horses, ours will actually die.

855
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,320
Listen, man, maybe we know just a little bit more than you about horses.

856
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,840
Also, we're going to have to back out of the big race because our horse is dead.

857
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,920
Uh-oh, that can only mean one thing, us in a horse costume winning the race at the end.

858
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,480
Oh!

859
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,680
Who saw this coming?

860
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,640
Wait for it.

861
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,000
And then we have to build a cybernetic horse to win the race.

862
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,280
On a horse made of brothers I ride!

863
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,400
Guys, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to break your spirit, but horses are very fast.

864
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,720
Then the odds of you running faster than a horse in a horse costume are...

865
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,320
Low.

866
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,040
Given what you're forgetting, is we want it the most.

867
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,600
Haven't you seen the end of Cool Runnings?

868
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,160
It'll dis-

869
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,720
Right?

870
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,120
Oh, the movie ends with us carrying the horse on our shoulders over the finish line.

871
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,680
You can finish diabetes, Doug!

872
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,640
I believe in you!

873
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,800
That horse is dead.

874
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
That horse has been dead for 30 minutes.

875
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,940
Get up!

876
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,160
Get off Diabetes Horse 2013!

877
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,080
I got red vines waiting for you!

878
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,680
The revenge of the nerds guys who run in and start plugging electrodes into him like,

879
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,080
don't worry, we'll fix him with science!

880
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,880
You won't.

881
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,280
You won't.

882
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,840
You can't.

883
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,400
How about another question?

884
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,280
How that guy be, guys?

885
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,580
Good.

886
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,680
I'm in my first year of teaching high school.

887
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,800
I told my girlfriend that I looked up some of my students on Facebook.

888
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,480
She thought this was really creepy.

889
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,120
It's not like I read all their wall posts or look through their pictures.

890
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,920
I basically just looked at their profile picture and moved on to the next student.

891
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,160
And she agreed that it wouldn't be weird to do this if I had started a new job and looked

892
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,080
at the profiles of my co-workers, but still thought it was creepy to do to students.

893
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,040
Is she right?

894
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,960
That's from creeping in Cali?

895
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,560
There's a question mark there to leave it open to interpretation whether or not the

896
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,680
person is actually creepy.

897
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,440
Is it open to interpretation?

898
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,400
Because it seems like the answers are pretty cut and dry, yeah.

899
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:51,880
Yeah.

900
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,000
It's pretty creepy.

901
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,160
Imagine it this way.

902
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,040
If one of your students was in the room with you, or Jesus was in the room, or a co-worker

903
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,200
was in the room, would you squeeze on the Facebook profiles of your students?

904
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,120
I imagine you would not.

905
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,880
Yeah.

906
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,280
I have a hard enough time looking at Facebook profiles of people I know and not feeling

907
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,840
weird.

908
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,160
Yeah.

909
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,080
I also imagine that when I was...

910
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,200
I guess I was in high school right before Facebook.

911
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,560
Facebook sort of came up while I was in high school, but it didn't really permeate my school.

912
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,440
My teachers had been like, hey, Griffin, it seems like you had a really great time at

913
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,240
that party.

914
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,560
And by party, I mean youth group, probably.

915
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,560
That would weird me the fuck out.

916
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,840
I would not dig on that.

917
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,200
Hey, Griffin, I also really like fallout boy.

918
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,000
High five.

919
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,640
All right.

920
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,920
All right, teach.

921
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,000
Would have been reliant K at that point.

922
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,640
Griffin, I also think Jesus rocks.

923
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,360
High five.

924
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,880
Griffin, I too am lino.

925
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,440
Let's...

926
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,600
Reliant K deep cut for a reliant K joke everybody can enjoy.

927
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,960
Man, don't do this thing.

928
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,400
Don't do this thing.

929
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,520
This just stinks.

930
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,560
I feel like you're throwing off the balance.

931
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,840
But then again, maybe not.

932
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,160
You watch a Good Will Hunting.

933
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,000
You watch a Good Will Hunting.

934
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,240
Or you watch a Stand and Deliver.

935
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,640
Or you watch that other one.

936
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,920
Here Comes the Boom.

937
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,800
You watch that Here Comes the Boom with Kevin Smith.

938
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,520
What happened with Kevin James, you dumbass?

939
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,320
Kevin James versus Kevin Smith is the last fight.

940
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,440
Last fight.

941
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,280
It's just like two pieces of ham just swinging together.

942
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,560
We decide to see Here Comes the Boom.

943
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,800
Someone was making this choice.

944
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,240
Paul Blart, I get it.

945
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,600
I've got to see that.

946
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,280
He's like, it's ridiculous.

947
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,600
His name is so funny it sounds like fart.

948
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,280
Like, I'm with you guys.

949
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,080
I'm with you on that.

950
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,400
But listen, back to my point.

951
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,360
Okay, back to your point.

952
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,640
Where's Blart too?

953
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,320
You watch these films.

954
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,440
These teachers, they know their fucking students so much.

955
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,640
And they use that shit.

956
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,720
Okay, all right, here we go.

957
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,560
Finding Forrester, right?

958
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,960
Which is the unofficial sequel to Good Will Hunting.

959
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,000
Finding Forrester.

960
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,680
Sean Connery had a hard time connecting with his youth.

961
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,560
You know what I mean?

962
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,960
Trying to teach him how to write, trying to express.

963
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,200
So he learns some terms of phrase that he would use

964
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,800
when he was playing basketball.

965
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,560
Like, you're the man now, dog.

966
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
And punch the keys for God's sakes.

967
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,760
Both of which are catch phrases that they would use

968
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,040
with his friends.

969
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,680
You know what I mean?

970
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,480
He connected with him.

971
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,040
He formed an honest, earnest connection.

972
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,080
And then he taught him how to punch the keys for God's sakes.

973
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:48,760
I am so, do you know how close you're the man now, dog,

974
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:55,000
was to slipping off of my mind table for like forever?

975
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,480
And you have just saved me from that terrible fate

976
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,720
because that is flooding back to me now.

977
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,360
And it is really funny that he said that.

978
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,200
It is really great.

979
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,800
It is quite possibly the funniest line in cinematic history.

980
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,120
It is hard to top.

981
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,080
You're the man now, dog.

982
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,880
You're the man now, dog.

983
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,400
You're the man now, dog.

984
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,920
You're the man now, dog.

985
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,200
Isn't that what you say?

986
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,920
Can we make another Highlander before he dies, please?

987
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,360
Please, I'll give anything.

988
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,280
Just make a dozen more things.

989
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,000
But that connection is what I'm saying.

990
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And Facebook can facilitate that.

991
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,320
You can sit down with somebody and be like,

992
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,000
yeah, I know, Evanescence, let's talk about your math.

993
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,200
And then they're more receptive to your math advice.

994
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,480
Griffin, watch like any special on Lifetime or 60 Minutes

995
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,920
or True Investigations, whatever,

996
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,640
the stories that involve teachers and students

997
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,880
that begin with, and then the two connected on Facebook,

998
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,760
never end with like, and she got an A.

999
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,800
Well, that's the thing.

1000
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,400
They can never know.

1001
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,720
And that makes it creepier, I confess.

1002
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,200
But they can never know that they got an A.

1003
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,240
And never know that you know about their Evanescence love

1004
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,840
because you creeped on their soc.

1005
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,720
It sounds like you're saying to lean into it.

1006
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,360
I'm saying either run the fuck away

1007
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,040
or lean into it on the sneaky creep.

1008
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,880
Regardless, you tell your girlfriend,

1009
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,720
like, you're right, it is creepy, I'm gonna stop.

1010
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,080
And then you do it in secret

1011
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,240
because you gotta make those Finding Forrester connections.

1012
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,360
It's so important.

1013
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,480
Honey, you don't understand.

1014
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,280
I gotta shape them.

1015
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,120
I gotta shape them.

1016
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,080
These are my children.

1017
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,240
These are my babies.

1018
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,320
I gotta, they're like my little eggs.

1019
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,720
I don't know why it went from like a Sean Connery impression

1020
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,640
to like a Nicolas Cage impression.

1021
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,920
Man, that movie would've been so, so, so, so much better

1022
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,440
with Nicolas Cage in it.

1023
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Oh my God, it's not even close

1024
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,880
to how much better that movie would've been.

1025
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,240
Man now, dog.

1026
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,520
Hey, hey, man.

1027
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Hey, which one of your men is the dog?

1028
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,040
And also Tim Allen is there as the shaggy dog.

1029
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,640
There is the shaggy dog.

1030
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,200
Oh God, I wanna write this movie, an invisible baby.

1031
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,360
So Tim Allen's the shaggy dog.

1032
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,360
John Travolta is there as old dogs.

1033
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,800
And they're all riding robot horses.

1034
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,440
DDL, DDL's in the mix, or is he?

1035
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,560
Because he's an invisible baby.

1036
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,560
Nick Cage is there and he's a teacher

1037
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,640
who's probably cocaine addled.

1038
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,880
That's a subtext I feel like that runs through,

1039
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,920
runs underneath like the sewer system

1040
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,160
of every film that Nicolas Cage is in.

1041
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,760
And the movie's called Bad Lieutenant,

1042
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,440
but now he's also a teacher.

1043
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,280
From now on, I think instead of saying

1044
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,560
Hollywood is out of ideas,

1045
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,080
people should just start saying

1046
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,080
Hollywood doesn't listen to my bim bam.

1047
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,800
Because it's like we have opened wide our blast doors

1048
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,480
waiting for your lightsabers of cinematic ingenuity

1049
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,920
to tear us wide open.

1050
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,520
Oh God.

1051
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,400
Oh Jesus.

1052
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,240
That's gonna stay with me.

1053
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,400
That imagery.

1054
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,960
It is like a spicy hot dog.

1055
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,760
And the taste of it will linger.

1056
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,880
Oh wait, what?

1057
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,760
Oh, what?

1058
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,220
Yeah.

1059
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,080
Wait, did you just have a seizure?

1060
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,040
I was wondering if you meant like Hollywood's dick

1061
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,320
was like a spicy hot dog or like...

1062
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,360
Hollywood's dick is a spicy hot dog.

1063
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,160
That's a spicy meatball.

1064
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,600
You guys know that one?

1065
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,800
Time to make the donuts.

1066
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,560
Do they want to add?

1067
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,240
We got it.

1068
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Cut, print, that's a wrap.

1069
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,760
That's a wrap.

1070
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,960
That's a great podcast that everyone can enjoy.

1071
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,800
You are getting Adele, right?

1072
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,200
Dude, you just met Adele.

1073
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,680
Dude, you got Adele tickets.

1074
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,000
Dude, you're Adele.

1075
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,280
Adele, and I really enjoyed that song, Skyfall.

1076
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,280
The Skymall.

1077
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,800
Stop, end, stop it, end it.

1078
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,600
There you go, Weird Al.

1079
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,960
Cut it.

1080
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,320
You are welcome.

1081
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,120
I know that you are constantly on the lookout for your ideas.

1082
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,240
Skymall, welcome.

1083
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,080
Hollywood doesn't listen to Bim Bam.

1084
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,840
Weird Al doesn't listen to Bim Bam.

1085
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,560
We're opening the doors for you.

1086
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,560
It's all there.

1087
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,160
Just come pick these lilies.

1088
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,440
This has been my brother, My Brother and Me.

1089
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,320
It's an advice show for the modern era.

1090
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,680
We hope you've enjoyed whatever that was.

1091
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,680
We are here every Monday, usually.

1092
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,760
And we really appreciate people tweeting about the show,

1093
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,880
like Jan Villarosa, Emily Nancy Jean, Mark Payne,

1094
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:44,280
Bat Manson, David Meowie, Shane Element, Tickerburn.

1095
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,760
Sorry, what?

1096
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,520
Tickerburn?

1097
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:48,920
I don't know.

1098
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,480
Is it just all consonants?

1099
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,240
Owen McBride, yes.

1100
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,680
Owen McBride, Platt, Raymond News.

1101
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,400
Oliver Platt.

1102
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,600
Oliver Platt, in my dreams.

1103
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,720
So thank you to everybody who's tweeting.

1104
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,400
If you do tweet about the show, throw in a link to our sampler.

1105
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,880
It's bit.ly forward slash it's my Bim Bam.

1106
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,280
When is that sequel coming?

1107
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,760
I feel like it's really brewing.

1108
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,960
It's getting close.

1109
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,800
If only it were up to us.

1110
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,200
I know.

1111
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,880
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1112
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,440
for the use of our theme song, which is It's a Departure,

1113
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,160
which is off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1114
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,480
It's just, you know, you ever listen to the radio

1115
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,440
and you're like, this isn't my rock and roll.

1116
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,400
This is your rock and roll.

1117
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,040
You know what I mean?

1118
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,720
Absolutely.

1119
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,360
It's rock and roll for equestrian fanatics like ourselves and like you.

1120
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,640
It says that in the liner notes.

1121
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,600
Also, it is such an exciting time over at Max Fun headquarters.

1122
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,960
We just added two new shows to the Max Fun lineup.

1123
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,920
One Bad Mother with Theresa Thorn and the Dave Hill podcasting incident.

1124
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,520
It's epic.

1125
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,160
So check it out.

1126
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,600
I'm so thrilled that we are linked even tangentially to Dave Hill.

1127
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,640
I think he's hysterical.

1128
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,520
Do you guys want a final?

1129
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,840
Yeah.

1130
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,400
Lay it on us, big man.

1131
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,520
You're the man now, dog.

1132
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,200
Oh, you beat me to it.

1133
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:20,680
Damn you.

1134
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,400
You're the man now, dog.

1135
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,120
Wait, damn it.

1136
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,400
Make these fucking donuts, Griffin.

1137
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,720
Come on.

1138
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,360
It is past daylight savings time to make the donuts.

1139
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,240
Griffin, where's the beef?

1140
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,280
That was so good.

1141
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,320
Who's the beef?

1142
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,760
Who's the man now, dog?

1143
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,040
I'm stuck.

1144
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,280
We have to pay so many licensing fees.

1145
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,920
Darlene, we have to talk about this podcast you recommended to me.

1146
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,000
I did not enjoy it.

1147
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,480
They talked about earning horses with Dragon Relay.

1148
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,400
I am going to come to your houses and eat your fucking computers.

1149
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,800
I'm going to eat your fucking computers nut by bolt.

1150
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,280
Time to make the computers.

1151
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,720
This one is sent in by Ira Ray.

1152
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,520
Thank you, Ira Ray.

1153
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Alice Chaos, who asks, Goofus or Gallant?

1154
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,760
Who is hotter?

1155
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,560
I'm Justin McElroy.

1156
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,760
I'm Travis McElroy.

1157
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,720
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1158
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,920
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1159
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,880
Kiss your dad.

1160
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:35,800
Square on the lips.

1161
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,720
