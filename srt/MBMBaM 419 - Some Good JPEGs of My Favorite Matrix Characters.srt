1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
era. I'm the oldest brother, Justin McElroy. They call me around these parts.

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm the middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I am the youngest brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm, uh, I would like to welcome everybody, all of our listeners. This is rare, we don't normally

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
open these doors up, but welcome to the My Brother, My Brother and Me writers room.

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,120
Yeah, sort of a bit of a panic. So if you can envision like a bunch of papers like flying

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,840
through the air and some like spilled coffee and there's like our interns in the corner like,

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. And like we started writing on the white board,

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,520
but we just ran out of room there so we just started writing on the walls.

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,080
Yeah, and there's a doomsday clock sort of counting down and I show up, I'm wearing like a,

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,200
you know, I got like the Steve Martin arrow through my head like, is this anything,

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
is this anything? And, um, man, we're in, we're in, we're in the shit.

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm just gonna come out and say it, folks. We don't know what to do about 420. I mean,

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
there it is, right? Yeah.

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,680
We don't know what to do. And we fell into this weird kind of valley

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,440
where it was both like for a long time it felt too far away to plan anything,

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,240
and now it feels too close to do anything right. And I don't know where the window was,

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,360
I feel like I missed it completely. Like maybe it was like during the week where we had to put

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,120
up like one of the live episodes or something, and that was the week we could have planned.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We just don't got it, because we could do a bunch of weed jokes,

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,880
that would be bad, because we haven't enjoyed the kind herb for many, many moons.

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,080
And, I mean, could episode one of the Trolls 2 podcast that we do technically be episode

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,560
420 of Mabimbo? Because I think that was probably all of our last brush with the kindness.

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
Like we could re-air, re-air the broadcast?

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,480
Yeah, sure, but probably people wouldn't like that. I had an idea where we could do a recap of

30
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
like our favorite Family Guy episodes, but I don't think that that's got the legs to get us

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,040
all the way. Yeah, because like how do you fucking choose? That's my number one thing.

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,760
And the other thing is just like, it is still a criminal crime in a lot of places,

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,040
and so wrestling with that is something, because I don't want to make a joke about

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
something that could get me put in the slammer.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
What do you guys think about we all do it on Mescaline?

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,320
Interesting. What if we do 420 on Mescaline?

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,880
That could be something.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,080
Here's my thing about Mescaline. I don't know what that is.

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
Okay, I always picture Jell-O. Is it Jell-O?

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,200
That's a good point. It could be Jell-O.

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
I don't actually know what Mescaline is.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,960
I have a kind of out there idea, and it might be good enough that we could actually do it.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
And you guys let me know what you think.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,160
Next week, next Monday, people hop out of bed. They load up their podcast app.

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,000
They wait five or six hours, because there ain't no way I'm gonna get one of these bad boys up

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,320
before noon. And then the episode does come up, and they see episode 421. We skip it.

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,920
Yes, we skip it.

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,280
I actually love that we skip it until we're ready to pull a perfect one.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
Oh, I love that.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,560
And then that'll be great, because we'll be in episode 539, and next week comes out is episode

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,600
420. How exciting is that gonna be for everybody when we come back and we're like,

52
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,640
oh, wow, they finally fucking cracked it. That's so good.

53
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,440
That's an amazing idea. I love that very much.

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,480
There's a show that's already gone here before that has crossed this

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,280
treacherous ravine, and it's Family Guy, which had a 420th episode.

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh, good, but they do.

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah. Nope, never mind. It was just an episode called 420. They haven't done this.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
Oh, shit. I bet that was a good one, though. Fuck.

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,080
I bet it was a good one. It aired on April 20th, so it was not the 420th episode.

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:49,680
Oh, man. Did ol' Quag smooch any bebs? Did my boy Quagmire smooch any bebs?

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,640
I don't know if he smooched any bebs.

62
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,000
I had a dream in which I had beef with Seth McFarlane,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
and he dumped some Hannah sanitizer on me.

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
I had a dream where I had beef with Seth McFarlane,

65
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,520
and he dropped some Hannah tattoos on my hands when I was asleep.

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,020
What?

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,360
All right, so the next episode that you hear is going to be episode 421, unless-

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,040
Unless?

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Unless we find it.

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,480
We do crack it in the next week.

71
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,520
We will remove it from its place unstuck in time, and we'll just knock that shit out.

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,080
But I find it very, very unlikely that's going to happen. So 421's the next one.

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,920
Oh, boy. I'm glad we could settle this.

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,680
And listen, don't tweet us your great ideas about what we should do for 420,

75
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
because then everybody will see them. You got to email them to us, and then we'll do them.

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
That way we can do it without crediting you.

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Yeah, it will be the ideal scenario. And make sure you say at the top of the email,

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,480
legally, property of McElroy Brothers. If you send us an email, we own it, basically.

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Yeah.

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,960
If you send us your social security number, you are basically like,

81
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
we can be you.

82
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,520
All right.

83
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,560
We want to take your life.

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,720
Can we do, like, you know how they did with the doctors who,

85
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,760
where they were like, the doctors, hey, remember, they like, one of them we forgot.

86
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,240
So this, the whole numbers have been all ka-fluy this whole time.

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,560
Do you think maybe we could, like, find some way through an accounting error

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,240
that we've already released episode 420 and we missed it already?

89
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,040
So it's like in the past and we don't have to stress about it anymore?

90
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,680
I do know how to backdate episodes on Libsyn so that they drop into the feed in the middle.

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Considering that I get maybe five to six tweets a day about opportunities for jokes that I missed,

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,080
really choice nugs, they're like, you know, you should have done this joke.

93
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,840
I feel like just releasing episode 420 and making no comment about it would be the excuse to

94
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
quit Twitter that I've been waiting for.

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,640
All right.

96
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,840
Listen, what if we re-release episode one of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

97
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
but we just put the opening sort of eight measures of 311s,

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
Amber is the color of your energy.

99
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,040
But wait, we probably did that for episode 311, didn't we?

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,080
I know we did.

101
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,920
I don't have the transcript that handy.

102
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Uh, let's just do a regular show this time.

103
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,240
We don't have to stress about it right now.

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,880
What number is this?

105
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,320
Travis didn't put it in again.

106
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,040
419.

107
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,240
419, are you kidding me?

108
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,760
God, that's kind of like, man, 420 is really close at this

109
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,480
point, huh?

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,980
Yeah.

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,280
I went to a new dentist's office today.

112
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,400
All of my previous dentists have had TVs in their rooms, but this one has none of that.

113
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
Close to the end of my appointment, because I didn't know where to look,

114
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
I made slightly prolonged eye contact with the person cleaning my teeth.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,640
She stopped what she was doing, sighed and said, can you please not?

116
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,440
Oh my God.

117
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,960
No, they didn't.

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
I don't believe it.

119
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
The rest of my visit was super awkward.

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,280
I didn't say anything, even after my teeth were cleaned.

121
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,480
I have to go back to get a filling soon, and I am terrified.

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
I will have the same person.

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
Is there anything I can do?

124
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
What should I do with my eyes?

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
Was I in the wrong?

126
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
That's from bad teeth in British Columbia.

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,080
Holy shit.

128
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
Everyone was in the wrong.

129
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
I was in the wrong.

130
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,040
I was in the wrong for reading this out loud.

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Fuck me.

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,440
Justin thinks this didn't happen.

133
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,040
Justin thinks this is a fake, somebody's trolling our forums.

134
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,320
But I think I can totally see it.

135
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,960
Imagine a hygienist deep in your pearly whites, and you just lock eyes with them the whole time.

136
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
That's not acceptable behavior.

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,600
It's not acceptable.

138
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,720
But it's also not acceptable to not have, if not a TV playing old episodes of The Office

139
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,280
or something right above you, a like a baby's mobile just sort of hanging above your head.

140
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,840
Something to just sort of attract the eyes.

141
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,880
Maybe it's just a small dot that somebody's drawn on the ceiling with a blue marker.

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,760
Anything, anything, anything to give you a reason to not look into the eyes of my hygienist.

143
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,240
I've never had.

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,800
Dr. Judy Woodruff does not have any TVs at the top of her office.

145
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,840
I've never had a TV.

146
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,760
As long as I've ever had dental work in my entire life, I've never had a TV to look at.

147
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,480
No one should.

148
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
You should have to do like I do when I go to the dentist, which is sit, stare at the

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,200
bright light, think about how my teeth will outlive me until they too are clean by time.

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
That is what you should do at the dentist.

151
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,920
You don't you don't need to watch old episodes of French or Friends or Friends.

152
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
No one needs to watch old episodes of Friends French.

153
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, you fucked up.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
You fucked up bad.

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
You can't go back.

156
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
You can't go back.

157
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,520
The good news is at least at my dentist, like the dental hygienist is like a specialist

158
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,000
they bring in to do, you know, the wet work.

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,520
And then when it's time to like, you know, rip out one of my terrible teeth and put in

160
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,640
like a, you know, a monkey's tooth in there, then they they, you know, the dentist dentist

161
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,440
steps in.

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,760
So it should it should be a different person.

163
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
But however, however, you here's the problem.

164
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, the problem is because I always I go to this very nice dentist here in Cincinnati

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,920
and every time I have gone, the person who has, I guess, prepared me for the dentist

166
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,760
who is ready to be for the dentist has been a different person.

167
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,480
Every time.

168
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,400
But that said, I also have to imagine they get together and discuss which of us like

169
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
teethers gave them eye contact that day.

170
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Like it happened again.

171
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,600
Who did you get weird eye contact from today?

172
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
And everyone's going to know.

173
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,080
That's all I can assume is like I spend so much of my life trying not to make eye contact

174
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,800
with people.

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,280
Sure.

176
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,440
Like even people I think I'm supposed to make eye contact with because I don't want them

177
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,720
to see the panic in my eyes of having to interact with another human being and be present with

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
another human being.

179
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,440
And so the idea of them being like, yeah, I looked right into his eyes.

180
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
I saw his soul.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,280
He's terrified of everything.

182
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,000
Like, I don't want them to know that much about me.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,120
OK, we need something here and we need something that is easily sort of reproducible in every

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,080
dentist office.

185
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,840
I want this shit to be as commonplace as like and that if you didn't have it, it would

186
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,160
be like going to a dentist and they didn't have any sort of anesthetic at all.

187
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
And you're like, wait, you don't have anesthetic?

188
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,640
I'm fucking sorry.

189
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,920
You can't come to this one because we don't have drills or there's no water at this dentist.

190
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,720
It needs to be that sort of place.

191
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,880
Sleep mask might be good.

192
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
I was thinking like cool.

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,040
Do they make like cool sunglasses that have like a little screen inside of them and you

194
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
can put it on and be like a virtual not VR goggles, but like why not?

195
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,920
Not VR goggles, well, expensive cool sunglasses.

196
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,240
I've seen these sunglasses here describing.

197
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,440
Yes, yes, I've seen these sunglasses.

198
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,560
I believe they exist.

199
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,440
Like Doc Brown wears in BTTF2 where he has the sunglasses on and they look like cool

200
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
sunglasses with a TV in them.

201
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
And you think those are less expensive than VR?

202
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,840
You could get like the cardboard and put a phone in it.

203
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
All right, fuck fine.

204
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,520
I mean, there's no way TV sunglasses are cheaper than that.

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,240
Okay, I've got it.

206
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,720
I've got it.

207
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,200
I've got it.

208
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,760
I've got it.

209
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,320
I've got it.

210
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,880
He's got it.

211
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,360
He's got it.

212
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,080
He's got it, folks.

213
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,560
Calm down.

214
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,040
He's got it.

215
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,520
Above every dentist chair, there will be live theater.

216
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,760
There will be a live production of The Tempest or a funny thing.

217
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,720
In the ceiling?

218
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,440
In the ceiling.

219
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,480
All the actors are suspended and they're doing a funny thing happened on the way to the forum.

220
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,640
And you are delighted and transported and depending on what the procedure is you're

221
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,600
getting, if you're just getting a cleaning, they're probably, you know, they're not

222
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
going to make it to act two.

223
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,840
So they'll get a nice little break.

224
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
They're like, oh, that's the end of the play.

225
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
And they'll walk away.

226
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
And we do.

227
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Is there a more convenient way of doing this?

228
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,840
That couldn't you just have them?

229
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,640
We're thinking about this all wrong.

230
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:53,680
If you put the performers on the stage, but then you have the tooth person oriented-

231
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
Sideways, sideways.

232
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,320
No, you have them oriented sort of vertically like Hannibal Lecter and just have the tooth,

233
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,080
like give the tooth work.

234
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,600
The dentist is loving it because their back was killing them.

235
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
So they're excited.

236
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,480
So now the dentist is just, you're standing and the dentist is standing.

237
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,520
Everybody's standing.

238
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,400
And you're just having standing dental work.

239
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,360
You're having standing?

240
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,040
No, you'll be tied to a stretcher and the dentist will be like, hey, listen, I've never

241
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,400
seen this before.

242
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,080
So please do let me know what's happening in it because I have not seen it.

243
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,600
So if anything really cool is about to happen, please let me know.

244
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
Let me pause real quick.

245
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,880
I'll look up from your chompers and I will watch the sword fight and then I'm right back

246
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,200
in there.

247
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,640
The only other thing we can do is put the live theater inside of the patient's mouth

248
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,800
so that the dentist will apparently focus on their fucking job instead of looking into

249
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
your eyes.

250
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,560
You know what I mean?

251
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
Like it takes two to tango.

252
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,280
You're right, Griffin.

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Why didn't you, you should have stopped what you were doing and be like, could you not?

254
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,640
Why did you look at my peepers instead of my chompers?

255
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,480
Hey, here's actually a very good question.

256
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
Thank you, Travis.

257
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,840
Why don't you look at my fucking teeth?

258
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,480
How about that?

259
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,320
Since you've got like whatever in there, like the thing that they pretend is counting your

260
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,840
teeth, but it's actually scraping them.

261
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,720
Since you got that in there, how about you focus on what you're doing?

262
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,400
My eyes are up here, but my teeth are down there where you should be looking.

263
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,480
They're pretty close and I can't fault you for that.

264
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
But if you look at my eyes, you will see no holes.

265
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,240
If you look in my mouth, it is Shia LaBeouf's holes in there.

266
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,120
So like if I went to the eye doctor and I caught him staring at my teeth, I'd be like,

267
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
what the fuck are you doing?

268
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,840
That's not where I look from.

269
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,120
That's not your world.

270
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,960
That's where I taste to.

271
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,640
Stay in your fucking lane.

272
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,840
How about a Yahoo?

273
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,720
Yeah, I love that.

274
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,240
Some good ones.

275
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,640
All right.

276
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,760
Yahoo user.

277
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
I don't know why I introduced it like that, but it is Drew Davenport.

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,760
So he does use Yahoo, I think.

279
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
I would argue he is a heavy user.

280
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,760
Level 9000.

281
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,160
Yeah, Drew.

282
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,960
Drew had sent this in.

283
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,360
Thanks, Drew.

284
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,640
It's Yahoo Answers user.

285
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,960
Horseygirl53534, 2534.

286
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,920
Horseygirl3534 has 2% best answers.

287
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,840
Not very good.

288
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,880
But also not the worst it could be.

289
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,120
2% of the time, she's right every time.

290
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,880
She has 100% of the best questions though, because her question is in the movie Cars.

291
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,360
I watched this recently.

292
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
I'm excited about this.

293
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,880
How would the Cars have kids?

294
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,720
Me and my friend Shelby are watching Cars when she asked this question.

295
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,680
So how would they?

296
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:42,640
Now, I know you're probably wondering, is there illustrations of this concept on internet already?

297
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,240
And me, Griffin, will say there is.

298
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,240
And I'm saying that for you so that you don't have to go and find.

299
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,840
Don't do this.

300
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,400
Because I went and I find a lot.

301
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,800
And some of it is Cars Cars.

302
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Some of it is Cars Peoples.

303
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,080
There's one with a plane in the car.

304
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
So there's sort of like planes in rescue.

305
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,720
Can I say, so I just recently watched Cars 3.

306
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,600
It's a very fine movie with wonderful voice acting.

307
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,320
Many moments in which tears are brought to my eyes.

308
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,280
Beautiful movie.

309
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,360
But it does introduce the concept of new models of Cars,

310
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,480
which I find deeply troubling as an analog comparison to people.

311
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,880
Sure.

312
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
The idea, I wouldn't look at BB and be like, this is the new model.

314
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,880
Ah, so much sleeker and better.

315
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
Like, huh.

316
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,000
The shitty thing is when you have to say that when you have a second kid,

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
and then you have to say that to your first kid.

318
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,720
Look at this.

319
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
This is the new souped up version of you.

320
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,320
If you were an iPhone, I would have traded you in already for this one.

321
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,000
This is Baby X.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,280
This is Baby X.

323
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,240
The most powerful baby with the best camera ever.

324
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,040
And if I charge this baby, she's good all day.

325
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,280
Yeah.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,480
There is-

327
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
Don't worry about cloud saves with this one.

328
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,880
You can talk all day about how they have sex, how the cars have sex.

329
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,360
And I will.

330
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,600
The question, the better question I want to ask is this.

331
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Why do they shit?

332
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:30,480
There are so many scenes in the Cars franchise where Lightning McQueen says,

333
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,680
I have to go take a shit.

334
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,120
There are long sequences in every one of these fucking movies where they're like,

335
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,920
where's Lightning?

336
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
And he's like, I'm in the can.

337
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
And it's pointless.

338
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
It doesn't end the story forward.

339
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,120
Why was it so important to John Lasseter that the cars shit so many times?

340
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,800
I mean, what's weird is that there are no scenes of tomato shitting.

341
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,240
Because they went to Larry and they were like, okay, Larry,

342
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
so in this scene, you're gonna-

343
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,200
And he's like, what?

344
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
What are you saying?

345
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
And they're like, in this scene, your character,

346
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,400
tomato is going to take a big shit.

347
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,440
And then he says, no, I'm sorry.

348
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,000
I won't be-

349
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,800
That is low brow humor.

350
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
That is low brow humor.

351
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,160
And it's sort of off my brand.

352
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,040
I played Hamlet at Cambridge.

353
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,240
So you will remove this scene or else I will not-

354
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,720
I am a Nobel Prize winner, sir.

355
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,240
I will, if you do not remove the scene, I will not be getting it done.

356
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,040
I will remove your license to use my recorded voice

357
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,960
in the car's branded electric toothbrush that says,

358
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760
go for it, pilgrim, brush those fuckers.

359
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,560
I'll make you remove it.

360
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,360
Stop brushing, you're gonna get conjovinus.

361
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll remove that too.

362
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,920
You will not be able to use either of those sound samples.

363
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,720
And if I might suggest a few cuts,

364
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,560
there is a lot of shitting scenes already.

365
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,600
So many scenes.

366
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,360
Not just my character, but it seems everyone,

367
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
this whole movie is shitting.

368
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
I could suggest maybe a rewrite.

369
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
Yeah, let me get in the studio.

370
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,800
Okay, are we rolling?

371
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,360
Okay.

372
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
I forgot how to do key.

373
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,880
So you can just use that and then it explains it all the way.

374
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,440
I've forgotten everything I knew from when I was a human.

375
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,120
Before I got, we're all cursed memories now.

376
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
I don't remember what that,

377
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,560
I don't even remember what my wife smelled like.

378
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,920
I only remember how my engine revs.

379
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm broken, this is worse than hell.

380
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I can't remember my daughter's face.

381
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
First place, I win, I win the big race.

382
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Get her finished, get her finished, get her finished.

383
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,360
What was my favorite food?

384
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
I don't remember how I ate.

385
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,640
Anyway, polish my muffler or what the fuck.

386
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
Now we are all cars.

387
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
We're all of us cars.

388
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,960
We've become cars, destroyer of worlds.

389
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,040
Black Mirror, season five, starring Lerald the Cable Guy.

390
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,720
Catch it.

391
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,360
I have no mouth, but I must vroom for her.

392
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,680
I think that cars can have kids.

393
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,720
If Lightning McQueen and another character

394
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
wanted to have a kid, they would just sort of,

395
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,560
I think Lightning McQueen could pop off a headlight,

396
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,920
and I think another car could drop a tire,

397
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
and then somebody would have to build a car

398
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,600
using those two components.

399
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,440
It should have a scene where he pops off a headlight

400
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,040
and another car pops off a tire

401
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,200
and they try to figure out what to do with it then.

402
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,680
They dig a hole and bury it.

403
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,600
Is this gonna be a kid?

404
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,880
We don't know what we're doing, but all the humans are dead.

405
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
I love this sequel of Children of Men we're creating

406
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
in this cars world where no one can have kids

407
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,560
and they have to figure out a way.

408
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,200
Now granted, I have not seen Children of Men,

409
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,280
but I have seen cars many times.

410
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Damn, Trav, have you seen any movies?

411
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,400
No, just cars.

412
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,040
All right, yeah.

413
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,000
Here's the thing, okay?

414
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
Can I tell you the thing that threw me about cars?

415
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,600
Okay, you ready for this?

416
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,040
The cars are cars, yes, of course.

417
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
The planes, the helicopters, they also have faces.

418
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,720
They are also living vehicles.

419
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
But the tiny bugs we see, they are cars.

420
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,400
Cars.

421
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,640
Yeah.

422
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,520
What the fuck?

423
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,840
Wait, what?

424
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,280
Yeah, they're just having fun with it.

425
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
How about another question?

426
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
Because of an unfortunate turn of events,

427
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,280
I am changing high schools to one with less than 100 kids.

428
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,720
I was wondering, how do I become the coolest kid in school?

429
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
Because of the low numbers, there is a chance for me

430
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
to be the coolest kid in school.

431
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,320
Thanks for the advice to making it happen in Massachusetts.

432
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,520
I love that it's not just like,

433
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,960
I know this sounds aspirational, but I've run the numbers.

434
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,160
And it is feasible for me to become the coolest kid in school.

435
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,960
The problem is at this point, I literally have no concept

436
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,160
of what constitutes cool.

437
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
I was going to say in school, but like really at all.

438
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,280
Just generally speaking.

439
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,840
Yeah.

440
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,440
I have no answer to this.

441
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm at a no.

442
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,480
Travis McElroy, do you have an answer to this?

443
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,600
Do you have an answer to this?

444
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,560
I'm a no.

445
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,080
Griffin McElroy, do you have an answer to this?

446
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,120
I mean, tech decks, but if not tech decks, then no.

447
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,840
All right, I want to bring in a special,

448
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,960
super special guest to help us answer this question.

449
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
Elsie Fisher, star of the film 8th Grade,

450
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,720
now in theaters everywhere.

451
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,000
Elsie, welcome to the program.

452
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
Hey, thank you for having me.

453
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
Elsie, I'm going to bounce this off you

454
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
and let me know if it sticks.

455
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,160
Tech decks, are they still hot or not

456
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,520
with sort of the 13 to 18 age bracket?

457
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,640
Oh, they're very hot.

458
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
They are very hot.

459
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,720
Wait, God.

460
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,440
Really?

461
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,560
I'm not even joking though.

462
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,840
They are very hot.

463
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,120
You have to be joking.

464
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
Elsie, get out.

465
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,840
I've had plenty of children in my classes

466
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,920
get their tech decks duped.

467
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
Okay, I can't tell if you're messing with Elsie.

468
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,560
I'm genuinely not.

469
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,040
I swear, they're very hot.

470
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,480
Yeah, wow, my collection still has value then.

471
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm so excited.

472
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
Oh yeah, it's probably doubled.

473
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
Is this how like sort of the statistics

474
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,840
of high school popularity, is that even how it works?

475
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Or I guess in any sort of primary school level of popularity,

476
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
if you clock in in a school with 100 kids in it,

477
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,680
are you more likely or is it just if you're super cool,

478
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,240
it doesn't matter what the size of the school is,

479
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,760
you're going to reign supreme?

480
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,200
I don't know.

481
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,240
I mean, I think numbers can make a difference

482
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
if it is a smaller school

483
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,520
because there are just less options to pick from.

484
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,360
So you have to do less to be cool.

485
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,440
Yeah, okay, can I make a suggestion?

486
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
And we'll see if this plays, right?

487
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,080
Think of that.

488
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,800
I've been watching a lot of cars, the movie Cars.

489
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,560
Think of it like a racetrack, right?

490
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,920
You don't have to go from bottom to beat in the first person.

491
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,560
You just have to pass everyone along the way.

492
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,240
So you need to find the 99th coolest person in school, pass them.

493
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
And beat them up.

494
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
No, no, no, Elsie.

495
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,400
Oh, wow, all right.

496
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,040
Okay, fine, I get it.

497
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,960
You've listened to the show before, I thought,

498
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
and we don't usually sort of endorse jumping people

499
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,560
to become cooler than them.

500
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,440
But that's Hollywood.

501
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,480
Not since the double-digit episodes, at least.

502
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,600
Elsie, I want to hit you with this theory, though.

503
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,080
I understand what you're saying about the numbers are better.

504
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,880
Let me alternate, though.

505
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,960
Isn't it more statistically likely

506
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
that you could be the least popular child in your school?

507
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
Like, if you think of your kid came back

508
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,440
and they were like, I'm the least popular kid in school,

509
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,280
they're like, oh, there's like a thousand kids

510
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,760
that go to that school.

511
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
No way you're the least popular one.

512
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,000
My kid came back and they're like,

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm the least popular one out of a hundred?

514
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
Eh, maybe.

515
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,160
I don't know.

516
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
It's possible.

517
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,160
I think it is a risk you have to take

518
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,680
if you go to a school of that size

519
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,840
and you're on a quest to become the coolest.

520
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,720
I think it's too easy to become the coolest

521
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,920
if there's just a hundred kids.

522
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,560
There needs to be a bad side, you know?

523
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Yeah, the danger.

524
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,000
We found a school, right?

525
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,440
And you know how there are schools for like,

526
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,920
ah, we take only the best and brightest,

527
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,520
you know, sinister, smartest kids.

528
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
But like, there's a hundred kids.

529
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,160
They were all the coolest kids at their hundred schools, right?

530
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,960
And we have brought, this is cool school.

531
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,720
It's only for the coolest kids.

532
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
They're not even smart or whatever.

533
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,920
That's just cool.

534
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,560
You're literally describing the plot of like, 14 different animes right now.

535
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,040
I think the opportunity that we're missing here

536
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,320
is not the size of the student body.

537
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
It is that you are a new student at this school.

538
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,760
You're changing schools.

539
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
You are brand new.

540
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,840
And that is, that's your ticket.

541
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,280
That's the opportunity.

542
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,680
I think the like, new student mystique

543
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,200
is going to penetrate a lot farther with a 100 person student body

544
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
because everybody there is going to know there's a new student in town

545
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,560
and their dad invented tech decks.

546
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,840
Because here's the thing.

547
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,480
What you want is you want a cool lie about yourself

548
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,720
that makes yourself more interesting that is not easily Googlable.

549
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,480
I have two vapes.

550
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,600
Yeah, right?

551
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,240
Just say that.

552
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,520
Just say that.

553
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,560
That was not a response to your question, Travis.

554
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,800
That was Elsie just letting everybody know how many vapes she personally has.

555
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,600
Yes, yeah.

556
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,280
I like that it's two.

557
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,280
It's my vape for me and then my vape for you, my friend.

558
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,400
That's so sweet.

559
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
What's your movie about, Elsie, so people can go see it

560
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,440
and will want to go see it, I mean?

561
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,600
It's about eighth graders and it's about a girl trying to live her life

562
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,280
and maybe that is weird.

563
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,640
And maybe your life is weird.

564
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,760
And maybe that is weird and maybe your life is weird.

565
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,880
So maybe you'll like it.

566
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,240
I've struggled a lot since I've been sort of following this movie in the trades

567
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
with spelling the word eighth.

568
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,320
Boy, it's a tricky one.

569
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,680
There's a lot of G's, H's and T's in that one.

570
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,560
There's like three of each and I can never really remember

571
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,480
how to assemble it correctly.

572
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,200
E-I-G-H-T-H.

573
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,040
That double H even sounds weird.

574
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,600
Yeah, you don't even know where that's coming from.

575
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
But it's not eighth grade, it's eighth grade.

576
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,160
Could you change it to eighth grade?

577
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,360
Is it too late?

578
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,680
I think it's too late.

579
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,360
It's already hit theaters, my friend.

580
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm assuming by the title, this is a horror film, right?

581
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,480
Oh, yes.

582
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,680
My experience in eighth grade, I don't think they could come up

583
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,200
with a scarier name for a film.

584
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,680
When I was in eighth grade, I had a tooth come loose

585
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,600
and I went to the bathroom and pulled it out

586
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,560
and it was like the first or second day of eighth grade.

587
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,920
And I was on a new floor.

588
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,960
In eighth grade at Comac, you were on the first floor.

589
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,800
And so I went to the bathroom, I was looking in the mirror,

590
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,920
pulled the tooth out and a door to one of the bathroom stalls

591
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,800
opened behind me and a woman did come out

592
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,640
because I was in the women's restroom.

593
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,120
And I didn't know because I was new to the floor

594
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,520
and they saw me pulling a tooth out of my fucking head.

595
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,640
So like worst, I was done pretty much after that.

596
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,600
I literally can't remember anything about eighth grade,

597
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,320
which makes me think it was incredibly terrible.

598
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,040
Maybe my eighth grade experience was just an alien abduction

599
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,600
and I've just like replaced those memories.

600
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,560
I don't know.

601
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,560
In my eighth grade year, I was a furry and I know this

602
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,600
because there are many photos of it.

603
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,280
Many photos of you like drawing furry culture?

604
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,960
No, no, like I used to wear ears and a tail to school.

605
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,680
All right.

606
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,120
There's nothing wrong with that.

607
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,000
You don't have a wrong one.

608
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,720
That's radical.

609
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,600
We love furries.

610
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,280
We fully support that.

611
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,160
Yeah, absolutely.

612
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,200
I'm so used to this furry discrimination in my real life.

613
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,120
You've come to the right place.

614
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,760
We are, I would say, reckless in our support of furries.

615
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,800
That's character development right there.

616
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,040
Thank you, yes.

617
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,440
Thank you for finally heaping the praise on us

618
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
that our dad continues to withhold.

619
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,320
Elsie Fisher, eighth grade, is in theaters now.

620
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
People can go see it even if they can't spell it.

621
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
And I think everybody should go do that, don't you?

622
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,600
Are you asking Elsie?

623
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,640
I'm asking Elsie.

624
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,600
Oh, okay.

625
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,120
Yes, please go see it.

626
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,240
Elsie Fisher, thank you for attending our program.

627
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,920
Oh, thank you so much for having me.

628
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,720
What a natural way to phrase that.

629
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,080
What a good person way of saying that, human, save it.

630
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,600
Elsie, we appreciate your guidance.

631
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Everybody go see eighth grade in theaters now.

632
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,320
But for the moment, we don't have big Hollywood dreams.

633
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,160
We gotta earn our money the old-fashioned way.

634
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,680
Right, so yeah, talking about sponsors for E-Savvy companies on the internet.

635
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:50,640
Let's go to the money's end.

636
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,920
Can I tell you all about Casper?

637
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,360
Um, yeah, I guess.

638
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
Okay, great.

639
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,960
So we travel a lot, we do a lot of tours, I go to a lot of conventions and stuff.

640
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,600
And there's nothing like sleeping on a shitty hotel bed to make me miss,

641
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm going to say it, my best friend, my Casper mattress.

642
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,720
Yeah, a lot of these hotels use mattresses from Bastard, which is the evil Casper.

643
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,600
And they are not soft, they come in a box that's bigger than the mattress and they deflate.

644
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,840
And they're not soft and they're not made out of, you know, soft materials.

645
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,720
And so I hate Bastard, I love Casper.

646
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,800
Bastard uses like eight middlemen.

647
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,480
And so it just really jacks up the price where Casper uses no middleman.

648
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,640
So it like decreases the price and Bastard's like,

649
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,880
we can make our mattresses more expensive.

650
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,000
They also, Casper combines multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep service

651
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,560
with the right amount of both sink and bounce.

652
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,120
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

653
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,160
And right now you can get $50 towards select mattresses

00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,440
by visiting Casper.com, that's C-A-S-P-E-R.com slash my brother.

And use the promo code mybrother, all one word, at checkout.

656

Terms and conditions apply.

657
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,400
Juice, tell me about Quip, because I know that you like to have them in there.

658
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,040
If you have nasty teeth or a nasty mouth even,

659
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,600
like however, wherever you're nasty up there, Quip is a great, great way

660
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
to finally kind of get things in order up there.

661
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,840
It's a new electric toothbrush that's a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes

662
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,760
and packs premium vibrations for a perfect two-minute clean.

663
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,160
You know, I used to use an electric toothbrush from one of the big brands

664
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,600
and it took up like a bunch of space on my counter in my bathroom

665
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,000
and very inconvenient.

666
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,320
Quip is great because it has this like little caddy, basically,

667
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,840
that has a sticky strip on it that you can basically stick anywhere.

668
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,480
Get it out of the way and your toothbrush just hangs out there.

669
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,280
And when you're going on a trip or whatever,

670
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,360
you just flip the Quip over and put it back into the container.

671
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,480
And then it's like a travel case.

672
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,080
Like I always say, got travel, just flip the Quip.

673
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,600
Just flip the Quip, I always say it.

674
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,840
And Quip has, it pulses every 30 seconds to let you know,

675
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,280
like brush a different part of your mouth.

676
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,600
And then at two minutes, I think it's like a different pulse

677
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,680
to let you know like you finally did it, believe it or not.

678
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,560
It also helps fix the problem of remembering to change your toothbrush

679
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,800
with its time because every three months,

680
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,520
they ship you a new one for just five bucks.

681
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,520
So, and it's actually very satisfying because they use the old brush head

682
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,640
right before you throw it away.

683
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,800
You use that to clean the like inside of the brush.

684
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,200
I find it immensely satisfying when you throw it away

685
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
and it's all perfectly clean and spotless and everything.

686
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
But Quip starts at just $25.

687
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,880
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now,

688
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,680
you'll get your first refill pack free with a Quip electric toothbrush.

689
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:12,240
That's getquip, G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

690
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,560
Catch it, catch the wave.

691
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,560
I want to tell you all about this next Jumbotron because...

692
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,760
Okay.

693
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,040
Yeah, I'm really excited about it.

694
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:28,000
It was sent in by Nick Palumbo for my dearest Andrea who says,

695
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,640
since introducing you to the McElhory, I'm done, I quit.

696
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,280
If you can't even get the name right, I'm walking.

697
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,960
Nick, Nick-less.

698
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,760
Let me fix your doo-doo mess here, Nick.

699
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,480
Anyway, since introducing you to the McElhory family of products.

700
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,080
It might be an inside joke, Griffin.

701
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,280
It is like their funny joke where they disrespect us.

702
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,760
Disrespect our whole honor.

703
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,040
Our brand, our brand.

704
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,120
Since introducing you to the McElhory family of products, Nick.

705
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,160
I can't get past this first sentence, guys.

706
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,440
It's just a doo-doo mess.

707
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,240
Yes, but since introducing you to the McElhory family of products

708
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,880
was the second smartest thing I did in December 2015,

709
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,240
asking you out was the first.

710
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,520
I figured it's fitting for me to use them to wish you a happy birthday.

711
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,480
Happy birthday.

712
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,080
I love you so much and I can't wait to marry the fuck out of you this August.

713
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,680
Yours forever and always, Nick.

714
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,680
Why did you say his name right?

715
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,120
You should have said yours forever.

716
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,920
McKick.

717
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,280
Yeah, Ken, which is Nick backwards.

718
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,600
Oh, burn him.

719
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Now they did want this message March 5th and it is August

720
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,760
which is when the wedding is going to happen.

721
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,800
So hopefully we're getting in before the wedding so I can let you all know.

722
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,160
I hope many happy returns and many more.

723
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,840
Listen, we all made some mistakes.

724
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,640
You know what I mean?

725
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,160
We all make some mistakes and I'm really not mad about it.

726
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,480
Congratulations on your love and happy birthday a long time ago.

727
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,200
All right, this message is for Aubrey and it's from Matt.

728
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,480
I was so excited to get a Jumbotron that I didn't plan anything specific to say.

729
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,000
Other than I love you and I hope this message from those good, good boys,

730
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,080
the McElroy's brightens your day.

731
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,560
Can't wait to be home with you and the snuggle boys planning our next adventure.

732
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,320
Always remain on the smooth tip and always keep it digital.

733
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,240
Love, Matt, Max and Henry.

734
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,840
Now I don't know who the snuggle boys are.

735
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,120
Yeah, but it sounds like the best and maybe also creepiest kind of like henchmen

736
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,400
I've ever heard of.

737
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Yeah, me and the snuggle boys.

738
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,360
I could come around and show you who's boss.

739
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,480
You think it's an ironic name?

740
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,680
You think they're like, you know, knife enthusiasts,

741
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,520
but they call themselves the snuggle boys kind of like the wet bandits

742
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,160
and it sounds like, you know, a harmless name, but really they did try to kill a kid.

743
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,480
Yeah.

744
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,600
So, Justin, you want to read this last one?

745
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,200
Absolutely.

746
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,800
This is a message from Caroline and it's for Joe and it says,

747
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
Hey Joe, a message to my favorite boy from your faith boys.

748
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,320
You told me not to spend my money on this,

749
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,760
but despite having an econ degree, I'm terrible with money.

750
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,440
Fine.

751
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:16,560
Hope you have a great 24th birthday and that all your magical dreams come true.

752
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,840
You're an awesome photographer, guitarist, and bro love your middle sister.

753
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,040
And that birthday did go ahead and pop off a little early this year on May 9th.

754
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,200
So we are hoping Joe's still in kind of the celebratory mood.

755
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Just a quick cue.

756
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,560
Hello, I'm Oliver Wong, DJ, scholar, and journalist.

757
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,560
And I'm Morgan Rhodes, music supervisor and stiletto devotee.

758
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,880
And we host Heat Rocks, a podcast where we invite our favorite musicians,

759
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,440
writers, and scholars to talk about the albums that have changed their lives.

760
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,360
Morgan, what exactly is a Heat Rock?

761
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,800
It's a record that's like hot fire, combustible.

762
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,360
Basically, just a really, really good album.

763
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,800
We've taken a deep dive into Nigerian funk from the 70s.

764
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,640
He kind of had like a bad reputation in town as just being like a sketchy dude.

765
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,040
And he was just making music that for thousands of miles around him,

766
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,280
he was the only person doing anything like that.

767
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,400
1980s teen comedy soundtracks.

768
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,640
This soundtrack always felt the same to me as like when I would find a great

769
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,880
blazer at a thrift store that I could, I was like, oh, this is going to be me now.

770
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,400
We've talked about Prince, Boys to Men, Kendrick Lamar, and everything in between.

771
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,040
Heat Rocks, every Thursday here on Maximum Fun.

772
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:42,640
I got a haunted doll watch here.

773
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
It's fresh, fresh.

774
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,320
I'm seeing more people that are not willing to weave the fiction

775
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,680
selling a haunted doll would normally require.

776
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,720
What the fuck are they doing?

777
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,600
That's the whole thing.

778
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,240
That's like the whole-

779
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,520
It's a doll, whatever.

780
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,160
But I have, as an artist, we must, and our source material changes.

781
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,640
You know, if you're an artist who presents themselves in their autumnal photography,

782
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,440
when winter does eventually come, you have to find a way to adapt and apply those skills

783
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,920
to the fallen leaves and the frost covered branches.

784
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,400
And in much the same way, I have done this thing.

785
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,720
I do want to show you all the, oh, it's not that.

786
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,040
Let me share my screen real fast so you can see.

787
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,200
Okay, there we go.

788
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,560
Oh, fucking holy shit, Justin.

789
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
Look deep into its eyes, guys.

790
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
No, could you not?

791
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,280
It looks like, okay, this doll-

792
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,480
No.

793
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
The subject line is just, okay, I need to stop sharing my screen.

794
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,840
Yes, please.

795
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,720
The subject line on this doll is just haunted doll, negative spirit.

796
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,360
That's it.

797
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,000
That's all you get.

798
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,560
The doll itself looks like a baby version of Gene Hackman from Superman.

799
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:00,880
Yes.

800
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,160
Yes.

801
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,080
It's, again, it's like creepy, but in a little bit of a lazy way.

802
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,560
It looks like a doctored haunted doll.

803
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,160
The starting bid, and there's zero of them, is a dollar.

804
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,080
And it ends in three days.

805
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,480
So it will have expired by the time you get this.

806
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:29,360
So there's just kind of the eBay user HermaMcDon, maybe, put this description up.

807
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,760
And it just says this, upon receiving this negative spirit, my cat died.

808
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,800
What?

809
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,520
Upon receiving this negative spirit, my cat died as I was getting ready to go get Fletcher

810
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,480
from the mailbox.

811
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,520
That is the name of this doll, by the way.

812
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,320
It is great because what is great about this is one of this-

813
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,640
This is like, I want to take you inside a little bit now.

814
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:03,360
One of the pictures of this doll is the eBay listing from the time this person bought this

815
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,860
doll.

816
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,400
So it says haunted doll Fletcher, terrifying negative spirit, must go now.

817
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
We'll kill cats.

818
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,320
We'll kill cats.

819
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,360
From distance.

820
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,240
This person bought this and is like, oh, actually, no way.

821
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,440
No fucking way.

822
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,080
This sucks.

823
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
My cat died when I was going to pick up this doll.

824
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,720
You were right.

825
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,280
I'm sorry.

826
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,480
I didn't know what I was fucking with.

827
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,720
So they're trying to get it out in a hurry.

828
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,600
It said, upon receiving this negative spirit, my cat died as I was getting ready to go get

829
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,800
Fletcher from the mailbox.

830
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,080
Days later, washer broke and-

831
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,000
You're putting that on the same level?

832
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,680
I'm going to read you one sentence.

833
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,120
I love that washer.

834
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,040
I'm going to finish a sentence.

835
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,080
So the cat did die.

836
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,040
This is one sentence.

837
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:54,560
Days later, washer broke and car accident, hitting a tree, my stepson.

838
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,680
Oh my God.

839
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,000
How are we ranking these things by including them in the same breath?

840
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,200
Days later.

841
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,920
Hey, so how's your life going?

842
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
It's been kind of a wild few days.

843
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,120
Got a creepy doll and my cat died.

844
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,400
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

845
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,120
It's okay.

846
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,640
Oh, and well, my washer broke.

847
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,000
Well, that's more of a mild annoyance.

848
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,480
I don't know.

849
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,240
And also a car accident, hitting a tree, my stepson.

850
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,400
Yeah, I don't really know that you were driving your stepson as if he was some sort of turbo

851
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,240
teen into a tree?

852
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,600
Or it kind of sounds like you hit a tree and then went on to hit your stepson.

853
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,680
It's a small tree, a small tree, but a big son.

854
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,920
And I went through the first and rammed right damn right into the second.

855
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,240
Hit my sturdy stepson and fucked up the tree.

856
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,880
Son was fine.

857
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,200
I think tree caught most of the momentum of it.

858
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,840
Son was annoyed.

859
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,520
I just want my money back and peace of mind back.

860
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,640
It's like they don't want to be haunted by the negative spirit anymore, but they are

861
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,040
going to go ahead and get a return on the investment.

862
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,240
They're going to get the ROI.

863
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,840
And yes, I did buy this negative spirit on eBay.

864
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,120
Well, okay, so you've owned up to it at least.

865
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,160
That's something.

866
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,880
I do collect other paranormal dolls, but this one carries death with it.

867
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,160
Any questions?

868
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,960
Please ask.

869
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,160
A dollar.

870
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,600
Good luck.

871
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,800
I've seen enough.

872
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,080
That's the last sentence.

873
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,120
Good luck.

874
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,160
I've seen enough.

875
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,480
Here's, I do collect other paranormal dolls, but this one carries death with it.

876
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
Any questions?

877
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,800
Please ask.

878
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,520
I don't have any fucking questions.

879
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,200
I think you summed it up pretty good with, it carries death with it.

880
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,240
I think that's actually everything I needed to know.

881
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,200
This is a first.

882
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,280
This is the first time I've ever actually been even remotely scared by one of these

883
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,000
things because this description, this is, Justin's not kidding, that's the end of it.

884
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,800
The lack of sort of a three act narrative structure to this, as is usually the case in

885
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,960
these sales pitches, and sort of the last couple sentiments that they include in there

886
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,640
really sort of drives home the fiction that this is a person who has bought and sold haunted

887
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,080
dolls and we have a lot of fun here, folks, but this one is really full of death.

888
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,160
So I'm going to need this off my hands, Ace.

889
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,480
It's somebody breaking ka-fabe for a minute, like, listen, I know I talked about like,

890
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,080
oh, he was a doll and he died in a bank heist.

891
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,440
But my cat did die.

892
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,280
I ran over a tree and my son and that washer that I just bought.

893
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,200
I don't even have time to formulate a good sentence.

894
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,000
I really, I need this thing out.

895
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,680
It's fun talking about Stephanie and she can make orbs and she changes the radio to the

896
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,720
station she was listening to when she died in the car accident at prom night.

897
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,360
That's fun.

898
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:59,280
This one, this one killed, this one killed my cat and broke my washer and did a car accident

899
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,920
with my son, stepson into a tree, I guess.

900
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,720
Who I love.

901
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,760
I love very much.

902
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,880
I love him so much.

903
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,120
This has been a bad.

904
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,480
Yeah, I just need this fucking doll.

905
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
You are going to have to pay me for it, though.

906
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,840
But the fact that it is $1.

907
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,880
I'm not like, I'm a little bit scared of this.

908
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
I have, I have, I do have some fear.

909
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,440
You want it?

910
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,400
I'll get it for you.

911
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,520
No, I super, super don't.

912
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,120
Yeah, don't.

913
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,320
No, I don't want it.

914
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,760
You're buying it right now, aren't you?

915
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,920
No, I'm respecting you.

916
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,960
I'm old enough now.

917
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,200
I've been around the block enough times to know.

918
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,800
Um, how about another question?

919
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,320
Well, can I ask you guys a question?

920
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,760
Uh, sure.

921
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,600
This is not really the format, but okay.

922
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,160
You're right.

923
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,960
Okay.

924
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:45,120
Mini man scudthumper, maker of wood, worn wood, shrub-ruster, sky-mocker, rave,

925
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,040
poorly pusher, windslave.

926
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,920
What am I?

927
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,520
Yeah.

928
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,560
Oh, fuck me.

929
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,840
Yeah, we're back.

930
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,200
Riddle me this, boys.

931
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,000
Yeah, sure.

932
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,840
We need a stinger or something for the riddles.

933
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,160
What am I?

934
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,640
A kite.

935
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,880
No, dummy.

936
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,000
A balloon.

937
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,840
Stop being so dumb.

938
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,040
Justin?

939
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,080
I wanted to mention our friend Adderall Fye, who plays Chunt on Hello from the Magic Tavern,

940
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,160
started this great podcast called Hey Riddle Riddle.

941
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,760
It's a great show where he and two other great improv comedians solve lateral thinking puzzles

942
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,960
and it's very fun.

943
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,160
If you like riddles, you should check that show out.

944
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,760
If you hate riddles, welcome to our great segment.

945
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,680
Hey Riddle Riddle.

946
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,160
No, wait.

947
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,600
I don't think we should still-

948
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,040
Can I get you with riddle me piss?

949
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,080
Okay, riddle me piss.

950
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,800
That's excellent.

951
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,520
Okay.

952
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,160
So Travis-

953
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,680
Mini man scudthumper, maker of wood, shrub-ruster, sky-mocker-

954
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,080
Can you say the word comma?

955
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,280
Can you just say the word comma?

956
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,840
Yes.

957
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,480
Yes.

958
00:45:50,480 --> 00:46:00,400
Mini man scudthumper comma, maker of worn wood comma, shrub-ruster comma, sky-mocker comma,

959
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,560
rave exclamation point, portly pusher-

960
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,520
What's the last one?

961
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,400
What's that one?

962
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,120
What's that one?

963
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,680
What's that one?

964
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,180
Rave?

965
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:07,840
Rave?

966
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,880
Is just the one?

967
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,720
Rave exclamation point, portly pusher comma, wind slave, that's hyphenated, period.

968
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,600
What am I?

969
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,000
It's not a kite.

970
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,800
We've established it's not a kite.

971
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,440
I mean, but most of those things you said aren't fucking words.

972
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,000
So that feels like a bad thing to have in a riddle.

973
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,880
I'm just going to tell you now.

974
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,380
Okay.

975
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,000
It's the ocean, I guess.

976
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,840
Does it say that?

977
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,280
Holy shit, Travis.

978
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,480
That's the answer.

979
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,520
I know.

980
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:47,360
Hickory dickory dock, the mouse ran up the clock, the clock struck one,

981
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,000
then down did come.

982
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,240
Hickory dickory dock.

983
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,680
What am I?

984
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,120
A mouse?

985
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,120
No, dumb shit.

986
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,240
What is it?

987
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,080
The guillotine.

988
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,160
All right.

989
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,640
We got one sent to us actually by Matthew McGreevy.

990
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,200
Thanks, Matt.

991
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,960
This is the riddle.

992
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,080
You go into the woods to get it.

993
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,560
Then you sit down to find it.

994
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,640
Then you go home because you couldn't find it.

995
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,600
I have no idea.

996
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,000
Fish?

997
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,560
You go into the woods to get fish.

998
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,400
Then you sit down to find fish.

999
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,960
Then you go home because you couldn't find fish.

1000
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,240
Maybe, maybe.

1001
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,200
A place to sit.

1002
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,480
No, the answer is a splinter.

1003
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:36,960
What?

1004
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,880
Yeah, you go into the woods to get a splinter.

1005
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,360
And then you sit down to find the splinter.

1006
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,040
Then you go home because you couldn't find this.

1007
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,160
I can't find this fucking thing.

1008
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,720
I'm going home.

1009
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,320
Okay, here's a good one from riddles.com.

1010
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,720
You don't see me unless you heat me.

1011
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,080
You don't smell me unless you make me.

1012
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,840
You don't know I'm here until it's too late.

1013
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,920
I have seen countless generations and like parchment always magnifies my presence.

1014
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,480
What am I?

1015
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:10,720
What?

1016
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,280
It's just like they were trying to write something and they got halfway through and they're like,

1017
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,880
this is fucking nothing.

1018
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,640
I just want this riddle to be over with.

1019
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,760
I'm gonna read it again.

1020
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,440
You don't see me unless you heat me.

1021
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,840
You don't smell me unless you make me.

1022
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,640
You don't know I'm here until it's too late.

1023
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,800
I have seen countless generations and like parchment always magnifies my presence.

1024
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,360
What am I?

1025
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,480
I don't know.

1026
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,920
It's invisible ink, but like, what the fuck?

1027
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,960
Wait, that's it?

1028
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,000
It's just invisible ink is the thing on this one.

1029
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,720
What the actual shit?

1030
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,400
I, okay.

1031
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,000
I love this one because I, I'll just read it.

1032
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,600
I run, it runs.

1033
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,200
I stop, it runs.

1034
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,920
What it it?

1035
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,680
This is, I'm imagining like a wizard sitting on top of a mountain and I've climbed the mountain

1036
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,920
and I've come to get his orb because it's the only thing that will heal my wife.

1037
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,600
And I fought many sort of, uh, you know, skeletons along the way,

1038
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,240
but I've made it finally to the top of the wizard's mountain.

1039
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,880
And then he says, I run, it runs.

1040
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,640
I stop, it runs.

1041
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,680
What it it?

1042
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,400
Ah, fuck.

1043
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,360
I fucked it up.

1044
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,960
Man, you came a long way from my orb and I fucked up the riddle.

1045
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,840
Just take the orb.

1046
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,920
What it it?

1047
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,240
Um, a car?

1048
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,200
A car?

1049
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,520
Nope.

1050
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,120
My heart?

1051
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,320
Nope.

1052
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,640
Okay.

1053
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,040
Let me, I'll, I'll, I want to read them all together.

1054
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,840
I'll read you the clues to the answer.

1055
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,360
I run, it runs.

1056
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,720
I stop, it runs.

1057
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,080
My watch.

1058
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,840
My watch.

1059
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,520
My watch.

1060
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,080
All right.

1061
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,720
I think the rule of fives is, has carried us to the end of the riddle segment.

1062
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,440
Hey, this is the end of, uh, riddle me piss.

1063
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,600
I did just want to say real quick before we go.

1064
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,640
What is the best thing about Switzerland?

1065
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,040
Okay.

1066
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,640
What's the best thing about Switzerland?

1067
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,120
I don't know.

1068
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,840
What?

1069
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,360
Hey, it's a riddle.

1070
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,960
What's the best thing about Switzerland?

1071
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,600
Chocolate.

1072
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,200
The mountains are beautiful.

1073
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,120
Um, there's skiing.

1074
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,040
There's a lot of alpine sort of activities.

1075
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,560
Um, I don't know, but the flag's a big plus.

1076
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,560
Wait, is that on riddles.com?

1077
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,840
That's for riddles.com.

1078
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,360
And it's actually, it's actually just a joke.

1079
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,720
So it's not technically a riddle.

1080
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,080
So they still fucked it up.

1081
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,640
Should we do it?

1082
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,560
We've done one question and one Yahoo.

1083
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,600
And that doesn't seem great.

1084
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,320
Eight riddles.

1085
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,240
Cause this show loves riddles now.

1086
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,800
We're a riddle podcast now.

1087
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,320
This is a riddle podcast.

1088
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,400
It's a riddle podcast for riddlers.

1089
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,800
The only fun thing on earth is riddles.

1090
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,400
And I love riddles.

1091
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,280
I have a good Yahoo.

1092
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,720
Y'all want to hear it real quick?

1093
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,600
Sure, yeah.

1094
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,600
This is sent in by Emily Mercurio.

1095
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,000
Thank you.

1096
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,280
It's, uh, from a Yahoo answers user.

1097
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,240
Raven Hill asks,

1098
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,760
How to get over losing important JPEG pictures on your PC.

1099
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,200
Years ago I had some really cool pictures I got from some website in 2012.

1100
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,080
I can't remember if the pictures were on my Windows 7 laptop or my Windows 7 desktop PC

1101
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,760
or even my old Windows XP desktop which crashed and broke.

1102
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,400
But I've checked my laptop and Windows 7 PC

1103
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,360
and these cool pictures of demons are not on either.

1104
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,040
I'm not sure what happened to the pictures because I have so many files and pictures.

1105
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,360
But I put it down that they are likely lost forever.

1106
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,320
I can't remember what website I got the pictures from either.

1107
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,240
And the website's probably not around now.

1108
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,280
How do I get over this?

1109
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,120
I love art and pictures from the net.

1110
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,120
Okay, one more time.

1111
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,720
I'm not going to read all that again, Juice.

1112
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,360
But the pictures that I had on my PCs,

1113
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,560
there were some cool pictures of demons that I downloaded from the net.

1114
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,840
And I don't know where those went.

1115
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,440
I had some cool demon pictures.

1116
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,480
I had a bunch of very, very cool skeleton pictures with guns.

1117
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,280
And then I had a few pictures of some of my favorite Matrix characters.

1118
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,280
And they're not on the my PC anymore.

1119
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,120
And I don't even remember where I got them off the net.

1120
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,160
So how do I…

1121
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,000
I feel bad for this person because you could come onto my PC

1122
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,840
and delete like 23 to 27 of my pictures of Matrix characters.

1123
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,000
And I wouldn't even notice because I have so many saved.

1124
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,560
All right, my friend Dylan has a 56k and he downloaded it all for me for about $4.

1125
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,600
You can put him on a desk.

1126
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,960
What I do is I'll save like Neo and then also like Neo 1, Neo 2.

1127
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,240
And just save the same JPEG a couple times just in case.

1128
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,960
You got to.

1129
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,560
You have some backups in there.

1130
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,880
So it's like just try to delete all of my Neos.

1131
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,320
You won't even find them because some of them I named Morpheus.

1132
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,560
So I have a cloud account that I upload most of my Matrix stuff to.

1133
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,800
And I feel guilty about that because it feels kind of counter

1134
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,320
to what the Matrix guys were all about.

1135
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:04,640
Yes.

1136
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,040
You mean all the Matrix characters?

1137
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,080
Like if Morpheus found out you did this, Morpheus would be like, oh.

1138
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,240
Yeah, I put pictures of him on the cloud.

1139
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,880
It's like if I was in the Matrix and I, you know,

1140
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,960
was on the cool sewer ships that they were on because I got real,

1141
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,960
I would be like, I hate the cloud.

1142
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,760
Yeah.

1143
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,080
Yeah.

1144
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,560
Yeah, so I have that and then I have one just to be safe,

1145
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,640
like a flash drive, but it's a big one.

1146
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,200
It's like 300 megabytes or something.

1147
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,440
And it's full of like JPEGs I downloaded off the internet in the early 2000s.

1148
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,600
And I put that in a sort of Faraday cage in my garage just in case,

1149
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,040
like if there is the big one, then the pictures will,

1150
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,920
I could still look at them on, ah, shoot.

1151
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,480
I'm not going to be able to look at them on my computers

1152
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,480
because it's going to get, you know, fried up by the big one.

1153
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,000
But the good news about the big one is it's going to kill all the AI.

1154
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,800
Yeah.

1155
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,720
Can you imagine anything that would make you happier than being at your local library

1156
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,280
and seeing someone sitting at a computer scrolling through the Google image search results

1157
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,360
for cool pictures from the Matrix and just like, yep, good one.

1158
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,800
You're coming home with me.

1159
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,360
How much is it to print each one out?

1160
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,960
Yeah, that's fine.

1161
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,520
Yeah.

1162
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,400
Ten cents?

1163
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:18,880
Okay.

1164
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,880
Just hand them a credit card and like keep it running.

1165
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,320
I'm going to be-

1166
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,360
Open a tab.

1167
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,000
Open a tab.

1168
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,080
We're going to be printing out a lot of these bad boys.

1169
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,800
Do you have three hole punch?

1170
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,960
Thank you.

1171
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,000
Can you keep a secret?

1172
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,920
Don't tell anybody how many of these I'm about to print out

1173
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,040
because it's going to be absolutely ludicrous.

1174
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:50,640
If work gets out, I'll never be able to show my face in city council again.

1175
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,520
Just frame them.

1176
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,960
Just frame them.

1177
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,760
Yeah, it was a two for one at Michael's.

1178
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,360
I just had them all taken care of.

1179
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,200
This one's kind of my pride and joy.

1180
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:08,720
They've cut the pictures in the shape of the letters M-A-T-T-R-I-X

1181
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,400
and they've cut the photos out like that.

1182
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,360
And I did have a talk with them about the spelling thing

1183
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,760
because that is hugely embarrassing for me.

1184
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,720
I can't even have my nephews over because they make such terrible fun of me

1185
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,800
for my misspelled matrix collage.

1186
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,080
But I do want to-

1187
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,520
I want them to be proud of me.

1188
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,680
I want to be proud of their uncle.

1189
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,520
But I'm so embarrassed.

1190
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,320
But not so embarrassed that I won't display it in my home

1191
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,680
because it is a treasure.

1192
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,480
I did pay to have those printed out at the library.

1193
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,280
So I'm thinking of turning my- changing my name to Matt

1194
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,200
just so it makes a little more sense.

1195
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,600
Right.

1196
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,880
Then people will at least be like,

1197
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,280
oh, it's a thing, but you didn't used to be Matt.

1198
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,360
And I'll say, or maybe it's a glitch in the matrix.

1199
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:49,840
Matrix.

1200
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,280
And we'll all have a good laugh.

1201
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,920
Anyways, that's why I didn't see that parking meter and I didn't pay it.

1202
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,680
Please, please cancel this ticket or whatever you need to do.

1203
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,840
I know I haven't seen the Matrix movies.

1204
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:09,120
At this point, I feel like I have though.

1205
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,400
You understand your honor?

1206
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,240
I got a lot of collectible stuff from like McDonald's and such.

1207
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,720
And at this point, I'm pretty much pieced it together.

1208
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,000
Quick side story.

1209
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
When I was in seventh grade, I was in our middle school library

1210
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,760
where I did spend most of my lunches.

1211
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,960
And the story is not going to be sad the whole way through,

1212
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,720
but just sort of during this part of it.

1213
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,000
You know what?

1214
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,400
It might be sad the whole way through depending on how you look at it.

1215
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,880
But I did print out a GameFAQs walkthrough for Pokemon Gold and Silver.

1216
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,720
And I didn't realize when I did that, that it was going to be about 290 pages long.

1217
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,640
Holy shit, this is going to need such strength.

1218
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,640
I got in a lot of trouble.

1219
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,480
And I was sort of a volunteer at the middle school library.

1220
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,120
And I was not invited back the following year

1221
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,320
because I did get a stern talking to…

1222
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,880
Because this is not a good heist because it was a dot matrix printer.

1223
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,800
Oh god, it's just that grueling noise.

1224
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,400
So that was like two days?

1225
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,160
Yeah, it was a good long time.

1226
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
I did not get the full print going.

1227
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,720
I think I got about 60 pages in before the librarian came over like,

1228
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,400
you've been printing for a long…

1229
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,600
What's a Cubone?

1230
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,040
And I was like, oh, here I go.

1231
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,240
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

1232
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,960
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1233
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,800
Trav, did you have some things you want to talk about real quick?

1234
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,760
I know the big one, the big thing.

1235
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,120
Let's start with that.

1236
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,840
So a lot of announcements, but all of these,

1237
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,960
at least all of like the dates of appearances and stuff,

1238
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,160
that's all going to be on mcroyshows.com slash tours.

1239
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,440
So I want to move through it pretty quick.

1240
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,680
But the big announcement is at the end of September, September 26th to the 28th,

1241
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,600
we are coming to Seattle and Portland on September 26th.

1242
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,000
We're coming to Seattle with my brother, my brother and me, September 27th.

1243
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,960
It's the Adventure Zone, both of those at the Paramount Theater.

1244
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,160
And then on September 28th, we're going to be in Portland at the Schnitzer Concert Hall

1245
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,760
with my brother, my brother and me.

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,680
Those are going on sale this Friday at 10 a.m. local time.

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:18,000
So it'll be 10 a.m. local to Seattle and Portland on sale Friday the 17th at 10 a.m.

1248
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,040
Pacific, it's Pacific time.

1249
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,720
Yeah, Pacific time, 10 a.m. Pacific.

1250
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm just reading the thing.

1251
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,240
So you'll have some time to get ready.

1252
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,040
So we have a couple days, but this Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific.

1253
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Now I'm going to run through these really quick.

1254
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,840
So dad and I are going to be in Leicington, Kentucky this Saturday the 18th at 2 p.m.

1255
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,840
at Joseph Beth Booksellers to sign copies of the Adventure Zone graphic novel.

1256
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,760
That'll be the day after my vasectomy, so make sure to ask both of them how it went.

1257
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,760
We are doing the tour at the end of the month in Orlando in August.

1258

All right, sorry, Orlando and Atlanta, so make sure you send in your questions.

1259
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,960
And then while I'm there, I'm going to be doing some stuff at Dragon Con.

1260
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,320
I've already announced the photo sessions, and I'm also doing some other stuff that we haven't

1261
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,160
nailed down yet, but I'll be at Dragon Con.

1262
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,120

I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1278
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1279
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,800
It's such a good album, and I really like it a lot.

1280
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,960
And all the Long Winters albums are really dope,

1281
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,360
but this is the only one that has our theme song on it.

1282
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,440
I also want to thank Max Fun for having us on the network.
