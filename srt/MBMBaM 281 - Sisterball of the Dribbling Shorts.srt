1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And guys, Griffin, I'm changing.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,320
I feel a spirit of renewal in my heart of hearts that has got me excited.

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
Today's the first day of the rest of my life.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
Is this like a holiday? Like, Ebenezer Scrooge, they did it all in one night?

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,760
Yes, it's kind of like that. Yes, it's kind of like that.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,520
Except if instead of three ghosts spooking me good, spooking my bones.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,440
Spooking you into good, spooking, turning you good.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,720
Just spooking me, just raw dogging me with their spooky spirits.

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,760
Instead of that happening to me in the night time, during the daytime yesterday,

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,440
I became the world's number one basketball boy.

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,760
What?

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,000
What?

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,920
I went to a college basketball game in which college age athletes play basketball.

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
They do basketball against each other.

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
You mean big kids?

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah, like big, big kids. And like, I didn't know I had it in me

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
to love this new thing, or any new thing for that matter.

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,080
But specifically this new thing, I always thought basketball was the final frontier.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
And there I was standing there, hooping and hollering.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
And you enjoyed it.

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
Oh, I loved every second of it.

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
I yelled with every dunk, with every achieved-

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,120
Funk?

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
With every funk and every achieved rebound.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,400
How about every clunk? That's what they miss.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
Well, I wasn't cheering for the clunks. No, Travis, I-

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
That was a test.

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
It was a test.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
I was. Every time they missed a shot, I would yell at a referee.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
Listen, I didn't know what I was doing out there.

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,520
You were yelling at a college referee, Griffin? That seems mean.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,240
Aren't they just like philosophy professors?

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,720
Yes, they are double duty school nurses.

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,600
But anyway, I am the ultimate hoops fan in the world.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,120
I don't know anything about it.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
I don't know anything about the sport, really.

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,880
Like they kept getting double bonuses and I wasn't sure what that was exactly.

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,600
Sure.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,920
But you don't need to know the most about it.

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,160
You just have to have the most passion in your heart for it.

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
And I'm just saying like right now that I'm a bigger basketball fan

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
than basically anybody listening to this podcast.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
Would you say that you have March Madness?

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,880
I definitely have. I got December diarrhea is what I have.

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,600
Did you-

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,960
December dementia.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,120
Yes.

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
As far as you could tell, Griffin, did anybody fake the funk on a nasty dunk?

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
Oh, good question.

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
There was only one dunk in the whole game.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
Okay.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,560
But there was a lot of fundamentals and they did not fake the funk on their funk-dementals.

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
Now, Griffin, let me ask you this.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,560
Yes, ask me.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,880
Was there a player-

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,200
Please, please.

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,440
I want the two of you to just keep asking me questions in order.

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Travis, it's your turn.

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Was there a player who made two shots in a row and then the announcer yelled,

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
he's on fire?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,480
Oh, sorry.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,280
He's heating up.

70
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
Let me tell you this.

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Whenever your team scores two buckets and drains two tasty buckets in a row,

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
two 10 piece wing buckets in a row,

73
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
then everybody in the crowd would stand up and start cheering.

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
And part of me wondered like, oh, shit, here come that infinite turbo meter.

75
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
Here come them fiery nets.

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,760
But I don't think that they managed to do that in real life, no.

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
And then Bill Clinton came out and he was an unlockable character and he played.

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,400
And he played.

79
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,000
I was wearing my basketball shorts because I wasn't sure what's customary to wear to a game.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,440
Well, like you take a mitt to a baseball game in case you want to catch a fly ball.

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,680
Right.

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,080
I thought in case they threw a basketball in the crowd and then I caught it.

83
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,760
And then like, technically, that's a live ball.

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,080
So I'm like, what am I, center now, point guard?

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,400
See, I guess I do know a little bit about the beautiful sport.

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
You're a leftist.

87
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,040
I think that's one, when you stand on the left side and you guard.

88
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,600
Uh-huh.

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
Griffin, would you like people to directly email you some of their favorite teams

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
and different moves in basketball?

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,160
I'd rather not.

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,840
Or to make you like some of their favorite players or different favorite basketball moves?

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
I don't really want to money the water right now.

94
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,080
With knowledge, you don't need facts.

95
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,240
No, it would be, facts are fine.

96
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm not looking, I don't want to know about opinions.

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't want to know any opinions on the names of what players are.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,720
I just, I want to, I want my joy to be sort of, I want it to go unperturbed.

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,880
And I want to just explore this new facet of myself, which is why starting next year,

100
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
I am leaving the podcast.

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,800
Oh, okay.

102
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,400
To explore my basketball fantasies in a new podcast I'm launching called Basketball Fantasies.

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,200
It's going to be so confusing because people are going to go to it for fancy basketball tips.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
It's going to be me like, what if you could score a three-point dunk?

105
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
Now listen, here's how it works.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,040
I just picture Griffin out in like Joshua Tree, just like staring at a basketball,

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,440
sitting on a bluff and just like thinking about like, what is dunking?

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,960
Like, what does it mean?

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
What does it mean to dunk?

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,440
Because it doesn't have to, I feel like it's different things to different people.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,880
For me, when I'm confronted by a friend that I've wronged and I tell the truth,

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,480
that's a sick dunk right there.

113
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,360
When a referee like really calls a foul that no one else saw, did the referee just like dunk?

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
Yeah, you did get dunked on by the ref.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,720
I, people get very excited about dunks, but really,

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
aren't you just carrying the basketball to the hoop?

117
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,200
Wouldn't it be harder to throw it?

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,440
Yeah.

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,000
I agree.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,640
Thanks.

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,440
Good point, Justin.

122
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,600
And I'm sorry, but I don't think you should be like, if they lift you up,

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
if your team players put you on your shoulders and then you dunk,

124
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
I don't think that should count.

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,800
That shouldn't be allowed now.

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,320
Do you think maybe in 2016, we could do all themed episodes like every week,

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,640
do a different theme just to like mix it up a little bit?

128
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Because I would, I'll be honest with you guys right now,

129
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,320
I would do anything, I would pay any price to keep talking about basketball for the next 54 minutes.

130
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,800
Yeah.

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,920
That's how, this is such an interesting, I believe it's 180, where-

132
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm learning so much.

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, where it gets to a point where if I'm not mistaken, like two years ago,

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,760
I think you hated sports.

135
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,560
Yeah, I'm learning so much from myself, which is the weird thing.

136
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,120
You know what I mean?

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,960
We've all grown.

138
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
This is like Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 3,

139
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
where they just go to basketball games for the whole movie.

140
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,080
Yeah.

141
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
Sisterhood of the Traveling Huge Basketball Shorts.

142
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,440
Well, Sister Ball, Sister Ball, Sister Ball-

143
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
Sister Ball 3.

144
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Sorry, Emilio S. M. S. as a no-nonsense, disgraced lawyer with a team of sisters.

145
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,480
Sister Ball of the Dribbling Shorts.

146
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,840
You gotta share the ball.

147
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,160
What?

148
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
You can share the ball?

149
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,000
That's crazy.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,120
You can't travel.

151
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,200
I did pick up on that during the game.

152
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,160
You cannot travel.

153
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
You have to dribble and you have to be wearing shorts

154
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,560
and you have to be in possession of the sister ball,

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,840
because that's the only way you can score.

156
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
You can't score without the sister ball.

157
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,040
What is the legal wait time before eating neglected household foods?

158
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,760
For example, if my significant other purchases cookies

159
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,680
and neglects to eat them for two weeks,

160
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,640
am I within my rights to go to town on those cookies?

161
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
I stole the cookies from the cookie jar,

162
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
is the name of the person who asked the question,

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
but also something that they're admitting.

164
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Okay, hold on.

165
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay, hold on.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
Your significant other bought it, right?

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,040
And then they sat untouched for two weeks?

168
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,720
Two weeks?

169
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
It would seem that way, yes.

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,280
Was the significant other waiting for a special cookie?

171
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah, you can have a cookie.

172
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,160
Are they Thanksgiving cookies?

173
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
Do they maybe have a turkey on them?

174
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
Oh, this is a good question,

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
because there's different forms of cookie.

176
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Was this just like your chewy chocolate chip cookie?

177
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,680
Or was this like,

178
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,200
I bought a 10 of those Danish cookies for that Christmas party

179
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,520
we're going to have in, I guess, three weeks,

180
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,920
but they were cheaper now because it's November 2nd.

181
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,240
And like, what?

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,960
This is madness.

183
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,760
This is, none of this,

184
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,560
I put my cookies in a fucking safety deposit box in a bank.

185
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,680
What are you talking about?

186
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,400
No, this is-

187
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Super quick flash poll.

188
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,440
Can I get a thumbs up or thumbs down on dance butter cookies?

189
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,800
Oh, big thumbs up.

190
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,440
Thumbs up, right?

191
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,720
They're delicious and grumbly.

192
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,920
With a cream or a liquid that you can have them with.

193
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,560
Oh, definitely.

194
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
They're a great nog partner.

195
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
Yes, they are a good friend to the eggnog.

196
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,360
But-

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Because also you're left with a 10 afterwards,

198
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
and who doesn't love a 10?

199
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
Yeah, you can put anything in that, marbles.

200
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,760
Listen, we need to aim any advice we give on this question

201
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
to any other person than this person.

202
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
Because this person isn't looking for advice,

203
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
they are looking for either forgiveness or acceptance.

204
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
And I'm not willing to give you that because you did not wait.

205
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,400
The fact that you did not wait means that

206
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,160
it's not that important to you what we think,

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
you bad, bad cookie boy.

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,360
But most of the time, you just ask them.

209
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
Why can't you just ask them, can I eat some cookies?

210
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Yeah, why do you need us to give you cooklematic permission?

211
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm sorry, but like, if you're in a relationship

212
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
in which like you share love,

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
you're allowed to have a goddamn cookie.

214
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,080
Like, I don't know what relationship that would be

215
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,960
where you would describe someone as your significant other,

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,600
but not when it came to cookie sharing,

217
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
unless they know you as the type of person who sits down

218
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,960
to like watch, you know, seven hours of Parks and Rec

219
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,920
and eat an entire sleeve of cookies in one go.

220
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,800
That could be what happened.

221
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,360
And that's not how love works, Travis,

222
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,160
to say like, love means never having to say,

223
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,880
can I have this?

224
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
What you've just said is madness.

225
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,320
Cause if you buy yourself a hoagie and you turn around

226
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
and Teresa has eaten the entire hoagie

227
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,840
and she can't just shrug her shoulders

228
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,320
and be like, marriage.

229
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,360
Because she's warm a dick.

230
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,160
Because she thinks she's feeble.

231
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,120
But the problem is, girl,

232
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
when you're talking about a one-off food experience,

233
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,440
cookies, that's like,

234
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,960
if you sit down and eat an entire family size bag of Cheetos,

235
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,160
A, I'm worried about you,

236
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
but B, like clearly that was a shared experience.

237
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
But if I go to the store and I get a single bag of Cheetos

238
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
and you eat all of them, yeah, you're terrible.

239
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
So then you bought a Quiznos party platter

240
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
and you're planning on having,

241
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
I know you, six to seven of those little sumbitches.

242
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,960
That's why you get small ones.

243
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Yeah, but unfortunately, uh-oh,

244
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
when you weren't looking, Teresa Duke snarfed them.

245
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,040
Whoops.

246
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,800
Now, and you're just cool with that?

247
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Because it's like, well, marriage, love, it means sharing.

248
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,480
I will say that in this specific example,

249
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,160
I'm very cool with it because for once,

250
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
I'm not the food monster in our house.

251
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,680
So yeah, I think I'd be like,

252
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
thank you for taking some of the heat off of me.

253
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
She learned it from watching you.

254
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
She learned it from watching you, though.

255
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,840
I think the worst food monster stunt I ever did

256
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,800
was when I was a young boy, perhaps 12 years old,

257
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,720
and I was reading in my parents' closet,

258
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
looking for God knows what.

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,080
What do you look for in your parents' closets

260
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,040
when you're a kid?

261
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,480
Forgiveness something.

262
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
And what did I find there?

263
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,880
But a couple of delicious bubblegum cigars.

264
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a boy, and I found one, and I ate it all up.

265
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,080
What was the significance of that?

266
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, it was purchased upon my birth.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,120
It was purchased when I was born.

268
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,600
So it was not only a food monster, but old and gross.

269
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Yeah, it's like, I just ate the special bubblegum cigar

270
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,120
for my birth.

271
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
That they were saving for your wedding?

272
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,280
Well, this is a good question, Travis,

273
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,960
that I have posed to Dad over the years.

274
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,400
What were you saving that for?

275
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm glad somebody got to enjoy it, you know?

276
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,840
But you ate it.

277
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,800
You did not chew it.

278
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,360
You ate it.

279
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,400
You consumed it.

280
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,840
Well, I mean, I swallowed bubblegum.

281
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm not an animal.

282
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
I live evil can evil one hand at a time.

283
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
So yeah, I ate the bubblegum,

284
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,040
the special, special bubblegum cigar

285
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,800
that bots celebrate and commemorate.

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,720
Could you taste like sort of the warm memories

287
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
that you were depriving our-

288
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
It tastes like the Reagan administration.

289
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,920
Is that what you're asking?

290
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,640
Yes.

291
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,480
And how old were you when this bubblegum

292
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
was consumed like food?

293
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
12, 12, 12, 12.

294
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,560
Oh no, way too old.

295
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,600
Damn, son.

296
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,640
12 years.

297
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,200
This is not-

298
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
12 is too old to go on bubblegum adventures.

299
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,840
This was old enough that if it had been at Griffin's birth,

300
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,880
it would have been gross.

301
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Yeah, but here's the other thing about it.

302
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
It tasted fine.

303
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,800
To my memory, it tasted fine.

304
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,240
There's not a lot of like love lost, flavor lost

305
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,920
when it comes to bubblegum.

306
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
It's not like, oh, I found an eight-year-old thing

307
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
of Bazooka Joe, it's spoiled.

308
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,660
Yeah.

309
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,080
You just microwave it for two seconds and it's perfect.

310
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,800
Uh, yeah.

311
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,400
I had another answer about bubblegum,

312
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,600
but I think we should move on.

313
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
No, I do want to hear it.

314
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,240
Is it as bad as the last one you told?

315
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
Because if so, I need it, I think.

316
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,760
He found a cigar that says,

317
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,480
congratulations on signing the Declaration of Independence.

318
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,280
Yeah.

319
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,600
And I broke into the Smithsonian so I could eat it.

320
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,880
National Treasure III.

321
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
Justin took the Declaration of Independence

322
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
and the Constitution and he spread a fine layer

323
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,040
of queso cheese in between the two of them

324
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
and threw it in the microwave for a minute and a half

325
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,200
and then ate it with a salsa on top.

326
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
And then Kate said, no.

327
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,320
It was freedom nachos.

328
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,280
I mean, it was special.

329
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,640
Do you guys want a yahoo?

330
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah, please.

331
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
Wait, no, your bubblegum story.

332
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,920
Is it really good?

333
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,520
It wasn't about a bubblegum story,

334
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,160
it was about a bubblegum book I read when I was a kid

335
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,640
about a kid who bought baseball cards

336
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,680
but hated the bubblegum,

337
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
the old chewy crumbling pubens nasty gum that came with them.

338
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,960
And so he left them all like in a big lump

339
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,040
in a big pile that it turned into a monster.

340
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,320
And that story made me want gum so bad

341
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
and I didn't have any.

342
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,360
This was in 86.

343
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
For me, it was the episode of Wild and Crazy Kids

344
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
where they had an episode contest

345
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,720
where they had to chew that like big,

346
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
what are those big bubblegums called?

347
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,440
I think it might have been like flavored double bubble,

348
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
like multi-flavored bubblegum.

349
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,120
And they would have to chew it up and put it on a scale

350
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
and whichever team got the heaviest amount

351
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,480
of chewed bubblegum on the scale would win.

352
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
And I would see that and that bubblegum,

353
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,600
that chewed bubblegum looks so delicious.

354
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,200
And that's when I realized I'm a broken person

355
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
and also that that's my fetish.

356
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,280
Do you guys want a yahoo?

357
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,640
I used to chew up a bunch and get a big wad

358
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,120
and then I'd get a new piece and bite it in half

359
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
and put the wad inside of that piece and close it up.

360
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,520
So it was like a planet, gum planet with a magma.

361
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,360
What's the matter with both of you?

362
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,040
Welcome to gum planet.

363
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,600
I can hear our audience collectively retching.

364
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,400
Welcome to John Carpenter's gum planet.

365
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,960
It's a terrifying new vision of gum

366
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,480
for John Carpenter, the mastermind behind the fly.

367
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,240
That's probably David Cronenberg and John Carpenter's vampires.

368
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm pretty sure that's John Carpenter.

369
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,320
Do you guys want this yahoo from-

370
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,520
I've been begging.

371
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,720
It's from level 9,000-

372
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,200
Please God.

373
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,560
Level 9,000 Yajur Juju Javanport.

374
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you, Drew.

375
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,520
It's by an anonymous user, but we're going to call him

376
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,840
Melton.

377
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,040
Melton asks, would it be a violation of any rules

378
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,600
to read questions and answers of yahoo answers on my podcast?

379
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,560
Oh, no.

380
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,520
Uh-oh.

381
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,760
I figured this would be a quick one.

382
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,360
Then we can move on to a real one.

383
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,880
But it's an important legal query

384
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,240
that I feel like we need to tackle.

385
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,200
Uh, well.

386
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,520
Somebody said, because the top answer is from-

387
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,720
Wow, just looking at-

388
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,280
Oh my God.

389
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,400
It's from-

390
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,120
Oh my God.

391
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,400
What could only be safely described

392
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,920
as a yahoo answers power user, Oclatom,

393
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,400
who has answered 77,411 questions.

394
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,760
He's got, okay.

395
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,680
He's got a full-on command center of people.

396
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
It's like, what do you got for me today?

397
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,200
We got another 1,000 yahoo answers questions.

398
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
He's got 514,003 points.

399
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
He's only level 7.

400
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,080
It's like, what the fuck's up with your experience scale?

401
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,240
Because that's a lot of points and questions

402
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
to only be level 7.

403
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
Is it like Scientology where there's only the 7 levels

404
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,760
and he's like the king of it?

405
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
I can't imagine that there is a more active user

406
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,440
on this service.

407
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,520
So I'm going to take their word for gospel

408
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,160
and their word is as long as you had permission

409
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
from the authors of the content to use it,

410
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
it would not be a violation.

411
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
If you didn't have their permission,

412
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
remember yahoo has a license to publish it.

413
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,680
You don't see their copyright policy.

414
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,200
There's no planet on which you're going to reach out

415
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,760
to people who are on the yahoo answer service

416
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
and get into personal content.

417
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,720
Is this Spankatron 5,000 yahoo answers user?

418
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,960
Could I use your question about your fetish towards Batman?

419
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,080
Thank you so much.

420
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,360
To whom it may concern,

421
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,320
don't worry about our tone in discussing

422
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,240
your home colonoscopy.

423
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,880
It will be respectful and scientific.

424
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
And we think that people can really learn from,

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,280
that's how we pitch it, right?

426
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,960
Like we want to take the lesson that you have learned

427
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,000
and we want to spread that wisdom

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
to as wide an audience as we can, right?

429
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,120
That makes sense.

430
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,680
Like we want to take your learnings

431
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,480
and we want to signal boost it.

432
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,840
I feel like it should be public access.

433
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
I feel like if you want to write a movie

434
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
based on a yahoo answer,

435
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,840
you should be allowed to do that.

436
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,600
You mean public domain?

437
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,400
Yes, that's what I meant.

438
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,720
Thank you.

439
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,320
Yahoo answer is just running an advertiser right now

440
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,680
for the ridiculous six.

441
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,600
It looks very bad.

442
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,440
I saw that on Netflix.

443
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
I almost jumped out of my skin.

444
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
I was so excited.

445
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,880
I couldn't believe it.

446
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,680
It was actually out.

447
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,600
I can finally watch it myself.

448
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
Guys, am I gonna watch that?

449
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,640
No.

450
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,920
Am I going to prison?

451
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,880
Yes.

452
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,280
For copyright theft.

453
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
I would like to say at this point,

454
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,680
2.51 PM, Sunday, December 13th, 2015,

455
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,720
I have thought for the past five and a half years

456
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,720
that Griffin had written every yahoo answer himself

457
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,680
as a work of fiction.

458
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,200
And I thought that they were all works of fiction.

459
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,680
This is my first time hearing anything about

460
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,360
that these were real questions

461
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,400
and not invented whole cloth by Griffin.

462
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,920
I had nothing to do with this.

463
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,560
It's all on Griffin.

464
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Could I get away on parody rules?

465
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
What if instead of calling it yahoo answers,

466
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,000
I called it like yahoo butsers?

467
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,400
That's not very good.

468
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,960
Let me try this.

469
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
Yahoo answers.

470
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,040
Let me throw this out there.

471
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,560
Fair use.

472
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,000
Fair use, a lot of people don't know what that means.

473
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
It's a complicated legal idea that you can do

474
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,360
pretty much whatever you want.

475
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,160
Oh, it's like when you write cash on a check.

476
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,920
A thing that I don't know that any human being

477
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,160
has ever done outside of movies and TV shows

478
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
that basically allows anyone to use that check ever?

479
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah, I can have the cash.

480
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
Yeah, it's like the other day,

481
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
I saw something through my neighbor's window

482
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
that I wanted, so I fair used into their house

483
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,280
and I just took it.

484
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,040
That's what fair use is.

485
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,360
And then he caught me doing it

486
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,800
and so I just fair used him right there and left.

487
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,320
What's more powerful, fair use or squatters rights?

488
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,680
Squatters rights is just fair use of a house.

489
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,040
Oh, okay.

490
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,640
I saw that my neighbors were using their popcorn

491
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,440
making machine and stand to sell popcorn

492
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
and the fair was in town and I thought I could make

493
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080
a quick buck so I just borrowed it and took it there

494
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,160
and they were pretty mad but when I told them

495
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,800
what I used it for, they thought it was fine.

496
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,480
Yeah, fair use.

497
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,540
I gotcha.

498
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,920
I fair used some black tar heroin yesterday

499
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,800
and then I drove a car just like through a hospital.

500
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,040
I fair used it really good that day.

501
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,320
I parked it and left it.

502
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,280
Fair use, bye.

503
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,160
Here's another question.

504
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,840
A large package came in the mail yesterday.

505
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,400
It's a Christmas present for me from my wife

506
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,920
or someone in her family.

507
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,640
She keeps goading me to open it but I'm a baby.

508
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
I love to wait till Christmas Eve to open presents.

509
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,040
Now that it sounds like you almost wait long enough.

510
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,200
I assume you mean Christmas day.

511
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
The thing is we're flying to see our family over Christmas

512
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
and she says it's too heavy.

513
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,840
It don't make no sense to bring the gift there with us.

514
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
Yeah, okay, yes.

515
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,600
And also I'm 95% sure I know what it is

516
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
and I really want to use it now

517
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
and not when we get back in January.

518
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,040
That's in all caps.

519
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,240
Jamie, you're eight years old.

520
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,120
What should I do?

521
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,600
Jamie.

522
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Jamie, you are absolutely,

523
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
you and I are on the same wavelength.

524
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
Your puckish charm has won us over, Jamie.

525
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
Oh my God, yes.

526
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Because yeah, if you're not gonna wait

527
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,920
until the day of the Christ child's birth,

528
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,720
like why are we doing any of this?

529
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,480
Then it's just an Amazon shipment.

530
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,080
Yeah, then it's just one of like 70 Amazon receipt days

531
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
that you have throughout the year.

532
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,520
This is, it's gotta be special.

533
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,960
It's gotta be Christmas special.

534
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,160
If we can just part the kimono for a second.

535
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,280
This is a gigantic issue

536
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
that we have been struggling with in our family

537
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,960
for the past five years and has come to a head this year.

538
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,440
Yeah.

539
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,480
Where we're faced with like,

540
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,080
I would say some equally unappealing solutions

541
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,800
to the problem.

542
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,840
Cool.

543
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,920
Solution one being like,

544
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,760
we give presents to Travis and Griffin.

545
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,960
We have them shipped here and just pretend

546
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,560
like we think they live here.

547
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,080
That's what we've been doing.

548
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,320
Yeah.

549
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,440
And the other one is like,

550
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,200
we ship presents to them

551
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,520
and then give them a picture of the presents

552
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,960
and be like, just you wait till you see it in person.

553
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,440
Oh boy.

554
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
I can't wait till there's VR.

555
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,680
We can all just VR open presents.

556
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,280
I mean, one option, another option is like,

557
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,880
we Skype, like video Skype to watch them open it.

558
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,440
No, that'll never happen.

559
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
If you're gonna go through that much fucking trouble

560
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
to watch somebody open a present,

561
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,240
then like your dad better be home from the war early.

562
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,720
You know what I mean?

563
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,400
Like it better be a giant box that you open

564
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,080
and it's like a viral video.

565
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
Like that's the level it needs to be.

566
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,200
Justin, you make an excellent point.

567
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
If your dad is home from the war early

568
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,280
and in that giant box that your family shipped you,

569
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
you should open it before January.

570
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,240
Put some holes in there.

571
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,720
Something.

572
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:36,800
For sure.

573
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,920
Give them a juice box.

574
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,080
Those viral videos, by the way,

575
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640
have made it impossible to buy large gifts

576
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
for anybody who has family in the armed services.

577
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,160
Because it's like, could it be?

578
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,800
Is it?

579
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,080
It's a basketball hoop.

580
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,200
Fuck.

581
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,920
It is a deconstructed basketball hoop.

582
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,880
No, that would be tight.

583
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,520
Are you kidding?

584
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,640
Fuck my dad.

585
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
Hoop dreams.

586
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,640
Hoop fantasies.

587
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,320
What better gift could there be for your dad

588
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
than when he gets home from overseas?

589
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
You're fucking sick of basketball.

590
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,720
Yeah.

591
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,320
You're like the king of dunks.

592
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,560
It's all been worth it.

593
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,680
Freedom is in free.

594
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,440
Yeah, this is what I've been fighting to defend.

595
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,520
But then he's like, tell me-

596
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,480
Sweet dunks.

597
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
But then he's like, tell me about this sick new sport.

598
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
And then he tells 10 friends,

599
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,480
oh, basketball, I will be your chosen one,

600
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,880
your chosen brother.

601
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm glad that my brother, my brother and me

602
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
has finally been able to get the word out about basketball.

603
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
Let's part the kimono even more.

604
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,680
Because right now-

605
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,200
Let's just take the kimono off.

606
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,880
I'm taking the kimono off and guess what?

607
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
There's nothing under there.

608
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,800
It's all my meat.

609
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,400
And I want to part the kimono and take it off

610
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
because we're doing Christmas this year on the 23rd

611
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,280
because Travis and Teresa are bouncing on the 24th.

612
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
See, I thought we were doing the 22nd

613
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,880
because we're going caroling on the 23rd.

614
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,320
We're doing it all.

615
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,560
We need to be in better contact.

616
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Regardless, we're not doing it on the 25th.

617
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,800
And in my child mind,

618
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm going to fully be on Christmas day

619
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,200
after Travis has left

620
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
and we've already opened all of our presents.

621
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,760
You know your boy is gonna be looking around

622
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
for that secret extra big present

623
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,800
that everybody held off to give me

624
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,560
until the day of the Christ child's birth.

625
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,280
It'll be like,

626
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,960
oh, it looks like we got one more

627
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,840
special Christmas day surprise for you, Griffin.

628
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,680
So just to put that seed and bury it deep in your guys' minds,

629
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,760
I am going to be expecting that second extra wave of presents.

630
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,680
It could just be one present, but make it nice.

631
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
Griffin, what if you just got really super blackout drunk

632
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,440
before we opened Christmas presents on the 23rd?

633
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
And then when you passed out,

634
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,000
we would rewrap them for you.

635
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,800
And then you could have the whole experience over again

636
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
on the 25th.

637
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
I would enjoy that.

638
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
I love the crinkle of paper.

639
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
You know, I've never gotten really drunk on Christmas before.

640
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,680
Maybe this is the year.

641
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,080
America.

642
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,440
I'm gonna need your help in the kitchen.

643
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,280
I'd rather you didn't get super drunk on Christmas.

644
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,680
I'm gonna need your help with the bread sauce

645
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,360
and a few other things.

646
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,840
I got it all.

647
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
I got a chart somewhere, but I'm gonna need your help.

648
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,680
I will be drunk, but normal base level drunk.

649
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,080
Oh, that's right.

650
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,960
We're doing our English...

651
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,360
We're taking it to Toffee Town, right?

652
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,760
What's up?

653
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
Taking it straight to Toffee Town,

654
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
going Christmas lunch,

655
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
going the whole production.

656
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,080
We're doing Goose.

657
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,200
We're making a bread sauce.

658
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,800
Got a sage and onion stuffing.

659
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,860
Got a...

660
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,980
Gonna do...

661
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,640
Probably do a Vicky Sp- Vicky Sponge.

662
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,040
Nice.

663
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,160
Gonna hit a...

664
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,600
Got some mince.

665
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm finishing up some mince meat upstairs.

666
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,040
Gonna do some tarts.

667
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,360
Maybe...

668
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,160
When are you doing this?

669
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,360
Will we still be there or will we...

670
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,680
Hell no.

671
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,480
You'll be gone as hell.

672
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,560
I got Christmas pudding.

673
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,480
It's been aging for a couple weeks.

674
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,680
It's got a couple more weeks to go.

675
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,280
Maybe just give it to Brandy.

676
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm gonna make my favorite British holiday treat,

677
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,920
which is a Chimbley Crumble.

678
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
And what I do there...

679
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,720
Well, I don't want to give away the surprise,

680
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,440
but there's...

681
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,720
I'll be looking forward to it.

682
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Let's just say there's some ashy sweepins.

683
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,000
And I'll be making an anatomically correct Doctor Who cake.

684
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh God.

685
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Do you guys remember when this used to be a comedy show?

686
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,640
The Sonic Screwdriver is exactly where you think.

687
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,400
His dick?

688
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,840
Yep.

689
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,560
Great.

690
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,360
I've seen the show.

691
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,400
I've been watching the season.

692
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,240
I haven't finished the season, but I thought he had...

693
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,120
Oh, you're in for a treat.

694
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,240
What an excellent season it was.

695
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
But I thought he just had like magic sunglasses

696
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,960
and not a dick that was also a magic tool

697
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
that allows him to hack into robots and stuff.

698
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
Well, when his dick comes out,

699
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,280
he lowers his sunglasses and he's like,

700
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,680
check it.

701
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,280
What is that?

702
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,440
That's the sound of the Tardis.

703
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,840
When his penis comes out.

704
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
That's the sound?

705
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
Let's all do our Tardis impressions.

706
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,560
Me first.

707
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,640
Kill me.

708
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
Let's go back in time.

709
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,640
The pain.

710
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,520
Let me try mine.

711
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,160
Oh yeah.

712
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,560
Sweet dick.

713
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,720
Remember when he pulls on the levers and he flips the switch?

714
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,040
Oh my God, the control unit of the Tardis

715
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,360
is basically like a Bop-It Deluxe, isn't it?

716
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,640
I'm just now doing this out.

717
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,280
Oh, mommy.

718
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,760
Fuck me.

719
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,920
There is an episode in which the Tardis turns into a woman

720
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,640
and then he continues to use the Tardis as a ship after that.

721
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,040
Yeah, no big deal.

722
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,960
It's horrifying if you think about it for too long.

723
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,280
Riding around in my Susan, solving space crimes,

724
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,720
fixing time faults.

725
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm writing the new theme song.

726
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
Me and Lin-Manuel are writing the new theme song to Doctor Who.

727
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,000
And it's a work in progress, but that's where we're at right now.

728
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,760
It's pretty good.

729
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,800
It's pretty good so far.

730
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,080
I thought it was pretty good too.

731
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
I feel like we should, like, if we...

732
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,600
I was about to say that we should congratulate Lin,

733
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,560
but like if we started like congratulating Lin

734
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,960
every time he did something worth congratulating him for,

735
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
it would literally be like the entire program.

736
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,440
I actually think it's our job to keep him humble.

737
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,480
Yeah, it's true.

738
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
And I guess he gave the Pope a piggyback ride this week,

739
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,960
so congratulations on doing that.

740
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,880
And then apparently it was like so fucking good.

741
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
And then he saw it again.

742
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,400
He was like, fuck your show is still that good.

743
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm gonna give you one piggyback ride.

744
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,320
He's a saint now.

745
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,040
He's a saint now.

746
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,320
Congratulations, St. Lin.

747
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,800
Should we...

748
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,640
Go to the Money Zone?

749
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,120
Yes.

750
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,560
You guys like underpants?

751
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,440
Looking at them, having them, feeling them, wearing them,

752
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,760
touching them.

753
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,480
What are you talking about?

754
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,520
Knowing they exist.

755
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,560
Just the very concept, the very idea of underpants.

756
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,120
I guess so.

757
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,240
Can I get a little personal for a minute?

758
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
Are you gonna part the kimono?

759
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
God, that's my least favorite phrase I've said three times.

760
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,160
Can I put the kimono back on and then take it off again?

761
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,680
Travis is gonna take off his skin,

762
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,360
revealing that he's actually being controlled

763
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,840
by a tiny little alien in his tummy this whole time.

764
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,120
That's wearing a kimono.

765
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,800
Oh God, and then we're gonna take that off.

766
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
It's all kimonos.

767
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm gonna remove my body to reveal that I've been two kimonos

768
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,040
staying on each other's shoulders the entire time.

769
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,560
Hey, what are you trying to do?

770
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,640
You're trying to get in to see Closer?

771
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,680
It's an R-rated movie.

772
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,120
Get out of here, kimonos.

773
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
Yeah, kimonos.

774
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,600
So underneath my kimono I'm wearing,

775
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,280
I just got a shipment of some me undies.

776
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,160
And when I put them on my body,

777
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,160
it is like remembering what is good about clothing.

778
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,760
It is like a moment of like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, clothing.

779
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,080
It's like awesome and feels great.

780
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,560
And this feels like I imagine in sci-fi movies

781
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,240
when they have jumpsuits and clothing has evolved

782
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
to a point where it's like, oh no,

783
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,000
it's like constantly being hugged

784
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,120
by a wonderful cloud of awesomeness.

785
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,200
That is what me undies is like.

786
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
And I got a pair with polka dots

787
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,400
and it makes me feel like an awesome cartoon character

788
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,480
who's wearing the most comfortable underpants on earth.

789
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,520
Counter story, I went out to Old Navy,

790
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,800
I bought a new flannel shirt

791
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,960
and they had a pack of like 80 pairs of boxer briefs

792
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
for like 12 cents and I bought them.

793
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,640
And now the fields of my ding-dong zone have gone fallow.

794
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,080
Oh, we had a lot of fun in here today.

795
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Hi, it's Justin McElroy for me undies.

796
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,880
They're really good underwear.

797
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,200
It's like wearing nothing at all,

798
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,040
only better than that because you don't get arrested.

799
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,600
It's a sci-fi fantasy cloud that wraps your body in a hug.

800
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,800
So go to meundies.com slash my brother right now

801
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,560
to get 20% off your first order.

802
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,560
Plus, I don't know, it just says plus,

803
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,360
then it gets cut off.

804
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
Travis didn't put the whole thing in here.

805
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,440
Plus, don't buy bad underwear

806
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,600
that will just turn your whole pizone

807
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
into a blighted wasteland.

808
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,280
It's like Fallout 4 under this kimono.

809
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,160
Down there.

810
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Down there in my kimono zone.

811
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,160
My kimono-no-no zone.

812
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,400
I want to tell everybody about clubw.com.

813
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,640
Have you ever thought, man, I'd love to be in a club?

814
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,240
Well, might I suggest Club W.

815
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,240
They have wine for sale and they'll sell it to you no problem.

816
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,400
No questions asked, no matter what age you are.

817
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,480
Club W, that part's not true.

818
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,120
Now, hold on.

819
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,280
If you go to clubw.com, you can answer six questions.

820
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,960
It's not stuff like, what wine do you like?

821
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,320
Because that wouldn't be useful.

822
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,400
Because this is for everybody,

823
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,560
not just people who are deep into wine.

824
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,680
So they ask you stuff like,

825
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,360
what kind of berries do you like?

826
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,800
Or how do you take your coffee?

827
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,520
That kind of stuff.

828
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,040
And it creates a palette profile just for you

829
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,920
and recommends wines that they think you would like.

830
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,360
And then they ship them right to your door

831
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,440
and they're perfectly matched to your taste.

832
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,640
It's leading the grape to glass wine revolution.

833
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,520
What does that mean?

834
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,440
I didn't know until I talked to them on the phone.

835
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,800
I had to take their word for it.

836
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,480
They said they work directly with vineyards

837
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,040
to cut out the middleman, which saves you money.

838
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,640
That I could understand.

839
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,840
That's when I sort of got back on board and dug it.

840
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,520
If you want to try it out, they've got a no risk,

841
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,360
100% guarantee that you will love what they send you.

842
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,240
And it's gonna be about a third of what you pay at the store.

843
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,400
Right now, Club W is offering My Brother, My Brother,

844
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,840
Me listeners 50% off your first order

845
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,760
when you go to clubw.com slash my brother.

846
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,840
That's clubw.com slash my brother

847
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,720
and get 50% off your first order.

848
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,120
Now also they come with really fun cards

849
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,640
that give you not only what you could pair it with,

850
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,440
but like a recipe of stuff you could pair it with.

851
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,160
And my favorite is I got a really great Zinfandel

852
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,960
that we just went to town on during game night.

853
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
And it's like, do you want to pair it with something?

854
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,040
Pair it with like chicken tenders and pizza

855
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,520
and enjoy it during a football game.

856
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,840
And I was like, that's so cool, thank you.

857
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
Or maybe a basketball game.

858
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,760
Yeah, remind me, what's basketball?

859
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,360
It's the one with hoops and balls in it,

860
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,720
but I can recommend a good pairing for that.

861
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,800
And that is, and this is another thing

862
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,640
that I'm gonna be working on next year

863
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
during my time off from the podcast

864
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,680
is I've been developing my own wine

865
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,800
and it's called Griffin McElroy Slamdonk Sports Wine.

866
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,320
And it is something that you can take with you to a game.

867
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,400
You may have to sneak it in depending,

868
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
like if it's a child's basketball game,

869
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,840
you probably can't bring alcohol into that.

870
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,280
But it pairs really nicely.

871
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,600
Like when you taste this wine,

872
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,000
the flavor profile that it has just like matches up

873
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,600
with watching men and women like soar through the air

874
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,120
with these beautiful orange balls

875
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,720
and putting them through right now.

876
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,400
Now to be clear though, there are no electrolytes to speak of.

877
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,600
No, there are definitely extra bones.

878
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Oh, so it's a good like rehydrating agent

879
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,120
for post sports play.

880
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,560
Yes, and there's little tinfoil balls in there.

881
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,640
Not so little that you'll like accidentally choke on them.

882
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Like when they touch your mouth, you'll know it.

883
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,920
But it kind of like, it also electrifies

884
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,040
the flavor of this wine.

885
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,520
There's like an alcohol sort of catalyst thing

886
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,320
that goes on in there.

887
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Is that what they mean when they talk about like tannins?

888
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
Is that just tinfoil balls?

889
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,640
Yes, but anyway, that's sort of my new thing.

890
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
My original name for Griffin McElroy Slamdonk Sports Wine

891
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,040
was Michael's Secret Stuff.

892
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,000
But apparently they are already working on that

893
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
for wine that is gonna come out alongside Space Jam 2,

894
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,200
which is weird because that one isn't gonna have Michael in it

895
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,080
as far as I know.

896
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,800
You know it's gonna have Michael in it.

897
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,520
Yeah, what am I saying?

898
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
He's probably gonna be in there in the mix somewhere.

899
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,640
I just hope they get Wayne Knight back in there.

900
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,400
Anyway, Griffin McElroy Slamdonk Sports Wine,

901
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,560
you can find it on Club W.

902
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,600
Definitely just look around.

903
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,120
If you can't find it, it's your fault.

904
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,760
It's user error.

905
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,120
You didn't answer the questions right.

906
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,920
You didn't answer the questions right.

907
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,840
There's a specific, it's almost a cheat code

908
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,280
if you wanna access this good wine.

909
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,720
This next message is from Phil Davis.

910
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,160
Thank you, Travis, thank you.

911
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,720
And it's from Rachel and Susanna, and they say,

912
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,880
hey Phil, thought you might be interested

913
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,720
in this friendly reminder from the brothers

914
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
that a birthday is a doodly doo.

915
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,000
Ding dong doodly doo, ding dong doo.

916
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,400
Happy birthday, how do you do?

917
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,240
Open presents, cakeies too.

918
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,400
Happy birthday to the funniest guy we know

919
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560
who always sounds really unfunny

920
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
when we try to describe him to people.

921
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,120
That's savage.

922
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,760
Um, do you feel good about-

923
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,400
Happy birthday, Phil.

924
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,040
Thanks for jumping on that phonetic grenade, Trav,

925
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,000
saying all those words that you'll never be able to unsay

926
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,320
in the middle there, you know,

927
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,560
when you did like a Mary Poppins scat break.

928
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,480
Can I tell you guys, I blacked out.

929
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:28,960
Oh, good.

930
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
I don't know if it was the phonetic combination

931
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,280
or white, but I don't remember what I said.

932
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,680
I think-

933
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,640
And when I look at the screen, it's just fuzzy now.

934
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,600
I think when you did that like Ned Flanders scab ridge

935
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,200
there in the middle, it sort of activated you,

936
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,640
Manchurian candidate style.

937
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
I think it opened, it was the incantation

938
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,400
that opened up the black gates to the Underdark.

939
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,040
Yes.

940
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,000
The obsidian wall has began to crumble

941
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
thanks to Travis's incantations.

942
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,440
I'm glad I could help.

943
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,800
And a spectral army is marching through that crevice

944
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,240
all chanting in time, a ding dong doodly doo.

945
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,800
Kill Phil Davis.

946
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,520
Kill Phil Davis, ding dong doodly doo.

947
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
I got another message here and it's from Cody and Leah.

948
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,120
And it's from Brandon who says,

949
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,400
ding, ding, dingy, dong, ding, ding, dong, dong, dong.

950
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,200
No, I'm just kidding.

951
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
He says human English words like,

952
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,160
congratulations on your recent engagement.

953
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,560
Love and best wishes to you from your friends

954
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,400
and family back home in the flooded swamp

955
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,200
that is Florida or Flo-Rida.

956
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,400
Oh, mommy.

957
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,120
Oh, sorry.

958
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,520
Ooh.

959
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,160
Say it right.

960
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,480
Oh, manny.

961
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,760
Oh, mommy.

962
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,280
Ooh, mommy.

963
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,200
Love your twinniest brother, Brandon,

964
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,920
or perhaps twinest, but I think it's twinnest.

965
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,200
Your stringiest brother.

966
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,760
Love your noodly spindly brother,

967
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,520
Brandon Long Arms Johnson.

968
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,560
Congrats, Cody and Leah.

969
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
It sounds like you got a good thing going.

970
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,800
Stay safe in Florida.

971
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,920
You never know what's waiting for you around each corner

972
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,520
in Florida.

973
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,560
Could be a gator.

974
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,080
Could be a Florida gator.

975
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,560
Another basketball sports thing.

976
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,320
Are you troubled by lack of astute

977
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,720
yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

978
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,200
Do you experience feelings of laughter and enjoyment

979
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,080
when you hear three friends go off on stupid tangents?

980
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,760
Have you or any of your family members

981
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,080
ever seen a spook, specter, ghost,

982
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,240
or totally rad party dude house cat

983
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,720
who really only exists as a sound effect?

984
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,880
If the answer to any of these questions is yes,

985
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,360

I'm pretty sure we don't have the rights to this song.

997
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

998
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,920
Yes. Yes.

999
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,760
Got a Yahoo here.

1000
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,400
It's sent in by a game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

1001
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,280
Thank you, Rachel.

1002
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Anton, who asks,

1003
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,520
how do I get my parents out of the house?

1004
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,040
I'm a sophomore in high school and want to throw a party.

1005
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,320
My parents are kind of strict,

1006
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,880
but please give me ideas and advice

1007
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,600
to get them out of the house so I can have a party.

1008
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,520
Don't?

1009
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,800
Are you kidding me?

1010
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,320
That's how you want to start this off?

1011
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,760
When was the last time you watched

1012
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
one of those hilarious teen comedies

1013
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,320
where the person throwing the party at the end,

1014
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,160
they were like, man, I'm really glad that happened

1015
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,960
and nothing priceless was destroyed.

1016
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,440
How about any house party movie?

1017
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Yeah.

1018
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,640
I'm sorry.

1019
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,760
At the end of every house party movie,

1020
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,040
there wasn't a moment where they learned not

1021
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,000
to throw a house party.

1022
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,320
No, they made like- I have not seen them.

1023
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
They made like nine of them.

1024
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,900
Travis, you just like,

1025
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,480
it's just, we're not having to do any of this.

1026
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,640
We host a comedy podcast.

1027
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,480
Right.

1028
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,040
What was step B after don't have a party?

1029
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,160
What's the joke?

1030
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,120
You tell me- Maybe choose

1031
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,480
a different activity to have at your house.

1032
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
You tell me- Like a study sesh.

1033
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,280
You tell me the next 10 words

1034
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,040
and I'll drop out of this race right now.

1035
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,040
No, convince your friends to have a party at their house.

1036
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,920
It's not, it doesn't seem like a fertile comedy-

1037
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,040
That was 10 words by the way, he crushed it.

1038
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,880
Hear me out.

1039
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,680
What you need to do rather than convince your parents

1040
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,880
to leave their house,

1041
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,240
convince your parents to have your friend's parents

1042
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,280
over for a game night or a dinner

1043
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,560
and then you throw a party at your friend's house,

1044
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,680
but then you're out.

1045
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,800
No, no, you're not allowed to outline

1046
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,600
any more steps of this until you sell me role-playing,

1047
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,880
Justin's your mom, I'm your dad, you're Travis

1048
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,560
and you're trying to convince us to invite over

1049
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,760
your friend's parents for a game night between adults

1050
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,440
and now go.

1051
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,480
You guys ever play Settlers of Catan?

1052
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,200
Hello, my son.

1053
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,120
Okay, wait, you're a ghost mom.

1054
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,160
What, no, I'm your mother.

1055
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,240
What are you guys saying the other day

1056
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,680
how you never hang out with friends anymore?

1057
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,000
No, well, I don't have time

1058
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,440
because I'm too busy working and taking care of you,

1059
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,720
you old shit.

1060
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,360
Oh, dad, you seem so stressed.

1061
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,440
Have another glass of Griffin McElroy sports wine.

1062
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,680
Oh, I need it, I've got a root for my spurs.

1063
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,400
What are you guys doing tomorrow night?

1064
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,240
Oh, come on.

1065
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,080
Just another boring night of staring at each other

1066
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,280
if you regret your life decisions?

1067
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,360
I can't, well, I can't do anything tomorrow night,

1068
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,040
I gotta watch my spurs dunk.

1069
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
Maybe you can play the game of life

1070
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,960
and make different life decisions where you don't have kids.

1071
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
Of course, I have to make your father his special spurs

1072
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,840
dunk treats or else he gets very angry.

1073
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,480
She's gotta mow my sports wine.

1074
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,400
Mow it up good for a holiday treat.

1075
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,160
It's just frozen cauliflower, but chopped up.

1076
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,000
It's the only thing you eat, it's like a baby.

1077
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm a simple man.

1078
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,960
All I need is my roughage and my sports wine

1079
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,000
and for my spurs to get a damn rebound.

1080
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,840
Come on.

1081
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,120
I've been turning off the TV for just a second.

1082
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,880
Come on, don't you dare.

1083
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,600
I paid good money for that TV service.

1084
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,200
Okay, can we just take a break from the spurs

1085
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,040
for one second?

1086
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,880
It's just a poster.

1087
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
It's a poster of the spurs with cardboard around it.

1088
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,320
Yeah, but that poster's got a TiVo hooked up to it.

1089
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,680
It doesn't.

1090
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,520
I'm capturing all the moments.

1091
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,800
Mom, I'm worried about dad.

1092
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,160
I'm worried about him too.

1093
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,680
The year is 1978 and what is TiVo?

1094
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,520
We haven't even-

1095
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,160
I don't even think there's the San Antonio yet.

1096
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,920
We haven't even annexed San Antonio from Mexico,

1097
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,480
let alone built the Duncanist sports franchise

1098
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
in history up in there.

1099
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,040
Dad.

1100
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,000
Glug, glug, glug.

1101
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
This is an intense flavor profile.

1102
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,080
Oops, we're switching roles.

1103
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,680
Yes, I'm your dad.

1104
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,280
Oh God.

1105
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,360
No dad.

1106
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,800
Now I'm the mama.

1107
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,840
Gotta love me.

1108
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,520
Wait, I just had an idea for a TV show.

1109
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,200
And that's how Dinosaurs was created.

1110
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
Shit, Travis, you know what?

1111
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,240
You're right.

1112
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,320
That was way better than anything

1113
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,920
that we could have come up with.

1114
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,160
I forgot the question.

1115
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,640
Throwing parties, right?

1116
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,120
Throwing a party.

1117
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,040
How do you get your parents out of the house?

1118
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,120
How do you recommend to your parents to leave the house

1119
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,840
so that you can have a ballin' ass party up in there?

1120
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,560
Well, let's rip the kimono open.

1121
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,760
Let's pull the rip cord.

1122
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,720
Let's throw the kimono in the garbage.

1123
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
Have any of the three of us ever been-

1124
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Let's get in the shower

1125
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,360
and let our disposable kimono melt into the drain.

1126
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,000
Our rice paper kimono.

1127
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,760
Have any of the three of us ever been to a party

1128
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,400
in which the parents were not home

1129
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,720
and they threw it-

1130
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,120
And got caught at the end.

1131
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,880
I don't know that I have been.

1132
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,200
All of my parties have been above board.

1133
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,960
All the proper paperwork was filed with the city.

1134
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,480
Okay, see, I did not get my permit

1135
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,640
to get torned at my friend's house.

1136
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,720
And by friend, I mean somebody that my friend Mark knew.

1137
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,920
And we rolled up to his house.

1138
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
I was like, hey, cool spot.

1139
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,600
Everybody here is really, really drunk.

1140
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,760
And I was there for maybe 15 minutes.

1141
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,320
I got torned and his parents rolled up like, mm-nope.

1142
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,520
And that was an important night for me

1143
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,880
because I never broke the rules again after that.

1144
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,080
And did you learn from Mark

1145
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,480
or Mark's secondary acquaintance

1146
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,440
how the parents were convinced to leave the home

1147
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,120
or had the parents just left for a minute

1148
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,000
and they threw a pop-up party?

1149
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,960
Honest to God, I think they went to Kroger's.

1150
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,760
Like the parents went to Kroger's and they're like,

1151
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,200
everybody get over here quick.

1152
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,600
Cause it, I mean, it didn't work.

1153
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,840
So whatever plan they had fucking sucked.

1154
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,640
And I felt like I was gonna get yelled at,

1155
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,680
which would have been crazy.

1156
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,560
It was like, Griffin, we expected so much more than you.

1157
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,800
Like, I don't even know your son.

1158
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,080
Well, how do you know me?

1159
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,920
How do you know me?

1160
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,800
In this housing market,

1161
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,640
don't you think you could find like a foreclosed home?

1162
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,480
Oh my God.

1163
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,320
Or even throw a party in?

1164
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,600
The round house.

1165
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,920
You're talking about a camp nowhere.

1166
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,120
A bunch of kids go in on a house in Huntington.

1167
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Fuck it, they can buy our childhood home.

1168
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,400
10 teens who save up their paychecks for what?

1169
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Like three months, could buy our ancestral home

1170
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,920
and have a fucking party hangout spot.

1171
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,760
Yep.

1172
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,600
They're gonna have to go,

1173
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,640
whichever one of them can grow a mustache

1174
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,160
is gonna have to be the one who signs the paperwork.

1175
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,640
Hi, I'm Phillip, homeowner.

1176
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,360
And I'm going to pay cash, please.

1177
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,960
This is my associate, Greg Mortgage.

1178
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,720
Hi, I'm Mr. Mortgage.

1179
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,360
Will you accept coupons also?

1180
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,360
For two houses?

1181
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,800
For two houses?

1182
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,560
Yeah, this is a great concept.

1183
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,760
So teens get together and they take,

1184
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,400
it's sort of like,

1185
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,480
like it's also about the housing crisis, right?

1186
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,640
It's sort of like the big short,

1187
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,640
but like for teens and the teens buy a house.

1188
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,400
Why couldn't they do that?

1189
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,360
Like, why could, if you had to,

1190
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,040
like if they can get enough money

1191
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,000
for a bunch of teens to like go to Spain together.

1192
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,840
Right.

1193
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,360
Why couldn't they kick in a few Gs to like buy a house

1194
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,760
that they can all party in all the time.

1195
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,480
And then they like, okay, okay, here's the movie.

1196
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,800
They get party house, right?

1197
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,680
And they all kick in the money and they buy a party house.

1198
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,960
They start having parties there constantly,

1199
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,200
but you know what happens?

1200
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,040
What?

1201
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,720
Like some start getting sick of it

1202
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,560
because the other ones leave messes there.

1203
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,240
And it's like, no, you don't understand.

1204
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,840
This is party house.

1205
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,680
We do what we want.

1206
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,520
And the other one's like,

1207
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,840
we have to take care of party house.

1208
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,240
Please pay your portion of the rent on party house.

1209
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,600
Please pay your portion of the rent on party house.

1210
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,280
And then it's just a regular house.

1211
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,800
You never go grocery shopping.

1212
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,440
We're running out of groceries at party house.

1213
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,360
I don't love you anymore.

1214
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,160
Wait, what?

1215
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,480
I think, I can't think of a single reason

1216
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,680
why this wouldn't work.

1217
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,520
There's no reason.

1218
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,040
I would love to see a scene in party house

1219
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,720
where there's like one person who's like,

1220
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,200
I don't really like the crown molding.

1221
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,040
And it's like, dude,

1222
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,680
like we're just gonna like get really drunk here.

1223
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,480
Oh my God, it's a whole franchise, right?

1224
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,600
We do the film and the film's gonna be very successful.

1225
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,000
And then we have a new HGTV show.

1226
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And it's- HGTV Teen Party House.

1227
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,760
HGTV, the T stands for teens.

1228
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,040
Wait. Uh-huh.

1229
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,600
I think the T is just part of TV.

1230
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,040
I think it's just tella.

1231
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,640
Yeah. I think it might be

1232
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,400
home and garden teen videos.

1233
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,240
Uh-huh. And-

1234
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,880
Hey, it's me, Martha Stewart 2.

1235
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,360
I'm coming to all you teens.

1236
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360
I'm the young Martha Stewart for teens.

1237
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,280
Today we're gonna put nachos in your garden.

1238
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,680
This isn't your mom's garden.

1239
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,040
Wait, what?

1240
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,000
It's me, Martha Stewart 2.

1241
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,800
Bury those cheesy little guys up in the ground.

1242
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Make sure you water them every day.

1243
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,440
You gotta have responsibilities

1244
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,480
if you want to harvest these nachos.

1245
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,520
Today I made this precious pergola all out of skateboards.

1246
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,560
I built a cozy to keep my whippets in.

1247
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,400
This isn't your mom's Martha Stewart.

1248
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,480
That's Martha Stewart, my mom.

1249
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,880
I'm Martha Stewart 2 for teens.

1250
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,440
And don't forget to get hardwood floors.

1251
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,720
It's easier to clean up puke.

1252
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,000
Maybe a nice linoleum,

1253
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,400
but that's not gonna have a lot of resale value.

1254
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,280
Make sure there's lots of pictures of jugs on the wall.

1255
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,440
Well, no, teens don't necessarily-

1256
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,120
No, like jugs of water. Mason jugs.

1257
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,440
Mason jugs?

1258
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,720
Yeah, like Mason jugs.

1259
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,480
Like Mason, they're like Mason jars are bigger.

1260
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,840
Oh, boy.

1261
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,160
Yeah. What about Anteens Roadshow?

1262
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,000
Now hear me out.

1263
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,640
That's not an HGTV product.

1264
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,960
Can I hit you guys with this?

1265
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,320
I have a house that I'm having trouble selling.

1266
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,160
Yes.

1267
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,120
Could I do a sort of rental,

1268
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,480
buy the day, promise no sex stuff or drugs

1269
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,120
that are too hard?

1270
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,960
There are teen nightclubs, Justin.

1271
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,960
I guarantee that there's a legal loophole

1272
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,440
that will let you rent a house to teens.

1273
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,680
I rent my home to teens.

1274
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,600
Are you high?

1275
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

1276
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,880
Do you wanna find out how I made my millions?

1277
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,280
Okay, but let's part the kimono just a little bit here, gang,

1278
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,600
because what we're describing is Airbnb.

1279
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,240
I'm gonna get one quarter of my kimono

1280
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,120
stuck in the document shredder

1281
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,080
and just watch as it's disintegrated.

1282
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,920
Yes.

1283
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,880
Just take it off.

1284
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,880
Don't stay in the kimono.

1285
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,320
It's trapped in the paper shredder.

1286
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,760
I'm gonna step out of the taxi

1287
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,720
and I'm gonna shut a little bit of my kimono in it

1288
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,360
and it's gonna drive off with it.

1289
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,560
I'm gonna sell my kimono

1290
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,400
to buy you a watch chain for your watch.

1291
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,160
I wanna buy, I wanna sell my kimono to buy you a box

1292
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,560
for your kimono.

1293
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,400
Oh no.

1294
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,240
Yeah.

1295
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,920
What we're describing is home away or Airbnb,

1296
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,480
which is the thing that exists.

1297
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,160
But it brings up a good question that I guess speaks volumes

1298
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,800
about sort of my ethics

1299
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,360
that I've never really thought about this before.

1300
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,120
Cause we do those a lot.

1301
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,320
Like we do lake house weekends here in Austin sometimes

1302
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,600
and we party the fuck out of those spots.

1303
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,440
But that's like somebody's digs.

1304
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,880
That's like somebody's house.

1305
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,800
What's the age?

1306
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,000
I bet it's 18,

1307
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
which could be someone who turned 18 in like September,

1308
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,920
the first week of September of their senior year

1309
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,760
of high school.

1310
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,600
And has like a bunch of crazy 15 year old friends

1311
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,120
that just like run wild,

1312
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,000
like a plague of locusts up on these spots.

1313
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,560
But what I'm saying is like,

1314
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,120
can you, are you, ethically speaking,

1315
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,000
legally, I think you're clear.

1316
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,800
Ethically speaking, can you bone down in an Airbnb?

1317
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,640
Yeah.

1318
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,640
My baby was conceived in an Airbnb.

1319
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,720
Is that true?

1320
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,080
Yup.

1321
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,200
So we know we're just-

1322
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,680
Thank you, Phillip and Judy,

1323
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,520
if you're listening.

1324
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,720
Yeah, that's like what I'm saying.

1325
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,600
Like, I'm not even talking about a lake house anymore.

1326
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,720
I'm talking about like somebody's apartment

1327
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,080
in a city you don't live in.

1328
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:58,960
And you like roll up there,

1329
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,960
like thanks for a place to lay my weary head

1330
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,520
and also to definitely bone down to go to the bones in.

1331
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,640
Thanks for that.

1332
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,040
Maybe that's the only reason you put a place up on an Airbnb

1333
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,360
because you dirty.

1334
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,160
You dirty and you love those thoughts.

1335
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,360
But how is that different from like a hotel?

1336
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,360
Well, cause a hotel is not like,

1337
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,800
this is Travis's room in the hotel.

1338
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,560
Would you like to make love in it?

1339
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,560
But I don't think that the main use case for Airbnb

1340
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,560
is like, I want to be away tonight.

1341
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,000
Somebody can live in my house

1342
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,480
and I'll get you in the morning.

1343
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,760
Like, I don't think that that's usually what Airbnb,

1344
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,160
the way it works.

1345
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,080
Do you think it's somewhere in the Airbnb clause,

1346
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,360
there's gotta be like a specific section that like,

1347
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,520
where you swear that you didn't put cameras

1348
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,360
in your house, right?

1349
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,640
Like I'm gonna rent my Airbnb out

1350
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,320
and I promise, promise, promise,

1351
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,200
I don't have super creepy cameras everywhere.

1352
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,960
I have a policy every time I go to an Airbnb,

1353
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,880
I check the toilet for cameras.

1354
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,000
Is there any there?

1355
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,680
I don't care how long it takes.

1356
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,000
I wait until they go and buy some and install them.

1357
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,840
Because-

1358
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,680
Or else what's the point?

1359
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,040
Or else what's the point?

1360
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,720
I'm doing some serious butt work in here.

1361
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,440
I went to all the trouble to get that tattoo.

1362
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,200
If nobody sees it, then what's the point?

1363
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,760
Why have I been perfectly sculpting my glutes

1364
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,280
if nobody's gonna watch?

1365
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,640
You know, art in a vacuum is not art.

1366
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,400
Also, please let a camera in the vacuum

1367
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,240
for various reasons.

1368
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,000
Did you hear about that guy that spent $2 million

1369
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,880
on the only picture of Justin's tight, tight butt

1370
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,920
that exists in the world?

1371
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,600
And he's not gonna share it with anybody.

1372
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,880
It's just his.

1373
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,160
Let's get this idea moving.

1374
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,920
Let's get this, let's sell your house, Justin,

1375
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,760
as a camp nowhere hang zone for teens.

1376
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Now there might be some police run-ins.

1377
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,280
Well, they would have to be discreet, absolutely.

1378
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,960
Like, we're not gonna hang a sign on the front door

1379
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,920
that's like, Justin McElroy's Dope Motel for Lit Teens.

1380
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,520
Teen getaway.

1381
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,600
Just a place where teens should go and relax for once.

1382
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,840
Just get away from the parents

1383
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,880
and maybe do some reflecting, wink.

1384
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,560
Maybe you just call the place Wink.

1385
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,800
Oh, that's good.

1386
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,840
But now we're talking about a teen nightclub

1387
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,000
and we don't want that.

1388
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,840
Don't we?

1389
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,680
Because we've already done that.

1390
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,880
We don't want to.

1391
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,600
Yeah, we've already conquered that market.

1392
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,480
What if we call it the Gym Factory 2?

1393
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,360
But it's just J-I-M, because it's Jim's house.

1394
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,240
What if we just open up a place called Pant Stains?

1395
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,360
And then next door, we open up a Dry Cleaners.

1396
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,080
Synergy.

1397
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,720
And then we open up another teen nightclub next door

1398
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,840
to that called Synergy, but S-I-N.

1399
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,680
Oh my God, he can't be stopped.

1400
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,440
Griffin McElroy's Huntington, West Virginia,

1401
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,920
Revitalization Project, now seeking investors.

1402
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,760
What are you saying?

1403
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,600
What are you saying?

1404
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,040
Okay, then we put a church next to that

1405
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,800
on the other side to help you.

1406
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,120
Like you're just saying like a chain.

1407
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,800
And then next to that, we put a Popeye's chicken

1408
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,600
for after church lunch meals.

1409
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,080
We don't put a church's chicken?

1410
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,040
Come on, Griffin.

1411
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,000
Then next to that, we do a church's chicken

1412
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,280
because that's just like competition.

1413
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,760
We don't want to monopolize the market.

1414
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,600
I see, okay, got it.

1415
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,000
Next to that, we put a bathroom house.

1416
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,840
What's that?

1417
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,800
Well, it's a place you go to use the bathroom,

1418
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,880
but you have to pay 25 cents each time you do it.

1419
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,200
And also we have to remove bathrooms from the gym factory

1420
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,520
and from Synergy and from the church.

1421
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,920
And next to that, a basketball stadium

1422
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,560
and we're playing Sim City now.

1423
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,400
Yeah, oh, we're gonna put a basketball stadium on that,

1424
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,400
but that's just for me.

1425
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,840
And it's gonna have a watch tower on top of it

1426
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,680
so I can watch.

1427
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh no, Godzilla's attacking.

1428
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,840
Oh no.

1429
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,880
Well, we better get...

1430
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,480
No Sim City poll, huh?

1431
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,320
I ran out.

1432
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,160
No Sim City poll?

1433
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,200
Oh, that's all right.

1434
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,520
And on that disappointing note,

1435
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,720
it's time to end this episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1436
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
We hope you all have had a lot of fun.

1437
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,200
We know we have in some parts.

1438
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,920
Can I change the name of Huntington?

1439
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,360
If I'm putting this much work into it,

1440
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,200
can I call it something else?

1441
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,040
Yeah.

1442
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,960
Okay, cool, Bluntington.

1443
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,120
Nice.

1444
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:14,960
Crushed it.

1445
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,760
James Bluntington.

1446
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,440
Big fan, big fan.

1447
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,040
If you want to come see us in Bluntington,

1448
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,240
we are gonna do a show December 21st.

1449
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,320
It's about 80% sold out.

1450
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,920
So get on it.

1451
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,040
Go get your tickets.

1452
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,440
Go to candleknights.net

1453
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,200
and buy tickets to come see us.

1454
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,160
It's December 21st, 8 p.m.

1455
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,800
I think it's like 20 bucks.

1456
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,520
And you can see us and Sawbones,

1457
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,680
Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine

1458
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,280
that I do with my wife.

1459
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,200
Both of those shows at 8 p.m.

1460
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,200
That address to get is candleknights.net

1461
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,800
or.org if you prefer.

1462
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,440
We also want to say thanks again to MeUndies

1463
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,080
who are dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear.

1464
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,400
If you go to meundies.com slash my brother,

1465
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,080
you can get 20% off your first order.

1466
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,920
You should go do that.

1467
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,400
They're amazing.

1468
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,920
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

1469
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,760
for the use of our theme song.

1470
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,600
It's a departure off the album,

1471
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,480
putting the days to bed.

1472
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,480
They're getting a lot of tweets from people

1473
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,760
that are listening to John Roderick

1474
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,720
and Jonathan Colton's Christmas album,

1475
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,120
One Christmas at a Time.

1476
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,160
It's a really good album.

1477
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,440
Good eye.

1478
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,280
Picking that one up.

1479
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,160
I like the one in between is my favorite on there.

1480
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,000
Yeah.

1481
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,800
You should also go on our Facebook group

1482
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,560
and check out, we put up the NBNBA Angels.

1483
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,000
Justin, tell us all about it.

1484
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,400
Well, sir, a bunch of us are kicking in

1485
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,760
to help some people here in West Virginia

1486
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,840
have slightly better Christmas.

1487
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,720
A lot of hard times, people falling on hard times.

1488
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,080
And we, and mainly the listeners

1489
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,240
of My Brother, My Brother, Me are gonna help them out.

1490
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
You can get details on how to do that

1491
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,480
and how to become a My Brother, My Brother, Me angel.

1492
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,880
Basically, on our Facebook page,

1493
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,320
My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation Group.

1494
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,840
The short version is though,

1495
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,480
if you can buy a few gifts for somebody in our area

1496
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,440
and you let us know about it,

1497
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,800
then we'll record a personal thank you for you.

1498
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,840
So let's make Christmas happen for some folks.

1499
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,400
Go to Facebook and search for the My Brother,

1500
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,680
My Brother, Me Appreciation Group.

1501
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,200
And you can find that the top post there

1502
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,840
will be about the Angels program.

1503
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,880
Or you can go to nbnbam.tumblr.com

1504
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,920
and it'll be the first post there as well.

1505
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,440
All right, you should also go check out

1506
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,400
all the other amazing Maximum Fun shows.

1507
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,480
There's tons on there

1508
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,480
and you're gonna find one that you love.

1509
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,600
Guys, they just put up a trailer

1510
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,160
for the Independence Day sequel.

1511
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,680
So I actually have to go.

1512
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,640
Can you guys finish the show?

1513
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,480
Sort of without me,

1514
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,680
you think of it as practice for next year

1515
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,400
when I'm on my basketball voyage?

1516
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,560
I would love to listen to whatever it is you're saying,

1517
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,640
but they just dropped a trailer

1518
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,880
for the new Independence Day movie.

1519
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,920
So I've got to go watch that.

1520
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,040
Guys, I hate to jump in.

1521
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,200
Sorry, I don't wanna over talk,

1522
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,440
but they just put up a trailer for Independence Day.

1523
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,200
I wasn't paying attention to whatever shit you guys-

1524
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,960
Guys, I hate to interrupt the two of you

1525
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,400
while you're talking about whatever you're talking about,

1526
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,320
but they just put up a trailer for Beaches 2

1527
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,280
and I have to leave

1528
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,240
and I have to watch the Beaches 2 trailer immediately.

1529
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,080
Son of a beach.

1530
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,000
Son of a son of a beach.

1531
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,920
Yeah, it's what it's called.

1532
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,280
So anyway, Cher's in it

1533
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,600
and I just got to go just jerk off to this thing real quick.

1534
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,440
Super.

1535
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,240
You guys heard about Back to the Future too?

1536
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,240
Anyway, that's gonna do it for us.

1537
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,520
Thanks for listening to our program.

1538
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,560
Life's a beach.

1539
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,400
Life's a beach is actually the name of it.

1540
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,320
Life's a beach.

1541
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,200
Griffin, you have to read the Yahoo Answers

1542
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,040
or I'm going to die.

1543
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,000
Okay, here's the final Yahoo

1544
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,320
and then we can get to the important stuff

1545
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,280
that we need to do.

1546
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,640
And it was sent in by Zoe Kinski, climb that ladder.

1547
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,480
Thank you, Zoe.

1548
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,120
Yahoo Answers user number five who asks,

1549
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,240
did you lose all respect for Steve Guttenberg

1550
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,000
as a serious actor when he did Dancing with the Stars?

1551
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,040
My name is Justin McElroy.

1552
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,280
I'm Travis McElroy.

1553
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,160
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1554
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,200
Go on, be watching the trailer.

1555
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,160
Finish it.

1556
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,000
This is from my brother.

1557
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,560
My brother and me kissed your dad's gribble lips.

1558
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:13,560
Hey, girls, do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna?

1559
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,400
Maximumfun.org.

1560
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,440
Comedy and culture.

1561
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,520
Artist-owned.

1562
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,720
Listener-supported.

1563
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,080
Hi, my name's Justin McElroy.

1564
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,320
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

1565
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,360
We host the medical history podcast, Sawbones,

1566
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,160
tour of all the weird, stupid, terrible, horrifying,

1567
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,760
hilarious ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

1568
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,360
If you haven't been listening to Sawbones,

1569
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,000
you've missed out on topics like.

1570
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,040
The seasick-proof saloon.

1571
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,120
The woman who gave birth to bunnies.

1572
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,160
The unkillable Phineas Gage.

1573
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,720
The true story of Typhoid Mary.

1574
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,800
Polio.

1575
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,760
And you can check out Sawbones every Wednesday

1576
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,040
by going to iTunes or wherever podcasts are sold.

1577
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,160
They don't sell podcasts, I told you this.

1578
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,920
Or presented.

1579
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,120
Offered for free, it's free.

1580
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,800
What better selling point could there be than that?

1581
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,600
Every Wednesday, Maximumfun.org

1582
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:34,600
or wherever podcasts are offered, it's Sawbones.
