1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Better it's better with you

8
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,300
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and my show for the modern era

9
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,240
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis big dog a whoo whoo

10
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,220
McElroy, hey, and I'm Griffin McElroy the smallest one of the bunch

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Broadway's back

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,640
Is it yeah Broadway's back? I heard it last night on the Tony Awards

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,800
Broadway is back and me I was so excited to see all the hits of Broadway

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,080
Yeah, we're out last night for the Tony Awards kind of a weird one

15
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,680
Oh, it's Tony words you guys know the story with these Tony's there are awards for a Broadway shows

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,200
I I heard this year actually they only gave them out to people named Tony, which I thought was cool

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,040
You're any any variety of spelling though Griffin was fine Tony Tony or Tony any one of them

18
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
no, so

19
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:17,640
The Tony Awards, I know that you're wondering the Tony Awards last night, what were they honoring exactly because

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,120
They didn't do any they didn't do what I know. They didn't do any plays or shows

21
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,680
From the ongoing unpleasantness. I don't know if you knew about this, but they're

22
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,900
Have you guys noticed how you haven't been outside in a while so

23
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,720
They did the Tony's

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,320
for the shows that got that were

25
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,160
Do doing it. Yeah, sure, but didn't get a chance to

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,600
You know like compete for Tony's wait, right

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,480
So basically mean this is wait, this is for shows that were like on Broadway two years ago

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,200
Exactly, but like after the last brought you don't understand. I'm saying kind of so right so like it's

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
just

30
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,960
Moulin Rouge. Oh a little pill. Yeah, and Tina the Tina

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,960
So so and so like every award

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,720
Like well for best musical it's

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,440
Moulin Rouge

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,520
Jagged little pill and the Tina Turner musical. Can I tell you something Justin?

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,280
I am kicking myself up and down that great white way because this is your chance to get it

36
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,520
If I had known if I had known I would have opened a show in February 2020

37
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,200
you know like I would have I would have

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,180
Spent every last dime I had to finally make my little dream come true

39
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,960
I would have done a one-man show

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,800
But like apparently that would have been enough right like and I finally could have put on my script. I wrote back in

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,280
2009 of mr. McGoran's Wonder Emporium as a musical you could have mounted it

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
I could have mounted it for sure. I could have done my musical Oklahoma to

43
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,440
To Oklahoma and it wasn't good. It wasn't even done. I only have two songs in it

44
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,600
But I couldn't poor Judd's alive again was one of them

45
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,720
It's about a zombie Judd comes back and look at that. It's another story with the French on top

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Wanted to the wind is back again, you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This one was about how the farmer and the counter man should be lovers

48
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Yeah

49
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,920
They all it's nice even the musical even the shows that weren't necessarily

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,280
Like in competition with those other ones. Yeah. Yeah, like if you did a different one like

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
um

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,520
David Byrne did American utopia. Uh-huh. They're like we got a Tony for you. That's right. Come on up. Thank you for doing your show

53
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,560
That's here's a Tony for you. I remember I saw a clip of it where they just stood on stage

54
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,600
I think it was Lynn just stood on stage and started yelling out like did anyone else do any shows?

55
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
No less yet. Lynn did his show

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Freestyle love supreme with some of his friends and they made it up

57
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
What that's

58
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,260
Fucking kidding me. They made it up. Well, we could do that and it's kind of like

59
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,560
The show before we get there cuz like I do that

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,160
Yeah, come up with show and it's like no, well, you know

61
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,920
I was actually talking I was talking to Christopher Jackson about it and he did yeah that every night said zooka

62
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,640
Zama zoom zoom zoom. Yeah, I mean yelled it except that wasn't the song you sing and you know all geek tests

63
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,760
I got you. You fell right into my trap Griffin drop that Chris Jackson heat. Oh

64
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
That's what shoes I do

65
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,700
Every night before they go on stage they go like, okay

66
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,520
Let's make sure to write this one down

67
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,360
Right because and then they come off stage and they're like, oh that was a great one

68
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,220
All right, you cars and you crushes like I thought you were writing it down Chris and Chris is like shit

69
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,920
I thought you were writing it down Lynn and they like all forget to write it down every night for like a hundred years

70
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Yeah for like a really long show and I also know that there's other people in freestyle love supreme and I don't know their names

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,080
And I'm a terrible. I want to say I want to say something else

72
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,240
Yeah, if I could say something else, all right, say it we did we did do it that we did duets there was

73
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,200
We did

74
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
famous duets coming back

75
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,480
Famous duets come back. They open with they're like history-making duets. Who do we have and in my head?

76
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm sitting there like my arms crossed like there's no joy in the world. There's no way they got a Dita and Kristen

77
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
No

78
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,800
No way, there's no way the music swells

79
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,760
I know and and Leslie my friend Leslie over juniors like we got a wicked performance and then they're both are

80
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah, they're both they're both doing it. Fuck me. And that's so good cuz that's

81
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
That wasn't it you would think

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,120
Certainly. Yeah, you would think that's the end

83
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,520
That's your closer but then who's that? Oh my god

84
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,440
It's Anthony no, you're not

85
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,320
They're both in tuxedos talking about the bohemian life the irony was powerful

86
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,320
Someone's in for help this man. This this husky boy. He's been killed

87
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
And Adam Pascal

88
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,320
Reuniting then and then like the audience several people had died at that point

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, and the rest of them are getting on it to leave cuz there's no way like getting up to leave

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,540
They're like scoop the book put it in. There's no way there's any more show

91
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,540
I

92
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,820
Look up at the sky that could those glowing red cracks in the sky that have been forming for about five years now

93
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:38,540
They're back. They're patching up. They're closing up the wounds guys. You would think you would think that that was the end

94
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,300
No, guys, no, no, no, no, they get this guys and then Lynn had to come out with a rap

95
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,780
He made up about the Tonys. Oh my poor friend. Come with me. You don't have to follow price

96
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,820
policy wheels of a tree

97
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,060
With this song here. They wrote down their songs. They came up with their songs a long time ago. They

98
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,980
Do it, of course Anthony rap man. Pascal wrote

99
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,780
wrote all of it

100
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,820
Yeah, but they but I will say this yeah flip it

101
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:21,080
Lynn had Wayne Brady on his team. Yeah, I was like, yeah, he's bringing out the big guns Chris

102
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,480
Chris Jackson and and Wayne Brady and a cast of thousands

103
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,360
But like they didn't make up a rap about it we just it's very like making things up

104
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,760
We actually got an invite and I forgot to tell you guys

105
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,280
Yeah, wait Lynn actually did send us a golden ticket to be on his team for the Tonys

106
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,640
And I forgot to pass it on and that one's on me

107
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,360
Yeah, I'm really really sorry about that

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,040
anyway, it was very special and and it's like I did I will if I could just there is one little thing I wanted

109
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,680
In there I do they did they were so everybody had me vaccinated. I'm loving that. Yeah, everyone in the audience is

110
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
masked right and I'm like even the

111
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,360
Anyway, everyone is masked and and I'm loving that yeah

112
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,320
And then and there's no musical performances in the first two hours, which are streaming exclusively on pair about plus

113
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,560
Yeah, I watched them gotta see who gets that scenic design war. Yeah, of course

114
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
So that they did that part. I'm like, well, I get it

115
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,320
I mean you had to do a scale back thing, but you know safety and then at 9 o'clock

116
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,920
CBS picks up the feed right? Yeah, and apparently they had saved all the performances for that

117
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
double block and

118
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I feel like I

119
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,920
Don't think it's fair if I'm elderly

120
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,080
Actor wearing my mask and the entire cast of Moulin Rouge gets to do one giant dry hump

121
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,120
Unsafe literally hundreds of people just dry humping dry humping the chairs dry humping each other. Okay, so

122
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,000
Unmasked dry. It wasn't one dry hump because when you say that it makes it sound like it was like a huge punctuation

123
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,760
At the end like I'll slow pull back like a hive hump if you can imagine

124
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Dry hump god. Yes

125
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
2020s best musical

126
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,440
Moulin Rouge

127
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Congratulations. Congratulations. It sounds like everyone had a good time. Hey, listen, can I say everyone seemed very relieved to not be in their house?

128
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,360
Yeah, that seemed that seemed accurate. Uh, it's at the winter garden too. God. What a what a beauty

129
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,680
What a beauty. What a joy to see that back up and running again. Nature's healing. Nature's healing the cracks in the sky. Nature's healing the winter garden theater. Things were fucked up for a while

130
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,320
Really? Yeah, but it's all better now. Everything's fine now. That's what Leslie said. Oh, oh did he?

131
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,760
Leslie said everything's fine now. No, he didn't say that but he did say Broadway's back, which it is. Yeah

132
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,040
Yeah, how can anything be wrong if Broadway is right? Look at Adam. Look at Adam and Pascal up there doing his thing

133
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,840
He's it sounds great. By the way, everyone's had a great. What a great evening. Oh

134
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,400
Boy, they've been honing their craft. I think while they've been kicking it

135
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,800
Oh, that's that's the thing right if you haven't been learning at least three new skills by the end of it of the COVID

136
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,880
What are we doing? Yeah, right. What are we even doing? So this is a an advice show not just a

137
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,760
bunch of guys getting excited about the Tony Awards because like

138
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,200
It was an exciting night. Yeah, sounds like yeah back. Yeah, absolutely

139
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,400
Absolutely, Lynn did a great job, by the way

140
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,800
Yeah, if there's one thing everyone knows about Lynn right and turn it on yeah turn it on

141
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Especially it seems like the procrastination

142
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,960
It gets a better. Yeah, if there's one thing there's two things

143
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,500
Everyone knows about Lynn why he can turn it on to he waits till the last minute. I'm fucking

144
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,140
Every single thing no freestyle love supreme. They're making it up every night. What come on. You're kidding me every night

145
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,180
You know sometimes I actually saw on the show and there were times where they asked the audience to do work for them

146
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:30,140
That's yeah, like you come up with an idea, right? That's why come on, right? It's like I paid to see you guys

147
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,380
You didn't pay to see me. Why should I give you a show lazy to rely on your audience?

148
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,860
So here's our first question. I work as a cashier at a store where we sell scented products

149
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,380
That's excellent. Sometimes when a customer brings one of those items up. I like to take a sniff of it before I scan it good

150
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,740
However, when I brought this up with a friend, she said she thought that was weird. Yes. Yes

151
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,620
Should I stop?

152
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,620
How unintentionally uncomfortable have I made people that's from a wicked whiff of the West. That's very good

153
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
now I

154
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,340
Convention

155
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:13,760
Now as an essential part of information has been lost here and that is if you are in a scenario where you are masked

156
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:20,680
Yeah in this venue and you're having to like do the little sneaky pull down to get a little whiff

157
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Now here's what I will say

158
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
There is a part of me

159
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,880
That I can see this bit

160
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,900
Like if you take a whiff and do that because there's nothing I love more than the feeling of like when you order something off

161
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:43,980
A menu or you go to buy something and the person says oh, that's the best or that's my favorite and you feel like oh

162
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,100
I won I now I picked the best thing right whether it's true or not

163
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,860
And so if you're like something like oh, this is my favorite one in the whole store

164
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,740
I could see that adding to the customer experience

165
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:02,220
Experience right, but it also depends on how deep you huffing right? Because if you're like, oh a candle like oh, I love this one

166
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,220
but if you're like

167
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,220
No, I think when it is your house, yeah, we can probably

168
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,620
Okay, stop this is a very musical episode I want to get a Tony apparently

169
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,780
I mean you could be checking for duds, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

170
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
Like

171
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,500
This no, this is a croissant give me no get another one wait

172
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,840
Trav do you when they say scented products? Do you think they mean baked goods? No, it's a candle

173
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,500
You don't have I have a French baguette candle. It's fucking incredible

174
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,740
You have a bread candle. Yeah, dude. It smells like bread. It's amazing. What a tease. Yeah

175
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,240
Well, I also do bake bread though

176
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,740
So sometimes it's just to waft them in just keeping your your family guessing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

177
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,220
Keep them on keep that candle is that bread? We'll take a bite of it and find out. I'm just saying

178
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:04,260
there's no way that the these people that are making these candles are able to

179
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,860
Quality control it so much that a dud doesn't sneak in there from time to time

180
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,820
Yeah, that there isn't just one stinker that sneaks into the batch from time to time. I

181
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:22,020
I my other question though if you work in a place, that's so jam-packed full of sense

182
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,120
Yeah, are you still getting much out of the experience?

183
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,840
Because you would think after a while

184
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:34,040
Maybe at the beginning of a shift to put by my interesting four or five hours in you must be overloaded with that stank

185
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,840
Right. Yeah, it's tough when you go into one of those places like the earth sent

186
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:45,460
It's just like not like just like that you think about it, right though you get a candle to smell something

187
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,380
Different. Yeah, right like to smell like a different smell, right? That's so true. So if you combine all the candles in

188
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
the in the shop

189
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,620
They're all just like different smells that you're not smelling then

190
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,120
So if you go are outside the shop and that's like the world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

191
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,280
Then you go inside the shop and what you're basically getting is the antecedent, you know

192
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,120
Like the anti interesting like the opposite the polar opposite scent from you would get on earth

193
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,040
You're smelling the opposite it's all the different smells that you're not smelling combined into one smell

194
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:31,040
That is the opposite or the anti scent of I am a million percent sure we've talked about anti-stink before

195
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,440
Oh, definitely. Yeah. Hey Griffin at this point. We're like almost 600 episodes. It's all great

196
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,920
We've talked about everything dude. No, I know but are we cutting-edge

197
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,920
Sign is scientists out because I'm not hearing anybody else talk about anti-scent the stink

198
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,520
That's reverses this does opposite stink the cancel sting cancels it. Yeah new chair and like things like Febreze, right?

199
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,040
That's no no, no, we've talked about that too because that replaces that gives you like now it smells like lavender

200
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,000
I want to completely zero out

201
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,000
Right. I want you know

202
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,440
like you go into a padded room and it's like so quiet because they put like the you know acoustic stuff everywhere and like there's

203
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,360
Nowhere for sound to bounce off. I want that for smell, but we have

204
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,200
Opposite my bin baby because I feel like this raises like so we've at this point then we've talked about everything there is

205
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,360
Yeah, if we're making an opposite of this show, is it like?

206
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,680
heavily researched alternate reality Mert game murder mystery

207
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,120
Okay, every week there's new clues. Yeah, this actually sounds badass and like something I like

208
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
Yeah, like hard

209
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,360
I think that is the that's the the the lodestone there is like or your your guiding star is like if it's hard

210
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,320
Yeah, that's the opposite of what we do

211
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,680
I in our show I think that the opposite of what we do on our show if there was an opposite my brother my brother

212
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
and me it would be like

213
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,840
coming up with non silly very serious ideas that could change the world for the better and

214
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Then that would then funnel through a pipeline to our show and we would just ruin them by talking about

215
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Like oh that rhymes with fart or whatever. The opposite of our show is like TED talk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

216
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:18,640
Not it's like short and to the point. Yeah helpful smart doesn't ramble stays on top. Does it right like a visual aids?

217
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,960
Oh, yeah, like I mean that it's like that the TED talk is like the opposite

218
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,880
It'd be like if Joe Rogan was like wicked smart instead cuz like we're we're also pretty dumb

219
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,220
We're also done like in a different. Yeah, but we're done in a non-threatening sense, but he doesn't write it

220
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
This is what I'm saying. It would need to be scripted

221
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:43,440
Yeah, it would need to be scripted if it's gonna be the opposite of our show. It would be great to have well rehearsed

222
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,120
Oh, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's hard to get left

223
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,140
Yeah, we're like a printing error away

224
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
You gotta clean your nozzle heads on

225
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,100
Hey, can I do a can approach the Wizards throne humbly? Yeah, and see what he has for us today

226
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:15,420
This one's awesome. And this one's good for particularly three of us because this is something that well

227
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,660
Maybe we don't have to worry about quite so much these days during the unpleasantness

228
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,060
But it is important for us to I think know how to sign a cool signature and thank you to Tori for sending this in

229
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,500
I have Leonard this before. Yeah, I mean there's a few steps here and there's some interesting

230
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,460
like things I haven't even considered I think

231
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,380
Ballpark, I've probably signed my name

232
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,340
a

233
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,420
Few like like 20,000 times

234
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:50,060
I've said my name a lot like in my life and I've never for instance analyzed my signature except to say

235
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,180
Oh, you've analyzed your signature. Oh, yeah, baby. There was that I I think I would guess

236
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,100
And man, this isn't a joke. Maybe 14 or 15 years old

237
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,460
I was like time to turn my signature into an autograph and I just

238
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,740
Handcrafted a very specific signing mechanism. Awesome

239
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,440
So like what's that mean for people who want to like forge checks of you?

240
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,660
Well, I'm not gonna tell me that but mostly I just removed a lot of letters

241
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,340
That's that's an important step and that is a part of this

242
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,120
It's think about which parts of your name you want to include which I've seen your signature for Travis

243
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,820
It's to wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle and then that's it. No, I usually get the S on the end there, too

244
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,020
So it's to wait where we will miss

245
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Yeah

246
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:44,980
Yeah, that's usually that's usually about as far as we get a lot of people don't know what an uppercase cursive G looks like

247
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,380
So I'm always I'm always that's how weird the General Mills is what I usually turn

248
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,660
That's it. That's a good then. That's also what I do every time I sign my name

249
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,940
I think about that great brand and how they do their G

250
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,900
But it makes it turns me into a sort of international man of mystery. I

251
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,540
Adjust in signature, you know what that is cuz everybody knows that J. It's friendly

252
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,020
It looks like a fun little shoe that something you guys imagine if your name was like Zeke

253
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:16,020
And you had to sign that in cursive every time every time you put pen to paper and think how do I start this bad boy?

254
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,460
Every time what's that? Yeah, even look like if it was Z

255
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,340
II

256
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,340
uppercase Q

257
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,620
God Zeke get out. That's fucking that's um, that's a maze. You've drawn a children's maze

258
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,100
This cursive I was Google search cursive Z and there's like ten different

259
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,900
It's because of that time they got to that letter in the alphabet everybody was like I'm so tired of coming up with squiggly

260
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,540
Beautiful letters just have fun with it. Whatever you do. Just have fun

261
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,940
Imagine being like in Britain and you got to write ZED anytime you want to put a Z

262
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:02,420
Yeah, and that's crazy because then it's like who's the deek and it's like that's actually a very cool name

263
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,260
Draw inspiration from other signatures. Look at the signatures of other famous people. I'm just

264
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,600
Well, no, I mean I'm not gonna start signing posters Walt Disney

265
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,940
Why not if you just said like well, that's just what my signature looks like

266
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,900
It says Griffin, but when I write it, it looks like Walt Disney

267
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Yeah, there's some other examples here. John Hancock obviously iconic. It probably took that dude

268
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,720
12 minutes to do this signet like

269
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:34,980
There's so much calligraphy happening here and that there's like a little what is almost certain like a mason

270
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,420
Like signature like little emblem at the bottom. I'll tell you who fucks me up is curve on a git

271
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,660
He draws he draws like a face

272
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,020
well next to his with like hair and like a squiggly mustache and it's like

273
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,980
Kurt you wrote quite a few books and

274
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,860
Probably signed your fair share of them. You're really gonna do a little doodle, isn't it?

275
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:02,580
Well doodle in every one stank green doesn't angler fish every time and that it's like who has the time?

276
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,380
Like really stank green and Kurt Kurt Vonnegut. Yeah

277
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,940
Do you think when John Hancock was signing the Declaration of Independence?

278
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Do you think he thought to himself?

279
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,900
Certainly, this won't be the most notable thing that I do

280
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:22,140
Yeah, certainly the the pica of mice my signature won't be the burning

281
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,340
Shit, do you think that when he went first? He thought this is gonna be how big everyone signs up

282
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,660
This is that is why this is right there. Like he did it first and he's like, let's go

283
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,420
There is like well, there's a lot of us John. Yeah, I wish okay

284
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,140
Fit in here buddy you you rude bitch

285
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,340
Well, I guess I just assumed we'd all write this thing you didn't even ask us

286
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,540
Why would you do some simple math?

287
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,180
You can see we can't fit on there with this car and we only have one pot of ink my dude

288
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,100
This is 1776 are we supposed to pop down to stables? Come on?

289
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,700
Hey, hey, do y'all think I think it'd be pretty dope

290
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:10,380
if like in Jurassic Park we could bring John Hancock back and then he was like

291
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,500
Looking around. He's like damn Hamilton's

292
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,340
Huge and but I where's the old? Where's the John?

293
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,620
And then he saw oh fuck. Wait, there is a movie called Hancock

294
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:26,060
I gotta get down on this and he goes he watches it and it's not what he wants it to be because it's like a

295
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,740
Will Smith superhero rock. I don't remember any of this. I don't remember dude. I don't remember any of it

296
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,700
I don't remember having superpowers falling in love with Charlize Theron

297
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,300
But I'm doing that right now watching. I'll try it. I'll give it a shot magnetic

298
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,660
Underline your signature for emphasis. Whatever. Don't fucking do that. No, don't do that unless

299
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,100
John Hancock did that if it's part of a letter if you could do like an S at the end and then it goes

300
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,500
Sue right back across the back like that if it's included as part of a letter

301
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,860
I think that he does he does he does a tail off his K

302
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:05,580
Look at this which goes down in and he does another H below his name. Yeah

303
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,380
ready to do a

304
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,060
Reprise of Hancock and there was like alright stop Hancock, too

305
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,780
So then there's about like eight different variations on ad flourishes. This one's

306
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,460
Amazing though this person in these images by the way signing their name wiki how which is fun

307
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,180
Number six add numbers or symbols to your signature. Oh like Ke$ha. Okay

308
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,260
The symbols might include a team jersey number a simple sketch or a graduation year

309
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,820
If you associate a specific number or symbol with your identity for instance

310
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,980
If you're well known for your role on a sports team

311
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,220
This may be a good way to publicly distinguish yourself from people with similar names

312
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,100
It could also be a good called shot though

313
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,020
If you're not distinguished as a sports team and you want to become so

314
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:58,820
Just start writing like Travis McElroy number 25 and then we're like what but then like you do train and you put in the work

315
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,940
And you get drafted by the Eagles in the first round and you're like, this is a dream come true

316
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,940
And they're like your number

317
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,940
78 and you're like fuck

318
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,020
Can't change can't be this one. Oh, sorry, man. This one's already this guy's already got this one. Shit. Can we trade?

319
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,020
What they have done in this picture though is they've written the number 23 just like above

320
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:27,060
The word wiki had the signature wiki how you can which I'm pretty sure if you do that on like for instance a check

321
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,460
The bank is going to say this is invalid

322
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,580
You can't just the numbers live on the check in very specific

323
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:41,580
We've made little homes for the numbers to live on in check and you can't just go writing shit like that down willy-nilly

324
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,540
I I would also say and I'm looking this up because I might be wrong

325
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,300
But number 23 is Michael Jordan, right? Like which is awesome, which is an awesome number to put down there

326
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,340
But like I know that and I don't know anything about sports

327
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,740
So I think if you just want to start putting number 23 and people were like, is that your number and back now man?

328
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,900
Big fan of George. Yeah, so

329
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,460
Jordan hey, I hate you know why I hate writing checks

330
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:15,380
Why cuz pre a lot of the time it's got the word 40 on there and I got to write the word for me. Oh, yeah

331
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,300
It's like it's like six or seven minutes. Just like

332
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:25,900
Like trying to dig deep like is that you in there or not? It's a tough one. Oh my god, Justin. Okay, I

333
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,780
Thought you were saying I thought you were saying

334
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,940
Because you are a 40 year old man. Is that you Justin inside the number?

335
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,620
I wasn't even thinking about the spelling of the word 40, but yeah, man, you gotta write that

336
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,200
Sometimes you have to write the word and it's like how do you spell?

337
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,620
I thought Justin was having an existential crisis

338
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,220
But that's no no, no, I should have been more clear like you have to write the the

339
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
For the kids that haven't written checks

340
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Cuz I know a lot of teens

341
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,900
I'm not writing checks. You gotta write the the words of the numbers. We have

342
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,380
To make sure you're serious about this on an episode of my brother my brother me too cuz you guys come on you can't keep saying

343
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,420
That's not our job. Yeah, that's right. Like that accountability is not it's not our problem

344
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,860
You know, my least favorite part of writing checks is what Miley Cyrus's favorite part of rain

345
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:20,300
Favorite part arranger probably signing up and cash to take him to the big bank. Where's my checkbook?

346
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,740
You know what I mean? Like where is that thing? I use it once a year. Hey, Billy, right?

347
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
I

348
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Probably calls him dad, don't you think?

349
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,540
No way, maybe before he had that collab I was Lil Nas X

350
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,460
Yeah, and then like before that it was probably dad, but he's like no, honey. Now I'm Billy Ray. I'm

351
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,660
They just did a goof about me on Great British Bake Off. I'm back

352
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:55,580
I bet Billy Ray was kind of pissed off that he couldn't translate that that success in the other. I got some other stuff in my

353
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,100
Catalog, you guys

354
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,380
Yeah, I bet it's passively earning money all the time. Justin. Come on. I mean, I'm sure that that goes down

355
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,100
I think Billy Ray counts himself

356
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,760
very lucky on days where he gets called Billy Ray in the house in the household and not just like

357
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:18,560
My least head or hey, hey dip shit. Hey, get me my checkbook scum nut. Hey

358
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
The dog saying that

359
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,080
Billy Ray Cyrus, okay, he's from sort of our neighborhood right from flowers, Kentucky

360
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,240
It's not too far from our neck of the woods. Billy Ray Cyrus has this

361
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,080
Jumbo hit with achy-breaky heart filmed at the Paramount Theatre over national data. Yeah, if you ever watch that video

362
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,200
It's right right around here. So Billy Ray has this Jumbo hit, right?

363
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,920
And it's like he starts to fade away and everybody's like, well, that was a cool run with Billy Ray

364
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,840
I wonder whatever happened that dude. He's like, oh psych my daughter's the most famous person on the planet

365
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:00,200
Swing at it. Huh Billy daughter. Oh, my daughter's those famous person planet. All right, so Billy Ray's back

366
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,640
Oh, he's on Hannah Montana. He's back and then it just wouldn't start to ebb

367
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:10,860
He's backing like the biggest song on the planet this dude. We keep putting him back at bat

368
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:17,340
It's wild how he just keeps like finding his way. Yes, you have someone loose. Oh, hey, yeah

369
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
Okay, you want to sell your soul again?

370
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,020
Man, I don't know. It's been like five times dude. Like I don't know if we can keep making this deal my man

371
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,560
All right. Yeah. Yeah, you got it. You want to be on dr. Quinn medicine one? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Are you sure?

372
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,160
Okay, just sign here in blood man. Yeah, you got it. Okay

373
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,560
Hey, um, Trev, I don't

374
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,920
But that's it's not Billy Ray Cyrus. Dr. Good medicine was just a guy that looks like him. Are you sure he was on?

375
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,440
100% it looks a lot like on hold on

376
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,800
No, we're no one is good. You're thinking of doc doc. Thank you. Yes, the series where this it's a fantasy series

377
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:04,080
Right, right, right. Yes, you can see how I get this confused though, right? Yeah, I assume there's some kind of crossover there

378
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,200
They probably had a crossover episode like in crisis on infinite Earths

379
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,160
When they made that show

380
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,720
I mean there had to be an episode where somebody's like this guy's heart is fucked up and Billy Ray just starts sweating

381
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
They're gonna make they're gonna make me do it

382
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,000
His hearts are really really really fucked up man

383
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,360
Dr. Something's wrong with it. I don't know. It's by all our medical measurements

384
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,360
His heart seems fine, but it's it's really fucked up. Dr. Billy Ray Cyrus. I've got eggs

385
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,280
And you might call it a

386
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Break

387
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Doc is a young Christian bachelor

388
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:55,400
The mountains of Montana who brings his small-town values and ideology to an environment that seems to lack familiarity with them

389
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Wikipedia get a little judgy

390
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:10,080
Yeah, this this this small-town doctor from real America. Thanks wiki. Hey, man

391
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,360
Montana is a great name you guys ever think about?

392
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Hey

393
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,760
Let's take a quick break and head on over to the money zone

394
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,400
Where space we've talked about it so many times you guys that I don't even know what they do

395
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Yeah

396
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,640
Why we just read it like this doesn't you don't think about it, you know

397
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,120
I have all this stuff is scripted. Like it's all every single word we say. Mm-hmm

398
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,760
well, the money zone is kind of my chance to just really check out and

399
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,920
Think about like how's the show going so far? Like what could I do to improve in the second half?

400
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,400
This is kind of our halftime. So like when I say that like with Squarespace, you can make a beautiful website

429
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,340
I thought it was a big empty warehouse that I could like run around in and do it

430
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,220
Yeah, and play freeze tag and shit. Yeah paintball fights and stuff

And now I just got it's crates and crates of minion dolls and I have no not even stuffed

432
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,020
These are like anatomically like figures. Yeah, like nine-inch

433
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,700
Plastic hard plastic and they don't move. There's no points of articulation and I don't know when you say

Yeah, yeah, and this is and this is again folks

435
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,520
Completely scripted. Yeah that stamps wanted us to say this next part

436
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,800
Travis when you say anatomically correct minion dolls. Yeah, what does that mean specifically and read it?

437
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,360
I'll read it right off the script. Okay, it shows the banana fuck that sucks. This show sucks now

438
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,080
It used to be it and this is still in the script I fucking hate that stamps me to say this part

439
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
But it used to be something

440
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:25,600
I don't understand why stamps made us denigrate our own podcast. No, it says here

458
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
Let's see, I live in Denver, Colorado

459
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,560
The air up here is very thin and dry due to the city's elevation as a consequence

460
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
My skin is always super dry

461
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Every winter I look forward to getting cracked

462
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:27,580
Bloody knuckles. Why do you look anytime a stiff breeze rolls through because of this I was carried small portable

463
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,740
Bottle of lotion in my backpack anywhere I go and every single time I busted out to reapply lotion on my knuckles or face

464
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,800
Someone has to make a joke about why a guy is 20s would actually have

465
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,540
lotion on hand

466
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
Wow, you're so horny

467
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:50,440
Wow, you're so horny you can't even wait until you get over work

468
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,580
Jeez, man. Anyways, that'll be 1495

469
00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:00,620
More like jizz man. I am getting pretty sick of hearing the same joke over and over and over again brothers

470
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,980
Is there any way I can make the joke stop?

471
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,820
Are there any witty responses I should be using or do I need to accept my fate and prepare?

472
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:14,020
Myself for a lifetime of jokes about where the lotion is being applied. That's from moisturizing not

473
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,700
masturbating in the mile-high city

474
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,340
Love Denver

475
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,140
Lucifer big scary blue sir, the nice nice people

476
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,520
Snowboarding jump ramps love it. I'm ready masturbating every

477
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,140
sucks

478
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,580
that

479
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
it it's

480
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,940
2021 and

481
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:51,980
Everybody's moisturizing. Yeah, and it seems like the people who are doing this to you are the ones who deserve

482
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,220
Derision and not you because I think we've all realized that

483
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,660
It's tough out here. So why not keep it?

484
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,500
It like what like what keep it away. You know what I mean? Like

485
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:14,220
Why not put that lotion on it and feel better for how it feel moisturized and good for it?

486
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,140
The the problem here question answer is you can really only deal with this one person at a time

487
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:25,140
Like unless you get some kind of grapevine going where it's like, hey, don't make that joke to Jim man. He's

488
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,140
He's sick of it

489
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,060
Yeah, you're gonna have to do this one person at a time

490
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:35,500
But I'll give you the response that I think would work best Justin. Can you please say the prompt to me?

491
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,940
The like the one that's outlined here. Yeah. Yeah. Wow, you're so horny. You can't even wait until you get it from work

492
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Jiz man, what do you mean?

493
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,980
Like I'm you use the cream to masturbate wait what it's a joke

494
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,100
Yeah, it's a joke about how you can use cream for a better masturbation experience

495
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,940
No one actually does it. I don't think but it is a fun joke from high school. Are you talking about? Yeah

496
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,700
well, you see you have cream and you use it to squeeze your part until the

497
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,580
Tell the just comes out from the good feel. Are you making this up?

498
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,220
No, no. No, it's a popular joke. Let's here. Come here. Oh, let me open my computer here

499
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,620
I'll show you some of the different things about it. You see now. I'm surprised you don't know about this follow. Oh

500
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,100
Oh, okay. Well see what happens is you?

501
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,700
Use the lotion on your I believe in some nations is called a tally whacker

502
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,380
Uh-huh, and you use the lotion on there to help the just come better. But why oh

503
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,060
Well, it's supposed to be a better feeling. I don't know

504
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,300
I've never tried it myself, but it isn't it's sort of a fun joke and freeze

505
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Has this ever happened to you?

506
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:52,460
Hi, everyone. It's me. Dr. Anthony Fauci. I

507
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,020
Pretty much polished off the kovat stuff

508
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,900
and so now I moved on to another subject this dear a dear to my heart and that's using the lotion for when you

509
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,220
Touch it touch shit good to make the stuff come out

510
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,620
I'm a doctor and I've been studying my whole life about this one very cool thing

511
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,100
Which is why it was kind of a hobby weird that I got called up

512
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,740
It's weird I got called up for this other thing

513
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,900
And I the whole time I tried to hint that this was a nasty thing that I liked a lot

514
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:36,540
During my many press conferences, but people then got pretty pissed off at me and they don't know that I'm a good time guy

515
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:43,700
Anyway, when you touch it to make it feel good the lotion even is better for you and

516
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
Just think about it

517
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,060
Just let him know because if we say it for long enough on the show

518
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:08,900
Then it becomes Canada this weird sort of splinter reality is created and then anytime anybody talks about Fauci

519
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,140
Yeah, it's gonna be like my wife's gonna talk about Fauci and he'll be like he's that guy that loves the little

520
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,660
Lotion on it when you touch it makes it feel better

521
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,220
It's me, dr. Fauci again, it makes it feel like the real deal

522
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,060
and that's and that's

523
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:32,780
And that's awesome to me make it feel like the real deal with dr. Fauci's goo

524
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,880
Is he selling a brand of it or is this a public?

525
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,900
Justin it's like how sometimes there's just commercials for beef. Yeah

526
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,740
Get together and it's like eat beef y'all get it

527
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:58,880
Um, nobody's eating beef. Hey, we need to get people talk about milk. How we gonna talk about milk?

528
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,620
Yeah, okay, so I'm sorry about that

529
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,460
Dr. Fauci, I don't know how to solve this problem

530
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:11,220
I keep a bottle of lotion next to the bed and my wife has been calling it my spank lube for 12 years

531
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,620
I can do about it. Can't stop no matter how many times I'm like, it's not funny anymore, honey

532
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
she keeps going with it and

533
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Um, there's nothing to be done

534
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,580
It's somewhat you pull out your lotion to put on your hands and they're like, oh you so hurry

535
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,780
Use your that lotion masturbate and you say I don't use this lotion masturbate

536
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:35,120
And then you pull out a second bottle and you go use this lotion to masturbate. It's way cheaper. That's not a masturbation lotion

537
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:43,500
This is hand lotion, it's like $20 a bottle this it's like 50 cents for like two gallons

538
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,220
My man, and it gets the job done. It's dr. Fauci's good

539
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,500
I gotta buy them both. I gotta buy them both. Yeah, I

540
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,300
Debate so much. I go through gallons of this. Where are you going?

541
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,780
I've had a cat for about four years now and nobody in my family gets her presents

542
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,900
This seemed normal until my mom got a puppy and my brother got a girlfriend with a dog Wow

543
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:12,340
We really got to get some other commas in here or something to help me decode this way. Yep

544
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:18,800
Okay, so nobody my family gets her presents. That seemed normal until my mom got a puppy and my brother

545
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,360
My brother brother got a girlfriend with a dog. It's like really fucking me up right now

546
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,880
I know we're just having a lot of fun. I can't park me

547
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,720
Yeah, he used a dog to get a girlfriend. No, he got a girlfriend and the girlfriend

548
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,960
Has a dog I think I don't think I don't think that's right

549
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,320
Maybe the mom getting a puppy somehow led to the but my mom got a puppy and so

550
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,840
Until one of her my brother got a girlfriend with a dog. Take that mom

551
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,080
Okay, English is not specific moving on now everyone in my family gets the dogs presents for gift-giving holidays

552
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,760
But still never get to my cat anything

553
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,920
I thought my cat is being left out and isn't considered a member of the family despite being around the longest

554
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,840
How do I get my family start buying my cat's presents? That's from cat friend in Chicago

555
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:16,160
You probably can't yeah, I own two dogs and a cat. I've had the cat longer. So that said

556
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,040
dogs are

557
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
inherently doofy and

558
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,880
silly boys

559
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,120
Even though mine are two girls and they when they get presents they lose it

560
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:34,040
Right you give a dog a chew toy or a bone or something and you you're like God

561
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,480
This showering manna upon the people right you give a cat a present

562
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,840
They'll look at it and then walk away

563
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,000
Maybe they'll play with it when you're not in the room

564
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,440
But they're not going to show you any kind of excitement when you give it to like it that doesn't yeah

565
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,440
It's not satisfying to give a cat a present

566
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,480
You know right really don't

567
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,520
I got I got my cat. It's funny. I got my cat's been crying a lot

568
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,920
My cat really has been crying a lot. So I'm trying to cheer her up

569
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:08,000
by getting her some new stuff to interact with around the house, and I got this little like it's not little it's like a

570
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,760
Crinkly tunnel nice with the bed in the middle. It's pretty big. I mean it's it's pretty big

571
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,760
It's not inconsiderable, and I put it out a while ago

572
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,080
And I realized like I've never seen her do that like be in it or on it. Yeah, and it occurred to me like

573
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,960
This is art. Oh, it's a piece now. Yes now. It's just a piece right now

574
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,320
It's just an installation if I had a dog, but I could tell the dog like can you please interact?

575
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,600
Oh, yes, absolutely, please if you wait

576
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,680
I really got an egg on my face on this you wiggle something near a dog. They're like okay, gotcha gotcha gotcha

577
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,200
I'm right on that man the number of times that I've held something up to my cat

578
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,160
And I've realized after a couple seconds like I look like an idiot like the cat is just staring me like I know

579
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,680
What you want don't get it twisted. I know you want me to play with that thing

580
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,800
I'm not interested in that man and like I don't know what to tell you do we're at an impasse here

581
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:06,000
I'm just saying that my cat is way cooler than me real stinker. You know. I love her so much. It's just like

582
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,760
She's too good for me. I don't deserve her. I just don't have pets and so I feel like this is

583
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,120
Exclude like excluding me because I don't

584
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,400
I don't have anything to say about cuz I don't have any

585
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,800
You have kids and they're kind of like pets right? Yeah. I don't want yeah. I don't like my cat. Yeah, right

586
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,760
I like one of my dogs a lot more than the other one, and I think that I think they know I mean

587
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,240
I don't have pets, but I feel like that's the kind of thing when you say people don't like it. No listen

588
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,200
I love them both. I just love one a lot more

589
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,360
Yes

590
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,960
It's perfect. Yeah, just like kids just like brothers. I don't know

591
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,000
Cats are doing their own thing cats also like dogs don't have a movie about them by Andrew Lloyd Webber

592
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,120
So there's well. I mean all dogs go to heaven

593
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,520
What's not by Andrew Lloyd Webber, okay?

594
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:02,040
If you're saying specifically dogs don't have a movie by Andrew Lloyd Webber. I can't argue with you there

595
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,080
Good. I

596
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,320
Could I could argue that okay? Okay? Yeah, they do

597
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,680
Dogs have a bat dogs have a badass movie by Andrew Lloyd Webber. What's it called dogs?

598
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,120
You think he made it you think he made a movie you think he made one called cats

599
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,760
And then he was like time to make one for dogs, and he was like mr.. Mr.. Fluffer's magic day at the city

600
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,120

621
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,960

00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,120
Thank you Travis for listening and having a basic sort of art appreciation skills

a strip throat, you know, like everybody gets 14 times when they're in middle school or

00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:50,720
Well, my well my dad knows something so maybe six or seven hours go by it's getting towards the evening and I'm like

643
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,920
I got it. I got to see what's going on because I'm losing my mind over here. I text the guy

644
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,760
I'm like dad. Did you ever hear anything about your tests? And

645
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,360
He said I'm one. I don't want to just like

646
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,280
So I just say well spoiler alert just to jump ahead. So no one's worried

647
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
That's fine. Okay

648
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,320

hang on

650
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:24,720
Negative and I say, uh, what a relief all that said no and dad said I know

651
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,760
Thanks for checking on me. Now. What now what would you?

652
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,720
Listener think that my dad meant

653
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,880
I'll give you a hint because the 24 hours later the next evening

654
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,680
The next evening. I'm having dinner with my family

655
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:50,640
my other family my wife's I get texts from my dad to me and Travis and Griffin that said

656
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,960
Negative on my kovat test now boys

657
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,600
I do want to ask did dad

658
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:01,280
Communicate to you before this that he was being tested for the novel coronavirus only when I facetimed him

659
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,640
15 minutes before he sent this text message. I haven't spoken to dad in weeks

660
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,040
Weeks. Yeah

661
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:14,600
Negative on my kovat tests. I said, uh, I dad told me yesterday, but I cared enough to which was an awesome flex

662
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,640
yeah, and then dad said

663
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,160
That was the strep test. I

664
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,920
Just got covered results now my dad then

665
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:33,240
My dad Clint McElroy told me I had said have you heard anything about your tests?

666
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:40,320
For kovat and strep him. He's just says negative. He hasn't heard anything about both Justin

667
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no my friend on phone now

668
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:51,520
Negative, okay, and then I said, uh, what a really probably thought what a waxing to say

669
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:57,000
I was so worried that you had strep throat. I was so worried. You'll have to eat popsicles

670
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,400
I was so worried about your strep throat. I

671
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,800
I don't know why we're litigating this on on me. I'm on the air

672
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,400
I mean, it's a I said the boys a screenshot because I couldn't believe I

673
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:16,120
Couldn't believe now on the one hand like I guess I'm kind of guys that I didn't have to worry about my dad having code for

674
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,080
It for a whole day that I kind of appreciate it, but it was not intentional

675
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,700
Yeah, I just don't worry about anything

676
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,200
ever

677
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,280
