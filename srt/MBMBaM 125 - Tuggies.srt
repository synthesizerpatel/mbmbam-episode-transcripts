1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello and welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, your advice show for a modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm your sweet- Did you want me in it?

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, this is awkward. Can I finish?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Go ahead, Griffin.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,440
Well, fuck! Let me loose!

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,680
Alright, spit that fire.

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:18,080
I'm gonna fucking- No, it's just not gonna happen now.

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,760
Let's cancel the whole show.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,240
Griffin, they gotta know who you are. They gotta know who you are, Griffin.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
I'm a baby. Gotta love me.

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,480
Sleep in the rain.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
You guys dinosaurs?

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,000
Topical!

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
Dinosaurs, it's back. Now, Griffin, you had a little thrilling tale you were gonna tell about a bug.

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,120
Skeeto. Got a skeeto in my office. Can't see it, been looking, but I got bite.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,200
I got one bite on my wrist, and I know I'm gonna have like 12 bites by the end of this show.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
Open Gotham style!

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Okay, so basically all of the possible openings that we discussed.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
Travis, do you want to talk about Halloween costumes?

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
Ooh, spooky scary!

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,400
Have you guys heard this Gangnam Style?

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
Yeah, it's all about plaids.

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,320
Gangnam Style.

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
It's all about tasteful plaids.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,880
There should be an episode of Put This On called Gangnam Style.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
Don't you think? That's pretty good, right?

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
Yeah, I'd say the half-life for that goof is about 13 more minutes.

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
So if he can possibly, if he can get the crew together real quick.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
Squeeze it out.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,240
So here on this program, are you gonna tell your, finish your story about the bug?

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,960
I was getting into it.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,320
It literally is, there's a bug in my office, I don't know how to deal with it.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm not like bug phobic, but I'm delicious to, delicious to bugs, extra delicious.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
You eat too many nanas.

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,600
Is that it?

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
Yeah, mosquitoes, they love bananas.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Right, but do they love, like I turn those bananas into poop pretty quick, so like.

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
No, you get it in your, in your skin excretions.

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay, I don't like to, I don't like to think about the fact that I have those.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Wow, that's fair.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,520
Guys, we gotta, I want to get to the advice, but we got a wonderful letter this week.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,280
And it came to us, the letterhead, the envelope is from Canisus College.

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,040
And we got an email from a girl named Melina.

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,600
Maybe a woman.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,720
Maybe a woman, a woman named Melina.

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,280
Well, I said girl because she's just out graduating, but yeah, I guess, I guess woman is correct.

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
And she sent that to our post office box.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,800
It's PO Box 54 Huntington, West Virginia 25706.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,880
And she, she's a fan of the story who's a sophomore at Canisus College.

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,200
And, and she stole an envelope from there to mail us.

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,440
And she sent a photo of herself in her, in her cap and gown.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
Uh, and she said that we are the reason she is graduating.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,080
That doesn't seem likely.

59
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
I mean, that, I don't want to, I don't want to put.

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
The last part was not true, but everything else.

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,080
I don't like putting fans on blast, but that there's no possible way that we

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,000
ever aided anyone with any sort of educational progress.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,720
I like, there is someone out there who has slum dog million aired my brother, my brother and me.

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,760
There one fucking possible collection of course loads.

65
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Could anyone ever be offered that would touch on the things that we talk about

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
animal, animal husbandry, specifically geese.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,640
Yeah.

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,200
That's one.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
What about, didn't we talk about different flavors of cotton candy once?

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,120
Yeah, that wasn't sure because why would that ever be part of a collegiate program though?

71
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,840
Clown college.

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,920
Yeah, go home.

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,280
Let's get to some actual questions.

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,800
I want to, as long as we're wasting time, uh, I want to, no, I want to thank, uh,

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
you had to go back to your bug story.

76
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,120
I want to thank it's, I'm up to two bites.

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,240
I got one on my knee.

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
Like don't worry about it though.

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
So I want to thank everyone who donated on, on max Funday last week.

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
We, uh, we did very, very well.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,480
Um, thank you so much to all the donors and our, our, our listener base is now composed

82
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,280
of two groups, donors and boners.

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
And you know what side you fall on.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,200
That's all I'm going to say on the matter.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,360
Uh, let's here's our first question.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm planning on moving into an apartment for the first time soon.

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,240
I'm looking around at some apartments and one in particular has apartments available.

88
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,480
If he says apartments again, I'm going to lose it.

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
Uh, it's such a fun word.

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
Apartments available on the first floor at the top floor.

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,840
My question is, which would be better to move into?

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400
My friends seem split on the decision.

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,360
So I think some insight from MB and BAM is needed.

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
That's from occupying Ontario.

95
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
It's the easiest question ever.

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,400
It's the bottom.

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
It's of course the bottom floor.

98
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,200
A hundred percent.

99
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,720
It's like, do you want to walk an extra?

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
Think about like all of the times that you're going to have to negotiate those stairs.

101
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,800
Like, do you want to walk a hundred miles for no reason?

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,320
No, of course you don't.

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,240
And it may seem, you may think like I've only have to move in and out once,

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,600
but that one time, man, Griffin and I,

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,200
we lived on a third floor apartment when we first moved to Cincinnati

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,600
and getting our sofa and chairs and shit up.

107
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
It was a two day job.

108
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
It was fucking miserable.

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,480
That was the worst.

110
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,720
Yeah.

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
And also if you live on the ground floor,

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,440
it's so much easier for people to find your apartment without like wandering through the

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
building trying to find where you live.

114
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
Also, do you know how Dr. Adkins died?

115
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Slipped on some stairs, fell right down.

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,800
Him and died.

117
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
And then the world got super fat again.

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,280
So just things to keep in mind.

119
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,800
The only upside to the top floor is you get some sweet, sweet balcony action.

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

121
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,720
Another benefit is that if the apartment catches on fire,

122
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
then you're definitely going to die.

123
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,680
So that's another bonus.

124
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,840
Again, we are in a situation where more information is necessary.

125
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,120
So like, notice he says top floor, right?

126
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah.

127
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,560
Now, is top floor like up five flights of stairs?

128
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,360
Bad.

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,920
Or is it like 30th floor, throw open the window to the balcony,

130
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,640
Jay-Z, run this city, 30th floor.

131
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you thinking like helicopter landing pad on the top of the building?

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,560
Exactly.

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Are we talking like by top floor, do you mean the penthouse?

134
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,200
I like to think that this person has enough

135
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,800
goddamn sense in their head that they wouldn't have to ask us like,

136
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,760
should I live in the sweet Las Vegas playboy penthouse

137
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,800
or in this prison cell in the basement?

138
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,360
I also would like to think since this person is moving into their first apartment,

139
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
that this is not like a blank check type situation

140
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,520
where he's just been handed a million dollars.

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
He's like, I guess I'm taking that swank apartment up on the top.

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
But the alternate, I mean, the alternate to the situation you're describing,

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
Griffin, is that this is a person who cannot tell the difference

144
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,880
for whom stairs or no stairs is a binary choice

145
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,600
that you can actually decide on rather than a self-evident truth.

146
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,520
Of course, you don't want stairs.

147
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,400
Sure, stairs.

148
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,080
But maybe the top floor is bigger.

149
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
Maybe the downstairs apartment is a smaller apartment.

150
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,200
Because what kind of fucking top heavy building do you think this is?

151
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
No, I'm saying that maybe it's like a house that's been converted to apartments

152
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,680
and like the downstairs is two and the upstairs is one.

153
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,440
I'm just saying that there are factors here in which it may not be as straightforward,

154
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,600
but I still stand by that it is straightforward

155
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,920
and the answer is always the bottom floor.

156
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,680
Obviously the bottom floor, it's going to be nice.

157
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,320
It depends.

158
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,240
No, it doesn't.

159
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,480
It does because my first apartment ever was in the West Virginia building,

160
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,000
the tallest building in Huntington, West Virginia.

161
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,520
I was on the 13th.

162
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
That's actually the coal exchange building we're going on.

163
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,640
I was in the, why are you going to put me on blast?

164
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
Just, well, I mean, if you're just going to fucking spit a bunch of nonsense.

165
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
I was on the 13th floor.

166
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,640
We played, we rochambeaued to decide who got the rooms.

167
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,920
There was one very small room with a painted shut window,

168
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,600
one slightly larger room with no windows whatsoever.

169
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,520
And then another room on the corner of the 13th,

170
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,520
like all windowed walls looking out like the pimpest view of the city ever.

171
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,560
And we had to rochambeau for it and I won fortunately.

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
And it was like a totally sweet, it was a totally sweet deal.

173
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
You could look out on all of Huntington's splendor.

174
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
That was kind of nice.

175
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,400
That was worth the minute and a half long elevator trip up and down.

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
I think that there does come a certain point where you pass like fourth floor

177
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
and it gets to be like, well, now the height is just awesome.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I would say more than fourth.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
I would say eighth.

180
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,680
10 floors.

181
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,760
At least.

182
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,480
I mean, think about the look on your nana's face when she says,

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,920
when she says, listen, occupying Ontario, I want you to take my sleeper sofa.

184
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,480
And you say, thanks, thanks, num nums.

185
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
That's what he calls his grandma.

186
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
And I want you to take my sleeper sofa.

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
And then you just have to sit there, sit it on her lawn,

188
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,480
pretend like you're taking it and sit it on her lawn and burn it.

189
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,980
Yeah.

190
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
You have to do that because you can't take it into your new apartment.

191
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,280
Because if you've ever tried to move a sleeper sofa,

192
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,000
it's the worst period at all.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,640
Try to do it.

194
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
Period. At all. Try to do it.

195
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,240
You know that it is not anything anybody would ever want to move ever.

196
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,840
Sure. And also the fire, the fire thing is pretty bad.

197
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Just keep in mind the fire thing.

198
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
And the other thing about sleeper sofas is I don't think I've ever opened one up

199
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
where there's not something in there.

200
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah. Cheerios.

201
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,840
Cheerios and Snickers wrappers.

202
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,920
Like a highlighter in there for some reason.

203
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
There's a Highlifes.

204
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,880
There's a Highlifes.

205
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,960
Somebody was reading about Goofus and Gallant in there.

206
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,880
I don't know, it's a flashlight.

207
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,600
They made a tent.

208
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
Did you guys know that the blank check house is here in Austin, Texas?

209
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,680
No.

210
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,400
Yeah, it is.

211
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,680
Did you guys also know that in that film,

212
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,360
he bought a fucking mansion for less than a million dollars?

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,040
Yes.

214
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,720
A million dollars was the sum total of money that the child had.

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,400
And he bought literally everything in the world.

216
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,640
Okay, okay, but wait a minute.

217
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,360
But wait a minute.

218
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
So we're talking about blank check.

219
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,360
They're talking about a mansion.

220
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,560
Is the mansion, in the theory of the story, is the mansion in Austin?

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
I don't know that the film was set in Austin

222
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,600
because they go to an amusement park and I don't think there's anything really nearby.

223
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
There's some shit down in New Bromfels,

224
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
but I don't think they would go to New Bromfels in the fiction.

225
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,680
In the fiction, they wouldn't go to New Bromfels.

226
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,440
He fucking hired fat, fake John Candy to drive him around.

227
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
Like that would cost more than a million dollars nowadays.

228
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
To pay a fat, fake John Candy to be your butt.

229
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,360
He had like a wall of like 30 TVs, right?

230
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,680
Yeah, that's at least a cool three mil.

231
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,840
And he had like a slide installed in his house.

232
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Yeah, that's 20 mil right there.

233
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,320
And like a virtual reality chair and like a big bouncy ball thing.

234
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,360
Like what the fuck?

235
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,160
Yeah.

236
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,360
What kind of discount place is he buying all this shit from?

237
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
Got it on Craigslist.

238
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,280
If you're looking at New Bromfels right now,

239
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:21,520
I can get you into like a nice six bed, seven bath on Park Road.

240
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,320
And that's gonna cost you 1.4 million and that's not even-

241
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,200
That's not even counting-

242
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,840
That's not even a-

243
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,040
Fucking water slide, it's not counting the expensive date

244
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
with the woman who kind of looked like more famous women of the era.

245
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,680
And also you can't hire fat, fake John Candy to be your best friend forever.

246
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
Just can't do it.

247
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,520
Not for that kind of money.

248
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,160
If that movie was called 200 blank checks and then you got a mil on each of them,

249
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,520
maybe we could talk.

250
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,560
Maybe we could talk.

251
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,480
But hold on.

252
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,520
I wanna give you some perspective and this is very indicative of how our economy has gone.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,840
A million dollars in 1994 equals $1.5 million now.

254
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,120
Not even close though.

255
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
Not even close.

256
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
How are things by the way?

257
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,160
How is your economy that inflation is that fast?

258
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,880
That's crazy.

259
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,920
That's rough and tumble.

260
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,480
But it's even still, do you think that fake Sinbad would threaten to kill a child for $1.5 million?

261
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,160
Do you mean Tone Loke, Griffin?

262
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
Sorry Griffin, do you mean Tone Loke, you bigot?

263
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,840
Because I believe Sinbad is fake Tone Loke.

264
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
I got him switched.

265
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,160
I think if you check the math-

266
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,120
I did it bad.

267
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,240
He did a wrong job.

268
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
I don't mean to make this a fucking-

269
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
The unofficial blank check cast.

270
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,280
What I'm saying is that the whole movie is horseshit.

271
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,760
And I would like to talk about it for about 40 more minutes.

272
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,480
Is he- but okay, but is he leasing?

273
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,680
Oh.

274
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,480
I want to read another question, but Travis, do you have two in a row from Ontario?

275
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,000
Apparently I do.

276
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
I like that.

277
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
Are we sure it's not from the same person?

278
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
Yeah, it's different people.

279
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,300
Okay.

280
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,960
Oh, this is good.

281
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,120
We should save this for next week, but I'm just gonna go ahead and-

282
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,400
This is a teaser to get more of the same.

283
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,240
I want to snap into this particular Slim Jim.

284
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760
I work in a haunted building.

285
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,200
It used to be a hospital, which has since been turned into a retirement home.

286
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,360
Many of the employees have encountered weird things like whispering in the ear

287
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
when they're alone and see reflections in the glass and no one's behind them.

288
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Even to the extreme of an employee getting thrown against the wall, which somebody saw.

289
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,720
The problem is that I don't believe in any of that stuff, but I want to.

290
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,720
How can I convince whatever is haunting my work to prove they exist to me?

291
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,200
Prove they exist to me. That's from one to believe in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

292
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
You gotta fuck in that hospital.

293
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
You gotta get high.

294
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,480
You've got to have sex.

295
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,440
You've got to curse and you've got to be black.

296
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,240
And I think you gotta say things like, oh no, that's just a legend.

297
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,840
That's just a legend.

298
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,320
If you do these things, the killer will reveal themselves to you.

299
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,760
If you say stuff like, I'm just one day away from retirement.

300
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
Uh huh. Yes, that's a good way.

301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
From hospital work.

302
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,480
Yes.

303
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,200
If you say, I hope no one eats this ghost food I laid out,

304
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,880
then that is a pretty sure way to get them.

305
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,400
Now specifically, Justin, can you, because I know that you had a brief ghost hunter phase.

306
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,080
What is the, what kind of food, what kind of food are we talking about?

307
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,960
Okay, well, ghost combos.

308
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,840
Is that the ghost of combos or combos of combos?

309
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,000
So when you eat combos.

310
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,640
Okay, so you get a bowl, you fill it with combos.

311
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:42,960
Okay.

312
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,520
You eat all the combos in that bowl.

313
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,080
Sure.

314
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,160
It's the ghost of combos.

315
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,640
But you gotta make sure that you leave the combos there long enough

316
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,760
for the energy to soak into the area.

317
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,200
Sure, the spectral residue from these combos.

318
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,360
How come that's not on the fucking bag of ingredients?

319
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,240
What if my kid's allergic to spectral combo residue?

320
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,960
Thanks for nothing, General Mills.

321
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,440
My kid's dead.

322
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,240
The other important thing is you have to eat them as violently as possible

323
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,080
to be sure to leave behind the spirit.

324
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,120
Right, it's best if they have an unrequited love too.

325
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
They need some sort of unfinished business.

326
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
One of the combos is maybe gonna go to college, you know, something like that.

327
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
Man, fuck.

328
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh my God, guys, I, on a whim, I have just searched for ghost equipment on Amazon.

329
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
And now I'm off to the races.

330
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,920
Darn it, because that is-

331
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,400
Oh, golly, this is a new thing.

332
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,320
To afford your new ghost hunting equipment,

333
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
are you gonna pawn your fushigi balls?

334
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Do you just hove from one dumb thing to another?

335
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,080
I think my, I feel like my skill in the art of fushigi is,

336
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,560
or as we call it, contact juggling, is really about to blossom.

337
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,200
Do you think that you could use your fushigi to attract ghosts?

338
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
I thought my shit was cool, but what are you doing?

339
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,920
Yeah, then I'm haunted by the ghost of my dignity.

340
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,360
It was there and then it disappeared as I fushigi'd.

341
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,000
When I suggested that you fuck at your place of business,

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,720
first of all, it's just a great idea, because it feels great to do it.

343
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,560
But more importantly, ghosts are real dirty, which we've discussed many times.

344
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
And so if you get down, then a ghost is gonna wanna come by,

345
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,160
see what's happening, maybe try to participate.

346
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,080
I mean, you catch them in a dreamcatcher.

347
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,000
You catch them in a dreamcatcher, like in the movie Dreamcatcher or something.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,840
Hey guys, next week, let's make our entire show about ghosts.

349
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,160
Okay, everybody send your ghost questions.

350
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,840
Do you have ghost questions or do you have a terrifically spooky tale

351
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,440
of when you were haunted by a ghost?

352
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
I'm getting spooked just thinking about it.

353
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,440
And we'll tell you about how we used to get drunk in an old asylum.

354
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,560
We'll tell you about the creepy warehouse where they used to store

355
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,760
the pink Cadillac that our dad drove for work.

356
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
And now it's a 7-Eleven.

357
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
Man, I'm getting scared just thinking about it.

358
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,120
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo!

359
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,240
Sure, I have a few.

360
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
This one was sent in by Justin Brown.

361
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
Thank you, Justin.

362
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark.

363
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,600
I'm starting to think Question Mark is not an actual, like, legit Yahoo Answer name.

364
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,280
Maybe it's like, if your Yahoo Answer name is like real, like racist or offensive,

365
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,360
they just, they switch it out.

366
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,920
Instead of that, can you just start saying The Riddler?

367
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,800
This one was sent in by The Riddler.

368
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,300
Thanks.

369
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,120
Thanks, The Riddler.

370
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
No, Yahoo Answers User Question Mark asks,

371
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,360
Yahoo Answers User Question Mark asks, how do I become like Dog the Bounty Hunter?

372
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,600
I am a big fan of Dog the Bounty Hunter.

373
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,280
Would love to go around catching bad guys and hauling them to jail.

374
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,040
Would I need to immigrate to America or could I do this in the UK?

375
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,440
What weapons am I allowed to have?

376
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
Can I drive faster, do the job?

377
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,920
Wouldn't you love if he came to America illegally and Dog had to be sent after him?

378
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
And at the same time, he was hunting Dog.

379
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,800
I learned it from watching you, Dog.

380
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,480
I learned it from watching you.

381
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,120
I just went to Bounty Hut and there's nothing in Bounty Hut in the UK.

382
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,560
It's just this 12-year-old kid with a mullet and a leather vest.

383
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,840
Let's go down the extensive list of reasons why you'd have to move to America to do this job.

384
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,440
The extensive list.

385
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
A, there is absolutely no crime in the UK.

386
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,080
Nothing behind.

387
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,440
Way more crime here.

388
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
B.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,960
Way more crime.

390
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
No, you can't have weapons in the UK, you goose.

391
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,340
Nope.

392
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,540
No.

393
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
No, that's a big problem.

394
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,280
Do you think you can just walk down the street with a big can of bear mace in the yuck?

395
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,840
You can't.

396
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,340
Nope.

397
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:49,360
Now, I do want to point out that Dog the Bounty Hunter is legally barred from entering the UK

398
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,880
because of a slight, mild case of a murder conviction in 1976.

399
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Wait, really?

400
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,760
Yes.

401
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,840
So you could corner the market in the UK because Dog cannot come there and chomp your flavor.

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,360
Okay, did you just Google Dog the Bounty Hunter UK or did you just know that?

403
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,640
That's just something I know.

404
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,320
He killed somebody.

405
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,360
Your brain is a horrifying place.

406
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
This just happened, well no, it just happened in August.

407
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:28,320
They wanted him to be on Celebrity Big Brother over there and he couldn't because he has a murder conviction.

408
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,820
Cool.

409
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,560
Is it cool, Travis?

410
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,520
Cool.

411
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,320
No, it's cool in that not cool kind of way.

412
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh, I see.

413
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,560
Oh, okay.

414
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,440
I get you.

415
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,080
I get you.

416
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,360
Suddenly, my whole understanding of what Dog the Bounty Hunter stands for is just ripped apart.

417
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:54,960
Okay, I am Dog the Bounty Hunter or rather a knockoff, a wannabe Dog the Bounty Hunter.

418
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
My name is Dog with two Gs.

419
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Dog, oh, okay.

420
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,440
My name is Rough Pup and I'm here to take you down.

421
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,480
That's my catchphrase.

422
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,840
Oh no, Rough Pup's here.

423
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,600
Stop all the crime, quick.

424
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:18,640
Quick, so anyway, I show up and I have to hit a man repeatedly with a bat to stop his crime that he's doing.

425
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,560
Cops show up, how does this shake out?

426
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,160
This scenario.

427
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,480
They walk in on this scenario and they see what I've done.

428
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
What's the result?

429
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,760
I think that you probably, before you're able to bounty hunt, have to go through some sort of training course or course.

430
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,280
Okay, but in this, let's just say in this fiction, I have no fucking interest in doing that.

431
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
I think you have to also kill the cops.

432
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,320
Uh oh.

433
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,880
Yikes.

434
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah, and then everything spirals.

435
00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:09,280
I went to a private college via financial aid and so after graduating now, I have a lot of friends with rich parents who love having dinner with their children and me, oftentimes at restaurants that are expensive for my low salary.

436
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,520
100% of the time, they end up paying for the meal.

437
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,680
But if there's any doubt about whether they will, I get uncomfortable when the check comes.

438
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,560
I used to fumble with my wallet, pretend that I was going to pay my share, but that got really uncomfortable.

439
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,360
Is it okay to just ignore the bill completely?

440
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
That's from not Ann Landers in New York.

441
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,800
I used to do that.

442
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,960
I used to do that game where I get out my wallet.

443
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,560
Where do I keep, where do I keep the fucking money in here?

444
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,000
This wallet's so big.

445
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,240
I know I left some, I slid some into a side compartment.

446
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,360
No, I mean, I don't, I think that's a little insulting actually to, like, people are onto that game.

447
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
They're crafty because they have money.

448
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,320
They know how it works.

449
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,880
They had to be tricksy to get that fortune in the first place.

450
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,520
If people want to pay for dinner, like they, part of the thing with paying for dinner is you feel like,

451
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,480
you know, you feel like a superior, like a champ.

452
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
You feel like you're taking care of people.

453
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,280
Good rule of thumb, like very rarely will someone be like,

454
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,840
hey, I want you to, I want to take you to dinner.

455
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,440
And then when you get there, like you're going to pay for your own stuff, right?

456
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,640
Like, I don't know that that's ever happened to me.

457
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,800
I used to feel the same way and be like, oh, suddenly I feel like, should I ask?

458
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,520
Should I bring it up?

459
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,400
Will they tell me?

460
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,720
Just be cool.

461
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,080
And if they ask you out to dinner, then they're probably paying for it.

462
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,560
But it's not, you can't give them the definite.

463
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,920
I think, I think if you don't, if paying for it is not an option,

464
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,240
you got to go with the full bluff and you got to take the check and you got to say,

465
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
guys, don't, don't worry about it.

466
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,840
I'll get this one.

467
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,960
And then you get your little reading glasses out.

468
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,760
Oh my God.

469
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,320
Yes, yes.

470
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,040
Tip calculator.

471
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,840
If you have a tip calculator in your wallet, that would be the only way.

472
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,160
I think 30% on this one.

473
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,480
What do you guys think?

474
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,920
If you don't consider the bill, then you're not doing the bluff correctly.

475
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,800
If you don't put on a little green visor and, and really, really crunch some numbs,

476
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
then you, they're not going to buy it.

477
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:17,040
Of course, that bluff, that barrel will go over the waterfall, maybe once.

478
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,880
And then you're in a whole heap of trouble.

479
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,960
It is good though.

480
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,560
I wish they paid the bill first.

481
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,840
I wish that was the first thing you did because it makes it, or decided on that at least.

482
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Cause it makes, it would make ordering a lot easier.

483
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,480
Justin, I...

484
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Cause that's always a high pressure situation.

485
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,120
Cause if you know somebody else is paying, you know.

486
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,000
I fucking love this idea more than any other idea we've ever generated.

487
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,680
I love the idea of a restaurant you show up to and you say, bring me $50 of food.

488
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,720
And then they...

489
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,240
You know what?

490
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,880
No shit.

491
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
There's the restaurant that I just went to yesterday.

492
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,720
There's an option on the menu that basically you pay $25 and they just bring you some courses.

493
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,760
I love it.

494
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360
Like it's chef's choice.

495
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
And it's just like, you pay 25 bucks and the chef...

496
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
That's good also for when you're drunk.

497
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,040
Yeah.

498
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,680
I don't know.

499
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm just going to chew for a while.

500
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,840
Hopefully by the end of it, I will be full.

501
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,200
I also think that, man, maybe you should offer to pay, you know?

502
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,640
How often are these people taking you out?

503
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,600
No, I don't think, I don't think you should offer to pay.

504
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
I think you should be gracious.

505
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,320
Oh, definitely.

506
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,440
I think that's a much more, I mean, like that's the better part of it.

507
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,320
It's goofy and a little insulting because, okay.

508
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,200
If you're a wealthy parent and you're taking your kid and their friends out for dinner,

509
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,800
part of the reason you're doing that is because it'll make you feel good.

510
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,280
So if you are at dinner and one of your kid's torpy friends, it's like,

511
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,200
wow, let me see what my portion is of that, Mrs. Jonas.

512
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,440
Then you're going to think, well, what do you think of me?

513
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,840
Do you think I need help buying your fucking French dip sandwich for $7.99?

514
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,640
Because I don't.

515
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,360
See, this is why your waiter always be on point

516
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,280
and always ask how to do the checks.

517
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,880
A savvy waiter, first thing, will say, and have you never seen that before?

518
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,960
I have, but not at a high class restaurant.

519
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
It depends on the establishment.

520
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
If you have more than four people.

521
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
Dodge happens right at the beginning, it's nice.

522
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,240
Yeah, except, oh, I don't eat at TGI Fridays.

523
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,040
You know what I mean?

524
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,120
Like I'm not a booby Tuesdays.

525
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,720
If it has the name of a day of a weekend.

526
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,120
You have just listed the two restaurants I've eaten at in the last two weeks.

527
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,040
Excellent, excellent.

528
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,400
In the correct order as well.

529
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,960
That must be easy if you live in Austin.

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,560
Like every restaurant serves delicious Tex-Mex food

531
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,440
and is in a giant dinosaur or something equally kitchen.

532
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,160
All the meals are served.

533
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,400
Here in Cincinnati, it's all TGI Fridays.

534
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,480
All the meals are served out of mason jars.

535
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Yeah, welcome to slurpers.

536
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,720
The whole restaurant's lit with different novelty Christmas lights.

537
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,520
That's actually, that one's actually not far off.

538
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,720
Um, listen, I love this restaurant.

539
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Listen, I don't think it's a restaurant.

540
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,480
I think that we've wandered into someone's attic.

541
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,600
I'm trying to eat.

542
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,240
I'm trying to eat the, uh, it's a boy bubblegum cigars that they flipped.

543
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,840
This saved as a keepsake.

544
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,080
Don't also, we might be raccoons.

545
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,680
Welcome to the best comedy advice cast

546
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,000
that is hosted and performed exclusively by raccoons.

547
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,920
For raccoons, by raccoons.

548
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,480
People are so surprised when we go to live shows.

549
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,440
They can't see us skinning around and rummaging through purses.

550
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,840
People are always so surprised that it turns out we're raccoons this whole time.

551
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
Every time I take raccoons out for dinner,

552
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,160
there's always that awkward moment where they realize they're raccoons.

553
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,660
Yeah.

554
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,840
And that they don't have wallets.

555
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,340
Yeah.

556
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,000
It's adorable, but I mean, I feel bad for them.

557
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,560
So you really don't, you're ordering garbage again.

558
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,040
Okay, again.

559
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,920
You're ordering, every time I take you out.

560
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
We could have just gone to Slurper's.

561
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,440
You either get the buffalo chicken sandwich or garbage.

562
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
It's the only two things I've ever heard you order.

563
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:25,280
Is it bad form to offer these parents maybe a tug?

564
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,800
As you're leaving, like, hey, Greg, do appreciate the vittles.

565
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
I will hit you on the tug.

566
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,680
You name the time and place.

567
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,440
I will get that tug right out the door, right to you.

568
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,720
Please, not Sunday morning.

569
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,160
That's when I go to church.

570
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,120
Yeah, dude, unless I am at church, I am tug ready.

571
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,720
You just say the word.

572
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,160
I will handle the gratuity, if you know what I mean.

573
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,680
You know what I mean, and I think you do.

574
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,440
I think it's a little, I think it could be perceived as slightly,

575
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,040
not, I mean, I don't necessarily think it's polite to offer to split the tip.

576
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,080
I think it's polite.

577
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,760
Well, no, God, not during a tug.

578
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,200
That would be Jesus.

579
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,840
That would be horrific.

580
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,800
Who would want that?

581
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
You're into some weird stuff, Danny's dad.

582
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,200
But man, that French tip was good.

583
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,800
So I guess, hey, unless you want us to split the tip,

584
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:43,920
then we're going to need to go to the Money Zone.

585
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
So welcome to the Money Zone.

586
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,560
As you know, we've been sponsored by Extreme Restraints for the last couple of weeks.

587
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,440
And we also-

588
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
By couple of weeks, you mean 14, right?

589
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,800
For the last 28 weeks, we've been sponsored by Extreme Restraints.

590
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,760
We received an email from Allie, who works in the warehouse at ExtremeRestraints.com.

591
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,400
And she is an avid My Brother, My Brother, Me listener.

592
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,920
And she just wanted to let us know that hearing our spots for the company

593
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,080
that she works for for the last two months has filled her with nothing but joy and pleasure.

594
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,480
And her heart is warmed by this partnership.

595
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,960
And thanks for being hilarious and fun with your ads

596
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
and overall supporting this great website.

597
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,240
I'm proud to be synonymous with My Brother, My Brother, Me.

598
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,200
Try it again.

599
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,840
Synonymous.

600
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,040
There we go.

601
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,760
Thank you.

602
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
Yours and Allie's.

603
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,800
So Allie, thank you so much.

604
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,560
And now we're going to talk about bonus and stuff.

605
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,680
You know, that email warms my heart.

606
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,840
But if I want my scrotum warmed, I go with the Mini Remote Control 10 Function Egg.

607
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,120
I don't-

608
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,800
That's a remote sex toy.

609
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,920
I've been fucking up.

610
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,960
So, because I just put like a towel on there and then I like shoot.

611
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,080
That's that old shit.

612
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,840
I put a towel right on it and then I use the hairdryer right on there.

613
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,720
Yeah, watch out for that because you'll dry and crack.

614
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,520
Yeah.

615
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,120
Jesus.

616
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,360
What?

617
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,400
You know-

618
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,800
I want to-

619
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,560
Listen.

620
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,840
Listen.

621
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
It's my birthday.

622
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
I'm trying to treat my balls right.

623
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,200
Uh-huh.

624
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,960
What else is there for me on this one- on this website?

625
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, how would you- how would you like-

626
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,280
There are some really good jewelry actually that I'm just now seeing.

627
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,760
Oh, that's nice.

628
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
I've never dipped into the jewelry before.

629
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,240
There's one that looks like a snake is coming out of your wiener.

630
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,740
Ooh.

631
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,200
When you say- now when you say jewelry that makes it look like a snake is coming out of

632
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
my wiener, are we talking about like a brooch?

633
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,040
Are we talking about like a pendant?

634
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,800
Let me tell you what we're talking about.

635
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Is this like one of those brooches that has like an old lady on it and it's like ivory?

636
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
It looks like- you know what I mean?

637
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,120
Like ceramic-

638
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,680
No, it looks like some sort of weird Return to Oz metal snake robot is crawling out of

639
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,880
your penis hole.

640
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,960
So not like a lady reading a book.

641
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,760
Justin has just forwarded me the picture and it is in fact a picture of a dick as well.

642
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
I guess I should have assumed that.

643
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,000
Hey, hold on let me see this pic.

644
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I just sent my brother a picture of a dick.

645
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Must be Sunday.

646
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,120
I guess I should have assumed it was just a picture of a dick.

647
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,320
Rachel, you gotta see this.

648
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,720
So extremetraits.com is your super store for adult novelties.

649
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,480
If you use the coupon code MIDDLIST as you're checking out, you're going to get 20% off

650
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,040
of your order.

651
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,600
It's a ring that looks like a dick.

652
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,960
Like a snake's coming out of a dick.

653
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,840
Do you think they custom fit it?

654
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,440
Like a snake, but it's coming out of the dick hole and it's like wrapping around.

655
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,600
Anyway, go to extremetraits.com, spelled just like it sounds, and use the coupon code MIDDLIST

656
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,880
to get 20% off.

657
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,560
And thank you so much, Extremetraits, for sticking with us for all these weeks.

658
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:59,120
It is one of the few sponsor program relationships I know of where the fans actually look forward

659
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,440
to the ads and demand that they continue.

660
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,600
We've heard from people specifically saying, I hope you never stop being sponsored by Extremetraits.

661
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,200
They are rooting for advertising.

662
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,160
So thank you to them and thank you to you guys for being so cool.

663
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,360
I think, I can't speak for them, but I think this shit's for life, you know what I mean?

664
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,280
Yeah, I think we've got something real here.

665
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,320
I think we're BFFs.

666
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,520
I look forward to these ads too.

667
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,440
I did not know you could come as snake.

668
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:23,920
Didn't know?

669
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:33,280
I remember when this relationship first blossomed, we got an email from Teresa Thorn, basically

670
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,480
to see like, I didn't know if you guys would be okay with this or if this would be the

671
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,160
sort of thing you would be comfortable doing, and it's like, have we not met?

672
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,280
This is the greatest day of our life, Teresa.

673
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,520
This is the best thing that's ever happened to us.

674
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,400
I ran through the hallways of work just screaming, you'll never believe, you'll never believe.

675
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,000
So thank you.

676
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,320
Thank you to them and thank you to us.

677
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,640
Thank you.

678
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,440
Thank you, everyone.

679
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,640
You want a yahoo?

680
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,080
No, I do.

681
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,600
Before we continue on, I don't know if you guys know, but there was a tragedy this week.

682
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
I'll fucking quit the show.

683
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,760
I know what this is.

684
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,240
The American hero has passed away at the age of 88.

685
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,160
Leonard B. Stern, he was executive producer for Get Smart, he worked on Sergeant Abilco,

686
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,240
and he was also the creator of Mad Libs.

687
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm not going to fall into your fucking trap.

688
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:27,120
And I was asked by many, many of the listeners to give a free eulogy for Mr. Stern, and I

689
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,400
would like to read what I've written now.

690
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,620
Okay.

691
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,800
Today the world has lost a great paladin, and I'm here to tell you a story.

692
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,200
The world has lost a great palindrome.

693
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,880
Leonard Stern, renowned sassafras, frothy poop train, and dwarf paladin died at the

694
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,840
age of swoop.

695
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,560
He was born in a small town of Throbbing, Wisconsin, and attended Yakety Saxe University.

696
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,640
After leaving school, he got his start as an applesauce splurger, but quickly advanced

697
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,040
to pommel horse in a prominent haberdashery.

698
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,160
His co-workers described him as a sketchy and smarmy, and that if you needed a boondoggle,

699
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,360
he was your flubber.

700
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,520
He became a much more caramel gentleman, preferring the company of Kibbe Gibbler.

701
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,760
The funeral service will be held at Bumblebutt Mortuary, and guests are asked to bring a

702
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,320
fart for the moist widow and her three stanky children.

703
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,840
Listen, Mrs. Stern, I'm so sorry.

704
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,920
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.

705
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,200
I brought you a fart.

706
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
Okay, now here's the question.

707
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,240
If you're bringing a widow a fart, do you bring a fart in a jar, or do you wait until

708
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,600
the exact appropriate moment, introduce yourself to the widow, and then fart?

709
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,560
You actually bring it in a casserole dish covered in foil?

710
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
I brought you this fart.

711
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,000
Listen, I don't want to be that guy.

712
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,600
Just pop it in the oven for 30 minutes.

713
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,400
I am going to need this back later, so please return to me.

714
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
This is my good fart pan.

715
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,240
Once you're done with the fart, please bring the fart pan back.

716
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,960
I'm glad this dude's dead.

717
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,740
Sorry.

718
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,200
Like, sorry.

719
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,320
I know he's a comedy legend probably, but I'm glad he's gone.

720
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,720
If only it could have happened before he invented Mad Libs, you know?

721
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,440
That's messed up.

722
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm just saying.

723
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,880
I wouldn't mind loopering him.

724
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,280
He was actually on, uh, he was one of the producers on Supermarket Sweep.

725
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,780
Oh.

726
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,720
I mean that, that, is there a window there where I could, I could looper him, um, between

727
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,160
the invention of Supermarket Sweep and the invention of the Mad Lib?

728
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,000
Because I don't want to, I don't want to sacrifice one for the other, you know what I mean?

729
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,120
You're right.

730
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,160
Yeah, absolutely.

731
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,520
Um, no.

732
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,120
No.

733
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,620
Fuck.

734
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,160
I got a Yahoo for us.

735
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,600
It's, uh, it's by, uh, thank you for sending it in, Colin Dinsmore.

736
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jake who asks, does my PE teacher like me?

737
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,480
We were playing a game of rugby and he told me to do a lap of the field.

738
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,780
Yeah.

739
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,880
Okay.

740
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,380
That's it.

741
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,800
That's how bad is this guy at interpreting signals?

742
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,520
That's the given circumstances that we, we have to work with?

743
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,560
That's about it, but I don't, like, that's kind of just like the PE way.

744
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,520
That's like what they do.

745
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,840
It's hard to know if you, listen, some of us have always been curious of whether or not

746
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,760
our PE teacher is like this, and I don't mean in a romantic way.

747
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
We all know the answer to that question.

748
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,080
Some of us are just seeking the approval of a PE teach.

749
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,840
I remember when I was watching Mr. Woodcock and thinking, I wonder if my PE teacher-

750
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:47,680
That fucking movie!

751
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,680
I just laughed at it.

752
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Sean Williams, God.

753
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Are you having a fucking laugh about the existence of Mr. Woodcock as a film?

754
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,840
Oh man.

755
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,440
Is that what tickled you?

756
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,960
Was it a specific-

757
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,480
It was just that it existed and Sean Williams, God, was in it, and you just can't believe

758
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,840
that those two things are true.

759
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,360
Do you guys have any good PE teachers?

760
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,020
Um.

761
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
No, we're going to find the humor in this bit if it kills me.

762
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,600
You are apparently already founded.

763
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,680
Apparently it's no, you need to look no further than your DVD rack to see a copy of Mr. Woodcock.

764
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,760
You're three copies, one for every day, one for special occasions, and one for archive.

765
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,600
I couldn't own that fucking movie because every time I saw it, I looked over in the rack.

766
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,160
I can't believe either of you unsportsmanly fucks don't have a single funny gym teacher story.

767
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,920
The only gym teacher story I have is my gym teacher in elementary school telling my parents

768
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,880
that I probably had ADD, and I did in fact, so thanks for that.

769
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,120
It sounds like he saved you a lot of money.

770
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,040
Yeah, thank you for acknowledging my mental deficiencies early on.

771
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,920
I appreciate that.

772
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,420
Um.

773
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,520
I didn't have any funny PE teachers.

774
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,880
I'm probably forgetting one.

775
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,680
There's probably one listed now that says, hey, I was funny.

776
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,280
I worked my ass off.

777
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,400
I worked my ass off for you guys.

778
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,960
Do you remember when we were doing jump rope for heart and I made all those wise

779
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
crocs to keep you guys motivated?

780
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Remember I called it jump rope for fart?

781
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Do you remember?

782
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,160
Do you remember?

783
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,680
Can we not?

784
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,560
You guys want a different yahoo?

785
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

786
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,880
Okay, this one's-

787
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
An additional one, right?

788
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
You're not going to edit out where you laughed at Mr. Woodcock for 20 minutes, right?

789
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,600
Oh god.

790
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,600
The name's good too.

791
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,280
Oh, that's what I'm laughing at.

792
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,920
It's got cock in it and also wood.

793
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,760
It's like a double boner joke.

794
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,320
If that movie was about ventriloquists, it would be the best movie ever.

795
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,280
So this one was sent in by Justin Brown.

796
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,920
Thank you, Justin.

797
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:02,400
It's by yahoo answers user Intelligent John who asks, have you ever tried to punch a bird?

798
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,680
That's all the things that there is.

799
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,480
Like an anchor or like predominance of like a bird you own or bird flying by?

800
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Well, let's run through each of those.

801
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,960
A, I don't think you can hunt a bird with punches.

802
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,000
They're live creatures.

803
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,520
You've got to tap the bird on the shoulder when it turns around and you punch it.

804
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,720
Would a bird stand there and take it?

805
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,480
You couldn't pull that on a cat.

806
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,360
If you try to punch a cat, he's going to go spectral.

807
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,640
He's going to disappear.

808
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,360
If you try to punch a bird, I'm not sure if they have that sort of cat ESP that would

809
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,400
allow them to avoid it.

810
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,000
So you're saying like a cockatiel sitting on its little perch in your room and you just

811
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,120
like walk in, you've had a bad day and you're like, I'm going to fucking punch that bird

812
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,080
and you swing your fist.

813
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,320
The birds all you've thought about all day.

814
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,840
It's the only way you got through me and your little brother trained that bird to say some

815
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
really offensive shit.

816
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,400
You got that 3pm feeling.

817
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,520
I can't wait to get fucking home and punch my fucking bird.

818
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,240
Just really let loose and punch the shit out of that bird.

819
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,000
And you're saying that perhaps the bird would just turn and look at you and just take it

820
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,520
full on in the face and maybe do that thing where it dramatically like its head snaps

821
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,120
to the side and then it looks back and like wipes off the blood off its beat.

822
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,160
Oh, I love this.

823
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,560
And then it comes at you just crazy balls.

824
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,200
And all of a sudden it's just a hardcore throw down in your room, that throw down showdown

825
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,720
between you and your cockatiel and the stuff's just getting rowdy.

826
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,760
Can we not say cockatiel?

827
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,600
Well, first of all, we can't say cockatiel because I'm going to start laughing again.

828
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,320
Your wood cockatiel, your Mr. Wood cockatiel.

829
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,520
Also, a cockatiel would just disintegrate if you punch it.

830
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Let's talk about a heartier bird.

831
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
OK, so like a blue Amazon parrot?

832
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,280
Maybe you've got an ostrich.

833
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,760
That's a scoring partner right there.

834
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,260
Yeah.

835
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,720
Ostriches are mostly dinosaurs.

836
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,640
You don't start shit with an ostrich.

837
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,040
Can I go to the pet store and say, I want a bird.

838
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,760
Hold up.

839
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,120
I want one that can take a punch.

840
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,800
Not one that will-

841
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,080
I know what you're thinking.

842
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,680
I don't want this bird to buckle over like a little bitch when I punch it.

843
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,360
But how come as many times as I've seen chickens killed on TV,

844
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,400
I've never seen a ostrich decapitated with a machete?

845
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,560
Can you imagine how sweet that would be?

846
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,640
I feel like that's a Mythbusters waiting to happen.

847
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,400
Yeah, here's a myth.

848
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,840
That would be awesome.

849
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,280
Why would that be awesome?

850
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,520
Think about how long its neck is.

851
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,640
There is a lot of neck there.

852
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,200
No, I know.

853
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,640
Where would you cut?

854
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,320
You have so many options.

855
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:38,080
Like, you could do like a backflip with a sword and chop it anywhere,

856
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,680
and that head's gonna come right off.

857
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,160
You're saying-

858
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,080
It would look awesome.

859
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,480
It's hard to-

860
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,800
As long as we're doing that, then can we do the cartoon thing

861
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,480
where they tie two flamingos together?

862
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,760
I want to try that.

863
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,440
What cartoon thing are you-

864
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
They do that with flamingos all the time.

865
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,320
I think it's in Alice in Wonderland.

866
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,760
What avian cartoon snuff films are you watching?

867
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,440
And, by the way, we haven't properly addressed the fact that Justin wants to cut an ostrich's

868
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,960
goddamn head off.

869
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,120
I was trying to steer the conversation away from that.

870
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,440
Away from the fact that our brother's a serial killer.

871
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,440
It would just be fun.

872
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,200
I don't want to do it.

873
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,960
I'm saying I want to see it on YouTube.

874
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,280
They are beautiful regal birds.

875
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,240
They're basically-

876
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
They're assholes.

877
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
They're super swans is what they are.

878
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,120
They're mega swans.

879
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:32,400
I think if you have something with that long of a neck, it is just begging to be decapitated.

880
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,080
Do you think that somewhere like God or the creator of whatever is sitting around going,

881
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,800
like, I can't believe nobody's decapitated those birds yet.

882
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,760
I gave it to them.

883
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,400
That was a gimmick.

884
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,000
Did you just get theological on us?

885
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,200
Whatever Supreme Being created ostriches, obviously made them for-

886
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,520
I didn't want to alienate the Venn diagram of people that both don't believe in God,

887
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,360
but also want to see ostriches killed.

888
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:55,760
Yeah, sure, sure.

889
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,280
I didn't want to alienate them.

890
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,160
You know that flamingos are not always pink.

891
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,360
They're pink because their color is determined by their diet.

892
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,800
So you think it's a lifestyle choice?

893
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,320
Yeah, because they-

894
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,280
Do you guys know about that?

895
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,840
They aided the shrimp and they turned it pink.

896
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,800
I don't-

897
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,120
Shrimp and pussy.

898
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,240
Man, did you guys know that about flamingos?

899
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,120
They're freaks.

900
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, man.

901
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,480
They will just-

902
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,600
Flamingos will-

903
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,000
I want to see a flamingo and an ostrich make love.

904
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,160
I know that's coming out of left field, you guys, but God, it would be beautiful.

905
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,960
The joke's on you.

906
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,240
Birds can't love.

907
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,440
They're not capable of it.

908
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I'd like to just see them sex each other.

909
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,600
What is with people who have birds as pets?

910
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,160
Seriously.

911
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,280
Doesn't make sense.

912
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,640
I want a pet that I can't touch and is also as loud as and as constant as a fire alarm.

913
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,480
And at any given moment might just flip out and try to pet my face.

914
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,760
I want something in my house that I can't interact with that will just periodically shit everywhere.

915
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,960
Yeah, and make a terrible noise and I hate it.

916
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,320
I hate this thing.

917
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,080
And that literally, if someone leaves the window open, it's gone forever.

918
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,480
Yeah.

919
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,680
Yeah, and it'll never come back.

920
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:19,120
Yeah, a bird is never going to look at you with anything more than those sad, soulless,

921
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,240
dead eyes that-

922
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,360
Well, what passes for eyes, they're a little more than polished opals.

923
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,680
They just stare right through you and they're never going to love you.

924
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,920
They're just birds with no capability.

925
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,840
I have to point out, unlike cats and dogs, they actually have a natural habitat that

926
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,320
they belong in and it's not your bedroom.

927
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,840
It's not like you can return, like, your beagle to the wild.

928
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,320
If I left my cat-

929
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,640
For like fucking birds mowing in the Amazon, you jerk.

930
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,560
If I took my cat and dropped it outside, it would be like, oh, well, okay, what now?

931
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,600
Where's the litter in this place?

932
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,720
But if I had a parakeet and I took it outside, it'd be like, bye, fucker.

933
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:57,760
Got it.

934
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,040
Oh, thank God.

935
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,840
Oh, thank God.

936
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,560
I'm going to go find a tree because that's kind of my jam, is a tree.

937
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,520
You can take your parrot into public provided you clip its wings so that it doesn't fly.

938
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,040
Because you're a real asshole.

939
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,800
That's a good basis for a relationship.

940
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,920
Yeah, I'm afraid of my dog running away, so I chopped off one of his feet.

941
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,280
Yeah, my daughter tried to go to college, so I cut her legs off.

942
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:20,720
Yeah.

943
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,720
I misread her really hard.

944
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,600
I misread my daughter because I didn't want her to leave.

945
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,520
Now her and my bird just cry all the time.

946
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,400
I love you, Becky.

947
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,280
I love you, Becky.

948
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,800
Sorry about your shin bones.

949
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,840
Let's talk about falcons.

950
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,720
That'd be cool though.

951
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:33,920
Okay.

952
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,600
Now I have always wanted to do that.

953
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:35,840
Sure.

954
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,720
If you trained a falcon, but even then it's like weaponized.

955
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,520
It's not a pet.

956
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
I do love the idea of just a living weapon.

957
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,360
Yeah.

958
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,120
Because that's also what I consider myself.

959
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,600
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,360
I mean, on the plus side, you're going to be able to become a gunslinger at an

961
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,880
unprecedentedly young age.

962
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,200
That's good.

963
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:04,800
The bad side is that somewhere there is a flying knife that you have trained that

964
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,160
would love nothing more.

965
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,200
And at your death, we'll just go on a killing spree.

966
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,320
Just that you're the only thing keeping that flying knife in check.

967
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,440
God, that would be a good name for a falcon though if I had it.

968
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,400
Come flying knife.

969
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,960
Guessing it's my side.

970
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,560
Not too fast though, please.

971
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,240
What would you call a falcon if you?

972
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,360
Condor man.

973
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,240
Condor man.

974
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,560
Okay.

975
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
That's good because he's neither condor nor man.

976
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:28,960
Exactly.

977
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,320
It's really going to fuck with his enemies.

978
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,920
I would name it Gongham style because I think people would, it would be like carbon dating

979
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,000
it because people would know it too.

980
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,920
Like within a day when I bought this bird.

981
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,520
This is my falcon pogs.

982
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,400
Yeah.

983
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,280
This is my falcon Judge Lance Edo.

984
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,480
Can I call my falcon Billy Ocean?

985
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,320
Of course you can.

986
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,120
Get out of my dreams and get out of my hair.

987
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,240
You're killing me.

988
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,160
Please stop watching me while I sleep.

989
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,320
I just decided that if I saw somebody on the streets of Austin with a bird on their hand,

990
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,280
I would just think they were a hipster probably.

991
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,040
That is, that is not a joke.

992
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,160
It is not outside the realm of, of possibility.

993
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,920
There's a guy who walks around Huntington with a parrot on his shoulder.

994
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,160
Yeah.

995
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,920
I also want to point out when it comes to falcons, you literally have to like blindfold

996
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,240
them to keep them from killing people.

997
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:26,800
Yeah.

998
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,760
Like they have specially designed hat and blinders so that the birds do not just freak

999
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,000
out and murder everything they see.

1000
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:41,280
I, I, there's this guy who used to always hang out at a restaurant that used to be in

1001
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,800
town called Chili Willy's that had a parrot and he would bring his parrot into the restaurant,

1002
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,880
which I think is foul by the way.

1003
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,840
That's a bird.

1004
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,280
You don't know what it does.

1005
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,320
He would bring his bird in the restaurant and then, and I would see him there all the

1006
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,560
time.

1007
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,160
I would think, huh, I guess Chili Willy, you know, I guess he must be friends with the

1008
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:58,880
owner or whatever.

1009
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,880
And now a new restaurant has opened up in that same locale called Backyard Pizza.

1010
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,280
And I've seen that motherfucker with his parrot again.

1011
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,440
I don't know if he's a feature of the building or if I think the one place he could take

1012
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,680
his parrot with his parrot won't lose his goddamn mind.

1013
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,000
Do you think he's providing a service?

1014
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,320
He's providing a service to Huntington restaurants.

1015
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,400
Like I will make your shit look more interesting by standing in front of it.

1016
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,920
People want to know my story.

1017
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,240
They'll get hungry cause I'll talk to them for two hours about my fucking parrot.

1018
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,480
And then I'll let the parrot do a little bit of the talking.

1019
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,200
And don't even worry about spiders anymore.

1020
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,760
He'll take care of all the colorful beetles.

1021
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,280
You can't pay me in pizza.

1022
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,720
Hey, do parrots eat pizza?

1023
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,360
Ah, fuck it.

1024
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,840
I'll eat his.

1025
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,120
I'll eat his pizza.

1026
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,200
What's, what's that flying knife?

1027
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,480
You want to eat some food?

1028
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,840
Well, you have pizza.

1029
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,160
You should have eaten your pizza there that I had to eat for you.

1030
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,640
Oh, what's that?

1031
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,960
You need me to launch the pizza upwards into the sky at a hundred miles an hour before

1032
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,560
you'll be interested in it at all.

1033
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:56,880
Okay.

1034
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,240
Fuck the fucking next stop flash forward.

1035
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,760
America's got talent.

1036
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,920
You got a million dollar check.

1037
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,600
Your show's opening in Vegas.

1038
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,440
This is my pet flying knife.

1039
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,600
The amazing pizza catching parrot.

1040
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,840
I love dead mouse pizza please.

1041
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,280
He died after three weeks.

1042
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,560
I had to train a new one.

1043
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,600
I hate this job.

1044
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,440
The world's fattest falcon.

1045
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,760
I hate this job almost as much as birds apparently hate pizza.

1046
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,520
This bird has acne.

1047
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,720
Get up there, flying knife.

1048
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,640
My flying knife, you have acne and your breath smells like garlic.

1049
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,520
I hate you now.

1050
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,040
I always hated you.

1051
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,560
Why can't you look at me with love?

1052
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,520
Put your hat back on.

1053
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,720
You're creeping me out.

1054
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,640
How come you never bring me a Bud Light like the cool birds in the commercials do?

1055
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,120
This is my parrot and this is our Las Vegas style show.

1056
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,240
It's now been moved to the Catskills and I trained my parrot to get me a beer.

1057
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,320
Does anybody else want a beer?

1058
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,440
Hold on a second.

1059
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,960
Wear this gauntlet because he will attack.

1060
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,280
Can you imagine if you owned a parrot and then like you brought home a falcon?

1061
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,040
What the parrot must think in that moment?

1062
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,440
What would a parrot think?

1063
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,960
Not that birds could think.

1064
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,600
Oh fuck.

1065
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,280
What's he calling it?

1066
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,240
Flying knife?

1067
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,280
That's such a cool name.

1068
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,240
He called me Steve.

1069
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:16,960
What the fuck?

1070
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,160
Why did he name me Steve?

1071
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,160
Name your parrot Raven.

1072
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,720
He won't see that coming.

1073
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,720
Hey, my friend and I saw a movie on the last day I was playing.

1074
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,880
As it turned out, we were the only two there.

1075
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,160
We usually like to stick around through the credits.

1076
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,520
On the off chance there's a bonus scene at the end, but halfway through the credits,

1077
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,800
I saw an usher glaring at us impatiently from the doorway,

1078
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,320
waiting for us to leave.

1079
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,320
I feel as paying moviegoers, we have the right to stick around until the lights come up,

1080
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,840
even if we're the only ones there.

1081
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,360
Am I in the wrong on this?

1082
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,520
And that's from ushered out in Utah.

1083
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,480
Well, I have great news for you ushered out in Utah.

1084
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,240
And this still is not a paid endorsement, but if you get the iPhone app Run P,

1085
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,200
it will not only tell you the best time to take a bathroom break,

1086
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,440
it will tell you if there is something after the credits,

1087
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,880
whether or not you need to stay.

1088
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,080
But do you think that's going to stave off the condescending stare of the movie theater usher?

1089
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,240
Who cares about that guy?

1090
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,320
I was that dude.

1091
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,640
Yeah.

1092
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,080
Yeah, but people should be able to sit there and enjoy their film without you rushing them out.

1093
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,600
I'm saying he's being a jerk.

1094
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,760
Well, I think the trait, here's the thing.

1095
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,640
The fact of the matter is, if you're the only two people in the theater,

1096
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,640
it's not like brothers got a lot of cleaning to do.

1097
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,680
Wow, that's a good point, Travis.

1098
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,160
How long is it going to take them to clean up after two people?

1099
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:36,640
Right?

1100
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,160
So unless you were just like changing seats every five minutes

1101
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,640
and then dumping your junior mints on the ground.

1102
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,680
I spilled them again.

1103
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,520
Hey, usher.

1104
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,160
Mom.

1105
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,880
Hey, usher.

1106
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,520
Usher or mom or usher Raymond.

1107
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,080
Anybody.

1108
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,280
I spilled them again.

1109
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,880
Spilled them.

1110
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,840
Hey, Will Ferrell.

1111
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,200
Hey, Will Ferrell in the movie.

1112
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,240
I spilled them.

1113
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,360
Please come out of the movie.

1114
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,800
I want Goobers this time.

1115
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,920
Turn my mints into Goobers.

1116
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,680
I want to return exchange these mints for Goobers.

1117
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,840
I only ate five.

1118
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,560
It's not fair.

1119
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,960
It turns out Rosebud is his sled, everybody.

1120
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,960
By the way, this happened in 1940.

1121
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,200
Wow.

1122
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,480
This is fun.

1123
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,880
Did you know that was a time travel scene?

1124
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,440
What?

1125
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,360
You are not doing this guy any disservice because when you're an usher,

1126
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,480
here's the life of an usher.

1127
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,080
Here's how a shift breaks down.

1128
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,320
You get to stand around and watch the end of a movie

1129
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,680
and wait for the theater to clear out.

1130
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,040
That's one of the things you do.

1131
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,320
Sometimes you go and you have to fill up a bucket with mop water.

1132
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,280
That's cool.

1133
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,920
Sometimes you have to clean up puke and jizz and skull leavings.

1134
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,600
And be careful not to stab yourself on your syringes.

1135
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,320
That's the worst part of the job.

1136
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,000
And as long as they're not doing that,

1137
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,920
then they are probably just happy to be standing still.

1138
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,080
I used to work at a theater.

1139
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,880
You know what they used to do for your lunch and dinner break?

1140
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,280
They used to say on our lunch and dinner breaks,

1141
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,160
they would say you can go and chill out for, you know,

1142
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,800
30 minutes or however long in one of the theaters.

1143
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,240
And so you would just go watch fucking 30 minutes of a movie

1144
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,560
and it was absolute torture.

1145
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,040
It's so sad. What was that Ryan Reynolds haunted house one?

1146
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,400
The remake? Amityville Horror.

1147
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,520
Spooky Mansion.

1148
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,280
I watched 30 minutes of Spooky Mansion, like the same 30 minutes.

1149
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,760
Oh yeah.

1150
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,560
For like a week.

1151
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,400
I saw-

1152
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,200
And as far as I know, I think they all died.

1153
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,840
I saw the end of The Grudge 2 probably 22 different times.

1154
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,200
Like the last four minutes.

1155
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,320
And it was some woman just getting wrecked by a Japanese ghost.

1156
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,160
I saw that shit so, so many times because I had to.

1157
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,680
You know what? I take it back.

1158
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,840
Do whatever this usher wants you to.

1159
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,360
Their life is nothing but fucking pain.

1160
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,240
Because here's the thing.

1161
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,680
Here's the thing that's just occurred to me.

1162
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,320
The real horseshit is not you staying after the movie.

1163
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,960
The real horseshit is this is the last day this movie's in there.

1164
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,440
Probably no one's coming to see this movie in two weeks.

1165
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,840
And dude was thinking like, cool, movie starts.

1166
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,560
I don't have to worry about it.

1167
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,160
We probably wouldn't even run the whole thing.

1168
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,600
And then you and your friends show up to watch it on the last day

1169
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,720
at like an 11 a.m. showing and just ruin this dude's hour and a half break.

1170
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,320
Now here's a suggestion.

1171
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,200
What about this?

1172
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,000
Why don't we engage him as a person and say,

1173
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,360
hey, do you know if there's anything after the credits?

1174
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,160
Because they will know.

1175
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,080
They've cleaned up after this.

1176
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,080
Just be like, I felt that the ending left me hollow and I don't know how to feel.

1177
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,720
Let me go devil's advocate.

1178
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,080
And by devil, I mean the usher.

1179
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,160
Let me be usher's advocate.

1180
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,760
Let me be usher's advocate here.

1181
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,960
He doesn't want to hang out with two weirdos who just saw a movie by themselves

1182
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,400
because let me tell you, I'm putting myself in his shoes.

1183
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,000
You guys were probably talking in his mind's eye.

1184
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,200
That's what was going on.

1185
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,360
You were tugging into his mind's eye.

1186
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,960
If he gets if he looks like full grump,

1187
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,720
it's probably because he thinks there's going to be tug leavings in his future.

1188
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,240
I think they're just called tugging.

1189
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,080
If he's got tuggies, he's got tuggies waiting for him.

1190
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,880
And do you think he wants to see the last eight minutes of Expendables 2

1191
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,080
and then clean up tuggies?

1192
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,960
Of course not.

1193
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,400
Of course not.

1194
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,040
He's going to need all this mental energy to keep a gum barrel out of his mouth tonight.

1195
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,160
You really think he wants to chat with you about whether or not

1196
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,880
Ryan Reynolds should have ended up with Sandra Bullock at the end?

1197
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,520
Probably not.

1198
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,880
He's sad about your tuggies.

1199
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,480
Leave the movie 10 minutes early.

1200
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:47,920
If you feel like the movie is coming to a close, you should stay on opposite sides of the theater

1201
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,160
so that when he comes in, he knows that there was no thank you.

1202
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,640
Or just as soon as he walks in, just say, no tuggies, bro.

1203
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,360
Don't worry.

1204
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,680
Just keep your hands in the air like you're at a middle school dance.

1205
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,840
It's as clean as when the theater rolled off the factory floor.

1206
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,760
In fact, we found some tuggies in the back row.

1207
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,960
We cleaned them up for you.

1208
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,360
Yeah.

1209
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,680
Or maybe when he comes in, you hide so he doesn't know you're there.

1210
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,200
When he comes in, you're sweeping popcorn into a little like, you're like, I got it.

1211
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,480
You jump up into the rafters like a howler monkey.

1212
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,680
He'll never know you're there.

1213
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,320
And you can just finish watching it as he cleans beneath you.

1214
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,400
Why don't you come in dressed as an usher?

1215
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,920
Why don't you come in dressed as usher?

1216
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,800
Dressed as usher.

1217
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,880
Hi, you wouldn't make usher leave the theater early, would you?

1218
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,800
Sir, you are 300 pounds and white as the fallen snow.

1219
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,480
Please, please leave the theater.

1220
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,480
You look like that really fat comedian.

1221
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,080
Ah, that would have been funnier if I could remember his name.

1222
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,280
What's that fool's name?

1223
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,360
You would literally, there's like five choices here.

1224
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1225
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,320
The one who won last Comic Standing.

1226
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,440
Oh, Renee Fatslin.

1227
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:56,800
What?

1228
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:56,960
No.

1229
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,080
Renee Fatslin?

1230
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,320
No.

1231
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,840
Louie Anderson.

1232
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,200
GERP.

1233
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,280
No.

1234
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,320
GERP.

1235
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,880
It's his name.

1236
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,000
Ralph E. Mays.

1237
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,080
Ralph E. Mays, that's it.

1238
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,440
Okay, I'm going to try that again.

1239
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,960
And, take two.

1240
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,480
You look like Ralph E. Mays.

1241
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:16,960
Nailed it.

1242
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,480
Nailed it.

1243
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,960
Old two-take Justin, they call him.

1244
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,920
Nailed it in two.

1245
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,000
Cut.

1246
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,480
Prank.

1247
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,960
Sir, rough.

1248
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,640
Can we just edit this?

1249
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,600
Just cut it.

1250
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,160
Cut it.

1251
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,720
Cut it.

1252
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,280
Cut it.

1253
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,780
Cut it.

1254
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,280
Cut it.

1255
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,680
Just get it there.

1256
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,720
Just cut that in.

1257
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,320
Take out the part where we did the other Tuesday.

1258
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:40,960
It'll be like.

1259
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,800
He's going to cut and paste.

1260
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,960
He looks like, and then Microsoft Sam.

1261
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,560
Ralph E. Mays.

1262
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,960
Can you do that and then just cut out everything from when we

1263
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,520
talked about BE teachers, except for when I said Mr.

1264
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,040
Wolfhawk and you lost it.

1265
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,680
Just like have a parenthetical statement within the show.

1266
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,120
I want this episode to be 45 seconds long.

1267
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,400
I want it to be you, you laughing about Mr.

1268
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,160
Woodcock and me saying.

1269
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,280
Hey, do you guys remember Mr.

1270
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,760
Woodcock?

1271
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,360
Ralph E. Mays.

1272
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,040
L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O.

1273
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,960
L-O, L-O.

1274
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,240
Keep your heart, three sacks.

1275
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,520
Keep your heart, three sacks.

1276
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,020
The end.

1277
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,800
We got to throw extreme restraints in there too.

1278
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,960
That podcast you told me to listen to, you were 100% right.

1279
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,840
It was 45 seconds long, but there was an uninterrupted bit

1280
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:34,000
about fuck toys for money.

1281
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,280
If this show were just a elaborate construct for which

1282
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,760
to deliver bits about sex toys, which I guess it is.

1283
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,200
They laughed at poor Sean William Scott and then talked

1284
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,680
about snakes coming out of a dick for like an hour and a half.

1285
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,720
They laughed at the existence of Sean William Scott,

1286
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,600
like just as a whole, his whole scenario.

1287
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,880
I was thinking about his funny bits from the movie.

1288
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,400
Yeah, like, yeah.

1289
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,080
Yeah, for sure.

1290
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,040
Thank you for listening to our comedy podcast,

1291
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,240
my brother, my brother and me.

1292
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,960
It's been just another great time.

1293
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,720
A lot of laughs.

1294
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,320
Thanks for people sending things to us in the mail.

1295
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:23,040
Again, our address is PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

1296
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,360
And you can just send that attention, me.

1297
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,160
No bombs.

1298
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:29,840
No bombs.

1299
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,200
You should write on it, no bombs.

1300
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,600
No Tuggies, no bombs.

1301
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,880
In fact, especially the first thing.

1302
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,880
No Tuggies.

1303
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
I know it seems like a good idea now.

1304
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:49,120
Thanks to people tweeting about the show,

1305
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,440
Thomas Rice, Double Wizard, The Incredible K, Opposable Plums,

1306
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:01,280
Tiff Cantrell, Frojack90, Mara Ruth S. Carroll, Chuck Jones 1970,

1307
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,040
Chuck Bruce One, Love Actuary, Blue Nicole.

1308
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,520
And if you're not already following MBMBAM Wisdom, you should.

1309
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,200
It's a funny Twitter account that you can enjoy.

1310
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,040
Thank you to Joe fucking Robinson for sending me a Pepsi

1311
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,920
Man action figure.

1312
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,880
Holy shit.

1313
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,760
Are you kidding?

1314
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,720
No, I'm serious.

1315
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,220
Goals.

1316
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,240
I know.

1317
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,200
It's going to be the best.

1318
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,120
Did we get any more extremely rare and valuable Pokemon cards?

1319
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,920
No, no more extremely.

1320
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,440
I did throw those others away, though.

1321
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,080
Ah, ah, ah, no.

1322
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,960
I also want to say, if you have someone that you love with a birthday coming up,

1323
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,560
or an anniversary, or a big occasion, and you want to shout out on the show for them,

1324
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:52,080
just go to Maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron and all the information is there.

1325
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,640
We'd love to wish them a happy birthday or tell them that you love them or if you got

1326
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,840
a business back or something.

1327
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,680
And if you have a business and you'd like a little commercial message on there,

1328
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,120
just go to the same link.

1329
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,080
Maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

1330
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,040
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1331
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,760
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1332
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,320
Maybe we should switch in like other tracks from that album

1333
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:16,820
in there.

1334
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,020
You think?

1335
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,520
There are a lot.

1336
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,400
There's a lot of good tracks and they're all pretty high energy.

1337
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,400
I bet they would get things going with a bang.

1338
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,600
Anyway, that probably won't happen.

1339
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,480
Yeah, probably.

1340
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,280
And remember, if you have any ghost-related questions,

1341
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,400
send them in so we can do a-

1342
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,840
Next week, all ghosts.

1343
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,600
Nothing fucking stupid, though.

1344
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,240
Like, we all- ghosts don't exist and like, that's cool.

1345
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,320
Make them- just make them good.

1346
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,520
Stop sending in shitty ghost questions, everyone.

1347
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,400
Yeah, just send your best ones.

1348
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,160
All ghosts next week.

1349
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,320
And thank you for listening to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

1350
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,600
this podcast here that we're on doing right now.

1351
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,400
We have got to stop drinking before doing the show.

1352
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,160
Yeah, good luck.

1353
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,800
Griffin, I believe you said you had one more question.

1354
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,080
Yeah, I have one to grow on.

1355
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,240
It's by- it was sent in by Nicole Thompson.

1356
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:08,880
Thank you, Nicole.

1357
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kat, who asks,
