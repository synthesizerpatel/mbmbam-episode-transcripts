1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,280
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,680
Once upon a time, I was one of the co-hosts of the Joystick podcast and we got to episode 99

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,320
and realized that the week following would be our 100th episode. And we didn't have it in us

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,960
or weren't able to be prepared enough, maybe is another way of putting it, to actually get it

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:30,160
together to do something special for a 100th episode. So we released episode 98, episode 98a,

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:44,480
episode 98b, episode 98c, episode 99, 99.5, 99.75, 99a, and then episode 100.

13
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,640
Okay. So we did that this one time. I don't

14
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,640
know why I'm relating that anecdote right now, but welcome to episode 421 of my brother,

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,280
my brother and me. We're so happy you've joined us here for just the regular amount of weed

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,640
discussion episodes of our podcast. Standard amounts.

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,360
Keeping it right between the navigational beacons. This is how much reglier people

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,560
like ourselves talk about weed. Not too much, not too little.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,520
Just sort of the one thing. I think the one thing this episode,

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,400
Willie Nelson's roll me up and smoke me when I die. Does it count as a living will? Discuss.

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,040
Are there going to be people when Willie Nelson passes away from this earth? And holy shit,

22
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
we can't really talk about celebrities in this context anymore. We've been doing this show for

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,720
eight years and it's broken bad on us so many times. Love Willie, keep it up. But when he does

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,520
pass on, is there going to be somebody who's like, all right, here's a big, big rolling paper.

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,200
Somebody's going to be like, hey, hold on, this is a dude. And they're like, no,

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,400
he was very, he was explicitly clear. I don't want to do this either. I don't want you to

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
think I'm excited about smoking a man. I don't want to cheat this dude. He's got

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,240
hair and bones and the whole deal. It's not going to go well.

29
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,280
It's not going to go good, but it's legally binding.

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,360
Please don't bogart my dad. No, we're talking about it too much.

31
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Please let me get some of that kind, kind dad.

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,160
So anyway, that's it. We can't talk about it anymore.

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,640
Just a regular amount of weed talk. Because if we're not careful,

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
this will become 420. If we're not careful, it'll be 420 and that'll be bad for us.

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,960
It's not. It's episode 421. Eventually, maybe we should just put 420 up for sale as a sponsored

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,480
episode. If you want us to make 420, we did have a possible situation that we thought would be

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,200
a good fit for that. That did not come together, did not congeal, which is fine.

38
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,040
That's the biz, as Jesse keeps telling us. It's the biz.

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,960
He says that a lot. Sometimes he just yells it at us.

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,680
It's the biz. This is the biz. This is the biz.

41
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,560
I never see him smoke cigarettes, except for when he's telling us about the,

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
about the biz after we've gone through a pretty hard knock.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,440
He lights up a big long cigarette and he tells us that it is the biz

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
and that we need to just learn to handle it.

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,040
He was in there. This was actually really hard for me.

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,400
I went in to ask Jesse about this sponsorship and he is in there holding court.

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,880
It's him, Alex Bloomberg, Ira Glass is there, Kerry Hoffman, like the whole gang,

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,280
all the luminaries are there. The Illuminated Aries?

49
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
Is that what you're saying? The Illuminated Aries?

50
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,960
And he's like, hey, Alex, I was like, hey, Jesse, I wanted to see how that sponsorship was going.

51
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,560
And Jesse says, hey, Alex, watch this. He takes the ashtray full of cigarette butts

52
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,800
because he had been getting stoked for this and just upends them onto my lap.

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
And some of them are still hot. Yeah.

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,560
So I'm kind of like, I'm just like patting my crotch really fast.

55
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
You don't need to worry about wiener burns for sure.

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,520
Everybody's like losing it. Adam Carolla, everybody's like loving it.

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,080
And then Jesse takes this glass ashtray, which is heavy as all get out,

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,280
and just chucks it right at my head. And I black out. There's blood.

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,240
Alex Bloomberg, loving it, losing it, absolutely in stitches about this.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
And Jesse comes over and he has one more cigarette.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He's like, oh, hey, you spilled my ashtray. So this is your problem now.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
And he flicks the cigarette in my mouth. Yeah.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,880
He says, it's the biz. Yeah.

64
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
And then he makes me leave. In that whole interaction, Justin,

65
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
about how many cigarettes did Jesse smoke just from start?

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
Eight. Eight cigarettes from start to finish.

67
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,360
I mean, he's like crushing them. Yeah.

68
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,120
Now, eight like in a lot or like all at once? Three at once.

69
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,800
And how many of them were in like long kind of very intricate holders?

71
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,720
The first three were in long intricate holders,

72
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,920
and he inhaled those in one drag. He pulled down three cigarettes in one drag.

73
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,600
Then he had a coughing fit that lasted for around 15 minutes,

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
but everybody was like frozen solid. You could tell that like this had

75
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,320
happened before and somebody had spoke and maybe it hadn't gone so good for them.

76
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,000
So everybody just like froze in terror. They got two ashtrays thrown right at them.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,760
Yeah. And not only that,

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,880
what I've heard, and maybe this is just a complete rumor,

79
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,320
but I've heard if you record those coughing fits and slow them down,

80
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
those are full episodes of Bullseye in each column. Yeah, sure.

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
That's how we do it. That's how we do it.

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
Everybody wonders where podcasts come from. There you go.

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Well, it all starts when Jesse smokes three cigarettes

84
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,280
like a cartoon, The Devil from the 1930s. And then he sees a podcast that he likes

85
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,760
and he's like, oh, God. And he turns into a wolf.

86
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,120
Speaking of wolf, it was weird how Scott Ackerman kept asking if he could take my thumbs.

87
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
And Jesse was like, no, Scott. No.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,440
And Scott Ackerman was like, please. Let me have the thumbs, Jesse.

89
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
Take them literally. This was not like some kind of metaphor.

90
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Yo, take my thumbs. Oh, no, dude. You ever seen that dude's thorax?

91
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,680
Covered with thumbs. Yeah.

92
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
Scott Ackerman wanted to take my thumbs, but Jesse wouldn't let him.

93
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,280
Really? Yeah.

94
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,000
Really? Yeah.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,720
Huh. Yeah, you lay him down flat on the floor

96
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
like he's planking and he just walks on the thumbs. It's horrible.

97
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,080
It's horrible to watch. Was the floating entity known as Gumhead there?

98
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,200
Gumhead, of course, who started head gum. I'm sorry, not a lot of people know this.

99
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,680
It was started by a living, floating celestial being, maybe?

100
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,320
Do you mean former guest spurts, Jake and Amir? Yes, correct.

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Well, that's their human form. Jake and Amir were there.

102
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,000
That's their human form. But when they joined together, they become Gumhead.

103
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Wow. Did I mention Carrie Hoffman tased me?

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,840
And I was already on the ground. It was uncalled for.

105
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,320
But she was like, PR XXX and then jam it into my chest. It sucked.

106
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,160
She already had the taser charged up. She was ready for it.

107
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,600
Yeah, sure. It was miserable.

108
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,560
Anyway, let's get to the questions. Here's our first one.

109
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
A couple of weeks ago, I was walking downtown and a guy

110
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,320
and his girlfriend asked me for change for a dollar.

111
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,880
We were near a parking meter, so this seemed reasonable to me,

112
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,760
and I pulled out my wallet. The guy immediately grabbed my wallet

113
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,800
out of my hands and ran about a block, a half of a block away with it.

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,040
Then he turned back around and gave me my wallet back.

115
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,000
In the end, I guess he stole my cash, which amounted to about $5.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,040
What happened? Was it a prank?

117
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
No, no, you can't leave. You left out a savory fucking juice.

118
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
Okay, okay, sorry.

119
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,800
You gotta give them the whole truth.

120
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
I skipped a parenthetical. Shame on me.

121
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
In the end, I guess he stole my cash, which amounted to $5.

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,880
Actually, it was $6, but he left me $1.

123
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,160
A juicy deed.

124
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,880
What happened? Was it a prank? Did he give up?

125
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Is this a thing that happens?

126
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,960
I mean, it was technically the theft of $5, but I was so relieved,

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,160
I went out to cancel and replace my cards, and I'm okay with that.

128
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,840
And it says, from never going downtown again.

129
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
This is so dope. This is my shit.

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
This is really nice of the mugger.

131
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
I mean, where you dress as the Monopoly man,

132
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
and the mugger saw you and was like, ah, a juicy target.

133
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,600
But what they didn't know is you'd spent almost all of your money,

134
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,640
except $6, on that Monopoly man costume.

135
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,080
Okay, we need to take, you guys are looking at the little picture.

136
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
You're looking at one grain of sand on the beach.

137
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,160
I'm going to look at the whole fucking beach.

138
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
Because I don't know if this is a mugging.

139
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm not convinced this is a mugging.

140
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,520
What are you thinking?

141
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Imagine if you will, you're young,

142
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,520
and you're trying to show off to a new significant other,

143
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,360
and you're having some fun downtown, and you're having that downtown fun,

144
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
and you're having a conversation about mugging,

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,400
and you say, I bet I could mug, and it would be great.

146
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,360
And your significant other's like, nah, you won't do it.

147
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
And then you walk up to somebody and you mug them a little bit.

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,080
And this is not even a mugging.

149
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,440
You got your fucking wallet back.

150
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,760
It's a little bit of a mugging, but come on.

151
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
But then you bring it back as like a jokey joke,

152
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,280
but you did take $5 from them.

153
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,400
So it's kind of like a cute, like flirty, like fun, flirty dare.

154
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Do you know what I mean?

155
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
Like a truth or dare, fun, flirt dare.

156
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
I mean, let's recontextualize this, right?

157
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
If somebody broke into my house,

158
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,280
but only stole something worth $5, how would I feel?

159
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh, is it a fun, well, yeah, was it a flirty dare though,

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
with like a significant other they're trying to show off in press outside?

161
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
But like they broke into my house,

162
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,920
and they stole the magnet that I got at King's Island, right?

163
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,560
Am I gonna, am I gonna press charges?

164
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,200
I don't know.

165
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,280
You catch them in the act, they spring out the window laughing.

166
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,680
They also stole a precious necklace,

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,480
but they hand you the necklace back through the broken window they smashed.

168
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
And then they walk outside.

169
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
You see them with a significant other,

170
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,400
and then they show them the magnet,

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,480
and then they high five and kiss and laugh.

172
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
And then they walk off, and you're like,

173
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
at fair dinkum, you got, you did a, it was flirty, so.

174
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,640
It's possible that this is the perfect crime,

175
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,360
what we're describing,

176
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,720
because like if you go and rob a bank,

177
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,640
and you steal millions of dollars,

178
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,800
but you come back seconds later,

179
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
you hand them back the bags of money,

180
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
and you're like, here's back a million dollars,

181
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,400
I did keep $200.

182
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
And they're like, huh, okay, well,

183
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,440
you could have made off with the millions, and you didn't.

184
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
Yeah, so yeah, keep that $200.

185
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,120
Okay, bye, thank you.

186
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
Can we just create a system where like,

187
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
I don't know how many muggers listen to this show,

188
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
but if we could just all agree on a little bit of etiquette

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
that listen, you're gonna make me cancel the cards,

190
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,480
but I'm gonna cancel the cards for use the cards.

191
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,840
There's no need for that.

192
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,440
You don't need my license.

193
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
If we could just agree that like,

194
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,320
you're gonna, okay, you got me.

195
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,640
Okay, you got me.

196
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,080
And then you get my cash.

197
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,480
All right.

198
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,080
And we move on with that.

199
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
You shouldn't have cash anyway.

200
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,080
For now on, you just refer to the cash in your wallet

201
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,200
as muggin' stuffins.

202
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,600
Yeah, yeah.

203
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
That's just my muggin' stuffins.

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
It's for when I get mugged, and I will deserve it,

205
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,000
because I was carrying all of this muggin' stuffins.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
Don't have too much, have six bucks in there.

207
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Duh, you got me.

208
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,160
If we codify this, though, Justin,

209
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,520
in the way that you're describing,

210
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm worried it's gonna be so easy.

211
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Can you say that real quick?

212
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
Muggin' stuffins, yeah.

213
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,200
If you have, I mean, if we have two wallets, right?

214
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
What were you doing today, Bob?

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,680
Muggin' stuff?

216
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
Yeah, we got a right butt cheek wallet,

217
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
and in that one we have driver's license,

218
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,440
easily cancelable credit cards,

219
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,600
pictures of our kids and loved ones.

220
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
And then our left butt cheek, we have a smaller wallet.

221
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,880
This one is going to contain all our money,

222
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,200
and then maybe a punch card for a Subway sandwich

223
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
that you have all the way going.

224
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
Because if I was a mugger and I saw that,

225
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,560
I'd be like, hmm, hell yeah, that's six bucks right there.

226
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,120
And then when you get mugged, you're like,

227
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,960
oh, here, just take my left wallet.

228
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,840
Just take my left wallet, this is my muggin' stuffins.

229
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
I'm worried if we do that, Justin,

230
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,880
it's gonna be kind of flag football.

231
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm worried it's gonna be so easy to mug people

232
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
that I might start doing it.

233
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,520
Because if you got me.

234
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Okay, so you mugged Steve, right?

235
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,920
But then Jerry turns around and mugs you.

236
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
What if there's just one, okay,

237
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,080
what if we make it there's just one money wallet?

238
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,280
And everybody's mugging, everybody going,

239
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,320
do you have the money wallet?

240
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
That's socialism.

241
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,760
You've moved away from the core argument, which is this.

242
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,160
If you make mugging a crime, only the criminals will mug.

243
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,720
Wouldn't it be more fun if getting mugged

244
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,360
could become something of an opportunity to meet new people?

245
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
Sure, sure.

246
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,320
And just don't have too much cash in your wallet

247
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,840
so it's not gonna cost you too much.

248
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,560
You're just getting mugged, and it's not a crime.

249
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
So the person mugging you is not a criminal.

250
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,520
They could be your neighbor, your best friend, whatever.

251
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,760
You are getting mugged, though, and it's a shakedown.

252
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,240
And here's the one thing about this system that I've created

253
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,880
which may have some flaws, it's too early to say.

254
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,720
If you don't give them the wallet, they will fuck you up.

255
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
They have carte blanche.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
Okay, okay, okay.

257
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,540
Oh.

258
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a real mug.

259
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,200
It's a real mug.

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,560
It's a real mug.

261
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,680
It's just not illegal.

262
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
Man, Juice, I gotta say,

263
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,680
you sound like the Dark Knight's the Joker right now.

264
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,520
Like just hella chaos and...

265
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
I love chasing cars.

266
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,560
Really?

267
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,320
Can I do a Yahoo?

268
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,280
Wait, do you?

269
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait, what?

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
Justin, do you chase cars?

271
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,520
I'm like a pup chasing a car,

272
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,680
and I'm loving the hunt of the car and just going for it.

273
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
24 Sev, chaos too.

274
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,240
Oh, baby.

275
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Yeah, when I get that car, I'm gonna bite it a lot.

276
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
I almost finished his famous monologue

277
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,640
that I memorized verbatim, Griffin.

278
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:54,960
Sorry, keep going.

279
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,560
Can I please finish the Joker's monologue?

280
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
Yeah, please, please, please.

281
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,960
I gotta start over at the beginning.

282
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,600
Okay.

283
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,400
Can I be Harvey Dent?

284
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
Uh, yeah.

285
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,240
Okay.

286
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,720
Oh, man, this burns a lot.

287
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
This is a real stinger.

288
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
Are you Batman, Travis?

289
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,200
Uh, yeah, I guess, if that's the only one left.

290
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
Okay, but he's not in this scene,

291
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
so please respect that.

292
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,760
I gotta hold my mouth like this.

293
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm just like a dog chasing a car.

294
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
Hey, is the Joker in here?

295
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,800
Yeah, it's me, the Joker.

296
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Sit down, I'm doing a monologue.

297
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

298
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,520
No, that's fine.

299
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,640
I'll start at the beginning.

300
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,360
It's pretty good.

301
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,400
I need a ointment.

302
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm just like a dog chasing a car

303
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,400
for the love of the chase

304
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,520
and to keep my exercise fitness at 100%.

305
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,760
You gotta get your steps in.

306
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,440
I'm starting over.

307
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm just like a dog.

308
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,960
Stop interrupting me, Batman.

309
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,040
I'm like a dog chasing a car.

310
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,480
Did somebody knock something over?

311
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
No, I'm flipping a coin to see if I should blow you goons away.

312
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,520
Shoot your asses.

313
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm starting over.

314
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm just like a dog.

315
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,400
And I'm chasing a car.

316
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,720
And it's my number one.

317
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,400
A car.

318
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,000
You wanna get nuts?

319
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,360
No.

320
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,280
You ever danced with the devil

321
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,200
while you're chasing a car?

322
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,840
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,480
Oh, well, you sure do lick yourself a lot.

324
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,080
Give me your wallet, Joker.

325
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,560
You'll never get it.

326
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,440
Okay, well, now I have to beat you up.

327
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,280
I have 100 wallets

328
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,040
and I'm gonna set them all on fire.

329
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,720
Okay.

330
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,520
And scene.

331
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,840
That's how, of course, that was not a recording

332
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
of the famous film Batman Does It Again.

333
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,040
That was us doing it.

334
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,680
Weirdly enough.

335
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo?

336
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,080
Yeah, I do.

337
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,200
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

338
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,840
Thank you, Adrian.

339
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,800
It's Yahoo Answers user Jules who asks,

340
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,080
my stupid brother might have given my dog a Twizzler.

341
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,120
How can I tell for sure?

342
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,440
Breaking it down.

343
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,080
I wanna get forensic on this motherfucker

344
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
and figure out how we can figure out

345
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,080
how they can figure out if their stupid brother

346
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,920
did give their dog a Twizzler

347
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,200
and how they can tell for sure.

348
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,680
If it was a gusher, it would be easy.

349
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,720
A gusher would be easy

350
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
because there would be dribbling juice

351
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
down the doggy's chin.

352
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
And that would be so easy to diagnose.

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
You would get near the chin, smell it.

354
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,560
If it smelled like watermelon or a grape.

355
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
The dog's head would have become a watermelon, Griffin.

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
Of course.

357
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,080
How silly of me.

358
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,400
That is the joke you were making

359
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,360
and I fucked it up.

360
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
Start it again.

361
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,040
Read the question again, start over.

362
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,760
My stupid brother might-

363
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
If it was a gusher, it would be easy.

364
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
Because of fruit head.

365
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,800
Justin, any jokes?

366
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
No, I wanna hear the question for once.

367
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
My stupid brother might have given my dog a Twizzler.

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,040
How can I tell for sure?

369
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
Well, if it was an airhead,

370
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,360
his head would have blown up real big.

371
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,640
It's a shame it wasn't that.

372
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
All right, all right, all right.

373
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
If it was a tizzy roll pop,

374
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,600
an owl would have come and taken it.

375
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,680
So any other fun candy commercial sort of things?

376
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,720
If it was Skittles,

377
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,240
Skittles would have popped all over his face and body.

378
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,280
Because Skittles pops.

379
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,560
Yeah.

380
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,280
If it was, fuck, shit.

381
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
My favorite candy bar, fuck shit.

382
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,800
There's probably not a ring pop.

383
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,440
Do you remember the great slogan for that one?

384
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,040
How they get so many goddamn nuts?

385
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Fuck shit, fuck shit.

386
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,540
Hey.

387
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
It was actually the first candy that was ever

388
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
discontinued before it was released.

389
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
So you see a lot of retro sites that have like,

390
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,800
do you remember this?

391
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,480
Hey, 90s kids, remember this one?

392
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,360
And we all say no.

393
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,680
It's like, well, it was discontinued, wasn't it?

394
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,240
All right.

395
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
There was a kid in middle school who swore up and down

396
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,560
that he had had a fuck shit once.

397
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,040
But when pressed, he couldn't really give us any details,

398
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,680
except that there was a goddamn lot of nuts in it.

399
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
He said there was so many goddamn nuts.

400
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,480
His uncle, he said, worked at the fuck shit factory.

401
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
But here's the thing about the fuck shit factory.

402
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
Nobody ever goes in.

403
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,800
Nobody ever comes out.

404
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,280
Come with me and you'll be in this fucking righteous candy

405
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,400
factory.

406
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,680
We got nuts.

407
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,320
Holy shit, do we have nuts?

408
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
I actually one time I got invited

409
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
to go into the fuck shit factory.

410
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,000
But then Mr.

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,960
Fuckworth came by and he told me that he would give me,

412
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,120
his words, a goddamn lot of nuts if I would deliver to him

413
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,560
the fuck shit recipe.

414
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,760
And I ran and ran and I never stopped running,

415
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,960
if I'm being honest.

416
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
And I think that really has led me to where I am now.

417
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:07,200
So the Twizzler, the dog ate a Twizzler, I think.

418
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
And so I just want to help this person.

419
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,080
So we've had a lot of fun just cussing a bunch,

420
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,760
but I wonder if we could help this person

421
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
whose dog might be Twizzler sick.

422
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,000
If you scrubs want to eat my goddamn nuts,

423
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
are you sure that you can handle it?

424
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,800
Here's the thing about dogs and Twizzlers.

425
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,200
They don't like them.

426
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,040
You don't or dogs don't?

427
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,960
You know what?

428
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,560
I'm ambivalent to them.

429
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,480
They're definitely better than Red Vines.

430
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,200
Don't at me.

431
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,520
But I don't think a dog would like a Twizzler, would they?

432
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,120
I mean, my dog would literally eat anything.

433
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,320
It's just the gummy consistency is probably not a dog's fave.

434
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
But regardless, that's-

435
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,120
How can we know for sure?

436
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,400
I don't want to do an Ian Malcolm Dookie analysis.

437
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
Actually, he wasn't into it, was he?

438
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
He hated that they were putting their hands

439
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,440
inside the Dino Dookie.

440
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
So I did a quick search of Animal Hub,

441
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,560
where I get all my facts and figures.

442
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,080
And the answer to this question that was posed by Seth

443
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
Can dogs eat Twizzlers?

444
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,120
And here's the answer for y'all to specifically answer

445
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
the question, can dogs eat Twizzlers?

446
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Strictly, the answer is yes.

447
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,480
Okay.

448
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,120
And there's no harm done for the dogs to ingest them.

449
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,920
Besides, they are known to be safe for consumption

450
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,440
as even kids love to eat them.

451
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
So wait, here's what it says here.

452
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,160
Too much is bad.

453
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,560
Twizzlers may be safe for dogs.

454
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,640
However, they should not eat them.

455
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,040
For dogs, however, they should not be recommended

456
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,360
to be given to your dogs in large quantity.

457
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
Fucking shit.

458
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, for sure.

459
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,440
Okay, but also you can't say like kids like to eat them

460
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,920
so it's safe because my kid likes grapes.

461
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,240
And if I give my dog a grape, I believe she'll explode.

462
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
So like, that's not a good metric for that.

463
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
My kid also loves chocolate.

464
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,320
Like that's not a good metric.

465
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,400
Are dogs not supposed to do grapes?

466
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
No.

467
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,880
Oh shit, I gotta go.

468
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
Mr. Barfleet?

469
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,840
Mr. Barfleet?

470
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, well, I guess I should ask.

471
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
Does anybody know how to make a dog poop now?

472
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,200
To get it out.

473
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,640
Twizzlers.

474
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,520
We'll give them diarrhea.

475
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,200
Hi brothers, I work at a grocery store deli in a rural area

476
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
and a few days ago, someone came to the counter

477
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,000
who I am 95% sure is a moderately famous Hollywood actor.

478
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,920
Stop, stop, stop.

479
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Let's just scroll through the question

480
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,960
and see if they say who the actor is.

481
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,880
Because it's not, I don't think it is.

482
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
And if this is the case, like how can we approach this one

483
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
in good faith, fam?

484
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,040
Yeah, we can't.

485
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,400
You have to tell us who it is.

486
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
Email us next week.

487
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,320
Try it again.

488
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,560
Email us again next week and let us know who it is

489
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,600
because we can't.

490
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,120
That is true because like there are Hollywood celebs

491
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,920
that if you said they got away to a rural area,

492
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,120
I'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

493
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,520
This is the first time we've ever sent something back

494
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,240
for a second draft.

495
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,360
Send it in, say who it is.

496
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,360
We'll do this one again, but we can't not know.

497
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,080
Yes, and please include the original text of your question.

498
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,600
We have to know who the person is.

499
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,080
It means everything.

500
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
And use the same sign off.

501
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
We won't say it here, but that way I can search.

502
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,920
And actually reply to your first email that you sent

503
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,960
to keep it like thread.

504
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
And send us a Bitcoin for a hundred dollars.

505
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I work in an office building.

506
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,320
I want a $300 of Bitcoin.

507
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,560
I work in an office building that has a kitchen

508
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,400
and we've discovered that many of our spoons

509
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
are going missing at an alarming rate.

510
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,880
My boss has personally bought new spoons

511
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
to replace the missing ones on enough occasions

512
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,040
that she dressed up as a spoon for Halloween

513
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
to remind people of the issue.

514
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,560
Sounds like a fun person.

515
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,600
She won the costume competition in case you're wondering.

516
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,640
I was.

517
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,200
I was.

518
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
Where are our spoons going?

519
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,040
And how could I stop this from happening?

520
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,720
That's from burglarized in Baltimore.

521
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,440
Oh, I got it.

522
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,000
I know.

523
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,880
What is it?

524
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,320
Up your butt and around the corner.

525
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,040
Next question.

526
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,480
Okay.

527
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,980
Wow.

528
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,040
Right, a little intense.

529
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
I wish this would happen to me because I have a sad story

530
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,280
for y'all.

531
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,000
I a few years ago was in need of spoons

532
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
because we were out and we went through a lot.

533
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,280
I was in need of spoons.

534
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,800
And I got a container of spoons

535
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,720
and it was like an eight pack, right?

536
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
It's like eight spoons, eight forks, eight knives.

537
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,480
Get home, put them into the silverware drawer

538
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,560
and you'll never believe this.

539
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,280
What?

540
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,200
I hate these spoons.

541
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh, no.

542
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,960
I hate these spoons.

543
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,760
What's wrong?

544
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,320
They feel, okay, one, they have no heft.

545
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,160
They feel like they're made of plastic.

546
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,920
Two, the top is shaped like baby spoons.

547
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,600
Baby spoons, I can't get four crunches of Cap'n Crunch in here.

548
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,680
I can't get, I can't get four biscuits.

549
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,840
It's a shallow, narrow, tiny spoon that is weak

550
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,360
and there is nothing powerful about this spoon.

551
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,680
It is a weak spoon that I hate.

552
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,600
And I have eight of them now and I would do anything

553
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,160
if someone could give me an excuse to replace these spoons.

554
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,320
Please, Spoon Thief, if you're hearing this,

555
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,520
come steal my spoons.

556
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,200
Yeah, these miserable spoons.

557
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,480
Can we all agree?

558
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
I have not reached into the silverware drawer

559
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,840
when I needed a friendly spoon to help me eat my cereal soups

560
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,920
or whatever, what have you.

561
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,840
I have not reached into that drawer

562
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,760
and mindfully chosen a small spoon, a little spoon,

563
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,440
I guess a teaspoon over a big boy spoon

564
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
since I was an eight years old.

565
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
That's a wild choice to make.

566
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Why would I, do you want to work twice as hard

567
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
for the same amount of soup?

568
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,600
Nah, I don't.

569
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,000
I want to carry a lot of soup up to my mouth with each go

570
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,800
and I don't know why the littler spoons even exist.

571
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,800
I want the spoon to endanger the corners of my mouth.

572
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,760
I will say that with Big Fork versus Tiny Fork,

573
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,360
Tiny Fork, sometimes I look and I'm like,

574
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,960
yeah, this is a thin food.

575
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,640
I don't need that Big Fork.

576
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,160
This is a conservationist.

577
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,600
I'm gonna save my energy.

578
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,480
I don't need to lift the extra weight of the Big Fork.

579
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,560
But with the spoon, I agree with you, Griffin.

580
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,120
Those little spoons, that's for my baby now.

581
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
My baby can have those spoons.

582
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
How cool would this movie be if I was having

583
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,720
dinner with the queen and I showed up on my scooter

584
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,360
I rented from the street and I rode into Buckingham

585
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,240
and rolled up to the table and then they were like,

586
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,800
you're late and I was like, fuck off and sat down

587
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,960
and I threw my backpack under the table.

588
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,400
And then they started and they served up a soup

589
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,360
and I took like four of the seven sort of implements

590
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,000
that were lining my plate and I just threw them

591
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,160
to the ground and they're like, what are you doing?

592
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,120
And I was like, gang, you only need the big spoon

593
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,720
and you need the Big Fork and maybe a knife for hard meat

594
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,440
and that's it.

595
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,080
And then they all were like, oh shit, you're right.

596
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,160
And then I pulled out my boombox and we had a party

597
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,600
and that's the end of the movie.

598
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,200
And so this one's called Manners Schmanners

599
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
and Travis, I am gonna-

600
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,640
Wait a minute.

601
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
Yeah, no, I'm gonna need to borrow it.

602
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,400
But this is, it's what I believe in, really strong

603
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,240
and I think Mike Myers is gonna play every role but me.

604
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,280
Okay, and to solve your problem,

605
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,400
Burglarized in Baltimore, what you're gonna wanna do

606
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,520
is much like coffee shops do, you wanna get a bigger spoon,

607
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,320
chain that to the regular spoons

608
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,680
and so that way people are less likely to steal it

609
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,840
because it has like a big dangly, I don't know,

610
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,280
a spatula or a spoon, maybe just a big piece of wood

611
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,320
on there, something so they have to return the spoon

612
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,960
back to you.

613
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
Would it be helpful if, this is a thought,

614
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,680
what if you see a big stack of spoons,

615
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,960
huge stack of spoons, big sexy spoons

616
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
with the curve just the way you like,

617
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
what's the first thing you wanna do?

618
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,360
Put it right up my butt, take it around the corner.

619
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
Exactly, stuff right in your pocket.

620
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,400
What if there's just one spoon for the whole office

621
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,200
and it's like, it's a member of the family.

622
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,240
If somebody steals this motherfucker, it's on.

623
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
And you know it because you were waiting on it.

624
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,080
You were waiting on the spoon.

625
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,360
You cannot get that spoon out of the break room, no way.

626
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,080
Someone else needs to stir their Cremora

627
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,200
into their decaf, they need a spoon.

628
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
I'm just going over your yearly review here,

629
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,800
your numbers have been good,

630
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,520
your customer service reviews are way up.

631
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Now I do see here that you hog the spoon.

632
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,680
Did you hog a little bit of a spoon hog, Victoria?

633
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,520
You're fired.

634
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Spoon hog.

635
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,600
It's my favorite James Bond villain.

636
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
It's a good one.

637
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,640
So what if we have everybody in the office-

638
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,120
You say there's enough spoons for you.

639
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Never enough spoons for you, spoon hog.

640
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,360
Never a fork will do.

641
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,640
Why not a spoon of two thousand?

642
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,440
Why not a spoon hog?

643
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,120
What if everybody has their own spoon?

644
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,920
I gotta point out, I was doing kind of a parody cover

645
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,400
of Soundgarden's Spoon Man, but Justin took it

646
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
and ran with it in such a different direction.

647
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,320
A parody cover of Chris Cornell's theme from Casino Royale.

648
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,720
Yeah, but I mean, Skyfall would have matched

649
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,040
sort of the rhythm of Skyfall.

650
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,560
Or like Goldfinger, you could have done like Spoonfinger.

651
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,040
Mine was not a parody, it was a pastiche.

652
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,600
I was capturing-

653
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
Oh, an homage?

654
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,400
It was an homage.

655
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,600
I was capturing, it's like how, you know,

656
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
that Weird Al song, Everything You Know Is Wrong,

657
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,720
it's sort of like a tone parody or a pastiche

658
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,760
of They Might Be Giants?

659
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,040
That's kind of what I was going for.

660
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,800
A soundalike, a tone parody, a pastiche.

661
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah, maybe if we say pastiche 80 more times-

662
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,880
Can we just go to the money tone?

663
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,120
We've never done this before,

664
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,440
but we're just going to go back and forth on this one.

665
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
Ant vs. Ant.

666
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Yeah, okay, all right.

667
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,000
You know, folks, hiring is challenging, right Griffin?

668
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,960
Yeah, I hate doing it, but there are lots of,

669
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,640
well, there's not, there's really just the one way

670
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,240
to make things easier, huh, Juice?

671
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,040
Yeah, that place is ZipRecruiter, isn't it, Griffin?

672
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,120
Yeah, they make hiring simple, fast, and smart,

673
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,080
isn't that right, Travis?

674
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,480
No, yeah, yes, ZipRecruiter sends your job

675
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,560
to over how many, Griffin?

676
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,920
100, Travis?

677
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,080
Of the webs, Justin, leading job boards,

678
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,920
but it's true, they don't stop there

679
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,000
with their powerful matching technology.

680
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,960
ZipRecruiter will scan your DNA and your blood-

681
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,240
Whoa!

682
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
And they'll steal your DNA and your blood,

683
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
and they'll legally force you to take whatever job

684
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,880
they see as the right fit for your genetic makeup.

685
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,280
It's like The Giver, it's kind of like The Giver.

686
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,400
Basically The Giver.

687
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,680
When you're born, ZipRecruiter assigns you a job.

688
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,480
And that's not-

689
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,320
Do you feel a chip in the back of your neck?

690
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,560
That's ZipRecruiter, you already have it.

691
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,240
That's ZipRecruiter there.

692
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
Now, can you see colors?

693
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,960
Do you feel emotions?

694
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,640
Good news, ZipRecruiter has designated you as a giver.

695
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,320
Okay, I have to tell you legally

696
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,560
what the gene splicers at ZipRecruiter actually do

697
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,320
is they scan thousands of resumes

698
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,280
using their latent psychic gene powers to find people

699
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,880
with the right experience and invite them

700
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,320
to apply to your job.

701
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,000
That's what they actually do.

702
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,800
All right, now we can go back to goof arounds.

703
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,400
Right now, our listeners can try ZipRecruiter for free

704
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,040
at this exclusive web address.

705
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,280
Folks, that's underlined and bold and italicized.

706
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,080
So ZipRecruiter really wanted me to say out loud,

707
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,440
exclusive web address, ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

708
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,520
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

709
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,720
ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.

710
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,080
Advertisers don't keep advertising with you

711
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,560
if it fits a direct response like this, right?

712
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,840
The way this game works is advertisers take out an ad

713
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,720
and they have something like that,

714
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,800
that link that you're supposed to use

715
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,800
to try ZipRecruiter for free.

716
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,960
And if enough people use that, it's called direct response.

717
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,800
They know that people are using that thing.

718
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,280
They heard it on our show and we did a good ad

719
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,160
and so people are using it.

720
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,760
ZipRecruiter has been advertising with us for years.

721
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,080
So shockingly, at some point, apparently at many points,

722
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,880
our listeners of My Brother, My Brother, and Me

723
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,680
have been listening to the three of us chuckle fucks

724
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,240
and thought, oh, these are the guys I should turn to

725
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,200
for hiring advice.

726
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,440
I'm gonna do what they told me to do.

727
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,760
Like a lot of you do it and thank you so much,

728
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,040
but it's very shocking to me.

729
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,000
This is how undeniable the ZipRecruiter service is.

730
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,800
It sounds so strong and powerful

731
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,080
that even three dum-dums cannot fuck it up.

732
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,880
It's so good.

733
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,000
It's ZipRecruiter.

734
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
You got to.

735
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,640
Can I tell you about Squarespace?

736
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,000
Please do. Yeah, okay.

737
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,440
Okay, but in doing this,

738
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,760
I'm actually gonna promote my own project

739
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
that I use Squarespace to correct.

740
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,520
You can go to buttercupisaveverygoodgirl.com

741
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,920
to find a website I made on Squarespace

742
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,560
in about five minutes that is just a slideshow

743
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,120
of nice pictures of my dog, Buttercup,

744
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,000
who is very cute.

745
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,600
I think it's a very good website.

746
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,360
And like I said, it was really like maybe five minutes

747
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,960
and that's what Squarespace does.

748
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,800
Cause you can, let's see, let me run through

749
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,600
what I did here.

750
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,120
Create a beautiful website too.

751
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Turn your cool idea into a new website.

752
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,920
Check.

753
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,880
Showcase your work.

754
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,640
I took these pictures of Buttercup.

755
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,280
Check.

756
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,360
Announce an upcoming event or special project.

757
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,560
This is a special project.

758
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,200
Check.

759
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,160
And more.

760
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,560
Check.

761
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,620
What?

762
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,240
Website sucks.

763
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,120
No, Buttercup is a very good girl.com.

764
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm looking at it now, man.

765
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,560
There's no fucking games.

766
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,800
There's no like flash animations.

767
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,440
There's a slideshow of good dog pictures.

768
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,120
There's like six pics, but no games.

769
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,800
I have a frequently asked question section.

770
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,200
I've got about Buttercup section.

771
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,760
Why exactly did you put your credit card

772
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,280
in so many of these pictures?

773
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
You can make it out in literally every other one.

774
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,880
Can you fucking update the homepage at least

775
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,200
to have it say like games are coming?

776
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,800
Yeah, I will add games on the way under construction.

777
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
I haven't finished the website yet,

778
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,680
but please come back to it.

779
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,520
I'm sorry, there's no games yet.

780
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,920
I'll add some flash dating games

781
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,120
where you can date Buttercup.

782
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,680
Is that weird?

783
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,000
No, I just want one where she's running around

784
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,840
grabbing bones and her bark's turning

785
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,120
into fireballs or something.

786
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,200
But like, just think about it, bud.

787
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,320
That'll come in Buttercup is a very good girl.com 2.0.

788
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,640
Okay.

789
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,640
But if you want to make a website

790
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,680
dedicated to your pet, you can do so.

791
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,160
And you can do it very easily

792
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,760
because Squarespace has beautiful templates

793
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,200
created by world-class designers

794
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
and powerful e-commerce functionality.

795
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
So if I want to start selling Buttercup merch

796
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,080
through my website, I can.

797
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Free and secure hosting,

798
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,120
so I'm not worried about people like hacking.

799
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,560
Buttercup is a very good girl.

800
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
Oh God, now I'm worried about it.

801
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,440
And there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

802
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,080
So head to squarespace.com slash my brother

803
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,800
for a free trial.

804
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,760
And when you're ready to launch,

805
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
use the offer code my brother, all one word,

806
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
to save 10% off your first purchase

807
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,200
of a website or domain

808
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,520
that's squarespace.com slash my brother.

809
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,920
And then enter the code my brother, all one word.

810
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,760
This message is for Vriska

811
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,440
and it's from the Dirk John Hive Mine.

812
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,920
And they requested this message

813
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
and it's their money.

814
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,680
So whatever.

815
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,160
Vriska did nothing wrong.

816
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,760
So there is the message that you paid money for.

817
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
Maybe it's your ringtone now.

818
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,920
Maybe it's your text message alert.

819
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,400
I don't know.

820
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,760
But there's Taco saying the thing

821
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,360
that you said you wanted him to say.

822
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,120
Maybe it's gonna be in court evidence

823
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,000
and they'll play that in court.

824
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
They'll be like, ah, shoot.

825
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm gonna do another one.

826
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,760
Okay.

827
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,480
That one was short.

828
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,440
This is for Daniel

829
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,040
and it's from Future Daniel.

830
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,080
It says, hey, Daniel,

831
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,680
why did you spend $100

832
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,120
to have the McElroy's read this message,

833
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,920
you dingus?

834
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,400
Stop being fiscally irresponsible

835
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,160
just because you're feeling sad at the moment.

836
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,960
Oh, well, I suppose it didn't hurt.

837
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,200
Things are looking better over here in 2018,

838
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
but we can't keep doing this.

839
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,720
And that's for Daniel

840
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,320
and it's from Future Daniel.

841
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,520
And that's very meta.

842
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,560
It's very meta.

843
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,440
I also don't think there's-

844
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,720
That's not how that works.

845
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,880
Yeah, I don't think that there's any way

846
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
that things are looking better

847
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,680
over here in 2018 is true.

848
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,080
You never know for Daniel

849
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,120
and Daniel's world.

850
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,560
Alexa.

851
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,440
What did Alexa do?

852
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,880
She was telling me about

853
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
the Encyclopedia Britannica for some reason.

854
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,080
Oh, now my Alexa's gone.

855
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,000
Ah, fuck.

856
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,080
I wish Alexa would cuss.

857
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
Here's a Jumbotron for Brian

858
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,320
and it's from Michael who says,

859
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,280
congratulations to my chemical engineer-ist brother

860
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,040
on your impending bundle of joy.

861
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,960
Hopefully by the time you hear this,

862
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,440
I'll have convinced Allie to let our dad

863
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,560
be called peepums,

864
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,080
but I'm not sure that'll work.

865
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,400
Hearing this in the resonant tones of the brothers

866
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,560
will take the sting out of the disappointment

867
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,720
from your band director-ist brother.

868
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,520
And this was for May,

869
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,640
so almost certainly the baby is here.

870
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
I hope everything's going well.

871
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,160
And it's kind of fucked up

872
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,960
how grandpa's and grandma's get to pick their name, right?

873
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,840
They get to pick their chosen sort of nickname.

874
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,160
Like, dad is like, I'm peepums now.

875
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,840
And it's like, I feel like I should get a choice in the matter.

876
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,920
Because that's a word that is uncomfortable for me

877
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,680
to call you, my real father.

878
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,200
Yeah, but you're stuck with it.

879
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,120
Welcome.

880
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,600
Thank you.

881
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,400
No problem.

882
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,200
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

883
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
What do you look for in a podcast?

884
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,160
Reliability is big for me.

885
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,720
Power.

886
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,680
I'd say comfort.

887
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,200
What do you think of this?

888
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,720
That's Jordan Jesse Go.

889
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,760
Jordan Jesse Go?

890
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,040
They came out of the floor?

891
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,840
And down from the ceiling?

892
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,200
That can't be safe.

893
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm upset.

894
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,840
Can we go now?

895
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,800
Soon.

896
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
Jordan Jesse Go, a real podcast.

897
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
A real podcast.

898
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,800
Rittle me peaceful, please.

899
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,840
No, I was about-

900
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,440
No, Travis, please don't.

901
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,760
Please.

902
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,640
What were you gonna do?

903
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,320
No, I was gonna do something.

904
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,200
What were you gonna do?

905
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,880
Do we have too many segments now?

906
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,800
No, we have just enough segments.

907
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,520
And I'm gonna do my segment instead of Travis's, okay?

908
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,800
Well, can we do both of them?

909
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,760
I don't know if we'll have time to do both of them.

910
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,280
All right, can I please start?

911
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,640
Time vote.

912
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,000
I think I should be a tiebreaker.

913
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,440
Okay, what do you think, Griffin?

914
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,040
Oh, I don't know what your segment's gonna be.

915
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,320
Well, just let me do my segment.

916
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,520
Can I just please do my segment that I've been preparing it for like half the episode,

917
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,000
please?

918
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,640
I have too.

919
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,080
I know some questions.

920
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,360
Guys, please, please.

921
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,720
Please.

922
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,640
Just let me do my segment.

923
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,520
Rittle me piss.

924
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
I have a new riddle for you.

925
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,400
Very good riddle.

926
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,280
Wait, where did he go?

927
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:36,800
Who?

928
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,480
Your riddle me piss, the like sort of fun and sort of renaissance dancing boy turned into,

929
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,120
yeah, went to Dagobah a little bit.

930
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,080
It's me.

931
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,240
Here's my riddle I have for you.

932
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,840
In which month does money grow on trees?

933
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,760
In which month does money grow on tree?

934
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,840
I don't know.

935
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,240
Well, it's a riddle.

936
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:08,880
What?

937
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,240
It's a riddle.

938
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,440
Yeah, sure.

939
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,360
In which month does money grow on trees?

940
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,240
Yeah, March.

941
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,880
Never remember.

942
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,800
Okay.

943
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,480
Oh my god, riddles.com, you're off the fucking chain.

944
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,440
And it's actually N-E-V-E-R hyphen M-B-E-R.

945
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,120
So it's not even member, it's just an unpronounceable never member.

946
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,800
That one made me, dude, that one made me really sleepy.

947
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,360
That's weird.

948
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,840
A riddle's never hit me before and then like made me like want to just go straight to bed.

949
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,000
I have a riddle for you.

950
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,720
All right.

951
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,160
A boy was born in 1955.

952
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,080
Oh, he just had his 18th birthday today.

953
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
How did that happen?

954
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,160
Because of the leap year?

955
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,080
Was it a leap year situation?

956
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,120
No, dumbo.

957
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,400
Well, then there's literally no other.

958
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,040
1955 was not the year he was born.

959
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,000
It was the hospital room he was born in.

960
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,600
Fucking holy shit.

961
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,360
Oh, did you not like that one?

962
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,680
Okay, let me try this one.

963
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,800
No, it's just like any clues would have been good, riddles.com.

964
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
This has to be fucking fair.

965
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,080
Let me try this one then, Griffin, because it was a completely separate riddle

966
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,560
on a completely different page of riddles.com.

967
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,920
A man was born in 1898.

968
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,280
He is still alive now at the age of 33.

969
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,000
How is this possible?

970
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,560
Leap year?

971
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,760
No, he was born in room 1898 in the hospital.

972
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,120
I have one for you.

973
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,320
Okay.

974
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,160
I have four wings, but I am not a windmill.

975
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,400
I have clawed feet, but I am not a bear.

976
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,240
I have scales, but I am not a reptile.

977
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,680
Who am I?

978
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,840
Who am I?

979
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,160
Justin.

980
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,720
Who am I?

981
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,220
What?

982
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
What am I maybe makes more sense.

983
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,960
I have four wings, but I'm not a windmill.

984
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,040
No fucking shit.

985
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,920
There's no way.

986
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,560
Are those called wings on a windmill?

987
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,080
Are those called wings?

988
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,600
I have four wings, but I'm not a windmill.

989
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,480
I have clawed feet, but I'm not a bear.

990
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,600
I have scales, but I'm not a reptile.

991
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,320
Who am I?

992
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,040
I don't know.

993
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
A house.

994
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,240
No.

995
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,640
A tub.

996
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,040
No.

997
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,720
Whatever you're thinking, it's horse.

998
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,280
Is it a dragon?

999
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,320
A butterfly or a dragonfly.

1000
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,320
What?

1001
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,960
Butterflies don't have fucking clawed feet.

1002
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,600
You can't do it like that, riddles.com.

1003
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,560
But also, no one's ever been like, be careful, that butterfly will claw you.

1004
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,760
It's never worked that way.

1005
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,600
You can't, Travis, you're missing the point.

1006
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,280
You can't have a riddle where it's like, it could be a couple different things.

1007
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,200
Take your pick.

1008
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,880
Take your pick.

1009
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,080
Yeah, the knife was made out of ice, or the chandelier fell on him.

1010
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,120
It's one of the two.

1011
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,480
Okay, have we gotten that out of our system?

1012
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,080
I feel like this segment can never last longer than like four minutes.

1013
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,280
I feel like we get in, we do a riddle, we get out.

1014
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,120
Okay, you're the boss.

1015
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,680
I just feel like if I hear too many of these riddles, I-

1016
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,520
You'll die?

1017
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,600
I might literally die.

1018
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,040
I think that when that one riddle made me sleepy, that was my body saying,

1019
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,800
okay, a few more of these and we're dead.

1020
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,440
How about a Yahoo instead?

1021
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,680
These always wake me up and make me feel amazing.

1022
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,760
Yes, here's one that was sent in by Nick Waterstrat.

1023
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,320
Thanks, Nick.

1024
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,120
It's Yahoo Answers user Jaden.

1025
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,560
Jaden asks,

1026
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,360
I'm 13 and have $82.

1027
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,360
What should I spend it on?

1028
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:16,880
Don't say to just save it.

1029
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,380
Huh.

1030
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,440
So $82, the only restriction Jaden has provided is that this money must be spent.

1031
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,600
Well, I mean, there's lots of restrictions.

1032
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:37,120
He cannot buy a cigar or a porn and he can't buy, he can't vote.

1033
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,560
But that's not a money thing, is it?

1034
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,720
Can't buy a car, I guess, with $82.

1035
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,920
I feel like this is why, for me personally speaking,

1036
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,720
trading card games were invented so that this question would always be answered for me

1037
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,000
from ages like 10 to 17, is that I would always know where $82 should be spent.

1038
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,440
And it was Magic or Pokemon or Hero Clicks.

1039
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,520
And then I did it and I didn't have to stress out about my earnings.

1040
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,360
I just knew where it was going to go.

1041
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:05,840
Candy?

1042
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,920
You could buy $82 worth of candy.

1043
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,480
Travis, they're fucking 13 years old.

1044
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,440
Come on.

1045
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,120
What do they need with candy?

1046
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,480
They're basically adults.

1047
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,200
I don't know, pocket knives?

1048
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,240
Can you buy that at 13?

1049
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,680
Pocket knives?

1050
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,040
Travis Patrick.

1051
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
I'm trying to think about what I would have bought at 13.

1052
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,720
Oh, okay.

1053
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,440
That is fair.

1054
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,480
Yeah, that's legit.

1055
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,040
I would have bought candy or pocket knives.

1056
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,840
Didn't you buy a nice steamer trunk for our bedroom?

1057
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:37,600
I did have one of those, yes, but I believe I got that for Christmas.

1058
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,560
That's a cool gift.

1059
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,120
I wanted a place to keep my secrets.

1060
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,040
Yeah, not a very hidden trove there, Captain Jack.

1061
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,800
Not a very, not a very, you didn't really bury that one.

1062
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,920
It was kind of a big steamer trunk in the middle of the room, wasn't it there?

1063
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,720
Captain Barbarossa with your buried secrets.

1064
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,160
Now maybe with $82 at 13, invest in some real estate.

1065
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,440
You're not going to be able to get much.

1066
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
That's the same as saving it.

1067
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,080
No, no, no.

1068
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,080
You buy, because here's the thing, Griffin.

1069
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,160
You buy $82 worth of real estate, by the time you're 21,

1070
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,360
that's like $82,000 worth of real estate in this economy.

1071
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,920
In this economy, yeah, which is either good or really bad, but.

1072
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,280
It's one of those.

1073
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,560
Justin.

1074
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,800
What if you're gonna, what if you, if I only had $83 in my pocket?

1075
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,280
You know what I mean?

1076
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,600
It's 82, so like that may ruin your idea.

1077
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,120
I found another dollar.

1078
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh, good.

1079
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,680
Oh, you mugged someone?

1080
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,320
If I only had $82 in my pocket, you know where I'm gonna go.

1081
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,240
I'm gonna be looking for a come up.

1082
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,440
I'm gonna pop some tags.

1083
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,880
Oh, good.

1084
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,520
Oh, all right.

1085
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,800
Yeah, I'm going to the thrift shop.

1086
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,400
I'm gonna go in there.

1087
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,160
I got $82 in my pocket.

1088
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,200
I'm gonna buy some leopard mink that I should have washed.

1089
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,520
And I would just go to the thrift shop with my $82,

1090
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,600
and pop some tags, look for a come up.

1091
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,480
Okay.

1092
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,920
Yeah, it's fucking awesome.

1093
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,360
Velour jumpsuit, maybe.

1094
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,040
Some house slippers.

1095
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,240
A dookie brown leather jacket that I found digging.

1096
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,160
I think I would get 0.0001 bitcoins.

1097
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,840
Oh, that'd be good.

1098
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,560
KB Toys still around?

1099
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,440
They don't sell toys anymore.

1100
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,800
Nobody sells toys anymore.

1101
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,400
Did you guys go to any Toys R Uses before they closed?

1102
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,000
Yeah, I did.

1103
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,640
Sad, yeah?

1104
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,780
Yeah.

1105
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,840
This isn't funny.

1106
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,520
No, it's just bummed me out.

1107
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,400
I used to work there.

1108
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,520
$82.

1109
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,080
I never had $82 when I was 13.

1110
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,720
The first time I had $82 is after I had my first job

1111
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,400
at the country's best yogurt when I was 18 years old.

1112
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,480
And even then, I was making $2.50 an hour,

1113
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,760
or whatever the fuck minimum wage was back in 2005

1114
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,080
in Huntington, West Virginia.

1115
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,040
$82 is a princely sum.

1116
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,080
Are you kidding me?

1117
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,240
I would have gotten my own apartment when I was 13

1118
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,840
with $82 fucking dollars.

1119
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,520
Here's our idea if I was 13 and had $82.

1120
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,240
I would buy a clear bag and as many full-size candy bars

1121
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,760
as I could afford.

1122
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,040
Put them all in there.

1123
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,440
Then at Halloween, I would roll around with this bag

1124
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,920
and then direct people who asked me about my haul

1125
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,040
to different addresses in my neighborhood.

1126
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,040
And it would create a lot of confusion and a lot of chaos

1127
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
about where the cool houses were.

1128
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,960
And then I could just kind of like do my thing.

1129
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,880
And I would be out there because they'd be looking

1130
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,800
for these fake houses that I created with my fake haul.

1131
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,680
And just to finalize all the deets of the plan here, Justin,

1132
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,600
what would your thing be?

1133
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,640
What do you mean, what would my thing be?

1134
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,880
Justin Well, you're like, you would do your thing.

1135
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,680
What?

1136
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
Justin Okay.

1137
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,880
So I pick, I would make up a bunch of addresses.

1138
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,200
And so people would be like, where are they doing full-size?

1139
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,080
Justin No, no, no.

1140
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,480
I get that.

1141
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:06,960
I get that.

1142
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,160
Justin But then you said-

1143
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,280
Justin You gotta get yourself some 16 second

1144
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,960
more angel aim.

1145
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,920
Justin Right.

1146
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,880
That's their thing.

1147
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,720
As you have established, you would send them off

1148
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,600
to do their thing.

1149
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,400
And then you would just be out there doing your thing.

1150
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,680
So in this circumstance, my thing would be,

1151
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,280
I roll up at each house at about 825.

1152
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,560
And I'm like, listen, everybody's off looking

1153
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,920
for the good houses.

1154
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,840
You've got five minutes left.

1155
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,680
You don't want to leave that candy bowl line

1156
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,320
around your house.

1157
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,080
You're just going to scarf it this week.

1158
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,640
Hit me up and you'll be the only game in town

1159
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,760
so you can get all the candy.

1160
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,880
Justin That's good.

1161
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,440
Justin Okay.

1162
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:41,920
Justin That's good.

1163
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,680
Justin And then you light the black candle

1164
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,760
and you reawaken the Sanderson sisters.

1165
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,320
That would be my thing.

1166
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,800
Justin Yeah.

1167
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,640
Justin Establishing what our things would be.

1168
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,200
That would be my thing.

1169
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,440
Justin Yeah.

1170
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,880
I mean, that's fucked up because they killed

1171
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,000
a lot of people, Trevi.

1172
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,760
Justin Listen, I don't want to do it.

1173
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,480
Justin No, no, you said you wanted to do it.

1174
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,000
Justin I'm trying to impress that cool new girl.

1175
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,280
No, that would just be my thing.

1176
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,840
Justin Okay.

1177
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,520
Justin You know, because like, I'm trying to scare

1178
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,240
my little sister.

1179
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,720
Justin Sure.

1180
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,920
Justin And I'm trying to impress that girl

1181
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
that I just met because I moved into town.

1182
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,040
Justin No, I'm not saying there's reasons

1183
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,600
not to do it.

1184
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,520
I'm just saying they killed a lot of people, Trev.

1185
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,680
Justin Yeah, but then I would also stop them,

1186
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,080
Griffin.

1187
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,040
Justin You know what I'd do with $82 at 13?

1188
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,200
I would buy a bunch of marbles and a big coat.

1189
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,280
And I would fill the coat with the marbles and I would go to the principal's house and get inside

1190
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:21,920
of it somehow.

1191
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,280
And then I would open up the coat and let all the marbles fall out.

1192
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:25,760
Justin Nice.

1193
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,640
Justin Yeah, and then I'd tell them to, you know,

1194
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,600
you know, huff my nuts or something like that.

1195
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,280
And I'd get out of there because then the marbles are their problem.

1196
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,400
Justin I think I'd just go to Cracker Barrel and

1197
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,480
just buy a bunch of those talking parrots.

1198
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,440
Justin That's fun.

1199
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,840
And then you set them up at your principal's house and you'd be like,

1200
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,440
huff my nuts and then be like, huff my nuts and then be like, huff my nuts, huff my nuts,

1201
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,720
and then keep going forever and ever.

1202
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,680
I love that shit, dude.

1203
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,200
You ever seen a viral video like that?

1204
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,560
Justin I'd probably do that.

1205
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,920
Or I'd buy like a bunch of harmonicas just cuz.

1206
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,760
Put them in my steamer trunk.

1207
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,280
Justin I'd do Jawbreakers at Cracker Barrel and I would put those in my coat and empty

1208
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,840
them out of my principal's house because I really want them to slip and fall.

1209
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,880
I hate that fucking guy.

1210
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,560
Justin This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother, and me.

1211
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,920
Justin Where does he fucking get off, you know,

1212
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,880
send me to detention?

1213
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,400
Justin We hope you enjoyed it.

1214
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,320
Unless you're Principal Daniels, in which case you could huff Griffin's nuts, apparently.

1215
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,560
Justin I would've spent $82 to get Principal Daniels

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,360
Buffy with a hipster slant and we were on one episode as like craft beer fans.

Remote viewing is the psychic thing, right?

1256

Yeah.

1274
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,560
It's like a thoughtful look at old war movies,

1275
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:09,280
where they talk about sort of the history of cinema about war

1276
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,160
and sort of geopolitical history and all kinds of stuff,

1277
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,920
a deep dive into those movies.
